Example of QPSK carrier recovery phase error causing a fixed rotational offset of the received symbol constellation, X, relative to the intended constellation, O. Example of QPSK carrier recovery frequency error causing rotation of the received symbol constellation, X, relative to the intended constellation, O. In the transmitter of a communications carrier system, a carrier wave is modulated by a baseband signal. At the receiver the baseband information is extracted from the incoming modulated waveform. In an ideal communications system, the carrier signal oscillators of the transmitter and receiver would be perfectly matched in frequency and phase thereby permitting perfect coherent demodulation of the modulated baseband signal. However, transmitters and receivers rarely share the same carrier oscillator. Communications receiver systems are usually independent of transmitting systems and contain their own oscillators with frequency and phase offsets and instabilities. Doppler shift may also contribute to frequency differences in mobile radio frequency communications systems. All these frequency and phase variations must be estimated using information in the received signal to reproduce or recover the carrier signal at the receiver and permit coherent demodulation.  Methods  For a quiet carrier or a signal containing a dominant carrier spectral line, carrier recovery can be accomplished with a simple band-pass filter at the carrier frequency or with a phase-locked loop, or both.Bregni 2002 However, many modulation schemes make this simple approach impractical because most signal power is devoted to modulation‚Äîwhere the information is present‚Äîand not to the carrier frequency. Reducing the carrier power results in greater transmitter efficiency. Different methods must be employed to recover the carrier in these conditions. = Non-data-aided = Non-data-aided/‚Äúblind‚Äù carrier recovery methods do not rely on any knowledge of the modulation symbols. They are typically used for simple carrier recovery schemes or as the initial method of coarse carrier frequency recovery.Gibson 2002 Closed-loop non-data-aided systems are frequently maximum likelihood frequency error detectors.  Multiply-filter-divide  In this method of non-data-aided carrier recovery a non-linear operation (frequency multiplier) is applied to the modulated signal to create harmonics of the carrier frequency with the modulation removed (see example below) . The carrier harmonic is then band-pass filtered and frequency divided to recover the carrier frequency. (This may be followed by a PLL.) Multiply-filter-divide is an example of open-loop carrier recovery, which is favored in burst transactions (burst mode clock and data recovery) since the acquisition time is typically shorter than for close-loop synchronizers. If the phase- offset/delay of the multiply-filter-divide system is known, it can be compensated for to recover the correct phase. In practice, applying this phase compensation is difficult.Feigin 2002 In general, the order of the modulation matches the order of the nonlinear operator required to produce a clean carrier harmonic. As an example, consider a BPSK signal. We can recover the RF carrier frequency, \\\\omega_{RF} by squaring: :\\\\begin{align} V_{BPSK}(t) &{}= A(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_{RF}t + n\\\\pi); n = 0,1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ V^2_{BPSK}(t) &{}= A^2(t) \\\\cos^2(\\\\omega_{RF}t + n\\\\pi) \\\\\\\\\\\\ V^2_{BPSK}(t) &{}= \\\\frac{A^2(t)}{2}[1 + \\\\cos(2\\\\omega_{RF}t + n2{\\\\pi})] \\\\end{align} This produces a signal at twice the RF carrier frequency with no phase modulation (modulo 2\\\\pi phase is effectively 0 modulation) For a QPSK signal, we can take the fourth power: :\\\\begin{align} V_{QPSK}(t) &{}= A(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_{RF}t + n\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}); n = 0,1,2,3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ V^4_{QPSK}(t) &{}= A^4(t) \\\\cos^4(\\\\omega_{RF}t + n\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ V^4_{QPSK}(t) &{}= \\\\frac{A^4(t)}{8}[3 + 4\\\\cos(2\\\\omega_{RF}t + n{\\\\pi}) + \\\\cos(4\\\\omega_{RF}t + n2\\\\pi)] \\\\end{align} Two terms (plus a DC component) are produced. An appropriate filter around 4\\\\omega_{RF} recovers this frequency.  Costas loop  Carrier frequency and phase recovery as well as demodulation can be accomplished using a Costas loop of the appropriate order.Nicoloso 1997 A Costas loop is a cousin of the PLL that uses coherent quadrature signals to measure phase error. This phase error is used to discipline the loop's oscillator. The quadrature signals, once properly aligned/recovered, also successfully demodulate the signal. Costas loop carrier recovery may be used for any M-ary PSK modulation scheme. One of the Costas Loop's inherent shortcomings is a 360/M degree phase ambiguity present on the demodulated output. = Decision-directed = At the start of the carrier recovery process it is possible to achieve symbol synchronization prior to full carrier recovery because symbol timing can be determined without knowledge of the carrier phase or the carrier's minor frequency variation/offset.Barry 2003 In decision directed carrier recovery the output of a symbol decoder is fed to a comparison circuit and the phase difference/error between the decoded symbol and the received signal is used to discipline the local oscillator. Decision directed methods are suited to synchronizing frequency differences that are less than the symbol rate because comparisons are performed on symbols at, or near, the symbol rate. Other frequency recovery methods may be necessary to achieve initial frequency acquisition. A common form of decision directed carrier recovery begins with quadrature phase correlators producing in-phase and quadrature signals representing a symbol coordinate in the complex plane. This point should correspond to a location in the modulation constellation diagram. The phase error between the received value and nearest/decoded symbol is calculated using arc tangent (or an approximation). However, arc tangent, can only compute a phase correction between 0 and \\\\pi/2. Most QAM constellations also have \\\\pi/2 phase symmetry. Both of these shortcomings came be overcome by the use of differential coding. In low SNR conditions, the symbol decoder will make errors more frequently. Exclusively using the corner symbols in rectangular constellations or giving them more weight versus lower SNR symbols reduces the impact of low SNR decision errors.

He is best known as the director of the propaganda film Der Ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew). Early life and education Hippler was born and brought up in Berlin as the son of a petty official. His father died in 1918 in the First World War in France. Hippler resented the Treaty of Versailles and its associated regulations, such as the assignment of the Danzig Corridor, the occupation of the Rhineland and the disarmament of Germany as unjustified humiliation, and rejected the Weimar democracy. In 1925 when he was 17, Hippler joined the Nazi party NSDAP.Artists under Hitler: Collaboration and Survival under Nazi Germany page 30 In 1927, Hippler became a member of the NSD StudentBund - the National Socialist German Students' League. Later he studied law in Heidelberg and Berlin. He was a member of the ' dueling society in Heidelberg and the Arminia dueling society in Berlin. In 1932 he became NSDAP district speaker. In 1933 he was appointed the district and high school group leader for Berlin-Brandenburg in the National Socialist German Students' League. Hippler was a supporter of expressionism. As the leader of the National Socialist German Students' League of Berlin he organised an exhibition in Humboldt University of Berlin for expressionist painters, for which he was vehemently attacked by the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg. In 1932, Hippler was expelled from the University of Berlin for participating in violent Nazi rallies. On 19 April 1933, the new National Socialist Education Minister Bernhard Rust repealed any disciplinary actions against students associated with the NSDAP, thus reinstating Hippler. On 22 May 1933, he gave a speech initiating a march from the student house in the Oranienburger Stra√üe to Opera Square with books which were then burned. In June 1933 Hippler participated in a violent rally opposite the stock exchange, against Alfred Hugenberg then minister of finance and still Hitler's rival, calling Hitler to disavow him and remove him from power. Hippler was later involved in a dispute over the direction of arts policy. He was satisfied with the anti-Jewish orientation of the arts policy and the consequent banishment of that art from museums and art dealers who had been created by people of Jewish faith. However, in July 1933 at a rally of the National Socialist Student League in the lecture hall of the Berlin University, he criticised the harsh action of some Nazi circles against the German modern artists like Emile Nolde and Barlach, the artists group Die Br√ºcke, which was propagated by elements of the Nazi leadership as part of efforts against the Degenerate Art. Although Goebbels was a lover of Nolde, this direction after a word of argument was in favour of the more radical of Hitler's National Socialists, whose spokesman was Alfred Rosenberg and his Combat League for German Culture. Fritz Hippler earned his PhD in 1934 at the Heidelberg University with Arnold Bergstraesser and a dissertation titled \\"State and Society in the Thinking of John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and Paul de Lagarde. A contribution to the sociological thinking of the present time\\".German title:‚ÄûStaat und Gesellschaft im Denken von John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx und Paul de Lagarde.

Page 93 (dissertation, University of M√ºnster, 2006) Career in film production Poster for The Eternal Jew exhibition, 1937 After receiving his doctorate in 1934, Hippler became a lecturer at the German University of Policy in Berlin. From 1936 he worked as assistant to Hans Weidemann working on the production of German newsreels, directed in the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Here he learned the production of documentaries. In January 1939, he took over Weidemann's position. In August 1939, Goebbels promoted Hippler again. He appointed the 29-year-old Hippler to head the film department at the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda RMVP. In February 1942, he appointed him to the kingdom of film directors. With these two functions Hippler was one of the most important politicians of the film \\"Third Reich\\" after Goebbels. In October 1942, he was Director in the RMVP. His task was control, supervision and direction of German filmmaking. In 1938, Hippler was appointed to the rank of SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. According to Veit Harlan, Hippler loved to wear his SS uniform. Warsaw Ghetto children shown in the film The Eternal Jew In his ministerial functions, Hippler continued to produce films. In 1939-40 he was responsible for the propaganda film The campaign in Poland which ran under the title of Baptism of fire. In 1940, he was responsible for the management and design of the feature-length documentary film The Eternal Jew--according to Courtade, History of Film in the Third Reich, \\"the vilest anti-Semitic Nazi films.\\" The film historian Frank Noack assessed The Eternal Jew as \\"probably the most radical inflammatory film of all time\\". An article written by Hippler in the magazine \\"The film\\" about its creation marked Jews as \\"parasites of national degeneracy.\\" He deliberately filmed conditions within the Warsaw Ghetto to show the starving inhabitants, conditions designed by the Germans to increase the death rate. The film served as a preparation and agreement of the population in the coming holocaust and was mainly used for training of police and SS troops. In the same year, Hippler received from Hitler a secret special endowment of 60,000 Reichsmarks in recognition of his services to the Reich. In addition to The Eternal Jew Hippler also directed the 1940 propaganda documentary Feldzug in Polen about the Third Reich's invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, and Die Frontschau (The Frontshow), a series of shorts shown to soldiers before being shipped to the Eastern Front. In 1942, Hippler published a book about film theory titled Betrachtungen zum Filmschaffen (i.e., Contemplations on Filmmaking), which included a preface by Emil Jannings. By 1943, he was promoted to Obersturmbannf√ºhrer. Conflict with Goebbels Goebbels could usually count on his young people. Nevertheless, he frequently criticized their shortcomings. As early as 1939, he recorded in his diaries that Hippler was intelligent but cheeky and totally contradictory. He also stated that Hippler was immature. Goebbels complained repeatedly about the disorganisation of the film department. Hippler suffered apparently with alcohol addiction. Goebbels finally discharged Hippler in June 1943 due to \\"mishaps, alcoholism, and family problems‚Äù, although Hippler claimed in his diary that he was removed due to his choice of Erich Kaestner for the screenplay of the film M√ºnchhausen even though several of Kaestner's books and plays had been banned by the Nazis in 1933. After his dismissal, Hippler was accused of falsely denying his partial Jewish descent and demoted from his SS rank. Hippler was sent to an infantry replacement battalion of the country, according to Strauss and underwent mountain infantry training. Then he was again released from active duty and used until February 1945 as a front cameraman in order to produce material for newsreels. On 3 May 1945, he flew into Hamburg as a British prisoner of war. Postwar After the end of the Second World War, Hippler was interned and sentenced to two years in prison. He was able to stage a comeback after his release. He was interviewed in the Bill Moyers CBS Cable documentary A Walk Through the 20th Century in 1982. Hippler died on 22 May 2002, aged 92. He is portrayed by Cary Elwes in the 2001 television film Uprising, and by in the 2010 film Jew Suss: Rise and Fall. Filmography *Wort und Tat Words and Deeds.

Since LCD technology was not yet mature at the time, the TV used a minuscule CRT which set the record for being the smallest CRT on a commercially marketed product. Later in 1982, Sony released the first model of the Watchman, a pun on Walkman. It had grayscale video at first. Several years later, a color model with an active-matrix LCD was released. Some smartphones integrate a television receiver, although Internet broadband video is far more common. Since the switch-over to digital broadcasting, handheld TVs have reduced in size and improved in quality.

There are 39 issues of Expert Gamer in total. The bulk of XGs content was video game strategy guides and cheat codes. There were no reviews and only occasional light-hearted features. History Expert Gamerss roots began in July 1994 when the popular magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly launched a spin- off magazine called EGM¬≤. EGM2 was essentially \\"another EGM,\\" only without a reviews section and a greater emphasis on import games. The magazine released 49 issues under its original name.. Starting in August 1998, EGM2 became Expert Gamer, and the magazine's focus shifted away from news and previews to strategy and tricks. Despite the different name, XG continued EGM2s numbering system. The redesign into Expert Gamer was heralded with a rare fold-out cover depicting the name change unique to issue 50. The content of the strategies would largely remain the same, although a cleaner style was implemented. Late into its cycle, International was returned to Expert Gamer, bringing not only news of import gaming, but of anime as well. XG lasted for 39 issues until October 2001 (with the last issue being XG #88). The next month (November 2001), XG was replaced by GameNOW, albeit minus several of its more notable long-term staff members. Although GameNOW maintained a healthy tricks section and occasional strategy guides, the magazine's focus shifted to in-depth previews and reviews. Skewed to a slightly younger audience than that of EGM (roughly 12- to 14-year-olds), GameNOW concentrated less on industry insider- type features and more on the actual video games, including numerous large screenshots and elaborate feature articles. The numbering system was reset with the change to GameNOW, and the final issue was #27 in January 2004. For a couple of years after the change from XG to GameNOW, the \\"Expert Gamer\\" name lived on in the form of the Expert Codebook, a seasonal collection of tricks and strategies. By 2003, however, the \\"Expert Gamer\\" name was dropped, and the collection became known as the EGM Codebook. Running gags Towards the end of Expert Gamers run, the magazine has developed a series of running gags that were quite popular with its readers. These gags were typically discussed in the magazine's letters section, \\"Gamers' Forum\\". They included such topics as the death of Aeris in Final Fantasy VII and some readers' desire for naked pictures of the cast of Street Fighter. Other gags were concepts born in the pages of XG, such as Choppy McChopp, the custom-created wrestler in the N64 game WWF No Mercy whose moves consisted entirely of punching attacks, Choppy's arm-hating rival, Kicky McKickk, and the catchphrase, \\"Ooh, it looks like school's out.\\" Readers also enjoyed searching for appearances of a particular screenshot of Final Fantasy VIII that debuted in issue #64 (October 1999) and was repeatedly reused in the magazine whenever the editors needed to show a picture of that game or provide a visual of the Final Fantasy series in general. XGs sense of humor and many of its running gags continued after the magazine became GameNOW.

Crawford regained the number 2 after the NL and AL umpiring staffs were unified in 2000).Major league profile He worked in the playoffs 18 times, including every season from 1998 through 2006. He appeared in five World Series (1988, 1992, 1998, 2000, and 2002), serving as crew chief in 1992 and 2002; twelve League Championship Series (1980, 1983, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006), with all but the last two being in the NL; and five Division Series (1981, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2010). His 11th appearance in the League Championship Series in 2005 broke the record he had previously shared with Bruce Froemming. He also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1989 and was the home plate umpire for the 2006 All-Star Game. On May 23, 2002, Crawford was the second base umpire for Shawn Green's four-homer game. He was at third when Carlos Delgado hit four homers on September 25, 2003.

Crawford was the president of the Major League Umpires Association in 1999 when the umpires attempted a mass-resignation strategy. The strategy was unsuccessful. While Crawford kept his job, 22 umpires' resignations were accepted. Some have since regained their major league positions, others have been promised a position as soon as a vacancy occurs, and some were offered settlements that did not include a return to the field. Out of loyalty to his best friend, MLUA Executive Director Richie Phillips and his fellow NL umpires who were terminated by MLB, he did not join the World Umpires Association, the successor umpires union to MLUA.

Harper, with a screenplay by Stephen Grant, based on his short story by the same name. It is a surrealistic comedy-drama about a school shooting as seen through the eyes of a socially awkward college student named Jay. Walt Whitman, the shooter, is loosely based on Charles Whitman, but the film is not in any way a factual account of the 1966 shootings at the University of Texas. Plot The movie takes the point-of-view of Jay (David Grant), a college student whose main interests are theater and computer games. While Jay moves around his school's well-equipped theater building he delivers a long voice- over soliloquy revealing his quirky personality. Jay has difficulty interpreting other people: he mentions that his classmates often try to trick him into believing absurd statements, and he cannot always tell whether girls are just being polite to him or if they especially like him. Jay's voice-over is intercut with scenes of the production that is being performed in the theater, a fashion show version of Hamlet. Jay leaves the theater and encounters one of his professors, Dr. Max Boaz (John Kessel). As Jay and Max are walking outdoors a sniper opens fire from a rooftop and kills all the people around Jay. His roommate Walt (Stephen Grant) yells from the rooftop, asking Jay to come up and join him. Jay assumes Walt must be up there trying to assist wounded people or stop the sniper. Eager to help, Jay enters the building and tries to get to the roof, experiencing several bizarre encounters with other people along the way. After Jay arrives on the roof he learns that Walt is actually the sniper. Between outbursts of shooting, Walt says he comes from a long line of sharpshooters and has been working on a book about his family entitled The Delicate Art of the Rifle. Walt also tells Jay about incidents in which Walt tried to locate his girlfriend. She had disappeared and her friends and relatives did not remember her. Walt has come to the conclusion that there is some sort of \\"metaphysical virus\\" that erases people from history, removing all traces of them. Walt believes that he also has the virus and will soon disappear. The movie ends with a long steadicam scene that follows Jay as he walks through the theater building closing doors and turning off lights. In his voice-over monologue Jay reveals that Walt vanished and was never found. Jay says he has lost all his newspaper clippings of the sniper incident. At the very end Jay's voice-over intimates that Walt \\"erasing virus\\" theory might have been correct, but with Jay as a classic unreliable narrator this is never definitively established. Cast and crew *David Grant (not be confused with actor/playwright David Marshall Grant), who stars as Jay, is also the vocalist for 90's Punk band Action Patrol. *Stephen Grant plays the role of Walt Whitman and also wrote the screenplay.

Weil Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils, page 95. Prentice Hall, 2006. Soil can exhibit a wide range of colour; grey, black, white, reds, browns, yellows and greens. Varying horizontal bands of colour in the soil often identify a specific soil horizon. The development and distribution of color in soil results from chemical and biological weathering, especially redox reactions. As the primary minerals in soil parent material weather, the elements combine into new and colorful compounds. Soil conditions produce uniform or gradual color changes, while reducing environments result in disrupted color flow with complex, mottled patterns and points of color concentration. Causes Soil color is produced by the minerals present and by the organic matter content. Yellow or red soil indicates the presence of oxidized ferric iron oxides. Dark brown or black color in soil indicates that the soil has a high organic matter content. Wet soil will appear darker than dry soil. However, the presence of water also affects soil color by affecting the oxidation rate. Soil that has a high water content will have less air in the soil, specifically less oxygen. In well drained (and therefore oxygen rich) soils, red and brown colors caused by oxidation are more common, as opposed to in wet (low oxygen) soils where the soil usually appears grey or greenish by the presence of reduced (ferrous) iron oxide. The presence of other minerals can also affect soil color. manganese oxide causes a black color, glauconite makes the soil green, and calcite can make soil in arid regions appear white. Organic matter tends to make the soil color darker. Humus, the final stage of organic matter breakdown, is black. Throughout the stages of organic matter breakdown, the colour imparted to the soil varies from browns to black. Sodium content influences the depth of colour of organic matter and therefore the soil. Sodium causes the organic matter (humus) to disperse more readily and spread over the soil particles, making the soil look darker (blacker). Soils which accumulate charcoal exhibit a black color. Classification Often described by using general terms, such as dark brown, yellowish brown, etc., soil colors are also described more technically by using Munsell soil color charts, which separate color into components of hue (relation to red, yellow and blue), value (lightness or darkness) and chroma (paleness or strength).

His most influential work has been in the fields of cognitive anthropology and linguistic pragmatics: developing, with British psychologist Deirdre Wilson, relevance theory in the latter; and an approach to cultural evolution known as the epidemiology of representations in the former. Sperber currently holds the positions of Directeur de Recherche √©m√©rite at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute. Background Sperber is the son of Austrian-French novelist Man√®s Sperber. He was born in France and raised an atheist but his parents, both non-religious Ashkenazi Jews, imparted to the young Sperber a \\"respect for my Rabbinic ancestors and for religious thinkers of any persuasion more generally\\". He became interested in anthropology as a means of explaining how rational people come to hold mistaken religious beliefs about the supernatural. Career Sperber was trained in anthropology at the Sorbonne and the University of Oxford. In 1965 he joined the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) as a researcher, initially in the Laboratoire d'√âtudes Africaines (African studies laboratory). Later he moved to the Laboratoire d'ethnologie et de sociologie comparative (Ethnology and Comparative Sociology), the Centre de Recherche en Epist√©mologie Appliqu√©e and finally, from 2001, the Institut Jean Nicod. Sperber's early work was on the anthropology of religion, and he conducted ethnographic fieldwork among the Dorze people of Ethiopia. Sperber was an early proponent of structural anthropology, having been introduced to it by Rodney Needham at Oxford, and helped popularise it in British social anthropology. At the CNRS he studied under Claude L√©vi-Strauss, credited as the founder of structuralism, who encouraged Sperber's \\"untypical theoretical musings\\". In the 1970s, however, Sperber came to be identified with post- structuralism in French anthropology, and criticised the theories of L√©vi- Strauss and other structuralists for using interpretive ethnographic data as if it were an objective record, and for its lack of explanatory power. Nevertheless, Sperber has persistently defended the legacy of L√©vi-Strauss' work as opening the door for naturalistic social science, and as an important precursor to cognitive anthropology. After moving away from structuralism, Sperber sought an alternative naturalistic approach to the study of culture. His 1975 book Rethinking Symbolism, outlined a theory of symbolism using concepts from the burgeoning field of cognitive psychology. It was formulated as a reply to semiological theories which were becoming widespread in anthropology through the works of Victor Turner and Clifford Geertz (which formed the basis of what come to be known as symbolic anthropology). Sperber's later work has continued to argue for the importance of cognitive processes understood through psychology in understanding cultural phenomena and, in particular, cultural transmission. His 'epidemiology of representations' is an approach to cultural evolution inspired by the field of epidemiology. It proposes that the distribution of cultural representations (ideas about the world held by multiple individuals) within a population should be explained with reference to biases in transmission (illuminated by cognitive and evolutionary psychology) and the \\"ecology\\" of the individual minds they inhabit. Sperber's approach is broadly Darwinist‚Äîit explains the macro- distribution of a trait in a population in terms of the cumulative effect micro-processes acting over time‚Äîbut departs from memetics because he does not see representations as replicators except for in a few special circumstances (such as chain letters). The cognitive and epidemiological approach to cultural evolution has been influential, but as a means of explaining culture more generally it is pursued by only a small minority of scholars. His latest work, published with cognitive scientist Hugo Mercier, has developed their argumentative theory of reason. His most influential work is arguably in linguistics and philosophy: with the British linguist and philosopher Deirdre Wilson he has developed an innovative approach to linguistic interpretation known as relevance theory which has become mainstream in the area of pragmatics, linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. He argues that cognitive processes are geared toward the maximisation of relevance, that is, a search for an optimal balance between cognitive efforts and cognitive effects. As well as his emeritus position at the CNRS, Sperber is currently part time professor in the departments of Cognitive Science and of Philosophy at the Central European University in Budapest. He is also the Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute, a scientific discussion and research website. He is a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and in 2009 was awarded the inaugural Claude L√©vi-Strauss Prize for excellence of French research in the humanities and social sciences. In 2011 he gave a Turku Agora Lecture.http://aboagora.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/agora- lecture-%E2%80%93-dan-sperber-culture-and-minds/ Bibliography * Le structuralisme en anthropologie (√âditions du Seuil, 1973) * Rethinking Symbolism (Cambridge University Press, 1975) * On Anthropological Knowledge (Cambridge University Press, 1985) * (with Deirdre Wilson) Relevance.

Retrieved 15 November 2013 History Born in D√ºsseldorf, Pole took his name from a Waldorf 4-Pole filter, which he accidentally dropped and broke in 1996. Though the filter was perhaps no longer appropriate for DJ work in its damaged state, Betke found the strange hissing and popping noises the filter now made interesting sounds. He then began using the broken filter to create music, launching his musical career. Betke's first four albums, titled 1, 2, 3, and R (an intentional trilogy of albums, followed by a collection of remixes of Pole's 1998 debut EP Raum), were all based around this filter, with songs usually taking the form of dub basslines and rhythms with percussion provided by the eponymous filter. In 2003 Betke departed from this style for the album Pole (a combination of tracks from two EPs, \\"45/45\\" and \\"90/90\\"), which utilized more traditionally electronic but still eclectic production. Pole has been distributed on several different labels, including Matador Records and Mute Records, and in 1999 Betke cofounded (with Barbara Preisinger) the label ~scape, also known for publishing Jan Jelinek. On September 1, 2011, Betke founded a new artist label named Pole. Betke also mastered John Frusciante's 2016 EP, Foregrow.

Most mobile phones using a Qualcomm-manufactured CDMA chipset are supported. The program is also cross-platform, operating on the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems. Although BitPim might be taken for a personal information manager (PIM), its name derives from \\"bitpym\\", a suggestion generated by a pronouncable-password generator; the \\"y\\" being replaced with an \\"i\\" simply to eliminate ambiguity in pronunciation. Earlier, the program had been named \\"Entrocul\\" by the same method. Bitpim is comparable to Gammu, QPST, Open Sync, and Gnokii applications.  Features  Functionality varies depending on the model of the phone. Once the drivers are installed on the PC operating system, the following managing functions are generally supported: * Phone Book * Calendar * Wallpapers * Ringtones * Filesystem * Media * Memo * Todo * Call history * SMS * T9 editor Data can be imported and exported between the phone and Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar.  Implementation  BitPim is implemented using the Python programming language with various pieces in C to access hardware. The user interface is wxPython which in turn wraps wxWidgets. That gives a native look and feel on each platform. Most of the functionality is obtained by using the diagnostics mode available in Qualcomm Mobile Station Modem (MSM) used by virtually every manufacturer of CDMA phones. The diagnostics mode provides direct access to the embedded filesystem in the phone. The remainder of the functionality is via protocols provided by the handset manufacturers, but these usually only cover updating the phonebook. Because the sizes of fields in the protocols differ between every model (even from the same handset manufacturer) and even between the same model offered at different carriers, BitPim has code and field descriptions for every model. A big part of each approximately monthly release is adding support for new phone models.

The former British Consulate in Yokohama (now Yokohama Archives of History) Britain had a functioning consular service in Japan from 1859 after the signing of the 1858 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce between James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin and the Tokugawa Shogunate until 1941 when Japan invaded British colonial empire and declared war on the United Kingdom. Consular Officials The Consular Service was established with officials who were expected to serve their entire careers in Japan. The entry-level position was as student interpreter who were expected to learn Japanese. In the early years almost all dealings with Japanese officials were in Japanese and British consular officials had a high standard in the spoken and written language.I Nish, Britain and Japan, Biographical Portraits, p99 This declined over time as more Japanese officials learnt English.Ian Ruxton, (ed), The Semi-official Letters of British Envoy Sir Ernest Satow from Japan and China (1895-1906), p153-4. British Consular Courts in Japan Until 1899, British Consular Officials exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Japan. Consular officials sat as judges in consular courts in all treaty ports. Until 1865 appeals from decisions of consular officials were made to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. From 1865 appeals from decisions could be made to the British Supreme Court for China and Japan in Shanghai. From 1871 to 1878 a judge from Shanghai was based in Yokohama sitting first as a branch of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan. Later they were treated as a judge of the Kanagawa Consular Court. In 1879 a British Court for Japan was created in Yokohama which had first instance jurisdiction in Kanagawa and appellate jurisdiction from other consular courts in Japan.

It is a shrub or small tree characterised by its weeping foliage, yellow flowers and distinctive flaky bark. Description Persoonia longifolia is an erect shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of , usually with a single main trunk. It has flaky-papery bark, brown or greyish on the surface and reddish purple below. Young branchlets are covered with brown to rust-coloured hairs. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. The flowers are borne in groups of up to thirty on stalks up to long near the ends of branches, each flower on a pedicel long, the tepals yellow and long. Flowering occurs from October to January and the fruit is a smooth drupe long and wide maturing from July and containing a single seed. Taxonomy and naming Persoonia longifolia was first collected described in 1810 by Robert Brown Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The species name derives from the Latin terms longus \\"long\\", and folium \\"leaf\\". Within the genus Persoonia, it is classified in the Lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur. Distribution and habitat Snottygobble is found in the southwest of Western Australia within of the coast between Albany and the southeastern edges of Perth. It occurs in the jarrah, karri, marri and tingle forest. Ecology Persoonia longifolia resprouts from both epicormic buds and from the lignotuber after a fire, often several months later. A study of the phenology of this species has concluded that it grows, flowers and sets fruit in summer. Young branches are often damaged by larvae of the tip-boring Ptyssoptera moth and by birds including the red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii) and Australian ringneck parrot (Barnardius zonarius). Flowering commences in October and is completed by January, with peak flowering in November and December. The only pollinators observed during the study were native bees and the introduced honey-bee (Apis mellifera). Mature fruit falls from late July to September and are often eaten by wallabies, kangaroos and the bobtail skink (Tiliqua rugosa). If left untouched by animals, the fleshy part of the fruit either rots or shrivels and dries. Germination occurs in late winter to early spring from fruits produced in the previous season but microclimate appears to be an important factor in germination rate. Even when germination occurs, few survive with most seedlings succumbing to desiccation or grazing. Conservation status This persoonia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses In addition to being used for minesite restoration, P. longifolia is used in the cut-flower trade, being valued for its weeping appearance and durability. It also has potential in the nursery trade for its symmetrical habit, weeping foliage and textured, flaky bark, but studies have suggested that at least eighteen months of soil burial is required for seed germination.

These AAC systems may be high- tech (Dynamyte) or low-tech such as a communication board. Several studies have found PCS to be more transparent than other graphic symbols such as Blissymbols (Mizuko, 1987). A graphic symbol is transparent if ‚Äúthe shape, motion, or function of the referent is depicted to such an extent that meaning of the symbol can be readily guessed in the absence of the referent‚Äù (Fuller & Lloyd, 1991, p.217). Because of high transparency, PCS symbols are easy to learn by children with little or no speech. Several studies have reported that children with cognitive disabilities learn PCS easily. The communication interventions for individuals who have little or no speech have used PCS successfully for individuals. The PCS set comprises a core library of roughly 5,000 symbols, supplemented by general-purpose addendum libraries and country- specific libraries for a total of 37,000+ symbols. PCS symbols have been translated to 40 different languages. Patient Non Verbal Communication People can develop their own PCS for certain needs or if the needed symbol is not available. Some choose to start from scratch, and others start from alternative libraries. Common uses for the PCS symbol set include Speech Therapy, Picture Schedules for people with Autism, and helping people facing limitations while hospitalized. Boardmaker A drawing program with PCS is called Boardmaker. The software was available for Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. It started around late 1980s or early 1990s. There were many versions of Boardmaker for Mac & Win which include: * Version 1 for Microsoft Windows (1994 - 2001) * Version 3 for Macintosh (1991 - 2004) * Version 5 for Microsoft Windows (2001-2007) and Macintosh (2004-2008) * Version 6 for Microsoft Windows (2007-current) and Macintosh (2008-current) There are many different versions of Boardmaker such as: * Boardmaker Plus * Boardmaker with SD Pro * Boardmaker Studio References * Fuller, D., & Lloyd, L.

History Built by the Tunbridge Wells Corporation and designed by Percy Thomas and Ernest Prestwich, the Assembly Hall Theatre opened on 24 May 1939. When first built, the auditorium had a capacity of 822 on the ground floor, with a further 320 in the balcony. It was also equipped with a 22ft x 29ft cinema screen to allow films to be shown. It now seats up to 993 people, with 672 on the ground floor (373 in the stalls and 300 in tiered stalls) and 320 on the balcony (circle).Assembly Hall website During the Second World War, the theatre was used for dances for troops, film shows and events to raise money for the war effort.Kent and Sussex Courier By 2001, the theatre was attracting audiences of over 150,000 each year. The theatre was refurbished in 2001 with works including the provision of additional dressing rooms, remodelling the bar, repainting of the foyer and front of house areas, and new seating, air conditioning and other facilities. The auditorium closed again in August 2015 for a ¬£1.5 million refurbishment. New tiered charcoal-coloured seating replaced the previous fixtures. The balcony seating was re-upholstered in the same hard-wearing material. Overheating was addressed and the bar area was redesigned in black, charcoal and gold.

A food lover from childhood, he had no formal culinary education before beginning his career as a chef. Early life and education Tower was born in 1942, in Stamford, Connecticut. The son of a managing director of an international film sound equipment company. He was educated at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney, Australia; Parkside School, Surrey, England; Loomis Chaffee, Connecticut. He attended Harvard University earning a B.A. and then completed his M.A. at Harvard Graduate School of Design. After earning a master's degree in Architecture from Harvard University, he had intended to pursue design of underwater structures in Hawaii, because of his obsession with finding the lost city of Atlantis. After his grandfather died, Tower, who was used to being taken care of and supported, found himself out of money and in need of employment.  Culinary career  Inspired by a berry tart he had eaten at the then-unknown Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, California, he applied for a job there in 1972. Alice Waters and her partners hired him for his demonstrable skills and brazenness when it came to recreating great French traditional food. Within a year, he became an equal partner with Waters and the others. He was in full charge of the kitchen, the writing of the menus, and the promotion of the restaurant. Tower left Chez Panisse in 1978, after philosophical and business disagreements with the majority of the Board and with Waters in particular (she and they rejected his idea to open a Panisse Cafe). He worked at the Ventana Inn at Big Sur beginning 1978, and taught briefly in 1980 at the California Culinary Academy. He went on in 1981 to revive the dying Balboa Cafe in San Francisco, at the time, the restaurant was owned by Cathe and Doyle Moon. In 1982, he became head chef at Santa Fe Bar and Grill, located in Berkeley, California and also owned by the Moons. Santa Fe Bar and Grill was a restaurant that was later a springboard for fellow Chez Panisse-alum, Mark Miller, to open the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, New Mexico and a string of Southwestern-themed restaurants throughout the United States. In 1984, Tower opened his own restaurant, Stars, in San Francisco, in partnership with Cathe and Doyle Moon. Stars was among the top-grossing restaurants in the Bay Area. Tower opened branches of Stars restaurant in Oakville (Napa Valley), Palo Alto, Manila, and Singapore. Numerous American chefs worked at Stars, among them Mark Franz (Farallon), Mario Batali, George Francisco (Voodoo Bacon), Mark Gaier and Clark Frasier (Arrows', MC Perkins Cove) Loretta Keller (Bizou/Coco500), Dominique Crenn, Joey Altman (Bay Cafe/Wild Hare), Michael Shrader (N9NE), Brendan Walsh (Arizona 206, Elms Inn), Chris Colburn (The Chanticleer, Dalvay by the Sea), and Ron Garrido (Avalon in Eureka), as well as pastry chefs Tim Grable, Emily Luchetti, and Jerry Traunfeld. He owned the Peak Cafe in Hong Kong in the 1990s, as well as various related ventures in San Francisco including a more casual cafe, an upscale bistro, and a kitchenware shop. As his fame grew he licensed his name out, and began to earn celebrity endorsement contracts, including one for Dewar's Scotch. In 1998, Tower sold a part interest in the Stars restaurants to a Singapore real estate company. The new owners closed the Stars restaurants after two years of operation. Tower moved to Manila, Philippines for a year, then to New York City for four years, followed by a move to Italy and then Mexico. In 2014, he was hired as executive chef of Tavern on the Green in New York City, but he left in April 2015, after six months.  Filmography  In 2016, the biographical documentary Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent, directed by Lydia Tenaglia and produced by Anthony Bourdain and Zero Point Zero productions, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. The 100-minute film was bought by The Orchard for US distribution in the spring of 2017. On November 12, 2017 the film was broadcast on CNN. In 2017, Tower appeared on Top Chef, the Rick Stein TV show ‚ÄúRoad to Mexico‚Äù for BBC, the CRAVE wine and food festival, Spokane, Washington, guest of honor at Chef‚Äôs Roll, Miami Beach, and as a judge at the Basque Culinary Center World Awards, Mexico City.

Faller has a \\"Car System\\" in both the H0 and N scale, which consists of battery-powered road vehicles, made by other manufacturers such as Wiking, that have a magnet attached to the front steering. The magnet follows a steel wire hidden under the road surface, resulting in trucks and buses that behave in a realistic fashion without the need for guide rails. This system is extensively used by the Miniatur Wunderland (German for 'miniature wonderland') model railway attraction in Hamburg, Germany. Mechanisms are also available to stop vehicles and to switch them from one route to another, as at an intersection. These can be integrated with sensors and working traffic lights to create a realistic operating scene.

It has therefore mostly developed in 'prey' species. Composition Armoured structures are usually composed of hardened mineral deposits, chitin, bone, or keratin. Species with armour Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a well-armoured sea urchin Armour is evident on numerous animal species from both current and prehistoric times. Dinosaurs such as Ankylosaurus, as well as other Thyreophora (armoured dinosaurs such as Ankylosauria and Stegosauria), grew thick plate-like armour on their bodies as well as offensive armour appendages such as the thagomizer or a club. The armour took many forms, including osteoderms, spikes, horns, and plates. Other dinosaurs such as ceratopsian dinosaurs as well as some sauropods such as Saltasaurus, grew armour to defend themselves, although armour in sauropods overall is uncommon. The skull of Triceratops with its large neck frill and horns, both natural armour. In modern times, some molluscs employ the use of shells as armour, and armour is evident in the chitinous exoskeleton of arthropods. Fish use armour in the form of scales, whether 'cosmoid', 'ganoid' or 'placoid' and in some cases spines, such as on fish such as the stickleback. The chalky plate, or cuttlebone, of cuttlefish also acts as armour. Most reptiles have scaly skin which protects them from predators in addition to water retention; the crocodile's exoskeleton and the shells of the Chelonia: tortoises, turtles and terrapins. Numerous mammals employ the use of spines and body armour, although not as sturdy as reptilian armour, like the spines of the echidnas and of porcupines and hedgehogs. The bony shell of the armadillos and the extinct Glyptodon were very much like Ankylosaurus' armour and some modern armadillos curl up into a ball when threatened, making them unexposed due to their armour. Similarly, the hairy plate-like scales of the pangolin are employed in the same way and are constructed of the same material used in the offensive armour, the horn, of the rhinoceros. Usage Armour, although all used for the sole intent to ward off attackers, can be split into defensive and offensive armour. Examples of offensive armour are horns, hooves, antlers, claws and beaks, clubs and pincers, as developed in some mammals, birds, reptiles (including dinosaurs, such as the dromaeosaurid claw and the ceratopsian horn) and arthropods. Offensive armour is often used in conjunction with defensive armour and in some cases makes an animal almost unassailable.

Much influenced by Ludwig Hilberseimer, Heinrich Tessenow and Adolf Loos, Grassi's architecture is the most severely rational of the group: his extremely formal work is predicated on absolute simplicity, clarity, and honesty without ingratiation, rhetoric, or spectacular shape-making; it refers to historical archetypes of form and space and has a strong concern with the making of urban space. For these reasons Grassi is a non-conformist and a critic of conventional mainstream architecture.  Career  Building complex at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin (1993). Grassi was born in Milan, Italy. He studied architecture at the Politecnico di Milano university, where he graduated in 1960. He worked for the magazine Casabella-continuit√† for 3 years until 1964 and has been professor at the Politecnico di Milano and other universities since 1965.Giorgio Grassi, I progetti, le opere e gli scritti, Electa, Milan, 1996 Grassi is a prolific writer and theorist, having most notably written The Logical Construction of Architecture (1967), Architecture as a Craft (1979) and other influential works. Together with Aldo Rossi, Grassi argued that architecture had to look within itself to an autonomous methodology, separate from political, economic, social and technological events. Though described as severely rational, Grassi's architecture also incorporates a sensitivity to classical and neo- classical architecture (Alberti, Schinkel) but is at the same time deeply influenced by the modern movement, especially in Germany and Austria. Grassi's trademarks are his use of exposed brick in most of his buildings as well as square windows. In his writings, he refers to the socialist German architects of the 1920s as well as references to selected public buildings and public spaces as his guidelines. His works have been extensively published in the top international architecture magazines.Broadbent, Geoffrey (1990). Emerging Concepts in Urban Space Design. Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London. pp. 178-183 The work of Marxist architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri also influenced Grassi and the La Tendenza movement, and the University Iuav of Venice emerged as a centre of the group after Tafuri became chair of Architecture History in 1968. A Tendenza exhibition was organized for the 1973 Milan Triennale. In 1994 a competition was organised for the refurbishment of one of the key monuments of Berlin, Friedrich August St√ºler‚Äôs Neues Museum (New Museum), completed in 1855. Entrants to the competition were asked to address the building‚Äôs refurbishment in tandem with developing a masterplan for the whole of Berlin's Berlin‚Äôs \\"Museum Island\\". The jury awarded first prize to Grassi, only for the Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums) to reject its choice. The situation was only resolved three years later by holding a second architecture competition, which was open to the five architecture firms that had been placed top in the 1994 contest, but this time the programme related solely to the refurbishment of the Neues Museum. British firm David Chipperfield Architects, the runner-up behind Grassi in 1994, was declared the winner.Ellis Woodman, David Chipperfield Architects' Neues Museum, Berlin, BD, March 2009.

Moore and is the oldest continually operating medical school in the greater Los Angeles area. The school is affiliated with UC Irvine Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of Orange County. History An early photo of the sanitarium and school that was the forerunner of the University of California Irvine School of Medicine Although the School of Medicine joined UC Irvine in 1967, its history goes back more than 100 years. In 1896, the Pacific College of Osteopathy was founded in the city of Anaheim. Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1904, and through a merger with the Los Angeles College of Osteopathy, the California College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons was created in 1914 and would exist as such until 1961. In that year, as the California Osteopathic Association merged with the California Medical Association, the college was converted into an MD-granting medical school and was renamed the California College of Medicine (CCM). Over the next three years, its administrators worked with the University of California to have it become the third UC medical school, joining those on the San Francisco and Los Angeles campuses. This was accomplished on October 1, 1965, when the California College of Medicine passed into the full control of the UC Regents and became part of the University of California. Four days later, UC President Clark Kerr received a CCM faculty resolution requesting that the Regents designate UC Irvine as the campus on which the College of Medicine be developed. On April 20, 1967, the UC Regents approved moving the California College of Medicine to the Irvine campus, creating the UC Irvine College of Medicine. Following that, on July 23, 1968, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved an affiliation between the Orange County Medical Center and the UC Irvine College of Medicine, giving the medical school a teaching hospital. The UC Irvine College of Medicine moved onto the UC Irvine campus in 1968, and on Aug. 29, a first-year class of 94 students began coursework in the Med Surge I and II buildings. Six years later, on October 3, 1974, the UC Regents purchased the Orange County Medical Center for $5.5 million. The facility was renamed the UC Irvine Medical Center.

Historically, constructive bidding was based on the idea that the stronger a responding hand, the higher a bid, or jump, was made. In modern bidding styles, a slower progression of bids was deemed a more scientific method of investigating for the best contract. The principle of fast arrival was a logical product of this newer style and inverted previous meanings on the premise that since jumps to game leave less room for slam investigation, they imply an absence of slam values and therefore discourage more bidding. In addition, on weaker (or limited) hands fast arrival has a pre-emptive effect on the opposition and minimizes the information they might otherwise exchange. Stated conversely as the principle of slow arrival, the approach leaves more bidding space for stronger hands to explore for slam or choose the optimum game contract.

The National Highway (NH66) passes through Kaniyapuram junction dividing the town into two. The main features of Kaniyapuram are the Bus Stand in the National Highway and Railway Station, which are situated very close to each other. There is no other place in between Trivandrum and Quilon towns with this feature. The KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation) bus depot has about 40 buses, originating and terminating from/in Kaniyapuram. This is the only depot which has no fare stage for Fast passenger and Super fast buses.

The Lebbas are amongst the very prominent clan of Kaniyapuram. According to documented history, the Lebbas migrated from Tamil Nadu in the early 1650s to Kerala. It is believed that they established in Kaniyapuram as early as the 1650s and established themselves as traders in Kaniyapuram. They were successful merchants and operated almost all the business in Kaniyapuram until recent times. The Lebbas' main contribution to the Kaniyapuram society is the establishment of The Muslim High School, Kaniyapuram. The school was founded by late S Ahmed Kunju Lebba in 1947. The school had played a major role in the educational and social development of the area.

However, this industry is currently on doldrums and struggling for survival. Until three decades, water transport was the main mean of goods transportation from Kaniyapuram. Coconuts and coir products were transported to Kollam and Alappuzha from Kaniyapuram, through Parvathi Puthannaar and Kadinam Lake in large covered wooden boats (kettuvallam) and were loaded from the jetties located at Kadavil, Anakkapilla and Channankara. The water transportation through Parvathi Puthannaar which played a crucial role in the lives of many traders in Kaniyapuram came into disuse after the advent of railways and the National Highways.

Founded in 1994, the group has released six albums, including the acclaimed Nightlife, Easy Listening and Haven't Slept All Year. Cobra Verde's music has been featured on television programs such as True Blood, Entourage, The OC, Shameless, and Sons of Anarchy. In addition, the group performed on The OC as a Foreigner tribute band at a birthday party held at the show's fictional club, \\"The Bait Shop.\\" Cobra Verde includes singer-guitarist John Petkovic, Mark Klein (drums-vocals), Tim Parnin (guitar), Ed Sotelo (bass-vocals) and Frank Vazzano. This has been the longest-running line-up for the band, its origins going as far back as 1998. The band's sound has been described as post-punk, glam rock, hard rock, and garage rock. In a review of the band's 2003 album, Easy Listening, the Boston Phoenix compared Cobra Verde to the MC5, due to lyrics and guitars that \\"blur the line between revolution and hedonism.\\"Boston Phoenix, Word Plays, Franklin Bruno, July 4-July 10, 2003 Salon.com compared Cobra Verde to glam-rock, and specifically compared the band's 1999 album, Nightlife, to director Todd Haynes' film, Velvet Goldmine. \\"Haynes would have fared far better if he had consulted John Petkovic and his band Cobra Verde.\\"Salon, \\"Cobra Verde find the swaggering essence of glam rock that Todd Haynes and 'Velvet Goldmine\\"; Joe Gross, Sept. 20, 1999 The band has drawn comparison to '70s glam-rock because of the art work for Nightlife by noted photographer Mick Rock, who chronicled David Bowie, Queen, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop in the 1970s. History Cobra Verde started as a one-off studio project for Scat Records, a St. Louis-based imprint responsible for releasing records by seminal Cleveland bands such as electric eels and Dayton, Ohio band Guided by Voices. Petkovic, the sole continuous member throughout Cobra Verde's 20-year history, enlisted guitarist Doug Gillard and drummer Dave Swanson, with whom he had played with in Death of Samantha. Studio engineer Don Depew played bass. To reflect the one-off nature of the project, Petkovic named the ensuing album Viva La Muerte (meaning \\"long live death\\"), after the battle cry of the Spanish Foreign Legion. The album was subtitled \\"death in small doses.\\" The project lacked a name, however. \\"I didn't even have a name for the thing until the cover art for the record was being sent off,\\" said Petkovic, in a 1996 interview with Flipside magazine. \\"So I had a friend call me who happened to be hanging out with Werner Herzog ‚Äì so he asks Herzog to suggest a name. So he says Cobra Verde -- the name of the last film he shot with Klaus Kinski ‚Äì in honor of Klaus.\\"Flipside, \\"Shane Quizzes John Petkovic\\"; Shane Williams, March/April 1996 Rolling Stone called the Viva La Muerte album \\"provocative grime, like Diamond Dogs sabotaged by Final Solution-era Pere Ubu.\\"Rolling Stone, Cobra Verde; David Fricke, Dec. 29, 1994 The same line-up also recorded Vintage Crime (an EP that included an appearance of Chris Brokaw, of the Boston band Come) before being recruited to play in Guided by Voices, backing Robert Pollard on the 1997 album Mag Earwhig! A breakup of the GBV lineup led to a shake-up in Cobra Verde with the entry of Klein (of the Cleveland heavy-metal band Breaker) and Vazzano (of the Cleveland rock band Quazimodo) in 1998. The following year saw the addition of keyboardist and theremin player Chas Smith and bassist Dave Hill. The former, who died in 2007, was a member of noted Cleveland bands the Pagans and Radio Alarm Clocks, and served as a board member for the parody cult known as the Church of the Subgenius. Hill played in the band until 2002, leaving to pursue comedy and acting. Hill was replaced by Edward Angel Sotelo, an Argentine-born musician who had played in Cleveland-based post-punk Proletarian Art Threat. At this point, Cobra Verde included guitarist Derek Deprator who was replaced by Jovan Karcic (of noted Columbus group Gaunt). Karcic was replaced by J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., who toured with Cobra Verde and played on \\"Easy Listening.\\" (Petkovic and Mascis would later go on to play together in the band Sweet Apple.) Tim Parnin (of Cleveland band Sons of Elvis) joined in 2004, taking Mascis' spot and filling out the longest-running line-up for Cobra Verde. Releases Nightlife The 1999 album marked the beginning of Cobra Verde as an ongoing touring band. The 12-song disc earned four-star review by Rolling Stone, which called it \\"a treatise on fidelity and illusion, cold ambition and betrayal.\\"Rolling Stone, Cobra Verde; David Fricke, June 8, 2000 \\"Nightlife\\" was widely acclaimed, receiving praise from the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Alternative Press, The Onion, The New York Times and Village Voice. TimeOut New York wrote that \\"CV explores of rock music's classic themes: love, revolution, self-destruction and identity\\" and called the album \\"a stunning display of everything that makes rock music vital.\\" TimeOut New York, Cobra Verde, Mike Wolf; Feb. 10-17, 2000 Nightlife received comparisons to glam-rock, in part because of Rock's artwork, but also because the album cover features model Lisa Ronson, the daughter of glam-rock guitarist and Bowie collaborator Mick Ronson. A Magnet magazine article, \\"The Last Rock Star,\\" attributed the band's over-the-top sensibilities to \\"growing up all wrong,\\" which included Petkovic's parents taking him to nude beaches in Europe when he was a child.\\"The Last Rock Star,\\" Magnet Magazine, by Fred Mills, May 1999 Easy Listening Recorded by Depew, the album's cover is an homage to the 1974 French softcore pornographic film, Emmanuelle. The album features guitar contributions by J Mascis, who joined Cobra Verde for a United States tour. A video for the opening track, \\"Riot Industry,\\" starring Mike Watt, George Wendt and Rudy Ray Moore was acclaimed by Entertainment Weekly, Pitchfork and Billboard. Resembling the easy listening genre not at all, Easy Listening is all \\"powerhouse guitar riffs and wham-bam choruses\\". The album followed up on the success of Nightlife and became a breakthrough for the group. It was acclaimed in Playboy, the Chicago Tribune, the Boston Globe, FHM, Blender and the Village Voice. All Music Guide gave it an \\"A-\\" and called the album \\"nothing less than a masterpiece of glammed-up sexual obsession, agit-pop antics and indie rock glitter.\\"All Music Guide, 2003, Charles Spano The New York Times wrote: \\"The dangerous, ironic aura of glam-rock fascinates Cobra Verde, a band from Cleveland that folds new paradoxes into the anthems and angles of the 1970's style. Its new album, Easy Listening (MuscleTone), slightly smooths out its music but not its barbed wit.\\" Pop and Jazz Guide: Cobra Verde, Jon Pareles, May 23, 2003 The song \\"Modified Frankenstein\\" appeared in the 2003 film Carolina, starring Julia Stiles. It was released on MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer's Muscletone Records. Copycat Killers Released in 2005, the all-covers disc was originally meant as an experiment in recording techniques‚Äîapplying ideas to covers that would then be applied to an album of all originals. The album included covers ranging from \\"I Feel Love\\" (Donna Summer) to \\"Urban Guerilla\\" (Hawkwind). Never intended to be released at first, it yielded a number of songs that were featured on TV shows, including \\"I Want You,\\" which appeared as the musical backdrop to a clumsy sex scene in the Denis Leary FX Network show, Rescue Me. In a Rolling Stone review of Copycat Killers, David Fricke wrote: \\"It helps to know a little about Cobra Verde's roots in Cleveland underground-rock lore to appreciate the breadth of repertoire on this all-covers album. But the fun is obvious, as Cobra Verde remake Pink's \\"Get the Party Started\\" and the Fall's \\"The Dice Man\\" in their own glam-devil image and play the Troggs, Undertones and Mott the Hoople songs here like they wish they'd written them.\\"Rolling Stone, David Fricke, August 25, 2005 Haven't Slept All Year Released in 2008 (after one-year delay while the band was on hiatus), Haven't Slept All Year was recorded by Klein at his Noise Floor Studio, in Bedford, Ohio. Two of the songs on the album were premiered on TV shows before it was officially released. The opening track, \\"World Can't Have Her,\\" appeared on the HBO series Entourage, while \\"Riot in the Foodcourt\\" appeared on the FX Networks drama Sons of Anarchy. Songs on \\"Haven't Slept All Year\\" also ended up being featured in shows such as the MTV reality show The City (2010) and the MTV horror comedy Death Valley (2011). \\"World Can't Have Her\\" ended up in the Showtime series Shameless (2012). Alternative Press, in a review of \\"Haven't Slept All Year,\\" wrote, \\"Glamorous decay and excessive partying has never sounded sexier, dirtier or more fun.\\".Alternative Press, Annie Zaleski, February 2009 Pitchfork wrote: \\"Cobra Verde's music has always simmered with nocturnal menace and seedy suggestion, but on Haven't Slept All Year, there's a greater awareness of the price for staying up all night: Having to make amends in the morning.\\" Pitchfork, Stuart Berman, February 27, 2009 Dusted Magazine put \\"Haven't Slept All Year\\" in context with the band's history and the musical landscape: \\"The only thing more surprising than Cobra Verde's existence this far into the new millennium is the quality of its recordings. Fifteen years since Viva La Muerte, their debut on Scat Records, Petkovic and Co. continue to rock hard in the face of the impending cultural apocalypse. With that in mind, Haven't Slept All Year is an ideal soundtrack for the current trash heap that is our society. Cobra Verde cast their net wide and work with whatever comes slithering back, compressing it all into a weighty chunk of glittering pop-rock smite to be hurdled at whoever needs a knock on the head.\\"Haven't Slept All Year,\\" Nate Knaebel/Dustedmagazine.com December 5, 2009. In September 2014, Cobra Verde announced on cobraverde.com that it will be touring again and returning to the studio to record its next album. Appearances The OC Cobra Verde recorded a version of \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" for the Fox television teen drama The OC. The band also performed the song on the show, called \\"The Journey,\\" which aired March 16, 2006. Cobra Verde plays a Foreigner tribute band that has been hired by Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) to perform at a birthday party for his friend Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie). Ryan is a Journey fan, however, which becomes the running joke of the episode. Seth tells Ryan that \\"he couldn't get the real Journey, so he got a Journey tribute band.\\" As Cobra Verde begins performing \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You,\\" Seth admits that he knows the band on stage is a Foreigner tribute ‚Äì but that he got them, because \\"Journey sucks.\\" In a diary chronicling the event for Cleveland daily newspaper The Plain Dealer, Petkovic recalled going to wardrobe the day before the taping: True Blood Cobra Verde's version of \\"Play With Fire\\" (Copycat Killers, 2005) was featured on the HBO vampire drama True Blood (\\"Burning House of Love\\", which aired October 19, 2008.) The song became a favorite among True Blood fans and spawned a number of home-made vampire- and sex-themed videos on YouTube. It also appeared on the 2009 album True Blood ‚Äì Music from the HBO Original Series. Pitchfork called the song \\"a stunning surprise, transformed into a beatnik drum circle and injected with Nick Cave-level creepiness\\"Pitchfork Media, May 2, 2005; Jason Crock The Houston Press called it \\"sinister, there can be no doubt, never quite delivering on a horrifying end, but leaving you certain that somewhere past the end of the song someone is going to end up in a ditch.\\"The Music of True Blood, Episode 1.6: Cobra Verde Helps Sookie \\"Play With Fire,\\" Nov. 20, 2009 Discography Albums * Viva la Muerte (Scat Records, 1994) * Vintage Crime EP (Scat Records, 1995) * Egomania (Scat Records, 1997) * Nightlife (Motel Records, 1999) * Easy Listening (MuscleTone Records, 2003) * Copycat Killers (Scat Records, 2005) * Haven't Slept All Year (Scat Records, 2008) * True Blood (Elektra, 2009) Singles * One Step Away from Myself/Everything to You (Sub Pop; 1996) * Leather/A Story I Can Sell (Scat; 1996) * The Great Dominions (Carcrashh; 1996) * Terrorist (Wabana; 1997) * Blood on the Moon (Wabana; 1997) * For My Woman (Get Hip; 1997) References External links Alternative rock groups from Ohio Indie rock musical groups from Ohio Punk rock groups from Ohio Musical groups from Cleveland Musical groups established in 1992 Scat Records artists ","title":"Cobra Verde (band)"},{"id":"5768898","text":"Cyathea amintae is a species of tree fern native to Puerto Rico, where it grows in shaded areas and cloud forest at an altitude of 1000‚Äì1200 m.

It launched at a lower price than competitors (‚Äì16,300), and it outperformed conventional minicomputers. After a successful launch, the line expanded and the new focus for the NEWS became desktop publishing and CAD/CAM. =1990s= The Sony NEWS was unable to break into the U.S. market, where Sun Microsystems was dominant, and also did not fare well in Europe. The NEWS platform was later used for video-on-demand applications, and for Internet server applications. The NEWS division at Sony was dissolved in 1998. Hardware The Sony NEWS originally came equipped with a dual 680x0 (68020 or 68030) processor configuration running at 16-25 MHz. Later, the Sony NEWS was moved to the MIPS architecture, with MIPS III and MIPS IV microprocessors such as the R3000, R4000, R4400, R4600, R4700, and R10000. The fastest MIPS processors used in Sony NEWS workstations ran at 200 MHz. Both 680x0 and MIPS models shared the same case, which had a large door covering a floppy drive and a 5.25-in expansion bay which could house a SCSI tape or CD-ROM drive. The details of the door were slightly different: two windows for the 680x0 models while the MIPS ones had a single large window. Also hidden by the cover were a reset button and a series of DIP switches used to configure some bootup parameters. On the back were 3 expansion slots, one of which normally housed a video card. Underneath those were the connectors for SCSI, network (an AUI connector), serial (CH0, normally used for console, and CH1), parallel, and a keyboard. Software =NEWS-OS= Originally the Sony NEWS team had to decide which version of Unix to use: BSD or AT&T; System V. The project leader was interested in the potential commercial support for System V, but the engineering team preferred BSD because it had rich networking features including TCP/IP. Eventually BSD was chosen because they believed that computer networks would be important in the future. NEWS-OS releases were based on three different versions of Unix: * NEWS-OS 1.x: 4.2BSD, Shift JIS, introduced in 1987. * NEWS-OS 2.x: 4.2BSD, Shift JIS, introduced in 1987. * NEWS-OS 3.x: 4.3BSD, EUC, introduced in 1988. * NEWS-OS 4.x: 4.3BSD, EUC, introduced in 1990. * NEWS-OS 5.x: SVR4.2, EUC, introduced in 1992. * NEWS-OS 6.x: SVR4.2, EUC, introduced in 1993. Prior to version NEWS-OS 3.9, all versions of NEWS-OS were released exclusively for the 680x0 series of processors. NEWS-OS 3.9 was released in both CISC (\\"C\\") versions and RISC (\\"R\\") versions, for the 680x0 and the MIPS architecture, respectively. For example, NEWS-OS 3.9 was released as both \\"NEWS-OS 3.9C\\" and \\"NEWS-OS 3.9R.\\" Functionality was the same between the CISC and RISC versions. The NEWS-OS 4.x series was also released in both CISC and RISC versions. =Third- party software= Yukihiro Matsumoto originally began implementing the Ruby programming language on the 4.3BSD-based NEWS-OS 3.x, but later migrated his work to SunOS 4.x, and finally to Linux. In 1999, Ruby was known to work across many different operating systems, including NEWS-OS.

Mr. Quimby has found another job, though it is one he does not like very much. Ramona finds herself caught between being too young to stay home alone and too old to enjoy playing with pesky Willa Jean. She is trying to grow up, but sometimes it seems like her family is making it harder. Ramona and Her Mother won the 1981 National Book Award. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1981\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-22.From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Award history there were dual awards for hardcover and paperback books in many categories. Almost all of the paperback award-winners were reprints. Plot summary \\"People should not think being seven and a half years old was easy, because it wasn't.\\"Cleary, Beverly Ramona and her Mother, HarperCollins, 1979, pg. 42; At last, Ramona's father, Robert, has a job again, so the Quimbys host a brunch to celebrate. Ramona is burdened with the task of keeping her friend Howie Kemp's little sister, Willa Jean, out of everybody's way. Not wanting Willa Jean to touch any of her toys, Ramona gives Willa Jean a pop-up box of tissues to play with. When Willa Jean strews tissues through the house, the guests decide to take their leave. When someone remarks that Ramona was just like Willa Jean when she was younger, Ramona feels hurt and upset, not believing that she was ever such an exasperating spoiled pest. When Dorothy states that she could not get along without Beezus, Ramona feels isolated and unappreciated by her family. Now that both Dorothy and Robert are working full-time, everyone must pitch in to keep the house running as smoothly as possible. One day, the family comes home to find that, in the rush to leave the house in the morning, the Crock-pot was not plugged in, forcing the family to improvise dinner from the sparse ingredients on hand. The preparation of said dinner causes an argument between Robert and Dorothy, which frightens the girls, who had never before seen such behavior from their parents. Suddenly worried that their parents might get a divorce like some of their respective classmates parents have recently, Beezus and Ramona comfort each other that night at bedtime, and Beezus tells Ramona that she will always be there to look after her. The next morning, Beezus and Ramona are surprised to find their parents sitting at breakfast together, acting as if the argument never happened. Robert and Dorothy explain that marital spats are a part of life and do not necessarily foreshadow a divorce. When it is further indicated that Beezus and Ramona fight, Ramona feels that the comparison is unfair, and orders her parents to never fight again. Tempers flare again when Beezus refuses to let Dorothy cut Beezus' hair. Dorothy normally cuts the girls' hair, but Beezus reveals that she has saved her allowance to get her hair cut at a local hairdressing academy. The battle of wills between Beezus and Dorothy makes Ramona happy, since she is still envious of their relationship. When the appointment goes wrong and Ramona ends up with a cute pixie haircut and Beezus gets a bad perm and ends up with \\"forty-year-old\\" hair, Ramona suddenly feels bad for Beezus and decides it is nicer when everyone in the family is happy. Matters become complicated once more when Dorothy buys Ramona a new pair of pajamas, the first time Ramona has not received Beezus' hand-me-downs. Ramona loves her new pajamas so much that she wears them to school underneath her clothes. She finally admits this fact to her teacher, Mrs. Rudge, who promises Ramona that she will not reveal Ramona's secret to anybody. When Ramona overhears Dorothy's end of a phone conversation with Mrs. Rudge that night, however, she mistakenly assumes that Mrs. Rudge has betrayed her confidence. She becomes angry, argues with her parents, and decides to run away from home. Dorothy, to Ramona's shock, offers to help her pack a suitcase. Dorothy purposefully packs the suitcase so that it is too heavy for Ramona to carry, which turns out to be a ploy to get Ramona to stay. When Ramona realizes that she had been tricked, Dorothy says the words that Ramona had longed to hear since the day of the brunch and Willa Jean's tissue incident: \\"I couldn't get along without my Ramona.\\" Cleary, Beverly, Ramona and her Mother, HarperCollins, 1979, pg. 182; Critical reaction Reviewers appreciate Cleary's keen understanding of childhood. Kirkus writes \\"Cleary's pipeline to childhood as faithful as ever...

It is the final poem of what are referred to by scholars as the procreation sonnets (Sonnets 1-17) with which the Fair Youth sequence opens. Sonnet 17 questions the poet's descriptions of the sequence's young man, believing that future generations will see these descriptions as exaggerations, if the youth does not make a copy of himself by fathering a child. As in Sonnet 130, Shakespeare shows himself to be hesitant about self- assured, flamboyant, and flowery proclamations of beauty. Structure Sonnet 17 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, consisting of three quatrains followed by a couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. Sonnet 17 is written in iambic pentameter, a form of meter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The sonnet's fourth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. (17.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. The sixth line exhibits two fairly common variations, a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending, and the rightward movement of the first ictus (the resulting four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, is sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): √ó √ó / / √ó / √ó / √ó /(√ó) And in fresh numbers number all your graces, (17.6) The twelfth line features a mimetic stretching into two syllables of the word \\"stretched\\" to fit the metre: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And stretch√®d metre of an antique song: (17.12) Synopsis and analysis The poet asks who would believe his verse in the future (\\"in time to come\\"), if the youth's true excellence (\\"most high deserts\\") were to \\"fill\\" his verse. The poet's verse is inadequate; \\"heaven knows\\" is either an exclamation or part of the sentence: 'heaven knows that his verse is but a tomb' (with a hint of 'tome'). Shakespeare even goes as far as to say that the \\"tomb\\" hides half the youth's beauty. Shakespeare argues that his descriptions are not strong enough, and do not do justice to the man's beauty (\\"If I could write the beauty of your eyes\\"). Again, if the poet could number all the youth's graces in \\"fresh numbers,\\" then future times would accuse him of falsehood. Future ages would say, \\"this poet lies; / Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.\\" \\"Such heavenly touches\\" were the divine touches traditionally bestowed by the Muses on the poet, or they are the strokes of the brush or chisel of a divinely inspired hand, which, having 'touched' an earthly face, makes it perfect. As in Sonnet 85 Shakespeare's precedent is a phrase from Horace's Satires, \\"ad unguem / factus homo\\" (Sermones 1.5.32) 'it is the touch that perfects the man,' which was an expression from carvers who in modelling gave the finishing touch to their work with the nail (\\"unguem\\"). A future age, believing that such divine perfection could never (\\"ne'er\\") happen, would think the poet's efforts exaggeration. Shakespeare insists that his comparisons, even though they are limited in strength, are not exaggerations. The poet's manuscripts (\\"my papers\\"), once they are discolored (\\"yellowed\\") with age, will be the subject of ridicule (\\"scorn'd\\"), just as \\"old men of less truth then tongue\\" are derided. What the youth is truly owed (\\"your true rights\\") could be dismissed in the future as \\"a poet's rage,\\" or rejected as the \\"stretched metre of an antique song\\"; \\"stretched\\" firstly intends 'exaggerated,' but was used technically of earlier poetic styles. \\"Antique song\\" is both ancient and distorted ('antic') song. The sonnet ends with a typical notion that should the young man have a child, he shall live both in the child and in the poet's rhyme.

It is considered by some to be the final sonnet of the initial procreation sequence. The sonnet addresses time directly, as it allows time its great power to destroy all things in nature, but the poem forbids time to erode the young man's fair appearance. The poem casts time in the role of a poet holding an ‚Äúantique pen‚Äù. The theme is redemption, through poetry, of time's inevitable decay. Though there is compunction in the implication that the young man himself will not survive time's effects, because redemption brought by the granting of everlasting youth is not actual, but rather ideal or poetic.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. . p. 148 Structure Sonnet 19 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Like all but one of Shakespeare's sonnets, Sonnet 19 is written in a type of metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The eighth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / But I forbid thee one most heinous crime: (19.8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Both the first and third lines exhibit reversals which thrust extra emphasis on an action verb, a practice Marina Tarlinskaja calls rhythmical italics (line three also exhibits an ictus moved to the right, resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó /√ó / Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws, (19.1) / √ó √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, (19.3) Synopsis and analysis Sonnet 19 addresses time directly as \\"Devouring Time\\", a translation of the often-used phrase from Ovid, \\"tempus edax\\" (Met. 15.258). G. Wilson Knight notes and analyzes the way in which devouring time is developed by trope in the first 19 sonnets. Jonathan Hart notes the reliance of Shakespeare's treatment on tropes from not only Ovid but also Edmund Spenser. The sonnet consists of a series of imperatives, where time is allowed its great power to destroy all things in nature: As it will \\"blunt ... the lion's paws;\\" cause mother earth to \\"devour\\" her children (\\"own sweet brood\\"); and (\\"pluck\\") the tiger's \\"keen teeth\\", its 'eager', its 'sharp', and its 'fierce' teeth from the jaw of a tiger. The quarto's \\"yawes\\" was amended to \\"jaws\\" by Edward Capell and Edmond Malone; this change is now almost universally accepted. Time will even \\"burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood.\\" The phoenix is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. George Steevens glosses \\"in her blood\\" as \\"burned alive\\" by analogy with Coriolanus (4.6.85); Nicolaus Delius has the phrase \\"while still standing.\\" As time speeds by (\\"fleet'st\\", although variations in early modern spelling allow \\"flee'st\\" as in 'time flies' or 'tempus fugit'), it will bring the seasons (\\"make glad and sorry seasons\\"), which are not only cycles of nature but ups and downs of human moods. Time may \\"do what ere thou wilt.\\" The epithet \\"swift-footed time\\" was commonplace, as was \\"the wide world\\". Finally the poet forbids time a most grievous sin (\\"one most hainous crime\\"): It must \\"carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow\\". In associating crime and wrinkles Shakespeare has drawn on Ovid again, \\"de rugis crimina multa cadunt\\" ('from wrinkles many crimes are exposed' from Amores 1.8.46), rendered by Christopher Marlowe as \\"wrinckles in beauty is a grieuous fault\\". The hours must not etch into the beloved's brow any wrinkle (compare Sonnet 63, \\"When hours have .. fill'd his brow / With lines and wrinkles\\"). Nor must time's \\"antique pen,\\" both its 'ancient' and its 'antic' or crazy pen, \\"draw ... lines there\\". Time must allow the youth to remain \\"untainted\\" in its \\"course\\"; one meaning of \\"untainted\\" (from tangere = to touch) is 'untouched' or 'unaffected' by the course of time. The couplet asserts that time may do its worst (\\"Yet do thy worst old Time\\") ‚Äì whatever injuries or faults (\\"wrongs\\") time might commit, the poet's \\"love,\\" both his affection and the beloved, will live forever young in the poet's lines (\\"verse\\").

Part of the Fair Youth sequence (which comprises sonnets 1-126), the subject of the sonnet is widely interpreted as being male, thereby raising questions about the sexuality of its author. In this sonnet (as in, for example, Sonnet 53) the beloved's beauty is compared to both a man's and a woman's. Structure Sonnet 20 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet, containing three quatrains and a couplet for a total of fourteen lines. It follows the rhyme scheme of this type of sonnet, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It employs iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. \\"Only this sonnet about gender has feminine rhymes throughout.\\" The first line exemplifies regular iambic pentameter with a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) A woman's face with nature's own hand painted, (20.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Context Sonnet 20 is most often considered to be a member of the \\"Fair Youth\\" group of sonnets, in which most scholars agree that the poet addresses a young man. This interpretation contributes to a common assumption of the homosexuality of Shakespeare, or at least the speaker of his sonnet. The position of Sonnet 20 also influences its analysis and examinations. William Nelles, of the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, claims that, > Sonnet 20 splits readers into two groups: those who see an end to any clear > sequence after this point, and those who read on, finding a narrative line > connecting the rest of the sonnets in a meaningful pattern.William Nelles, > \\"Sexing Shakespeare's Sonnets: Reading Beyond Sonnet 20,\\" English Literary > Renaissance Volume 39, Issue 1, February 2009: 128-140. Abstract Scholars have suggested countless motivations or means of organizing Shakespeare's sonnets in a specific sequence or system of grouping. Some see the division between the sonnets written to the \\"young man\\", while others do not. A number of academics believe the sonnets may be woven into some form of complex narrative, while Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells confidently assert that the sonnets are \\"better thought of as a collection than a sequence, since‚Ä¶the individual poems do not hang together from beginning to end as a single unity‚Ä¶Though some of the first 126 poems in the collection unquestionably relate to a young man, others could relate to either a male or female.\\" Sexuality The modern reader may read sonnet 20 and question whether or not Shakespeare's sexuality is reflected in this sonnet. When looking at the sexual connotations in this sonnet it is important to reflect on what homoerotism meant during the time that Shakespeare was writing. Casey Charles discusses the idea that there was no official identity for a gay person at this time. There were words that identified what we would consider to be homosexual behaviour, but the idea of a \\"gay culture\\" or \\"gay identity\\" did not exist.Charles, Casey. \\"Was Shakespeare gay? Sonnet 20 and the politics of pedagogy.\\" College Literature 25.3 (1998): 35-52. EBSCOhost. Web. 10 Nov. 2009. Charles goes on to say that early modern laws against sodomy had very few transgressors, which means that either people did not engage in homosexual behavior or these acts were more socially acceptable than the modern reader would think. Shakespeare's awareness of the possible homoeroticism in Sonnet 20 does not necessarily illuminate whether or not he himself was actually practicing homosexual behavior. One of the most famous accounts to raise the issue of homoeroticism in this sonnet is Oscar Wilde's short story \\"The Portrait of Mr. W.H.\\", in which Wilde, or rather the story's narrator, describes the puns on \\"will\\" and \\"hues\\" throughout the sonnets, and particularly in the line in Sonnet 20, \\"A man in hue all hues in his controlling,\\" as referring to a seductive young actor named Willie Hughes who played female roles in Shakespeare's plays. However, there is no evidence for the existence of any such person.A \\"hue\\" was a servant; see OED: \\"hewe\\". The original word in the Quarto for \\"hues\\" is \\"Hews\\". Analysis While there is much evidence that suggests the narrator's homosexuality, there are also countless academics who have argued against the theory. Both approaches can be used to analyze the sonnet. Philip C. Kolin of the University of Southern Mississippi interprets several lines from the first two quatrains of Sonnet 20 as written by a homosexual figure. One of the most common interpretations of line 2 is that the speaker believes, \\"the young man has the beauty of a woman and the form of a man...Shakespeare bestows upon the young man feminine virtues divorced from all their reputedly shrewish infidelity.\\" In other words, the young man possesses all the positive qualities of a woman, without all of her negative qualities. The narrator seems to believe that the young man is as beautiful as any woman, but is also more faithful and less fickle. Kolin also argues that, \\"numerous, though overlooked, sexual puns run throughout this indelicate panegyric to Shakespeare's youthful friend.\\" He suggests the reference to the youth's eyes, which gild the objects upon which they gaze, may also be a pun on \\"gelding‚Ä¶The feminine beauty of this masculine paragon not only enhances those in his sight but, with the sexual meaning before us, gelds those male admirers who temporarily fall under the sway of the feminine grace and pulchritude housed in his manly frame.\\" Amy Stackhouse suggests an interesting interpretation of the form of sonnet 20. Stackhouse explains that the form of the sonnet (written in iambic pentameter with an extra-unstressed syllable on each line) lends itself to the idea of a \\"gender- bending\\" model. The unstressed syllable is a feminine rhyme, yet the addition of the syllable to the traditional form may also represent a phallus.Stackhouse, Amy D. \\"Shakespeare's Half-Foot: Gendered Prosody in Sonnet 20.\\" Explicitor 65 (2006): 202-04. Print. Sonnet 20 is one of only two in the sequence with feminine endings to its lines; the other is Sonnet 87. Stackhouse emphasizes the ambiguity of the addressee's gender throughout the sonnet, which is resolved only in the final three lines. She writes that many parts of the sonnet‚Äîfor example the term \\"master mistress\\"‚Äîmaintain uncertainty around the gender of the sonnet's subject. This idea of nature is also reflected in Philip C. Kolin's analysis of the last part of the poem as well. Kolin's observation of Shakespeare's discussion of the man being for \\"women's pleasure\\" does not lend itself to this idea of bisexuality or gender- bending at all. Kolin is saying that nature made him for \\"women's pleasure\\" and that is what is \\"natural\\".Kolin, Philip C. \\"Shakespeare's Sonnet 20.\\" Explicitor 45.1 (1986): 10-12. Print. Kolin goes on to say that the phrase \\"to my purpose nothing\\" also reflects this natural aspect of being created for women's pleasure. In this, however, he takes no account of Shakespeare's common pun of \\"nothing\\" (\\"O\\") to mean vagina. Whereas Stackhouse would argue the poem is almost gender neutral, Kolin would argue that the poem is \\"playful\\" and \\"sexually (dualistic)\\".  In Other Media  On his eighth studio album, Rufus Wainwright set Sonnet 20 to music on Take All My Loves: 9 Shakespeare Sonnets. And origionally on his album \\"All days are Nights: Songs for Lulu.\\" Where he also sets Sonnets 10 and 43. Notes References *Baldwin, T. W. (1950).

Like Sonnet 130, it addresses the issue of truth in love, as the speaker asserts that his lines, while less extravagant than those of other poets, are more truthful. Contrary to most of Shakespeare's sonnets, Sonnet 21 is not addressed to any one person. There is no second person, no overt \\"you\\" or \\"thou\\" expressed in it. Structure Sonnet 21 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet. It consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet, nominally rhyming abab cdcd efef gg ‚Äî though this poem has six rhymes instead of seven because of the common sound used in rhymes c and f in the second and third quatrains: \\"compare\\", \\"rare\\", \\"fair\\", and \\"air\\". The sixth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems, (21.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. A reader's sense of meter usually arises chiefly from stresses inherent in the text. Line ten provides a case in which the reader's sense of meter must condition the accents applied to the text. Without the benefit of reading ahead to the eleventh line, a neutral prose reading of second half of line 10 would observe stresses on the words \\"love\\" and \\"fair\\". However this does not produce a well- formed pentameter line. A sensitive reader will place an accent on \\"my\\" which in turn will allow ictuses to rest on \\"my\\" and \\"is\\", producing the well-formed iambic pentameter scanned below, even before the textual reason for the contrastive accent on \\"my\\" (as compared to \\"any mother's\\") is understood: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And then believe me: my love is as fair (21.10) Synopsis and analysis George Wyndham calls this the first sonnet to address the problem of the rival poet; Beeching and others, however, differentiate the poet mentioned here from the one later seen competing with Shakespeare's speaker for the affections of a male beloved. Larsen asserts that the \\"Muse\\", to which the poet takes exception here and whom through \\"compare\\" he parodies to make his own point, differs from the tenth \\"Muse\\" of Sonnet 38, although the two sonnets share vocabulary, rhyme and the theme of praise. Shakespeare's opening disclaimer asserts that his Muse is not like some other Muse that is \\"Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse\\". To \\"stir\\", as well as meaning to excite passion like a Muse, connects with \\"painted\\" since paint is stirred. Shakespeare derides the \\"vain\\" sonneteer who searches for images even from the heavens to \\"ornament\\" his comparison and who will \\"rehearse\\" or 'describe at length' his \\"fair\\" by comparison with every other \\"fair\\" to make a \\"couplement\\", either a coupling in a comparison or a couplet or stanza. The repetition of \\"fair\\" echoes Sonnet 18's \\"And every fair from fair some time declines\\". Shakespeare will resist their practice of \\"proud compare\\" to the sun, moon, the \\"rich gems\\" of earth and sea, and \\"April's first-born flowers\\", both 'born' and 'borne'. He will disregard \\"all things rare\\" that are contained within the bounds of the universe (\\"hems\\"), which another poet's pen might use. The line echoes the conclusion of another poem in the sequence, Sonnet 130's \\"And yet by heaven I think my love as rare, / As any she belied with false compare.\\" This poet is different and plain speaking. Because he is \\"true in love\\", he will \\"truly write\\" and require of the youth\\" (or reader) that he \\"believe\\" him: \\"my love is as fair / As any mother's child\\", the last allusion in the sequence to the youth to beget an 'heir' (intimated in the pun on air and heir at the end of line 12). The \\"gold candles\\" are the stars in the heavens. Edmond Malone found parallel descriptions of the stars as candles in Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth. While Alexander Schmidt glosses line 13 as \\"fall in love with what others have praised,\\" Edward Dowden has it \\"those who like to be buzzed about by talk.\\" As William James Rolfe notes, the line, and indeed the final couplet, refer definitely to the type of exaggerated praise that Shakespeare declaims in the sonnet. George Wyndham notes a parallel to the final line in Samuel Daniel's \\"Delia 53\\"; in that poem, the speaker condemns the \\"mercenary lines\\" of other poets. As Madeleine Doran and others note, criticism of exaggerated praise was only slightly less common in Renaissance poetry than such praise itself.

In the sonnet, the speaker of the poem and a young man are represented as enjoying a healthy and positive relationship. The last line, however, hints at the speaker's doubts, which becomes prominent later in the sequence. Synopsis Sonnet 22 uses the image of mirrors to argue about age and its effects. The poet will not be persuaded he himself is old as long as the young man retains his youth. On the other hand, when the time comes that he sees furrows or sorrows on the youth's brow, then he will contemplate the fact (\\"look\\") that he must pay his debt to death (\\"death my days should expiate\\"). The youth's outer beauty, that which 'covers' him, is but a proper garment (\\"seemly raiment\\") dressing the poet's heart. His heart thus lives in the youth's breast as the youth's heart lives in his: the hearts being one, no difference of age is possible (\\"How can I then be elder than thou art?\\"). The poet admonishes the youth to be cautious. He will carry about the youth's heart (\\"Bearing thy heart\\") and protect (\\"keep\\") it; \\"chary\\" is an adverbial usage and means 'carefully'. The couplet is cautionary and conventional: when the poet's heart is slain, then the youth should not take for granted (\\"presume\\") that his own heart, dressed as it is in the poet's, will be restored: \\"Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\\" Structure Sonnet 22 is a typical English or Shakespeare sonnet. Shakespearean sonnets consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet, and follow the form's rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. They are written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / My glass shall not persuade me I am old, (22.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. The eleventh line exhibits two common metrical variations: an initial reversal, and a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó /(√ó) Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary (22.11) Source and analysis The poem is built on two conventional subjects for Elizabethan sonneteers. The notion of the exchange of hearts was popularized by Petrarch's Sonnet 48; instances may be found in Philip Sidney (Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia) and others, but the idea is also proverbial. The conceit of love as an escape for an aged speaker is no less conventional and is more narrowly attributable to Petrarch's Sonnet 143. The image cannot be used to date the sonnet, if you agree with most critics, that it was written by a poet in his mid-30s. Samuel Daniel employs the same concept in a poem written when Shakespeare was 29, and Michael Drayton used it when he was only 31. Stephen Booth perceives an echo of the Anglican marriage service in the phrasing of the couplet. \\"Expiate\\" in line 4 formerly caused some confusion, since the context does not seem to include a need for atonement. George Steevens suggested \\"expirate\\"; however, Edmond Malone and others have established that expiate here means \\"fill up the measure of my days\\" or simply \\"use up.\\" Certain critics, among them Booth and William Kerrigan, still perceive an echo of the dominant meaning. The conventional nature of the poem, what Evelyn Simpson called its \\"frigid conceit,\\" is perhaps a large part of the reason that this poem is not among the most famous of the sonnets today.

She served as an Alderman on Calgary City Council 1918 to 1924.  Early life and personal life  Gale, nicknamed Annie at an early age, was born in Netherton, West Midlands, England. The daughter of a merchant grocer and his wife, she attended an all-girls school. Upon her completion she passed the Oxford Entrance Examination. As a woman, however, she was not able to become a student at Oxford University. She began helping run the family business after her father died of pneumonia. In 1901, at the age of 25, Annie married engineer William Gale. The couple and their two sons (born in 1902 and 1905)Lishman, Alderman Mrs Annie Gale, p. 3 eventually left to join their extended family, who had emigrated to Canada and eventually settled in Calgary, Alberta in 1912.  Career  Gale took an active interest in her new home. She soon noticed the poor quality and high prices charged for vegetables. This she found was a result of grocers having contracts with BC producers so the cost of transportation was added to the price plus the long time in transit accounted for the poor quality. Gale joined the Consumers League, founded to contest wartime profiteering and the high cost of living, and helped establish a City Market (farmers market) where sellers cold sell local produce.Lishman, Alderman Mrs Annie Gale, p. 7 She also played a leading role in the Vacant Lots Garden Club whose motto was \\"make the waste places into fruitful gardens.Lishman, Alderman Mrs Annie Gale, p. 8 She noticed the poor quality of coal sold door to door, and the fact that the horses pulling the coal cart were abused. She set up a stall in the farmers market to sell good quality coal. Hearing tales of isolated farm women having to give birth without proper medical attendance, she became secretary of the Free Hospital League, which was dedicated to \\"work for hospitals as free as the public school system.\\" The organization, with support from the United Farmers of Alberta, pushed Alberta's Liberal government to initiate public hospitals.Lishman, Alderman Mrs Annie Gale, p. 10 She played a major role in promoting the women's suffrage movement in Canada and organized Calgary's Women's Ratepayers Association, the first of its kind in Canada. She accepted the group's invitation to run in the 1917 Calgary city election. She was the first Calgary woman to run for political office. Gale was elected to the Calgary City Council on December 10, 1917. She was among the first women in Canada, and in the British Commonwealth, to be elected to an elected position in any level of government, following shortly after two women were elected in the provincial election earlier that same year.; Wikipedia article: McKinney, Louise (Canadian politician)\\" The following year Gale was elected as acting mayor by her fellow members on the city council. For the first time in the British Empire, a woman performed the duties of a mayor, when the elected mayor was unable to perform his duties. She was re-elected to city council in December 1919 and again in December 1921. In the 1921 Alberta provincial election, she ran as an Independent Labour candidate in Calgary provincial. Gale was unsuccessful, finishing 16th out of the 20 candidates running for the city's five seats. Her strong advocacy for working families made her enemies and they contrived to force her husband to resign from his employment with the City Engineering Department in 1923. She felt she could not serve on city council after his resignation so did not run for re-election when her third term on council expired a few months later.Lishman, Alderman Mrs Annie Gale, p. 50 In 1924, she was elected as a public school trustee for the Calgary Board of Education.

Legacy  The Canadian Magazine said of Gale, in a 1917 article: \\"She is exactly the type of woman who should be in public life--a feminine, gracious, magnetic personality without aggression or bombast; a woman with a charming platform manner which does not come off the instant she reaches the bottom step and stands on the floor of the hall; the type of woman of whom the West is justly proud.\\" Gale said: \\"I have always believed that the mission of women in political life was to clean up politics.\\" Feminist Nellie McClung paid tribute to Annie Gale: \\"Women haven't an easy time in public life and Mrs. Gale has played her part courageously and intelligently. Mrs. Gale could always be depended upon to take a sane, forward, dependable view. Her tact and charming personality have carried her through many difficulties. Women haven't an easy time in public life but they count the cost before they enter. Mrs. Gale has always upheld the standards of womanhood and we cherish the hope that she will come back to us again.\\" In 1983, a junior high school was named after her in the Calgary community of Whitehorn.

In the sonnet, the speaker is not able to adequately speak of his love, because of the intensity of his feelings. He compares himself to an actor onstage who is struck by fear and cannot perform his part, or like a ferocious beast or a passionate human filled with rage, and whose over- abundant emotion defeats the expressing of it. He forgets the correct words that the rituals of love deserve. The passion of his love seems to fall apart, as it is over-burdened with emotion. So he encourages his young friend to read and then respond to the poet's written expressions of his love. The sonnet ends with the paradoxes ‚Äî books that cannot speak will speak, if eyes will hear.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 156-7 . The metaphor of the actor has drawn biographical interest and comment. Shakespeare uses a metaphor from the theatre to express the idea of the speaker's impotence in performing the \\"ceremony of love‚Äôs right\\" (line 6). Instead, the lover must read beyond such a performance, and read ‚Äúbetween the lines‚Äù to understand the poet's love, as it is expressed in the silences between the words. This sonnet seems to suggest the limits of language.Edmondson, Paul Wells, Stanley. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 84.

The date that Shakespeare wrote this sonnet is not known for certain. If Thorpe numbered the sonnets in the order in which they were written, then Sonnet 23 was written before 1596. This is because, according to GB Harrison, Sonnet 107‚Äîusing its references to Queen Elizabeth‚Äîcan be dated to the year 1596. One scholar, Brents Stirling, in his revised ordering of the sonnets, argues that Sonnet 23 takes place in a \\"later phase\\" in the \\"poet-friendship relationship\\". In the timeline that Stirling describes, Sonnet 23 \\"celebrates renewal and rededication\\" of the relationship. In relation to Sonnet 107, Sonnet 23 is placed within the same \\"group\\" that Stirling creates. As for the subject of Sonnet 23, most scholars have narrowed the identity of the \\"Fair Youth\\" down to two contenders: William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. One scholar, Katherine Duncan-Jones, argues that William Herbert is both the \\"Mr. W.H.\\" of the dedication and the subject of sonnets 1-126. She cites Shakespeare's financial incentive for dedicating the Quarto to Herbert; the Earl's \\"reluctance to marry\\" and references to Sonnet 116 in his own writing are a few of her reasons for believing that he is also the fair youth. Scholar Kenneth Larsen also argues for Herbert, on the grounds of parallels between Sonnet 125 and events at the coronation of James I. Despite this, it has been noted that in the early 1590s, Wriothesley refused to marry as well, and Duncan-Jones acknowledges that sonnets written around the time of 1592-95 may have been originally addressed to Henry Wriothesley. Although the sonnet tells the subject to read his poems and understand his love rather than rely on a performance, this directly contradicts Shakespeare's writing style within his plays, where he \\"presents the writing of love poetry in general, and sonnets in-particular, as ridiculous\\". Patrick Cheney also notes that Shakespeare's plays tends to emphasize \\"the superior effectiveness of performing an emotion rather than speaking about it.\\" Within Sonnet 23, this is further complicated by the comparisons Shakespeare makes, first comparing himself to an actor and then his collection of poems to a play. Structure Sonnet 23 is considered an English or Shakespearean Sonnet. It contains 14 iambic pentameter lines. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The form consists of three quatrains and a couplet. All of the lines, including the fifth line are examples of iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / So I, for fear of trust, forget to say (23.5) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. After the octave (the first two quatrains) there is often a change referred to as a volta. In Sonnet 23 the volta is line nine's suggestion. Source and analysis \\"For fear of trust\\" has drawn different, though not necessarily contradictory, glosses. Nicolaus Delius has it \\"from want of self-confidence,\\" with which Edward Dowden substantially agrees; Thomas Tyler adds \\"for fear that I shall not be trusted,\\" and Beeching agrees that \\"the trust is active.\\" \\"Dumb presagers\\" is sometimes seen as a continuation of the acting metaphor; a dumb show often preceded each act of Elizabethan plays. Fleay suggests a more specific indebtedness to Daniel's Complaint of Rosamond, 19. The principal interpretive issue relates to \\"books\\" in line 9. George Sewell and Edward Capell, among others, supported emendation to \\"looks,\\" principally because the syntactical connection with \\"presagers\\" seems to require a word in line 9 that can evoke future time. Both words fit into the trope of the lover struck dumb by his love, and hoping to use his books (or looks) to make himself understood. Editors from Malone to Booth and William Kerrigan have defended the quarto reading, and most modern editors generally retain \\"books.\\" Exegesis According to Joel Fineman, Shakespeare's sonnets portray language as \\"corruptingly linguistic rather than something ideally specular.\\" He cites 23's conclusion ‚Äî \\"To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit\\" ‚Äî to illuminate Shakespeare's fixation on the shortcomings of words, stating that many sonnets \\"speak against a strong tradition, not only poetic, of linguistic idealization for which words in some sense are the things of which they speak.\\" Vendler writes that in sonnet 23, \\"the (inevitable) distance between composing author and fictive speaker narrows to the vanishing point.\\" She says that the sonnet gets at the \\"stranglehold\\" of both the poem and Shakespeare's prolific literary mind‚Äîboth the author and the \\"character\\" of 23 desire to express too many things at once. Vendler states that language is not the only barrier to expression in 23 though, continuing to say that when the poem recognizes \\"that tongue\\" in line 12 as a rival to the \\"character\\", Shakespeare intends \\"the tongue-tiedness rather as a fear of trusting the audience--the potentially faithless beloved.\\" Manfred Pfister argues that each sonnet has a \\"speaker\\" that, like a character in a play, delivers the sonnet with an awareness of the present moment, what has happened in the immediate past, and the audience hearing the text. Heather Dubrow writes that the sonnets are \\"plotted\\" too often. She argues that narrativizing them and applying a biographical lens to them is unwise because of how little we know about their original form. Patrick Cheney writes that the poem's focus on both the theater and \\"books\\" is useful. \\"The complication helps make its own point: Shakespeare's ingrained thinking process both separates and intertwines the two modes of his professional career...Perhaps we can see Shakespeare presenting Will as a (clowning) man of the theatre who nonetheless has managed to write poetry of educational value -- and is saying so in a Petrarchan sonnet.\\" Cheney goes on to say that Sonnet 23's purpose is to make a statement about the uses of theater and poetry. 23 illuminates live performance's inability to capture the \\"integrity\\" of timid infatuation. Helen Vendler says, \\"the octave seems to imply that the cause of the tongue-tiedness lies in the psychology of the speaker-poet.\\" This analysis points to a shift in the tone of the poem, in other words, a volta. The overall framing of the sonnet shines a light on the volta as well. Pairs of lines in the octave are parallel thematically: according to Vendler, \\"[c]areful parallels are drawn between [lines 1 & 2] and [ll 5 & 6] by fear and perfect (unperfect), between [ll 3 & 4] and [ll 7 & 8] by strength and own (his/mine).\\" She says when Shakespeare frames a sonnet this intentionally, \\"something is about to burst loose.\\" In Duncan-Jones' edition of this poem, in line 6 the word \\"right\\" is used, which supports a double meaning of the word.

In the sonnet, Shakespeare treats the commonplace Renaissance conceit connecting heart and eye. Although it relates to other sonnets that explore this theme, Sonnet 24 is considered largely imitative and conventional. Structure Sonnet 24 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. English sonnets contain fourteen lines, including three quatrains and a final couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line.

Edward Dowden notes parallels for the opening conceit in Henry Constable's Diana and in Thomas Watson's Tears of Fancy. The poem's central conceit, the dialogue between heart and eye, was a period clich√©. Sidney Lee traces it to Petrarch and notes analogues in the work of Ronsard, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes. The poem has not enjoyed a high reputation. Henry Charles Beeching speculates that it might be a half-serious spoof of a clich√©d type of poem. George Wyndham is among the few to take it completely seriously, providing a neoplatonic reading. \\"Perspective\\" is the key trope in the second half of the poem, as it introduces the idea of the connection between speaker and beloved. Some editors have assumed that \\"perspective\\" was used, as often in the Renaissance, to refer to a specific type of optical illusion sometimes called a perspective house; however, Thomas Tyler and others demonstrated that the word was also known in its modern sense during the time. Sonnet 46 and Sonnet 47 also present the eyes of the speaker as a character in the poem. Note that in Sonnet 24 both the singular eye and the plural eyes are used for the eyes of the speaker, contrary to Sonnet 46 and Sonnet 47 where only the singular is used.

The airport is located at Valan, on the south side of Skipsfjorden, north of the town, and from the North Cape. The airport has a asphalt runway which is operated by the state-owned Avinor. Flights are operated by Wider√∏e to Troms√∏ with connecting fights to Oslo. The airline also fly to other communities within Finnmark, who serve the airport with Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft. The airport handled 13,487 passengers in 2014. Honningsv√•g was served by a seaplane route in the late 1930s, but these never resumed after World War II. Valan Airport was planned as part of the construction of short take-off and landing airports in Finnmark, but did not open until 30 June 1977 because of airport's difficult terrain and landing conditions. Wider√∏e originally served the airport using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and the de Havilland Canada Dash 7, until the Bombardier Dash 8 was introduced in 1995. The routes have since 1997 been subsidized through public service obligations. A new terminal opened in 1989. The opening of the North Cape Tunnel in 1999 has resulted in a decrease of traffic at the airport. History The first flight in Nordkapp took place during the summer of 1926, when a German cruise ship SS Oceania used its on-board Junkers F-13 seaplane to fly tourists sightseeing. The second was Gidsken Jakobsen and John Strandrud who used their Junkers seaplane to fly sightseeing for cruise tourists. Jakobsen established Nord-Norges Aero and applied for concession for a Northern Norway route, but Parliament instead chose to support Norwegian Air Lines (DNL). Their Bergen‚ÄìTroms√∏ route started in 1935 and the following year it was extended via Skjerv√∏y and Hammerfest to Honningsv√•g. The Finnmark route was subcontracted to Wider√∏e, who flew an average of mail per trip between 11 June and 12 August. The Finnmark route was not carried out in 1937, but reopened the following year. In both 1938 and 1939 was operated from 1 July to 30 August. The 1940 schedule was terminated because of the German occupation of Norway, although twice a week a service was introduced from Trondheim via Troms√∏ and Honnignsv√•g to Kirkenes. This was the first winter flights and lasted until early 1941 when the pilots fled to the United Kingdom for military service. The terminal DNL assumed the Finnmark route in 1947, but dropped Honningsv√•g from the schedule. The municipal council approved plans in 1948 to reestablish the water aerodrome, which had been destroyed in the German retreat in 1944. Despite several local initiatives from Nordkapp during the 1950s and 1960s, Honningsv√•g was not included in the seaplane routes. Following the opening av Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak in 1963, Norving applied to operate a feeder service from Honningsv√•g to Alta and Hammerfest, but the ministry was not willing to issue subsidies for such a route. At the time travel time from Honningsv√•g to Oslo via Lakselv was ten hours. Various public committees look into better aviation services in Finnmark during the 1960s. One such alternative was to build a heliport. Instead the government opted for constructing short take-off and landing airfields. The first of these were constructed in Helgeland in 1968. The ministry proposed in 1972 that six airports be built in northern Troms and Finnmark. The first five airports opened on 1 August 1974, but construction of Honningsv√•g Airport was delayed. The reason was the difficult terrain and wind conditions and more time was needed to find a suitable site. In addition to Valan, sites at K√•fjord and Skarsv√•gfjellet was considered, in addition to the use of helicopters. Valan was chosen despite the poor conditions, which force approach to take place in a semi-circle. Construction cost 17.4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK 15.8 million was covered by the state and the remainder by Nordkapp Municipality and Finnmark County Municipality. The airport opened on 30 June 1977; it was initially operated by the municipality with the state operating the air navigation services. Approach at dusk Wider√∏e originally served the airport with nineteen-seat Twin Otters, serving Honningsv√•g up to six times per day. The airport allowed for a travel time of four and a half hours from Honningsv√•g to Oslo. Annual ridership was 20,000 for the first twelve months; it peaked at 25,316 in 1986 before falling to 17,000 in 1993. A new terminal was built in 1989. Honningsv√•g Airport has used the term \\"North Cape Airport\\" because of its vicinity to the North Cape. A dispute between Honningsv√•g and Lakselv arose in 1996 when the latter started using the same term for their airport. Wider√∏e introduced the Dash 8 in 1995 and from 1 January 1997 ownership and operations was taken over by the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Flights to Honningsv√•g have been subject to public service obligations since 1 April 1997. The North Cape Tunnel opened on 15 June 1999, providing a fixed link for Mager√∏ya to the mainland. This resulted in a significant fall in traffic, which hit a record low 10,846 in 2005. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The safety areas were upgraded in 2010, followed by a new control tower in 2011. Future After 2010 there are no new aircraft available for purchase with more than 19 seats which can use the runways common in Norway. The presently used Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft are assumed to be retired around 2030. Honningsv√•g is one of the airports where there is no room for runway extension. Considering the fairly low number of passengers, the plan is to use small planes. Facilities Aerial view of the airport in 2000 The airport is located at Valan, from Honningsv√•g. The terminal has a capacity for 150 passengers per hour. The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. The runway is designated 08/26 and has an asphalt surface measuring . The difficult terrain and wind conditions force aircraft to approach the airport in a semi-circle in both directions. The limited space also makes it impossible to extend the runway. Thirteen people worked at the airport as of 2008. Airlines and destinations Honningsv√•g is served by Wider√∏e, which operates Dash 8 (100 and Q200) aircraft to Troms√∏ and to some other communities in Finnmark. The routes are operated as public service obligations financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 13,487 passengers, 2,274 aircraft movements and handled 55 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Wider√∏e cooperate with SAS on connecting flights. The total flight time from Honningsv√•g to Oslo, via Troms√∏, is 3:45 hours.https://www.wideroe.no/en Wider√∏e Airlines, official website Honningsv√•g falls partially within the catchment area of Alta Airport, which is away by road. The driving time from Honningsv√•g to Alta is 3:00 hours. The pass at Sennalandet is sometimes closed during snow storms in the winter time. If this happens, the alternative route takes over 6:00 hours, , so the weather forecast should be checked 6‚Äì8 hours before. Another option is the Lakselv Airport which is and 2:30 hours away by road and without a mountain pass, but has only seasonal flights to Oslo. Accidents and incidents On 29 October 1990 at 14:30 a Twin Otter of the Royal Norwegian Air Force crashed during landing at Honningsv√•g Airport. The pilots lost control during turbulence and strong wind and the aircraft crashed from the runway threshold. Three of the fifteen people on board were killed. The accident resulted in stricter wind restrictions at the airport.

It is a part of the Fair Youth sequence. In the sonnet the poem expresses the poet's contentedness in comparison to others, though they may have titles, honors, or are favored at court, or are noted warriors. It prefigures the more famous treatment of class differences found in Sonnet 29. There are noted similarities in this sonnet and in the relationship of Romeo and Juliet. Synopsis ' The Speaker contrasts those who are fortunate (whether by the astrological influence of real \\"stars\\", or the social influence of their superiors, metaphorical \\"stars\\") with himself who, favored with no such public recognition, nevertheless can revel (\\"joy\\" is used as a verb) in what he holds most dear. ' These seeming fortunates display their \\"pride\\" (i.e. self-esteem, or finery) like an opening marigold, but only so long as their prince (\\"sun\\") favors them. (Elizabethans knew the marigold as a flower that opened in the presence, and closed in the absence, of the sun.) ' Similarly, even a warrior renowned for \\"a thousand victories\\" may be stripped of his honor and forgotten after a single defeat. ' But the Speaker is happy in his mutual love, from which he cannot be removed, either by himself or by others. Structure Sonnet 25 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, formed of three quatrains and a final couplet in iambic pentameter, a type of metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 12th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd: (25.12) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The 10th line begins with a common metrical variant, the initial reversal: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / After a thousand victories once foil'd, (25.10) The 6th line also has a potential initial reversal, as well as the rightward movement of the fourth ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / / But as the marigold at the sun's eye, (25.6) Potential initial reversals also occur in lines 1 and 11, with line 8 potentially exhibiting both an initial and midline reversal. Minor ionics appear in lines 2 and 3. The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: line 3's \\"favourites\\" functions as 3 syllables, and line 9's \\"warrior\\" as 2 syllables. The final -ed is syllabic in line 7's 3-syllable \\"buri√®d\\", line 9's 3-syllable \\"famous√®d\\" and line 11's 2-syllable \\"raz√®d\\". Stephen Booth notes that the original typography suggests that the final rhymes may have been intended to be trisyllabic: \\"belov√®d\\" and \\"remov√®d\\", although other editors (like John Kerrigan) prefer the standard 2-syllable pronunciations. Emendations This sonnet, as originally printed, departs from the English sonnet's rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Lines 9 and 11 (the expected e lines) do not rhyme. These lines in the Quarto of 1609 read (with emphasis added): > The painefull warrier famo≈øed for worth, ... Is from the booke of honour > ra≈øed quite, No other lines in Shakespeare's Sonnets fail to rhyme, and Shakespeare's typical sonnet structure demands that these lines should rhyme with each other. Most editors emend one or the other of these words to form one of three rhyming pairs: *fight ‚Äì quite ‚Äî first suggested by Lewis Theobald and \\"the more popular of the two generally favored emendations\\". *might ‚Äì quite ‚Äî first suggested by Edward Capell and the second most popular according to Booth. *worth ‚Äì forth ‚Äî also suggested by Theobald. This emendation was preferred by John Payne Collier. Duncan-Jones sees weaknesses in all three emendations, and retains the Quarto's non-rhyming pair worth ‚Äì quite. George Steevens opined that \\"this stanza is not worth the labour that has been bestowed on it.\\" Analysis =Astrological References= Shakespeare refers to the influences of astrology and fate in this poem. Stars are cited as the luck- giving ones that favor some with positions at court. The reference made to the \\"favour of the stars\\" is also a metaphor for the members of the court keeping in favour of the King. Because courtly status is gifted by the stars and not earned, it is precarious. John Kerrigan notes the echo of the prologue to Romeo and Juliet in the astrological metaphor of the first quatrain; he notes that the image severs reward from justice, making fortune a mere caprice. =Marigold Metaphor= Marigold emblem engraved by Crispin van Passe, as published in George Wither's Collection of Emblems (1635) The Latin motto may be translated: \\"He followed no lesser.\\" Edward Dowden notes that the marigold was most commonly mentioned in Renaissance literature as a heliotrope, with the various symbolic associations connected to that type of plant; William James Rolfe finds an analogous reference to the plant in George Wither's poetry: > When, with a serious musing, I behold The gratefull, and obsequious > Marigold, How duely, ev'ry morning, she displayes Her open breast, when > Titan spreads his Rayes; ... How, when he downe declines, she droopes and > mournes, Bedew'd (as 'twere) with teares, till he returnes; ... (lines 1‚Äì4, > 7‚Äì8) but whereas for Wither the sun represents God and the marigold's reliance upon it is a virtue, Shakespeare's \\"sun\\" is mortal and fickle and reliance upon this sun is a risk. Edmond Malone noted the resemblance of lines 5‚Äì8 to this section of Wolsey's farewell in Henry VIII: > This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes, > to-morrow blossoms, And bears his blushing honors thick upon him; The third > day comes a frost, a killing frost, And when he thinks, good easy man, full > surely His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, And then he falls as I > do. (III.ii.352‚Äì358) Ironically, this passage is now widely (though not universally) held to have been written by John Fletcher. Essex's Rebellion, style of allusion, and \\"compensation\\" Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex fell out of favour with, and rebelled against, Queen Elizabeth I, for which he was executed at the Tower of London. In Sonnet 25 may allude to Essex's Rebellion. In Themes and Variations in Shakespeare's Sonnets (1961), James Blair Leishman criticised preceding approaches to Shakespeare's sonnets, feeling they either excessively focussed on the identity of \\"W.H.\\", the Fair Youth, the Rival Poet, or the Dark Lady; or they analysed the sonnets' style in isolation. To remedy this perceived lack, Leishman sets out to analyse the sonnets by comparison and contrast with other poets and sonneteers like Pindar, Horace and Ovid; Petrarch, Torquato Tasso, and Pierre de Ronsard; and Shakespeare's English predecessors and contemporaries Edmund Spenser, Samuel Daniel, Samuel Daniel, and John Donne. Here Leishman agrees that the sonnet contains such allusions, but argues that it is more likely to have been written, and the allusions being to, the state of affairs shortly after Essex's return from Ireland in 1599‚Äîas opposed to after Essex's trial and execution in 1601‚Äîwhen the issue was fresh in Shakespeare's mind. In this interpretation, Essex is the \\"painful warrior famoused for fight\\" who \\"After a thousand victories\\" in Ireland \\"Is from the book of honor razed quite, / And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:\\". Leishman also names Sonnet 25 as an example of a contrast between the style of Shakespeare's sonnets and Drayton: where Drayton directly names the people he refers to, and references public events \\"in a perfectly plain and unambiguous manner,\\" Shakespeare never directly includes names and all his allusions to public events are couched in metaphor. He draws a comparison to Dante Alighieri and calls the style \\"Dantesquely periphrastic\\". In Leishman's critical framework, Sonnets 25, 29 and 37 are examples of what he calls a theme of \\"compensation\\". In this theme, the Poet views the Fair Youth as a divine compensation \\"for all his own deficiencies of talent and fortune and for all his failures and disappointments.\\" The Poet's faults, the troubles he has met, and the losses he has suffered, are compensated by the positive attributes and the friendship of the Fair Youth.

Life Euphemia was a daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross, and Margaret de Graham, Hugh's second wife and daughter of Sir John de Graham of Abercorn.John P. Ravilious, Queen Euphemia and her ancestry, The Scottish Genealogist, June 2017, vol. LXIV(2) pp. 49-52. Prior publications including J. Balfour Paul's Scots Peerage identify Margaret de Graham in error as a daughter of Sir David Graham of Montrose. She first married John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray but the marriage was childless. Her husband died in 1346 and she remained a widow for nine years. On 2 May 1355, Euphemia married Robert Stewart, sole son of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and Marjorie Bruce. Marjorie was a daughter of Robert I of Scotland (Robert The Bruce), and his first wife Isabella of Mar. Over a decade earlier, her second husband Robert had been joint Regent of Scotland with her first husband. It appears that there was an obstacle of affinity to this second marriage, and a papal dispensation by Pope Innocent VI was required for it to be recognized by the Catholic Church. The affinity was due to her first husband, John Randolph, Earl of Moray, having been a second cousin of Robert Stewart. There also was a blood relationship, as the dispensation referenced their being related in the fourth degree of consanguinity, but this relationship has as yet not been identified.Andrew Stuart, Genealogical History of the Stewarts (London, 1798), pp. 420-421. The children of Robert's first marriage to Elizabeth Mure were considered illegitimate by some due to reasons of consanguinity. Both sets of children from each marriage considered themselves rightful heirs to the throne, which constituted considerable future conflict. Euphemia and Robert were parents to four children: *David Stewart, 1st Earl of Caithness (d. bef. 1389) *Walter Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl (d. 1437) *Elizabeth Stewart *Egidia Stewart, married 1387 Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale Robert II succeeded his childless maternal uncle David II of Scotland in 1371.

The sonnet is generally regarded as the end-point or culmination of the group of five preceding poems. It encapsulates several themes not only of Sonnets 20‚Äì25, but also of the first thirty-two poems together: the function of writing poems, the effect of class differences, and love. Structure Sonnet 26 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet, formed of three quatrains and a couplet, having a rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. The seventh line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter line. The next contains a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending, of which this sonnet has six; it also exhibits an ictus moved to the right (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it: (26.7-8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Synopsis and analysis As Stephen Booth notes, Sonnet 26 works on a series of \\"shows\\": the word appears in four separate lines of the sonnet. Booth perceives a vague sexual pun in the second half of the poem, but G. B. Evans and others describe this reading as \\"strained.\\" The first \\"show\\" in the sonnet is directed to Cupid, to whom in servitude the poet's duty is \\"knit\\". The connection is compounded by the later \\"bare\\" and \\"all naked.\\" The figure of the naked Cupid can be traced back to Ovid's Amores. Capell, Dowden and others have seen Sonnet 26 as an envoy or introduction to a certain set of poems sent to an aristocrat who had commissioned them. The dedicatory sonnets are usually defined as 20‚Äì25, but they are sometimes extended to all of the first 25 sonnets. Others, among them George Wyndham and Henry Charles Beeching, make Sonnet 26 the introduction of a new set, running until Sonnet 32. Assuming the sonnet is an envoy or \\"ambassage\\", a submission of a vassal seeking preferment from a Lord, we are presented with a pastiche of ink-horn terms. The plainant extols the Lord's \\"merit\\" and, disingenuously, his own meagre abilities, his \\"wit\\". Sonnet 26's inflated formality exposes the subservience required of letters seeking favour. The poet seems dutiful, the purpose of his letter being not to display his \\"wit\\" but to bear \\"witness\\" to his \\"duty\\". His \\"duty\\" is \\"so great\\" and his ability \\"so poore\\", that his language may seem \\"bare\\", lacking \\"words\\" and adornment. Except that (\\"But that\\") the poet's hope is that the youth's \\"good conceit\\", his fine 'thought' or 'fancy' or even his 'opinion,' which can be found in his \\"soul's thought\\", will dress up the poet's \\"all naked\\" or \\"bare\\" missive of love. The sestet picks up the astrological motif of the previous sonnet, where the poet's love, unlike those who boast of the \\"favour of the stars\\", is at sufficient \\"remove\\" to be impervious to stellar influence. The youth's is required until such time as the poet's personal star, that which \\"guides\\" his \\"moving\\", shines favourably upon him (\\"points on me graciously with fair aspect\\"); \\"points\\" means 'directs' or 'influences' the poet, but was used of the zodiacal signs. Astrologically \\"aspect\\" (from the Latin ad + spicere = to look at or upon) is the manner in which a heavenly body or a conjunction of bodies looks upon the earth and its individuals, in this case \\"with favour\\". The youth's \\"conceit,\\" then, is needed until the time that his star \\"puts apparel on my tattered loving\\", until it dresses, as a bare or plain thing might be adorned, his loving which is clothed in tatters. He will be shown \\"worthy of their sweet respect\\", worthy of the countenance of \\"whatsoever star\\". Capell and Malone emend the quarto's \\"their\\" (line 12) to \\"thy\\". Other editors find the change unnecessary. At such a moment the poet may boast of his love, as others might have in Sonnet 25, but until then he dare not. Until then he vows not to \\"show my head\\". To remain unnoticed or as an act of obeisance he will keep his head down, so that his Lord may not test him or his love (\\"prove\\"); \\"me\\" is a synecdoche for 'my love'. The poem, like many others in the sequence, is built on a conceit rooted in social class. In this context, the master-servant trope commonplace in Petrarchan love poetry is literalised, by the poem's address to an imagined noble. Helen Vendler argues that the speaker's identification of himself as a slave or vassal invites skepticism rather than identification; however, others have stressed the appropriateness of the metaphor in the context of the speaker's frustrated desire for equality with the beloved. Analysis of this sonnet was at one point focused on its provenance. Edward Capell was the first of several scholars to note the similarity of content between the first quatrain and the dedication to Henry Wriothesley in The Rape of Lucrece. Other scholars have speculated that the poem was written to accompany some other of Shakespeare's writings, perhaps the first group of sonnets. Edward Massey and Sidney Lee, among others, accept the connection between sonnet and dedication; among the skeptics are Thomas Tyler, Nicolaus Delius, and Hermann Isaac. More specific arguments have been made that the poem's similarities to the Venus dedications indicate that the poem was written to Southampton. Modern analysts are more likely to remain agnostic on the question of the occasion of the poem, if any; all agree, however, that the sonnet at least dramatizes the type of emotions an older but lower-class poet might express toward a potential noble patron.

It is a part of what is considered the Fair Youth group, and part of another group (sonnets 27, 28, 43 and 61) that focuses on the solitary poet reflecting on his friend. There is a theme of night and sleeplessness, which is a traditional motif that also occurs in Petrarchan sonnets. thumb Exegesis Themes in Sonnet 28 begin in Sonnet 27, and continue into sonnets 43 and 61: All four sonnets find the poet alone in bed at night in the dark trying unsuccessfully to conjure with his mind's eye the image of the young man. All four describe the nightly disquiet that keeps him awake, and the imaginative journey that occurs in the mind of a poet.Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 112-113. Sonnet 28's first quatrain begins questioning how the poet can return to the young man in a happy plight. The concern is that at night he is prevented from resting, and by day he is oppressed by toil. The toil is the toil of travel, and the description of travel in the previous sonnet (Sonnet 27) is the journey that takes place in a poet's imagination. So, the word toil appears to be referring to the poet's work: the search for words and metaphors to describe his fair young friend.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 166 . In the second quatrain, Day and Night are personified as a pair of tyrants who were enemies to each other, but who have now shaken hands to join forces to torture the poet. Day tortures the poet with toil, Night tortures him by causing him to lament how far off the poet is from the young man. If toil is interpreted as the work of a poet, then the torture is a metaphor for the poet's anguish that his efforts to find poetic expressions and metaphors to describe the young man are not getting closer to the young man, but are moving away. This is not letting him sleep.Peters, Roger. William Shakespeare's Sonnet Philosophy, vol 2. Quaternary Imprint; 2nd Edition, 2018. The Day and the Night are disturbed that the young man, or at least his image, will not appear to the poet, so they attempt to torture it out of him. The third quatrain begins (line 9) with the poet telling the young man that he (the poet) flatters the day by telling him he is bright, and that he graces the young man even when the clouds hide the sun. In a similar way, the poet flatters the dark (swart) complexioned night. The poet, motivated to stop the torture and conjure the image of the young man, beguiles (guil‚Äôst) the evening. Beguiles is used here to mean tricks or deceives.Booth, Stephen, ed. (2000) [1st ed. 1977]. Shakespeare's Sonnets (Rev. ed.). New Haven: Yale Nota Bene. . OCLC 2968040. page 179-180Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 112-113. The high level of ambiguity in the third quatrain is thought to be deliberate and intended to derail a simple reading of a conventional sonnet with questions of who is being referred to. The confusion begins with the phrase \\"to please him\\", which at first glance may seem to refer to the fair youth ‚Äî a young man who appreciates flattery. That idea is supported in the rival poets group, where the poet appears to resist the young man's insistence on being flattered. The poet feels that his position in the young man's favor has been overthrown by rival poets, who have succeeded only because they flatter, whereas the poet prefers to write \\"in true plain words\\" (Sonnet 82, line 12). The sorting out of the ambiguities, causes the reader to consider a possible interpretation of the fair youth as a flattery-craving tyrant.Empson, William. Seven Types of Ambiguity. New Directions (1966) p. 133-134Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 113. In line 12 of the quarto the word guil‚Äôst occurs. Some editors replace it with the word gildest, which is defined as: adorns with a thin layer of gold). This substitution was first made in an 18th Century edition of Shakespeare's works, edited by Edmond Malone. With this emendation the poet flatters the night by saying that even when \\"stars twire [peer and wink] not, thou gildest the even\\" (evening).Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 166 . The final couplet (lines 13 & 14) makes it clear that the poet does not succeed in conjuring a vision of the young man, and the flattery, telling the day he is bright for example, does not satisfy the torturers, who appear to be stretching the poet on the rack ‚Äî drawing his \\"sorrows longer\\", and making \\"grief‚Äôs length seem stronger‚Äù (lines 13-14).Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 112-113. Sonnet Structure Sonnet 28 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. It consists of 14 lines arranged by the rhyme scheme to form three quatrains (lines 1‚Äì12) and a couplet (lines 13‚Äì14). The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is written in iambic pentameter, a metre based on five feet in each line, with each foot containing two syllables accented weak/strong: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / But day by night and night by day oppressed, (28.4) The two lines of the couplet, and perhaps lines ten and twelve, each has a final extra syllable or feminine ending: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, (28.13) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Alliteration occurs in the sonnet, the b, d or p sounds for example, found in lines 1 through 3. Notes References *Baldwin, T. W.

The main temple of the goddess is situated atop a hill, in Virar, Maharashtra, India. Location The temple is on the hill, almost 1500 ft from the sea-level. The Goddess rests in a temple situated about 1465 steps above the ground on a hill that forms a part of the Satpura Range in Virar, a northern Mumbai suburb, about 60 km away from Mumbai. The hill offers a very picturesque view of Virar and its vicinity. During the nine days of the Navratri festival many followers visit the shrine. Mythology The name Virar comes from Eka-viraa. Just as Tunga Parvat becomes \\"Tunga-ar\\", similarly \\"Vira\\" becomes \\"Vira-ar\\".There is a huge temple of Eka-vira Devi on the banks of Vaitarna River at the foot hills of Tunga Parvat, (this is now totally broken by the continuous raids of Mohamedeans and Portuguese in last 400 years), where people used to conclude their \\"Shurpaaraka Yatra\\", as described in the Puranas and local legends. There is a huge tank here dedicated to Eka veera Devi called \\"Viraar Tirtha\\", i.e. \\"Eka- Viraa Tirtha\\". Even today, on the west banks of Viraar Tirtha, one finds a carved stone about three feet long and nine inches broad. Below that is a group of female figures of the Yoginis of Ekaveera Devi. Nearby one can find a stone with a roughly cut cow and calf (Savatsa Dhenu), a symbol of Govardhana Math which symbolizes eternity or Moksha. Moving ahead near the foot of a knoll of rock are two cow‚Äôs feet (Go-Paad) roughly cut in rock. The legendary story of Jivdani Devi is as follows: During their forest journey, Pandavas came to Shurparaka. They visited the holy temple of Vimaleshwar consecrated by Lord Parashuram and on their journey to Prabhas halted on the banks of Vaitarni river. There they worshipped the Bhagavati Ekaveera on the banks of Viraar Tirtha and seeing the serenity and lofty nature decided to carve caves in the nearby mountains. They did so on the hills nearby and installed and worshipped the Yoga Linga of Ekaveera devi in one of the caves. They called her Bhagavati Jeevadhani (That is Goddess, who is the real wealth of life). Doing so Pandavas also made a set of small caves now known as \\"Pandav Dongri\\" about a mile from Shirgaon for the hermits. Many yogis used to stay in Pandav Dongri and have darshan of Jeevdhani Devi. After the onset of Kali Yuga, and after the advent of the Buddhist faith, the number of Vaidik Yogis lessened and slowly people forget the hillock and the devi. During times of Jagadguru Shankaracharya‚Äôs advent, a Mahar or Mirashi used to stay in Viraar who used to graze the village cattle. He came to Nirmal Mandir for the darshan of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Padmanabha Swami and requested that he bless him so that he could have darshan of his beloved Kuladevata. Jagadguru was pleased with the devotion of Mahar and advised him to serve Go-Mata on the foothills of Jivadhani, and at appropriate time he would have darshan of his Goddess and attain Go-Loka. He literally for the rest of life followed the advice of Jagadguru Shankaracharya and herded the village cattle. While grazing the village cattle, he used to see a cow grazing along with, whose owner never paid him for herding her. By his virtue, he determined to find the owner of the cow. He followed the cow on the top of Jeevdhan Hill. A beautiful woman with divine features appeared. The Mahar remembered the words of Jagadguru Shankaracharya and understood that she is none other than his Kuladevi Jeevdhani, he was overjoyed and asked \\"Oh Mother ! I have grazed your cow, will you not pay me for her herding ?\\". The Devi just smiled in delight and was on the point of putting some money in the Mahar‚Äôs hand, when he said \\"Do not touch me, I am Mahar. Give me something which cannot be spoilt by touch, words, smell, figure, and ether.\\" Knowing this Devi asked \\"Lo my child, whence from you learned this unique knowledge of Varnashram Dharma and Moksha Dharma?\\". To this Mahar replied, \\"From none other than by the Grace of Jagadguru Shankaracharya\\". Bhagavati was pleased by this and said \\"By your virtue (Punya), see this cow which is none other than Kaamadhenu has taken your forefathers to higher abodes by her tail, crossing the Vaitarini\\". Thus saying the Mahar saw the cow leap from the hill top putting her two feet prints on hill foor and other two across Vaitarini River in heavens. Now Devi told, \\"I confer upon you the thing which you demanded that is Moksha.\\" Saying so the Mahar attained Moksha (The real Jeeva Dhana, the real wealth of Life) and the Devi was about to disappear in the cave, when a barren woman saw all this divine incident screamed \\"Devi Devi, Amba Amba, will you leave this barren daughter of yours without our jeevan dhan a child in my laps?\\". Devi was pleased by her prayers and said \\" Great indeed are you who saw all three of us. I henceforth bless you with a child.\\" The lady was not satisfied by this, she said \\"Oh Mother of the three worlds, do not just bless me, but let all barren daughters of you who pray you be conferred with the child\\". Devi was pleased at this and said \\"See henceforth, due to the advent of Kali Yuga, in order to maintain purity of rituals, I will stay into a hole in the niche of the cave. The barren women who offer me the beetlenuts in this hole, as is offered in my original place in Mahurgad, will be rewarded with a progeny\\". Thus saying the Devi disappeared. This lady spread out the incident and thus once again the Jeevdhan hill started to be visited by the pilgrims. The presently installed image is a very recent one, the original sanctum sanctorum is the hole in the niche of the cave, which is the central place of worship. A fair is held on the Dusherra day which is attended by thousands of people. The fort is visited by tourists frequently. The temple of the Devi is completely renovated and there is a beautiful idol of Devi in white marble. There is also a temple dedicated to Sri Krishna. She mimics Santoshi Mata in Iconography and her photos and idols are often confused with her.

It is a sonnet within the Fair Youth sequence. Developing an idea introduced at the end of Sonnet 30, this poem figures the young man's superiority in terms of the possession of all the love the speaker has ever experienced. Structure Sonnet 31 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet, with three quatrains followed by a final couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Like other Shakespearean sonnets it is written in iambic pentameter, a type of metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. Metrically the sonnet is fairly regular, but demands several syllabic contractions and expansions. The first two lines each contain one expansion (marked with √® below): √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / / Thy bosom is endear√®d with all hearts, √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Which I by lacking have suppos√®d dead; (31.1-2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (In the first line, additionally, the fourth ictus moves to the right, resulting in a four- position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic.) Also expanded is line four's three-syllable \\"buri√®d\\" (though it retains two syllables in line nine). Other syllables must be contracted, as two-syllable \\"many a\\" and three-syllable \\"obsequious\\" below. Both are instances of the y-glide, pronounced approximately man-ya and ob-seq-wyus. √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / How many a holy and obsequious tear (31.5) Also contracted are line six's \\"stol'n\\" and line seven's \\"int'rest\\". Source and analysis Critics such as Malone, Collier, Dowden and Larsen glossed \\"obsequious\\" as \\"funereal\\"; others have preferred the simpler \\"dutiful\\". The quarto's \\"there\\" in line 8 is generally amended to \\"thee,\\" although certain critics have defended the quarto reading. \\"Religious love\\" is frequently compared to a similar phrase used ironically in A Lover's Complaint; G. Wilson Knight connects the phrase to a \\"suprapersonal reality created by love\\" in the sequence as a whole. Numerous editors have placed a period after \\"give\\" in line 11. This practice, which is not universal, changes the \\"that\\" in line 12 from an abbreviated \\"so that\\" to a demonstrative; the advantage of this procedure is that it renders comprehensible the \\"due\\" in line 12. T. W. Baldwin argued on thematic grounds that this poem should immediately follow Sonnet 20 and Sonnet 22. This argument, like others to rearrange the sonnets, has not received wide acceptance.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The writer is reflecting on a future in which the young man will probably outlive him. The writer takes a melancholy tone, telling the young man to remember the writer not because of the strength of the sonnets, but because the love that has been shown to the young man far surpasses any love shown by another poet.  Speaker and subject  Shakespeare's sonnets are typically classified in reference to speaker and subject. Sonnet 32 is commonly accepted as a \\"handsome youth\\" Keilen, Sean. \\"The Tradition of Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" Shakespeare 5.3 (2009): 235-52. sonnet. This classification as a handsome youth sonnet is significant as it characterizes both the speaker and the subject within the sonnet: the speaker, as a man displaying his affection for the subject who is a young, handsome man. The identity of the speaker is a well debated topic however. Some believe that the speaker is merely a character that Shakespeare has created as an expression of art.Bloom, Harold. Shakespeare's Sonnets and Poems. Broomall, PA: Chelsea House, 1999. However, the speaker is often thought to be Shakespeare himself, thus giving the content of the sonnet a much more personal sentiment. Some depict the voice of the speaker merely as a \\"construct[ed]\\" Kambaskovi√±-Sawyers, Danijela. \\"Three Themes in One, Which Wondrows Scope Affords; Ambiguous Speaker and Storytelling in Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" Humanities International Complete 49.3 (2007): 285-305. character by the author to \\"generate‚Ä¶reader interest, sympathy, and involvement that deserve closer attention\\".(Kambaskovi√±-Sawyers 286) Thus the speaker is not a reflection of the author but instead an authorial tool to evoke interest from the reader. In contrast, some critics believe that Shakespeare's sonnets are \\"autobiograph[ical]\\"(Kambaskovi√±-Sawyers 287) and that the two characters within the sonnet are Shakespeare and an unidentified male object of lust or affection. Ultimately, there is critical disagreement(Keilen 235) over whether the character of Shakespeare's speaker is ambiguous, Shakespeare himself, or a constructed character.  Content  Sonnet 32 is highly dependent upon the relationship between the subject and speaker of the sonnet. The speaker of the sonnet reflects upon \\"his own mortality\\"Bloom 43 in comparing himself to the young man whom he loves, whether romantically or in friendship it is unclear.Keilen 237 The speaker refers to himself as the \\"deceased lover\\"Shakespeare, William, Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard, Katharine Eisaman Maus, and Andrew Gurr. The Norton Shakespeare, Based on the Oxford Edition: Volume 1: Early Plays and Poems. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. which is significant as it highlights the age difference between the two men, a perpetual theme throughout Sonnet 32 as well as the rest of the handsome youth sonnets. After accepting, his eventual death, the speaker takes on a \\"self-deprecating\\"Keilen 238 tone referring to his poetry as \\"poor rude lines\\" (4) and beseeching the youth to remember him after his death. This emphasis on his failure in poetry is imperative as it frames the rest of the sonnet and the speaker's request for the young man to remember him \\"for his love\\" (14). The nature of this love is in disagreement however. While some critics believe that the love the speaker refers to is in actuality a \\"romantic\\" (Kambaskovi√±- Sawyers 288) love, others are convinced that the \\"love\\" (14) referred to is a \\"platonic love\\".Parker, David. \\"Verbal Moods in Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" Modern Language Quarterly 30.3 (n.d.): 331-39. Academic Search Complete. Regardless of the type of love that is illustrated within the sonnet, romantic or platonic, the love declaration should be considered significant as it characterizes the speaker's tone and content. However, the audience should \\"take with a pinch of salt\\" Parker 334 the seemingly modest self-denunciation and claims of inadequacy put forth by the speaker; due to the fact that they are simply a means by which the speaker emphasizes his affection for the subject. Subsequently, the content of Sonnet 32 is dependent upon the outlook of the speaker and the love he feels for the subject. Structure Sonnet 32 is written in the English (Shakespearean) sonnet form. It consists of 14 lines: 3 quatrains followed by a couplet. The metrical line is iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Literary critic George T. Wright observes how iambic pentameter, \\"however highly patterned its syntax, is by nature asymmetrical ‚Äì like human speech\\". Thus, the organization of a sonnet exists so that meaning may be found in its variation. The first two lines contrast metrically: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / If thou survive my well-contented day, √ó √ó / / √ó / √ó / √ó /(√ó) When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover (32.1-2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. While the first is quite regular, the second has a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending, as well as its initial ictus moved to the right (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic). The purpose of a Shakespearean couplet is to analyze and summarize the author's experience, as well as, to describe and enact it. In regards to the relationship of quatrain to couplet, \\"one must distinguish the fictive speaker (even when he represents himself as a poet) from Shakespeare the author\\".Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1997. 34. Print. This is particularly significant in Sonnet 32 because the fictive author reflects on his ability to write poetry. The structure of Sonnet 32 can be interpreted in light of its relationship to time. \\"The exact match created between events as foreseen by the poet (his death, the increasing poetic sophistication of the age and consequently of the beloved's taste) and the beloved's conjectured thought as he rereads the poet's verse makes intelligible Shakespeare's choice of a structure of superposition (in which lines 9-14 [beloved's thought] repeat lines 3-8 [speaker's wish]).\\" Vendler, Helen.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. This sonnet is the first of what are sometimes called the estrangement sonnets, numbers 33‚Äì36: poems concerned with the speaker's response to an unspecified \\"sensual fault\\" mentioned in (35) committed by his beloved.  Context  Nicolaus Delius notes thematic and stylistic parallels to the last scene of The Two Gentlemen of Verona. George Steevens and Edward Dowden were among the first to group the so-called \\"estrangement sonnets\\" and to note the parallels to other groups (such as sonnets 40, 41, and 42) with similar themes.Dowden, Edward. Shakespeare's Sonnets. London. 1881. This sonnet is viewed by T. R. Price as representing \\"the highest lyrical expression that English poetry has achieved\\". This is displayed in the power of using the beauty of nature as the symbol of human emotion.Price, T. R. \\"The Technic of Shakespere's Sonnets\\" Studies in Honor of Basil L. Gildersleeve. Baltimore. Lord Baltimore Press. 1902. p. 375.

Unaided by any previous excitement, they burst upon us at once in life and in power.\\"Coleridge, Samuel Taylor (1817). Biographia Literaria. London. Chap 15. According to Gerrold Hammond, the single sentence octave, the first two quatrains, presents the reader with the strong poetic nature by using adjective plus noun structures on every line. The order and abundance makes the reader aware of the rhetoric.Hammond, Gerrold. The Reader and Shakespeare's Young Man Sonnets. Totowa, N.J. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p 42-43. Sonnet 33 is the first to introduce the idealizing metaphor of the young man as the sun. The sonnet and the ones that follow have been especially attractive to critics interested in biographical reference in the sonnet; George Wyndham deplores this tendency, as does Stephen Booth.Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets. Yale University Press, New Haven.1977. Hammond critiques that the experience of reading this sonnet is almost to fall into collusion with the poet, \\"for everything about it, from its poetic and syntactic structures to its use of metaphor and pun, invites acceptance.\\" M. P. Tilley describes the sonnet as playing on the proverb 'the morning sun never lasts the day'.Tilley, M. P. A Dictionary of the Proverbs of England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. 1950. p. S978.

Elizabeth Sagaser notes that the poem is counterposed to Sonnet 116, stating that the ideas of some sonnets are neutralized temporarily by others.Sagaser, Elizabeth (1994). \\"Shakespeare's Sweet Leaves: Mourning, pleasure, and the triumph of thought in the Renaissance love lyric\\".

The Riddle of Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York. Basic Books. 1962. p 103. It also puts across the idea that the poem with its shifts and changes offers not information about the mutability of the human condition, but rather participation in an actual experience of mutability.Booth, Stephen. An Essay on Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven. Yale University Press. 1969. p 59 The speaker compares the delusion of the permanence of his friendship with the mountain tops 'flattered' by the rising sun.Muir, Kenneth. Shakespeare's Sonnets. London, George Allen & Unwin. 1979. p 59. In this sonnet (1) there is no overt \\"you\\" or \\"thou\\" (contrary to most of the sonnets and in particular to sonnets 34, 35 and 36 which all three use \\"thou\\") and (2) there is no mention of the supposed \\"fault\\" committed by the addressee towards the poet (as in sonnets 34 and 35) nor of the supposed \\"guilt\\" borne by the poet which may affect the addressee's reputation (as in sonnet 36). Structure Sonnet 33 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet, composed of three quatrains followed by a final couplet. Its rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, is typical for the form. Like other Shakespearean sonnets, it is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. A regular example is: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Anon permit the basest clouds to ride (33.5) The lines of the couplet have a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending. Lines two, three, four, eight, and fourteen all begin with an initial reversal. / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth. (33.14) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable.  Analysis  = Quatrain 1 and 2 = These two quatrains, being one sentence, are best analyzed together. In the 8 lines of quatrains 1 and 2, the patterned adjectives \\"help construct not an elaborate but an elegant metaphor of the sun as a noble countenance, normally given to blessing by his blaze and kiss but often obscured by base elements\\". In the first quatrain, the narrator is comparing the young man of his interest with the beauty of nature, specifically the sun and meadows. The sun makes the mountains look beautiful, and the meadows and streams are glittering in a way that only heavenly magic can do. In the second line, Kathryn Duncan-Jones points out the reversal of the traditions of courtly love roles suggested most often. Courtiers flatter the sovereigns, but this sovereign, a sun/son, flatters (deceives) inferiors.Duncan-Jones, Kathryn, ed. The Arden Shakespeare: Shakespeare's Sonnets. Italy, Thomas Nelson Int'l. 1997. p. 176. The second quatrain describes the young man's relationship with the poet. We can see here that there may be a moral or internal struggle for the narrator because the young man does not have loyalty towards only one person. The speaker is torn between hating the clouds and hating the young man who will \\"permit\\" the damage they (the clouds) cause and hurt the speaker's feelings. Guilt is transferred, not to another human being, but to a force of nature to blame for the young man's misdeeds for being promiscuous or disloyal to the speaker. The speaker is using the sun as a metaphor emphasizes its guilt and problem of the \\"friend\\".Dubrow, Heather. Captive Victors: Shakespeare's Narrative Poems and Sonnets. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1987. Print. Phrases and words like, \\"basest clouds\\", \\"ugly rack\\", \\"stealing\\", and \\"disgrace\\" in the second quatrain show the readers how the poet is feeling towards the young man's promiscuity. It also shows that a serious moral lapse has occurred. The poem's conceit has numerous parallels in Shakespeare's plays. Sidney Lee compares \\"flatter\\" (line 2) to a similar usage in King John 3.1.77-80. Steevens, Edward Capell, and Henry Brown note parallels in other plays. Edmond Malone glosses \\"rack\\" (line 6) as \\"the quick motion of the clouds\\"; \\"region\\" (10), a term for a division of the atmosphere, echoes and amplifies the reference. Rolfe notes that \\"forlorn\\" (line 7) was in Elizabethan pronunciation with the accent on the first syllable when it follows an unaccented syllable. = Quatrain 3 = Although Sonnet 33 is considered a part of the group of Shakespearean sonnets addressed to a young man, there have been claims that the third quatrain of sonnet 33 may have been co- addressed to Shakespere's only son, Hamnet, who died in 1596 at the age of 11.Schwartzberg, Mark. \\"Shakespeare's SONNET 33.\\" Explicator 61.1 (2002): 13-14. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 October 2014. As noted by Mark Schwartzberg of New York University, Shakespearean biographer Anthony Holden suggests that the death of Hamnet was \\"one of the catalysts that sparked the change to a darker tone in his [Shakespeare's] work, a tone that increasingly reflected personal grief\\". This change in tone is found in Hamlet, The Winter's Tale, and King John, which contained several, unexpected emotional moments. According to Scwhartzberg, the sense of betrayal and disappointment that permeates throughout the poem from the speaker isn't necessarily directed at the fair, young youth that this sonnet is thought to be addressed to, but rather at God or Fate for taking the life of Hamnet too soon. Schwartzberg believes that there is a pun on the word sun which, when replaced with son, provides the poem a tone of grievous loss. \\"Even so my sun one early morn did shine\\" (9) may be in reference to the brevity of Shakespeare's own son; \\"one early morn\\" being the phrase that captures this notion. This line combined with line 11 and 12 respectively, \\"But out alack, he was but one hour mine, / The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now\\" demonstrates Shakespeare's grief over the loss of his son as a father who felt like the existence of his son's life was but \\"one hour\\". Michael Wood also suggests the allusion of the third quatrain of Sonnet 33 to the death of the poet's son with an implied pun on \\"sun\\". In In Search of Shakespeare, he suggests that this sonnet might have nothing to do with the so-called Fair Youth sonnets, that it alludes to the death of the poet's son, Hamnet in 1596 at age 11, and that there is an implied pun on \\"sun\\" and \\"son\\": \\"Even so my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow; but out, alack, he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now\\". If this is the case the link of this sonnet with sonnets 34, 35 and 36 would be entirely coincidental and spurious. Kerverne Smith believes that the emotional effect that Hamnet's death had on Shakespeare resulted in recurring features found in Shakespeare's later plays, which fit into one of five motifs: \\"the resurrected child or sibling, androgynous and twin-like figures, a growing emphasis on father- daughter relationships; paternal guilt; family division and reunion\\".Smith, Keverne. \\"Almost The Copy Of My Child That's Dead\\": Shakespeare And The Loss Of Hamnet.\\" Omega: Journal of Death & Dying 64.1 (2011): 29-40. Professional Development Collection. Web. 28 October 2014. If this notion is to be true, then sonnet 33 could be that of the \\"paternal guilt\\" motif. In other readings of the third quatrain, it should complete the metaphor of the young man as a sun, but fails to commit, \\"my sun\\" being a step removed from \\"my friend\\" or \\"my love\\".Hammond, Gerrold. The Reader and Shakespeare's Young Man Sonnets. Totowa, N.J. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 42‚Äì43. This requires the reader to allow the speaker some leeway toward the metaphor, not to search to deeply into the \\"nature of the region cloud or its masking\\". The third quatrain restates the first two quatrains in the same metaphoric terms. = Couplet = According to Collin Barrow, the context implies that the speaker must 'allow others to dim their brightness', that he must allow for faults in his friend. The innocent weather that clouds the sun at the start of the poem has turned into moral stain, in which the sun itself (and by implication the friend) plays its part.Barrow, Collin, ed. The Complete Sonnets & Poems. Oxford. Oxford University Press. 2002. p. 446 Only when the end of the line is reached does it become apparent that the poet's comparison of his friend as 'my sun' has become a pun and slur, describing him \\"as 'a son of the world', a morally corrupt worldling, not a divine being\\". The friend's stain also stains the speaker and injures him irreversibly. Hammond considers the pun on 'sun' and 'stain' to be a superficial wit, the final line an excuse for the friend's crime. Hammond refers to the excuse as lame \\"were it not for the metaphorical dress.\\" The couplet offers resistance to the reader. The reader wants something like \\"I thought out love an everlasting day / And yet my trust thou didst, my love, betray.\\" These lines fit the spirit of the poem. Reading the sonnet with the couplet that Shakespeare wrote leaves the reader uncomfortable. Heather Dubrow claims the speaker is trying to fool himself; he accepts a one moral from the metaphor, that the friend's betrayal is justified by the sun, and neglects the moral the reader has been observing, the friend, like the sun, has been deceptive.Dubrow, Heather. \\"Shakespeare's Undramatic Monologues: Toward a Reading of the Sonnets\\".

Developed by Marty Bergen and first published in April 1982, Bergen raises are based on the Law of total tricks, a hand evaluation concept which states that with a combined nine trumps in the partnership one should compete to at least the three-level regardless of combined high card strength. Bergen recommended that instead of the more rare occurrence in the use of the 3 and 3 response as a to show a strong hand, these bids should be redeployed to provide more precise information about the length and strength of support held by responder for partner's five-card major suit opening when responder has four-card support. Bergen raises are used in response to a 1 or 1 opening bid to show hands of specific length in trump support and strength as follows: *1NT followed by 3/3 on next round ‚Äì invitational to game (typically 11-12 high card points) with three-card support *2/2 ‚Äì weak (7-10 high card points) with three-card support *3 ‚Äì weak (typically 7-10 high card points) with four-card support *3 ‚Äì a limit raise (typically 11-12 high card points) with four-card support; invitational to game *3/3 ‚Äì very weak (preemptive, typically less than 7 high card points) and four-card support *4/4 ‚Äì very weak (preemptive, typically less than 7 high card points) and five-card support Over 3, Opener may sign off in trumps, but a bid of 3 asks partner to bid three of the major with a weaker hand, i.e. 7-8 points, or bid four with a stronger hand, i.e. 9-10 points. Many partnerships which employ Bergen raises also use Jacoby 2NT and splinter bids in response to major suit openings for game-forcing hands with trump support. A direct raise to game is then preemptive on a very shapely hand (often with five card trump support). Modifications to Bergen responses do exist. One such method (usually called Reverse Bergen) is to reverse the meanings of the two minor suit responses at the three level, thereby creating a system of responses that denote progressively weaker hands on subsequent bids.  Bergen Raises over One-of-a-Major Doubled (BROMAD)  Some partnerships play an extension of Bergen Raises after opener's bid has been doubled. This is called \\"BROMAD\\". There are several schemes, including one which keeps 3 and 3 (as above) and adds 2 and 2 with similar meanings, but with only three-card trump support. Others simply have one raise at each level for 7-10 HCP (with three or four trumps), and use Jordan 2NT with four trumps and 11+ HCP. Bergen himself indicates that different partnerships have different preferences for which suit to use. In all cases, the direct raise shows a 'pre-emptive' three-card raise, limited to 6 HCP.

Gerald Massey finds an analogue to lines 7‚Äì8 in The Faerie Queene, 2.1.20. In 1768, Edward Capell altered line ten by replacing the word \\"loss\\" with the word \\"cross\\". This alteration was followed by Edmond Malone in 1783, and was generally accepted in the 19th and 20th Centuries. More recent editors do not favor this as a speculation that introduces a metaphor of the young man as a Christ figure, something that Shakespeare did not do here or elsewhere; the idea, as it would be portrayed by the young man in the context of this sonnet, does not fit well with Gospel accounts.Shakespeare, William.

Structure Sonnet 35 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has fourteen lines, divided into three quatrains and a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in a type of metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. Line four exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. (35.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Two seemingly unmetrical lines can be explained by the Elizabethan pronunciations auth√≥rizing (line 6) and √°ccessary (line 13).Groves (2013), p. 167. Source and analysis C. Knox Pooler notes that line 4 echoes a simile in The Two Gentlemen of Verona that was derived from Plutarch; Stephen Booth notes several adaptations of proverbs, applied against one another in a manner that tends to reinforce the contradictory emotions of the speaker. Fleay perceived an allusion to Elizabeth in the \\"moon\\" of line 3, and to Southampton in the \\"bud\\" of line 4. The poem is among the better-known and more frequently anthologized of the sonnets. It is commonly regarded as exemplary of Shakespeare's skill at evoking ambivalence and at creating complex personae. L. C. Knights regarded the first quatrain as typically Elizabethan, but praises the phonic and syntactic complexity of the second quatrain. As Booth writes, \\"The facts the poem reports should make the speaker seem admirable in a reader's eyes; the speaker's manner, however, gives conviction to the idea that he is worthy of the contempt he says he deserves\\" (192). Lines 7 and 8 are sometimes seen as a crux, and are universally recognized as ambiguous. Knights notes the potential doubleness of line 7, either \\"I corrupt myself by excusing you\\" or \\"I myself corrupt you more by forgiving you.\\" George Steevens glosses 8: \\"Making the excuse more than proportioned to the offence\\", while Bullen has it \\"Making this excuse: Their sins are more than thine.\\" Both Bullen and Steevens amended the quarto's \\"their\\" to \\"thy,\\" as is now standard practice. Further analysis In Sonnet 35, one of the most apparent points that critics have addressed is the duality of the poem's tone. The first quatrain describes what at first appears to be praise and is followed by the second quatrain, in which the speaker addresses a lover's sin and the corruption of himself as a result. Stephen Booth draws attention to the discrepancies between the first and second quatrains and remedies this discrepancy by explaining the speaker's true purpose in the first quatrain. He says, \\"This sonnet is a variation of Shakespeare's habits of damning with fulsome praise and of making flattering accusations.\\"Engle, Lars (2007). The speaker lists sarcastic praises, which are supposed to be read as if the speaker was recalling these excuses he made for his sinful lover with contempt. Quatrain 2 creates \\"a competition in guilt between the speaker and the beloved.\\" The competition grows with the speaker's attempt to justify his sin of becoming the accomplice by degrading the beloved. This leads to an escalation in quatrain 3, where the speaker declares his inner turmoil. He says, \\"Such civil war is in my love and hate.\\" This conflict within the speaker leads to the couplet, which according to Booth declares the \\"beloved diminished under a new guilt of being the beneficiary of the speaker's ostentatious sacrifice.\\" In summation, Booth's reaction to Sonnet 35 is that \\"the facts the poem reports should make the speaker seem admirable in a reader's eyes; the speaker's manner, however, gives conviction to the idea that he is worthy of the contempt he says he deserves.\\"Atkins, Carl D. (2007). Contrary to Booth's take on the duality of Sonnet 35, Helen Vendler claims the dedoublement is most visible \\"in the violent departure from in quatrain 1 in the knotted language of quatrain 2.\\" Instead of describing the speaker as divided over love and hate, she says that the speaker in quatrain 1 is \\"misguided, and even corrupt, according to the speaker of quatrain 2.\\" She also disagrees with Booth's reading of the couplet. Rather, she related the contrasting voices in the first and second quatrain to a philosophical metaphor for the self. I have corrupted myself is a statement that presupposes a true \\"higher self which has, by a lower self, been corrupted, and which should once again take control. Even the metaphor of the lawsuits implies that one side in each suit is 'lawful' and should win.\\"Vendler, Helen (1997). Vendler brings up another point of criticism, which is the confessional aspect of Sonnet 35. Shakespeare uses the vocabulary of legal confession. In an essay by Katherine Craik she discusses the connection between this sonnet and the early criminal confession. Craik says, \\"the speaker testifies against the unspecified 'trespass' of a 'sweet thief', but simultaneously confesses to playing 'accessory' to the robbery.\\"Craik, Katherine A. (2002). Related article: . The speaker also excuses the beloved's sin, which brought about his \\"wrongful self-incrimination\\" in the sonnet. She concludes, \\"Fault can be transferred in the act of confessing, and judgments are clouded rather than clarified.\\" Her conclusion aligns with Booth's claim that the speaker is an unlikeable one. It also aligns with Vendler's point that either the speaker or the beloved must be wrong. Craik's essay draws the conclusion that the speaker is actually at greater fault than the beloved. Homosexuality in Shakespeare's Sonnet 35 Sonnet 35 deals with the speaker being angry with the young man for an apparent betrayal through infidelity. The apparent homoeroticism between the speaker and the young man has spurred debates about the sexuality of the speaker and consequently Shakespeare himself. There are 3 main points to discuss with this issue: the problem of ambiguity in the writing, the possibility of applying an anachronistic view of love and consequently mistaking these sonnets homoerotic, and finally the implications of Shakespeare's life and homosexual tendencies. ;The ambiguity of the texts Paul Hammond argues the difficulty in pinning down the sexual language lies in the intentional ambiguity. First, one must keep in mind that in the early modern period the death penalty was still in effect for sodomy, so it was extremely important that writers remain vague to protect their own lives. Keeping the language ambiguous enabled multiple interpretations of the writings without the danger of being branded as homosexual.Hammond, Paul. (2002). What is more, the words we would use to describe homosexual behavior is either anachronistic to the time period or it carried different meanings. For example, there is no seventeenth-century equivalent word for homosexual. Additionally, \\"sodomy\\" and \\"sodomite\\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have a radically different meaning than modern perceptions. It is not clear if sodomy even had any specific representation of sexual behavior between men. It could be used for sexual activity between men, women, or either sex and an animal. It can also be used as a rhetorical device to establish the unacceptable foreignness of an enemy. To further confuse things, even the meaning of \\"friend\\" is subject to scrutiny. \\"Friend\\" can be used to greet a complete stranger, it can mean someone of the same sex that is an extremely close friend, and it can even be used to describe a man and a woman in love. In the same respect, lover can be meant to have sexual connotations or just imply a strong platonic friendship. Hammond states, \\"The words 'love', 'lover', and 'friend' in the Sonnets have no single or unambiguous meanings, but are continually being redefined, refelt, reimagined.\\" He also states, \\"Sometimes indications of sexual desire are present not in the form of metaphor or simile, but as a cross-hatching of sexually charged vocabulary across the surface of a poem whose attention seems to lie elsewhere.\\" ;Misinterpretation of love Carl D. Atkins argues that readers are misinterpreting the type of love depicted in the sonnets as homosexual. He believes that we must look at it with an eye that considers the concepts of love in Shakespeare's time. He sees the relationship between the speaker and the young man as a passionate friendship that is more pure than heterosexual relationships and in some cases can even take precedence over marriage. He puts an emphasis in distinguishing between intellectual lover, or love of the mind, and animal love, or love of the body. The sonnets are writing about a pure platonic form of love and modern readers are injecting too much sexual politics into his or her criticism. Atkins sees the sonnets more as a chronicle of underlying emotions experienced by lovers of all kinds whether it is heterosexual, homosexual or passionate friendship: adoration, longing, jealousy, disappointment, grief, reconciliation, and understanding. ;Homosexual implications for Shakespeare's life'' Stephen Booth considers the sonnets in the context of Shakespeare's personal sexuality. First, he discusses the dedication of sonnets 1-126 to \\"Mr. W. H.\\" Booth considers Henry Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton, and William Herbert, third Earl of Pembroke as the best candidates. Both men work with the idea that the sonnets are being addressed to a man of high rank and both were considered to be attractive.Booth, Stephen (1977). However, the dedication remains mostly a mystery. Some theories even point to the dedication being to Shakespeare himself. In regards to the sonnets having a bearing on Shakespeare‚Äôs sexuality, Booth maintains the sonnets are written as a form of fiction. He believes the hermaphroditic sexual innuendos are being overanalyzed and misinterpreted to point towards Shakespeare's own sexuality. In reality, it was commonplace for sexual wordplay to switch between genders. He writes, \\"Moreover, Shakespeare makes overt rhetorical capital from the fact that the conventions he works in and the purpose for which he uses them do not mesh and from the fact that his beloveds are not what the sonnet conventions presume them to be.\\" Booth maintains that sonnets involving wooing a man are in fact an attempt of Shakespeare to exploit the conventions of sonnet writing. Overall, Booth asserts that the sexual undercurrents of the sonnets are of the sonnets and do not say anything about the sexuality of Shakespeare.

Background  While Hutton was growing up, her family lived in several states and spent six years in Taiwan. She was interested in all kinds of natural sciences, and she decided to stay in the fields of math and science.https://ctago.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kate-Hutton.pdf Kate Hutton's biography Hutton was an amateur astronomer in her teens. Hutton received a B.S. in astronomy from Pennsylvania State University in 1971, and an M.S. (1973) and Ph.D. (1976) in astronomy from the University of Maryland, College Park.  Scientific career  After graduating with her Ph.D., Hutton says she found astronomy jobs scarce, so switched careers. She sees astronomy and seismology as similar: \\"Earth is a planet, after all, so it's sort of a matter of looking down rather than looking up.\\" In 1977, she began work at Caltech's seismology lab as a data analyst. She worked her way up to senior seismologist and was in charge of operating Caltech's earthquake measuring program and also conducted research. Hutton's academic research areas in seismology included magnitude measurement, seismotectonics, and the development of the Southern California Seismic Network. Hutton worked on a project to improve the consistency of the ‚Äúearthquake catalog‚Äù, which is a list of over 400,000 southern California quakes recorded since 1932. She also worked on the development of earthquake safety programs, such as the statewide Earthquake Early Warning System, which could provide early notice of an earthquake and mitigate casualties and damage. Hutton retired from Caltech on Jan 30, 2015.  Public outreach  Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, Hutton regularly appeared in the media alone and sometimes with her United States Geological Survey colleague Dr. Lucy Jones to inform the public about recent earthquakes in Southern California and abroad. Hutton was ‚Äúvery successful and highly valued‚Äù at Caltech because of her ability to communicate complex topics clearly and accurately to the public. Hutton was also sought out by international news organizations from Japan, Korea, Sweden, and France for her explanations of earthquakes. According to LA Weekly, \\"Hutton strikes just the right balance between calm and caution\\" in explaining earthquake science to viewers.  Personal  Hutton is a licensed amateur radio (ham radio) operator and has been involved with the Palm Springs Hamfest. She is also the Section Traffic Manager for the Los Angeles Section of the American Radio Relay League, which calls itself \\"the national association for amateur radio.\\" Hutton has been an out lesbian since 1984, and is often listed as a \\"lesbian icon.\\" She gave a tour of the Caltech seismology lab for the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Scientists group and ended up dating the tour group's leader that year. Hutton was the consulting seismologist for the 1990 monster movie Tremors starring Kevin Bacon.

It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the speaker expresses his love towards a young man. History Sonnet 36 is just one of The Sonnets out of 154 that were written. There are 120 sonnets devoted to an unknown young man, twenty-eight sonnets are written to a young lady, and the rest are allegorical.Douglas (1933). p. 17. Sonnet 36 falls in the category of love and beauty along with other sonnets such as 29, 37, and many others according to Claes Schaar.Schaar (1962). p. 187. Structure Sonnet 36 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet, constructed from three quatrains and a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The second line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Although our undivided loves are one: (36.2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Analysis of relationship between speaker and young man Shakespeare most likely wrote the sonnets that were meant for the young man over a four- or five-year period.Hubler (1952). p. 78. There is speculation that the young man Shakespeare is addressing may be named William Hughs or Hews. While Butler raises the question of Shakespeare's homosexuality, other critics such as Wilde refute this claim and maintain Shakespeare had an innocent relationship with the boy. However, no reputable evidence for this theory has been found. Throughout his sonnets, Shakespeare addresses the young man's physical beauty as well as his internal beauty.Douglas (1933). pp. 16-17, 19. In this particular sonnet, Shakespeare admits his love for the young man, but he states that he is not able to publicly acknowledge his love due to the shame that might result. According to Lord Alfred Douglas, there seems to be a contradiction between Sonnet 35 and Sonnet 36, because while he rebukes the young man in the first sonnet, he admits his own guilt in the second.Douglas (1933). pp. 90-91. Butler proposed that the young man in this poem was guilty of some public offense. However, Alfred Douglas believes that line 10 of the poem completely exonerates the young man of such an offense, because Shakespeare admits his own guilt. General analysis Sonnet 36 represents the speaker's acceptance that he and his lover will no longer be able to be together. The two seem to both love each other, but due to some unknown incident (most likely caused by the speaker) they cannot be together. Because of this incident, embarrassment would be brought to both (especially the lover) if they were seen together in public. The message of the sonnet is best summed up when the speaker says, \\"I may not ever-more acknowledge thee, / Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\\" (lines 9-10) implying that the young lover would be shamed if others knew he and the speaker knew each other. =Line by line analysis= Let me confess that we two must be twain, / Although our undivided loves are one: :The speaker admits that the two of them cannot be together (twain = separate or parted) even though their loves are together and seem inseparable.Evans (2006). So shall those blots that do with me remain, / Without thy help, by me be borne alone. :\\"Blots\\" is a vague reference to some disgrace that the reader is unaware of. The speaker has accepted that he must be alone, because he sees no way they can be together. In our two loves there is but one respect, / Though in our lives a separable spite, :When it comes to their compassion there is only one matter: love. But in reality, there is a \\"separable spite\\" that will keep them apart. Which, though it alter not love's sole effect, / Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. :Although this \\"spite\\" cannot change the way the two feel about each other, It can still take away the time they can spend together, which is the most enjoyable part of love. I may not evermore acknowledge thee, / Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, :The speaker is proclaiming that he will no longer acknowledge the young lover in public. This is because he wants to avoid bringing further shame on the object of the poem via guilt by association, contrary to the reference cited. Nor thou with public kindness honour me, / Unless thou take that honour from thy name: :The speaker is advising the young lover to not acknowledge him in public either. Unless the young lover wants to bring dishonor upon himself by further association with the speaker. But do not so; I love thee in such a sort, / As thou being mine, mine is thy good report. :He is reinforcing the command to not acknowledge him and reminding him that he loves him since they are \\"one,\\" if either is dishonored, then both are dishonored. According to Helen Vendler, author of The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, there is a parallel of phrases in the same lines that represent unity and divisions respectively. For example, the phrase, \\"we two\\" is followed by, \\"must be twain\\", meaning must be separate. Also, \\"Our two loves\\" is followed by \\"separable spite\\".Vendler (1997). Criticism =Relationship between sonnet 36 and other sonnets= The location of where Sonnet 36 properly fits in the sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets has been widely debated. Claes Schaar groups the sonnets according to how similar they are. Sonnet 36 is grouped with Sonnet 33 through Sonnet 35. Although there is no apparent connection between Sonnet 36 and 37, there is an apparent link between the topic in 35 and the first line of 36.Schaar (1962) Helen Vendler agrees with Schaar contending that Sonnets 37 and 38 seem to not fit in place between Sonnets 36 and 39. He claims Sonnet 36 and 39 are often linked because they share three sets of rhymes: me/thee, one/alone, and twain/remain. Sonnets 36 and 39 both contain the word \\"undivided\\" and concern a thematic commonality concerning the separation of lovers. Sonnets 37 and 38 are linked with Sonnet 6 in both material and the use of the phrase \\"ten times\\" thus, illustrating discontinuity among the sonnets. Sonnet 36 is also strongly linked with Sonnet 96 in that the rhyming couplet is identical, \\"But do not so, I love thee in such sort, As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\" The theme of depriving oneself of honor for the other is also consistent between the two. These discrepancies with thematic links and common word usage have given legitimacy to the argument that the Sonnets may not be in a finalized order. It is argued that Shakespeare provided room among his clearly written sonnets for some of his earlier and less refined sonnets. Therefore, the order of the sonnets may not be the polished repertoire Shakespeare had intended. =Biblical references= Blackmore Evans suggested that Sonnet 36 was influenced by Ephesians 5:25-33, \\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church‚Äî for we are members of his body. 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' This is a profound mystery‚Äîbut I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\\" Most particularly, verses 31 and 32 that discuss the mystery of the two, husband and wife, becoming \\"one flesh\\" in marriage. This link is most strongly exemplified in the first two lines of Sonnet 36, \\"Let me confess that we two must be twain, Although our undivided loves are one:\\" Stephen Booth adds that Ephesians 5 was a regular source of inspiration for Shakespeare. There is also evidence of Ephesians 5 in Shakespeares, Henry IV, Part 1. Booth suggests that the \\"blots\\" in line 3 of Sonnet 36 may be an allusion to Eph 5:27, \\"...without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish...\\" There is also a parallel in motivation between the speaker's self-sacrifice in accepting separation for his lover's sake and Christ's marriage to the church.Booth (1977). =Other references= Line 12 of Sonnet 36 suggests that Shakespeare may be addressing a person of nobility. The correct address of such a person was, \\"Right honourable\\". Such parallels in dedications can be found in Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. In Music Poeterra recorded a pop ballad version of Sonnet 36 on their album \\"When in Disgrace\\" (2014). Notes References *Atkins, Carl D. (2007).

However, the tone is more complex than in the earlier poems: after the betrayal treated in Sonnets 34‚Äì36, the speaker does not return to a simple celebration. Just as an aged father takes delight in the youthful actions of his son, so I, crippled by fortune, take comfort in your worth and faithfulness. For whether it's beauty, noble birth, wealth, or intelligence, or all of these, or all of these and more, that you possess, I attach my love to it (whatever it is), and as a result I am no longer poor, crippled, or despised. Your mere shadow (present in me) provides such solid reality to me that I am complete with it. I wish whatever is best in you, and if this wish is granted, then I will be extremely happy. Structure Sonnet 37 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet is constructed with three quatrains and a final rhyming couplet. The poem follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and like other Shakespearean sonnets is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. The second line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / To see his active child do deeds of youth, (37.2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Source and analysis The sonnet was at one point a favorite of biographically oriented critics, such as Edward Capell, who saw in the opening lines a reference either to a physical debility or to Shakespeare's son. This interpretation was rejected by Edmond Malone and others; Horace Howard Furness, discussing it in conjunction with the legend that Shakespeare played Adam in As You Like It, calls the supposition \\"monstrous.\\" Edward Dowden notes that lameness is used symbolically (as in Coriolanus 4.7.7) to indicate weakness or contemptibility. George Wyndham and Henry Charles Beeching are among the editors who find other analogues for \\"lame\\" in this metaphorical sense. \\"Dearest\\" (3) is glossed by Gervinus as \\"heartfelt\\", but Malone's gloss \\"most operative\\" is generally accepted. Line 7 has been much discussed. Malone's emendation of \\"their\\" to \\"thy\\" is no longer accepted. George Steevens, finding an analogy in The Rape of Lucrece, glosses it as \\"entitled (ie, ennobled) by these things.\\" Nicolaus Delius has it \\"established in thy gifts, with right of possession.\\" Sidney Lee has \\"ennobled in thee\\", reversing the relationship between beloved and \\"parts.\\" It is commonly agreed that the image is drawn from heraldry. \\"Shadow\\" and \\"substance\\" are drawn from Renaissance Neoplatonism; Stephen Booth notes that the wit of line 10 derives from Shakespeare's reversal of the usual relationship between reality and reflection.

In this poem, as in the others in this part of the sequence, the speaker expresses resentment of his beloved's power over him. Paraphrase Go and take all of my loves, my beloved‚Äîhow would doing so enrich you? It would not give you anything you do not already have. All that I possessed was already yours before you took this. (The second quatrain is obscure and contested.) If, instead of loving me, you love the person I love, I can't blame you, because you are merely taking advantage of my love. (For possible readings of lines 7‚Äì8, see below). Yet I forgive you, even though you steal the little that I have, and even though it is well known that an injury inflicted by a supposed lover is far worse than an insult from an enemy. Oh lustful grace (i.e., the beloved), in whom everything bad is made to look good, even if you kill me with these wrongs against me, I will not be your enemy. Structure Sonnet 40 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, composed of three quatrains followed by a final couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the English sonnet, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. Line four exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more. (40.4) All four lines in the second quatrain have a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest (40.7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. In prose, which syllables receive emphasis within a string of monosyllables can be very open. The following two lines are mis- scanned by reversing every ictus/nonictus (except those on \\"before\\" which are lexically determined): / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; (40.2-3) Although a little awkward, these emphases yield an acceptable prose sense; yet we can be quite sure they were not intended by Shakespeare. The following more likely scansion (which retains one reversal) shows how Shakespeare works with meter to convey meaning: √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; (40.2-3) Source and analysis Commonly viewed as parallel to the situation in Sonnets 133, 134, and 144, the sonnet appears in this light to reflect a situation in which the speaker's beloved has seduced the speaker's mistress. While the seeming specificity of the reference has tantalized biographical critics, it has also been likened (for instance, by Geoffrey Bullough) to the central situation of The Two Gentlemen of Verona. The situation described, if not wholly unique to Shakespeare, is at least highly unusual, as Sidney Lee notes. Parallels have been noted in Petrarch and in Theodore Beza's Poematica, but these are not as implicitly sexual as Shakespeare's poem. Line 5 is glossed by Edward Dowden as \\"If for love of me thou receivest her whom I love\\"; George Wyndham, though, has it \\"If, instead of my love, you take the woman whom I love.\\" Line 8, the next vague line, has received even more varied interpretations. Dowden has it \\"Deceive yourself by an unlawful union while you refuse lawful wedlock\\"; Beeching has it \\"by taking in willfulness my mistress whom you yet do not love\\"; Lee says \\"'What thou refusest is that lascivious indulgence which in reality thou disdainest.\\" C. C. Stopes relates the line to other sonnets written in condemnation of illicit lust. Notes References *Baldwin, T. W. On the Literary Genetics of Shakespeare's Sonnets.

It is a part of the Fair Youth section of the sonnets addressed to an unnamed young man. While the exact date of the composition is unknown, it was originally published in the 1609 Quarto along with the rest of the sonnets. Within the sonnet, the speaker excuses the Fair Youth's amorous activity due to his youth and attractiveness toward women, but also chides him for betraying the speaker by sleeping with his mistress. It is the second in a set of three sonnets (40, 41, 42) that dwell on this betrayal of the speaker. This sonnet is also notable for the textual references made to Shakespeare's other works. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet. Structure Shakespeare's sonnets conform to the English or Shakespearean sonnet form. The form consists of fourteen lines structured as three quatrains and a couplet, rhyming abab cdcd efef gg and written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. While Shakespeare's versification maintains the English sonnet form, Shakespeare often rhetorically alludes to the form of Petrarchan sonnets with an octave (two quatrains) followed by a sestet (six lines), between which a \\"turn\\" or volta occurs, which signals a change in the tone, mood, or stance of the poem. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, (41.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Context This sonnet is closely connected to both sonnets 40 and 42. Sonnet 41 is the middle in a set of three sonnets that centers around the fair youth's transgression against the speaker by seducing his mistress.Vendler, Helen . The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. 1997. President and Fellows of Harvard College. Belknep press of Harvard, Cambridge, Mass. London, England. Pgs. 217-221. In the first of these three sonnets (40) the speaker implies that the loss of his mistress did not hurt him badly, because he did not love her, trying not to blame the youth but blaming him still. Sonnet 41 continues the saga with desperate attempts to excuse the youth's behavior, eventually admitting his hurt. In the last of the three (42) the speaker continues his trend of self-deception exemplified in sonnet 41. Exegesis = Allusions and Textual References = There are many allusions and textual references in this sonnet taken from other Shakespeare works. They have been helpful in understanding the context and creating our \\"modern\\" interpretation of the sonnet.  Allusion 1  Sonnet 41, lines 5-8: \\"Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won; Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed; And when a woman woos, what woman's son Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\\" Line 5 may be explained by a scene in \\"King Henry VI,\\" Part 1. 5.3.78-9 which states: \\"She's beautiful, and therefore to be wooed; She is a woman, therefore to be won.\\" Line 6 may be explained by a line from \\"All's Well that Ends Well,\\" 1.1.126 which states: \\"...Loss of virginity is rational increase,...\\" Lines 7-8 are references to Venus and Adonis in which Adonis refused to make love with the goddess of love, Venus, and therefore he was \\"accidentally\\" killed. Each of these references clarifies lines 5-8 explaining that because this man is so beautiful, he can be won, therefore he is constantly wooed and seduced. If he is to refuse, it would be considered ungracious and ill- natured. His beauty gives him every right to lose his virginity. Allusion 2 Sonnet 41, lines: 10-12: \\"And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\\" These lines can be explained from many sources, touching in on more uses of this language. One source comes from King Henry IV (Part 1) 1.1.84: \\"See riot and dishonour stain the brow.\\" King Henry IV (Part 2) 4.4.62: \\"For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,\\". King Henry IV (Part 2) 5.5.66: \\"Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,\\". King Henry V 1.1.56-58: \\"His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports, And never noted in him any study, Any retirement any sequestration,\\". Each of these references relate to the sonnet as the same idea that this man will never withdraw from his wanton and riotous ways. The beauty of this man sentences him to debauchery and lawless sex which leads him to his \\"twofold truth.\\" The twofold truth that he is breaking is the bond between [my] mistress's fidelity to [me], and his bond to [me]. The young man is never responsible for his actions because he is too beautiful. Each of these references can lead us to convey the question of \\"why was he born so beautiful?.(Katherine Duncan-Jones. \\"Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" Bloomsbury Methuen Drama.) \\" =Quatrain 1= The sonnet begins with the first eight lines an attempt to make excuses for the young man's infidelity. These so-called \\"pretty wrongs\\" are said to occur when the speaker is \\"sometime absent\\" from the youth's heart, meaning when the youth forgets his love for the speaker.

David Alexander states that \\"Sometime\\" suggests that these infidelities do not happen very often, and even then, \\"the blame does not attach to the beloved but to the fact that 'still temptation follows where thou art', one who is young and beautiful is always being tempted,\\"Shakespeare, William, and David Alexander. West. \\"41.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: With a New Commentary. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co, 2007. 140. Print. further excusing the youth from his actions. =Quatrain 2= The second quatrain continues this trend of excuses with subtler wording. \\"Gentle thou art\\" suggests that the youth is of noble birth, and courted by many as a result. Alexander writes that it also suggests that the youth is not \\"rough and uncouth, but kind,\\" and is therefore more likely to attract sexual attention and be too kind to turn it away. Note the proverb used twice by Shakespeare, \\"She's beautiful; and therefore to be Wooed: /She is a Woman; therefore to be Wonne,\\" (Henry VI, 5.3.78-79) and \\"Shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd, /Shee is a woman, therefore may be wonne,\\" (Titus Andronicus, 2.1.83-84) altered slightly in lines 5-6 of the sonnet. Atkins calls lines 5-6 here, \\"An intensified (not 'woo' but assail) and significantly perverse variant on the topic (women) and order (first woo then win) of a popular proverb.\\"Shakespeare, William, and Carl D. Atkins. \\"Sonnet 41.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson UP, 2007. 122. Print. The final excuse for the youth's infidelity is that no man can resist the advances of a woman. Alexander argues that the observation that end the first eight lines of the poem is much more pointed than that. \\"To imply that men cannot be expected to resist women because their mothers were women is such nonsense that it is an excuse which excuses nothing.\\" Most early editors emend the \\"he\\" to \\"she\\" in line eight, with the suggestion by Thomas Tyrwhitt that \\"the lady, and not the man, being in this case supposed the wooer, the poet without doubt wrote...she.\\" However, modern editors follow more in line with Martin Seymour- Smith who notes: \\"The man 'prevails' in the sexual sense...so that the usual emendation 'she' for 'he' is unnecessary and wrong. The woman wants the man to prevail.\\" Regarding lines 7‚Äì8, Duncan-Jones remarks: \\"Though this sounds like an obvious truism, Shakespeare's first published work, (Venus and Adonis), described a 'woman's son', Adonis, who refuses the advances of the goddess of love.\\" =Quatrain 3= The third quatrain begins with the turn in line nine, \\"Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\\" with \\"seat\\" referring to designated area for sexual activity. Here in the sonnet, after many attempts to invent excuses for the youth, he is finally honest about his hurt and can no longer deceive himself. Shakespeare alludes to another of his works here, with the word \\"seat\\" used with the same meaning by the character Iago in Othello, \\"I do suspect the lustful Moor / Hath leap'd into my seat\\" (Othello, 2.1.290-1). Atkins suggests that line 10 is a statement that the youth should forbear even though his beauty and straying youth will lead him \\"in their riot even there.\\" The \\"Who\\" in line eleven marks the same culprit as in line three, Alexander remarks, \\"young blood whom the beloved should have kept under control. Instead he allows them to lead him astray and take him on a rampage into his own home, 'even there' into his estate, his 'seat', breaking two things precious to him, 'a twofold truth,'\\"Shakespeare, William, and David Alexander. West. \\"41.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: With a New Commentary. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co, 2007. 141. Print. with the twofold truth consisting of the mistress's truth, her contract of love with the speaker, and the youth's truth, his contract of love with the speaker, both of which the youth's beauty has led him to break. =Couplet= The couplet contains the final excuse given to the youth for his infidelity. Duncan-Jones remarks that the threefold repetition of \\"thy beauty\\" gives the reprimand in the sestet an effect of \\"exoneration\\" and \\"compliment.\\" The young man is not responsible for his sexual transgressions, as it is a case of \\"Why was he born so beautiful?\\"Shakespeare, William, and Katherine Duncan-Jones. \\"41.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets. London: Methuen Drama, 2010. 192. Print. The speaker lays blame on the youth's beauty, not on his will. It is that beauty which tempts her (the mistress) and is itself false to the speaker. Atkins further comments, \\"Nevertheless, though the blame may be partially laid to his beauty, the friend is still himself 'tempting' and 'being false,' forced to break his trust only because of his lack of forbearance.\\" While in lines 1-8 he attempts to forgive and argue away the youth's offence, the truth is certainly felt in line 9's, \\"Ay me.\\" There can be no doubt about the speaker's final bitterness, and the last four words of the sonnet, \\"being false to me,\\" carry the pain.

It is a part of the Fair Youth section of the sonnets addressed to an unnamed young man. Paraphrase It is not my main ground of complaint that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.(Hammond 59) Structure Sonnet 42 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. This type of sonnet consists of three quatrains followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in a type of poetic metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. Line 10 exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And losing her, my friend hath found that loss; (42.10) The first three lines may be scanned: √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / That thou hast her it is not all my grief, √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) And yet it may be said I loved her dearly; √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, (42.1-3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. In the first and third lines, Shakespeare emphasizes pronouns by putting them in metrically strong positions, encouraging the reader to place contrastive accent on them, thereby emphasizing the antithetical relationships plaguing the Speaker. This technique is common in the Sonnets, and continues through this sonnet. The second line has a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending (one of six in this sonnet). Analyses and criticism Some of the sonnets discuss a love triangle between the speaker, his mistress and a young man. In sonnet 42, this young man is presented as the speaker's 'friend'. The primary objective of this sonnet is to define the speaker's role in the complex relationship between the youth and the mistress. Sonnet 42 is the final set of three sonnets known as the betrayal sonnets (40, 41, 42) that address the fair youth's transgression against the poet: stealing his mistress.(Vendler 217) This offense was referred to in Sonnets 33‚Äì35, most obviously in Sonnet 35, in which the fair youth is called a \\"sweet thief.\\" This same imagery is used again in Sonnet 40, when the speaker says, \\"I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief.\\" Sonnet 41 implies that it is easy for the speaker to forgive the fair youth his betrayal, since it is the mistress that \\"woos,\\" tempted by the fair youth's beauty just as the speaker admires it. This affair is discussed later in sonnet 144-a poem which further suggests that the young man and the dark lady are lovers; \\"‚Ä¶my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side\\".(Greenblatt 1803) In Helen Vendler's The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, it is noted -- \\"By inserting himself somehow as cause or agent of the relation between the young man and the mistress, the speaker preserves a connection with the young man which is the overriding motive of this poem\\".(Vendler, p. 220) The idea that the fair youth and the poet are \\"one\\" is common in the sonnets; for example, it was also asserted in Sonnets 36, 39, and 40. A closer look at Sonnet 36 illustrates this point further, \\"In our two loves there is but one respect\\".(Greenblatt pg. 1766) A possible reason the speaker emphasizes the oneness between himself and the youth is to align himself with the youth as opposed to his mistress. Sonnet 42 uses feminine rhymes at the end of the lines: especially in the second quatrain as a poetic device, similar to sonnet 40.(Hammond, 59) \\"The poem is essentially a sad one‚Ä¶it's sadness heightened by the feminine endings, six in all [out of seven]\\".(Atkins 124) Many critics seem to agree with this reading of the feminine endings, and note that additionally, the author uses two words to imply the emotionality tied up in his sonnet. The word \\"loss\\" is repeated throughout this poem, appearing six times. The repetition of this word emphasizes how strongly the speaker feels that he has been deprived of the two most important relationships in his life: the fair youth and the mistress. The word \\"loss\\" is balanced by the word \\"love,\\" which also appears six times. They appear together in line 4, \\"A loss in love that touches me more nearly,\\" referring to the poet's loss of the fair youth to his former mistress. Again in line 9, the two words are woven into the same line, \\"If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain.\\" These perfectly balanced words emphasize the main point of the sonnet as being about loss of love.(Atkins, 124) The use of the term \\"loving offenders\\" in line 5 can have two meanings: that the offenders (the fair youth and the mistress) are in love; but it can also mean that they seem to enjoy their offense. This line, along with line 12, \\"And both for my sake lay on me this cross,\\" hearken back to Sonnet 34, in which the speaker declares, \\"The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief / To him that bears the strong offence's cross.\\" The biblical allusion of the cross ties the poet himself to Jesus in his suffering so that others might be happy, relieved of their sins.(Hammond 58) Hammond writes that he feels the author was projecting himself as a martyr, a Christ like figure bearing the cross. Hammond reads line 5, \\"loving offenders\\" to mean equally as a vocative or self description; saying, 'it is my nature to love those who offend against me'. It appears that most critics agree that the author himself is accepting the 'cross' in this poem.(Rowse, 87) The exaltation \\"Sweet flattery!\\" at the end of the sonnet indicates sarcasm, since \\"flattery\\" usually indicates dishonest beauty. The speaker makes the argument that since he and the youth are one, they must then share the same woman. Because the mistress and the youth are having an affair, the speaker comes to the logical conclusion that he and the youth are that much closer. Atkins illustrates this, \\"‚Ä¶we are meant to understand‚Ä¶that the flattery exists nowhere outside the poet's imagination\\".(Atkins 124) Notes References * Rowse, A.L.

In 1990 Dutch composer Jurriaan Andriessen set the poem to a mixed chamber choir setting. Rufus Wainwright's \\"Sonnet 43\\", the sixth track on his album All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu (2010), is a musical setting of the sonnet. In 2004 the Flemish composer Ludo CLAESEN set this poem to a setting for chambermusic (flute, piano and soprano-solo).

Background The company was founded by Edward Fredkin in 1962 in Maynard, Massachusetts. It then moved (serially) to Santa Monica, Culver City, and Los Angeles California. Triple-I merged with Autologic, Inc. in 1996, becoming Autologic Information International Inc. (AIII). The combined company was purchased by Agfa-Gevaert in 2001. In the early 1960s, Information International Inc. contributed several articles by Ed Fredkin, Malcolm Pivar, and Elaine Gord, and others, in a major book on the programming language LISP and its applications.Berkeley, Edmund C.; Bobrow, Daniel G. (editors), The Programming Language LISP: Its Operation and Applications, Cambridge : The M.I.T. Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, March 1964. Cf. e.g., Fredkin, Edward, (Information International, Inc.), \\"Techniques Using LISP for Automatically Discovering Interesting Relations in Data\\", and other articles in the book.Norberg, Arthur, \\"Paul W. Abrahams Interview: October 15, 16, and 17, 2007, Deerfield, MA\\", Association for Computing Machinery, Oral History Interviews. Cf. pp.124-125. Quoting: \\"And there were also specific people, Stan Kameny, who also got involved with the LISP project, and the same thing with Clark Weissman. In fact, all three of these people, Bob Saunders was working for III [Information International Inc.] at the time, which is kind of an interesting company, then it got involved with programmable film readers, which is where they got all the money. And then because Ed Fredkin was interested in LISP and things like that, particularly because of his tie-in with Marvin Minsky, they expanded into the LISP II business. And they had a lot of expertise. They had people like me, they had other people who knew LISP who were involved with LISP, and so this gave him quite an in at SDC.\\" Triple-I's commercially successful technology was centered around very high precision CRTs, capable of recording to film; which for a while were the publishing industry's gold standard for digital-to-film applications. The company also manufactured film scanners using special cameras fitted with photomultiplier tubes as the image sensor, for digitzing existing films and paper documents. One such successful product of theirs using their precision CRT technology was their FR-80 film recorder introduced in 1968. It was capable of recording black and white (and later color as an option) digital imagery to motion picture or still transparency film at a maximum resolution of 16384x16384, making it an ideal system for generating either Computer Output Microfilm (COM), computer-to-film negatives for making printing plates, and other computer-generated graphics. However, Triple-I is most notable for its commercially unsuccessful ventures; a number of one-or-two of a kind systems which included CRT based computer displays used at the Stanford AI Lab, an OCR system based on PDP-10's (two were sold), and The Super Foonly F-1 - which was used for movie special effects. OCR Systems Triple-I had a very ambitious OCR group which used their core film scanning technology, graphic displays, and a custom binary image processor (BIP); all interfaced to a PDP-10 timesharing computer with much custom software. Although it was continuously under development over a period of over ten years, only two actual systems were ever sold. The first (circa 1974) was a paper-to-digital-to-paper system for reworking U.S. Navy aircraft maintenance manuals, which involved filming and scanning paper manuals, capturing the many diagrams in digital form, and reading the accompanying text. The second was a hand-print recognition system sold to the British DHSS in 1976A feasibility test of the Grafix I optical character recognition system, USAF 1976, p79, which captured data from benefit forms. While none of the OCR research had any lasting impact, the use of PDP-10's directly enabled Triple-I's involvement with computer animation. Computer animation Triple-I's work in computer animation done by the Motion Pictures Product Group, is probably the most notable first from Triple-I, at least if measured by the eventual success of the technology. They created some of the first computer-generated special effects for major motion pictures, and employed a number of computer graphics pioneers. Computer animators Gary Demos and John Whitney, Jr. began using equipment at Triple-I in the early 1970s for animation, including the first use of computer imaging in a feature film -- the \\"android vision\\" effect in Westworld. In 1974, Demos and Whitney convinced Triple-I to establish the Motion Pictures Product Group. In 1976, they scanned and animated Peter Fonda's head for Futureworld, the first appearance of 3D computer graphics in a film. They created an early demo animation called \\"Adam Powers, The Juggler\\"; this animation was later used in Miramar's short film All Shapes and Sizes as well as referenced by Pixar's short film Red's Dream. They were also responsible for effects in the film Looker, and animation tests for films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars. Circa 1976, prior to becoming an artist-in-residence at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, pioneering computer artist David Em spent nights at Triple-I for eighteen months, learning to use their systems and create his first 3D, shaded, digital imagery. When Disney began production of the film Tron, they hired four companies to create the computer graphics -- Triple-I, MAGI, Robert Abel and Associates, and Digital Effects. Triple-I and MAGI were responsible for the majority of the roughly thirty minutes of computer animation. Triple-I created the Master Control Program, the Solar Sailer, and Sark's Carrier. Whitney and Demos left before the end of work on Tron, to found Digital Productions. Partly due to their departure, Triple-I was unable to complete as much of the effects as planned, and MAGI took over some of the work. Triple-I sponsored the construction of the Super Foonly F-1, the fastest PDP-10 ever made. Jim Blinn, Frank Crow, and others developed the company's rendering software TRANEW for the Foonly. Craig Reynolds created the Actor/Scriptor Animation System (ASAS), a procedural animation language based on LISP, at the MIT Architecture Machine Group, and then at Triple-I integrated it into their Digital Scene Simulation System. Larry Malone developed 3D modeling software for the Tektronix 4014 display. Tom McMahon developed a memory-mapped thousand line RGB framebuffer for the Foonly, one of the earliest framebuffers in that class. In 1982, the management of Triple-I decided to shut down the Motion Pictures Product Group. Electronic pre-press Triple-I was also heavily involved in electronic pre-press systems. Its Automated Illustrated Documentation System, or AIDS, produced technical documents, initially for the aerospace industry. The company manufactured a variety of output devices that could create entire pages with graphic to Microfiche, 16 or 35mm films or truesize film. Later this technology was adopted by Time and Newsweek magazines. In 1982, this technology produced another first for Triple-I when the Pasadena Star-News became the first newspaper to produce full pages electronically, a process of pagination that is now universal among large dailies worldwide.

It is Cleary's second published book, following Henry Huggins. This humorous realistic fiction story tells the adventures of young Ellen and the new girl in her school, Austine Allen. Plot Third-grader Ellen Tebbits lives with her parents on Tillamook Street in Portland, Oregon. The book opens when Ellen heads to her dance class at the studio run by the mother of a classmate, Otis Spofford, who is always teasing her. When she arrives, she heads to change in a broom closet so the other girls cannot see her terrible secret: Ellen is wearing woolen underwear. After class, she accidentally walks in on a new girl in class, Austine Allen, who's also wearing the dreaded underwear. Soon, the two become best friends. Other chapters in the book deal with Ellen's first- ever time going horseback riding, her efforts to bring a giant beet to school for show-and-tell, and Ellen and Austine's efforts to put up with the obnoxious Otis' antics. During summer vacation, Ellen and Austine decide to dress as twins on their first day back to school. The plan is for their mothers to make identical dresses for them. Austine's mother, however, cannot sew, so her dress doesn't turn out well. As the day goes on Austine begins to amuse herself by tugging on the sash of Ellen's dress. Ellen gets irritated and finally slaps Austine in the lunch line when her sash comes undone. Unfortunately, Austine was innocent; Otis had pulled on her dress. Austine begins spending time with other girls and ignores Ellen, who thinks everyone looks down on her for slapping her best friend. In the final chapter, the teacher chooses Ellen and Austine to go outside and clean the chalkboard erasers. Austine continues to ignore Ellen, who becomes so angered by this that she yanks on the sash on Austine's dress and rips it. Both girls end up in tears and, after learning that Otis was the culprit in the lunch line and that both of their mothers made them wear their dreaded woolen underwear that day, they mend their friendship.

It is the seat of the local government area of the City of Stonnington. The Second Empire and Italianate style Victorian era building is located on the northeast corner of Glenferrie Road and High Street, in Malvern.  History  Planning for a Shire Hall in the Gardiner Road District commenced as early as 1867. In 1878 land at the corner of High Street and Glenferrie Road was reserved for a Shire Hall, Court House and Library. Two years later, the estimated cost of erecting a building comprising a Shire Hall, Municipal, Post and Telegraph Offices, Library and Reading Room was ¬£4,000. The Council considered the Shire could not afford to pay such a sum, and the members were against borrowing the money. In August, 1884, the proposal was again considered, and in November, the Council decided to float a loan of ¬£5,000 for the purpose of building a Shire Hall. A Shire Hall Committee was formed and submitted a proposal to Council which included a hall capable of holding 400 people, Court House, rooms for a Magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions, Shire Secretary, a Public Reading Room and Library. Plans drawn up by Architects Wilson and Beswicke were accepted by Council and the total cost of the new building was ¬£8,651. The foundation stone of the Malvern Shire Hall was laid by the Hon. Alfred Deakin, the Minister of Public Works, on 22 September 1885. The Councillors and a representative gathering of residents watched the ceremony. A casket, containing copies of Melbourne newspapers of the day was deposited in a cavity beneath the foundation stone. Shire President, Councillor Robert G Benson invited all those present to a luncheon in a marquee on the adjacent Malvern Cricket Ground. A large number of residents and ratepayers of the Shire of Malvern assembled to witness the opening ceremony on Monday afternoon, 26 July 1886. The Shire President, Councillor Benson showed those present the new building and assembled the crowd in the Council Chamber for a toast to the Queen and the citizens of the Shire of Malvern. In the evening Councillor Benson presided over a civic banquet in the Main Hall. In August that year, the Councillors presented Councillor Benson with a gold medal \\"commemorating the opening of the new public offices, and a small token of esteem in which he, the President, is held by the members of the Council.\\" Additions to the Shire Hall in 1890, included a second tower and an extended Glenferrie Road facade. A brass plaque at the base of the main tower commemorates the presentation of the clock in 1891 by Shire President, Councillor Alex McKinley. In 1926, alterations to the design of Architects Hudson and Wardrop, were carried out on the municipal wing, containing public offices, Council Chamber, and Mayoral rooms. The first Council meeting was held in the new Council Chamber on 5 April 1927 and four months later the renovated Ballroom (with gallery), new Supper Room and Cocktail Lounge, front Portico and extended south wing were completed. A brass plaque at the head of the main stairs commemorates this renovation. The first official function held in the renovated City Hall was a Mayoral Ball given by the Mayor and Mayoress Councillor William Turnbull, and Mrs. Turnbull, on 28 July 1927. At a Civic Dinner, His Excellency the State Governor, Lord Somers, opened the hall and congratulated the citizens of Malvern on their possession of such a handsome civic building. In 1996 the City of Stonnington completed major renovations to the building.  Architecture  Heritage Victoria describes the Malvern Town Hall as aesthetically and historically significant. It is an extraordinary and essentially intact example of a building of its type, having two towers. The building demonstrates a changing sequence of styles from the Late Victorian Boom period to interwar Adamesque. The use of marble and terrazzo in the foyers and the plaster Adamesque ornamentation in the hall is of note. The Malvern Town Hall is a large and imposing Late Victorian Italianate style building with a symmetrical facade to Glenferrie Road and projecting two storey portico. The two tower roofs are in the French Second Empire style with fish scale slates, circular vents, elaborate leadwork and cast iron walks. A terrazzo floor, marble walls and central marble staircase, feature in the foyer which leads to the upper cocktail lounge which has a similar elaborate, coffered ceiling. Also of interest in the foyer is the War Memorial designed by Paul Montford and the statue of Psyche and Cupid. The Main Hall has a vaulted ceiling and pendant lighting from the period. Swags and urns decorate the curved sides of the vaults. The stage and rear gallery both feature cast plaster with City of Malvern crests. The Compton Pipe Theatre Organ was installed in 1992, having been acquired from the Piccadilly Cinema in Birmingham, England. The Council Chamber with its tiered gallery and vaulted ceiling remains essentially intact. The Queensland Maple timber furnishings and panelled dado are original. An ornamental cast plaster ceiling is a feature of the Banquet Hall.  Name Change  After the amalgamation of the City of Malvern with the City of Prahran in 1994 to form the new City of Stonnington, the Town Hall was renamed the Stonnington City Centre and became the corporate headquarters of the new Stonnington City Council. In 2015, the corporate headquarters of the Stonnington City Council was relocated to the new Stonnington City Centre, across the road at 311 Glenferrie Road, and the Malvern Town Hall reverted to its original name.  Present functions  Malvern Town Hall can be hired for a variety of community and commercial events such as festivals, markets, music and fairs.

The Hamilton Tiger-Cats defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 22-16. Weather conditions and change in punting rule Because of strong winds of up , CFL officials, in agreement with both head coaches, Bud Grant for Winnipeg and Ralph Sazio for Hamilton, changed a punting rule prior to the game, perhaps unprecedented in CFL if not in football history. Instead of all punts having to be being returned without the fair catch rule as is standard in Canadian football, punts into the wind would be ruled dead as soon as the returner touched the ball, a sort of forced fair catch rule, the rule being voluntary in the American football. Without the rule change, it was thought that the team going against the wind would lose the viable option of punting and be forced instead to try to convert on third downs all the time. Key elements in the game A strong wind prevailed throughout the game, and all scoring occurred while the team who received the points was going with the wind. To retain possession of the ball, the Blue Bombers conceded one safety touch in the first quarter and two in the third quarter while struggling against the wind. In the fourth quarter with the wind at their backs, the Bombers began a last-minute drive, snuffed out when fullback Art Perkins was stopped cold by the Hamilton defence on a third-and-one gamble. The Bombers lost by 6 points, the margin of three yielded safeties. They would return to the Grey Cup game only 19 years later, the 72nd Grey Cup in 1984.

History Established February 3, 1925 it is named in the honor of David B. Oliver, President of Pittsburgh Public Schools from 1911‚Äì1922. Oliver was largely responsible for the increase in the number and size of Pittsburgh Public Schools. The school sits on land that once was a landfill and is one of ten high schools in the Pittsburgh Public Schools area. The school colors are orange and seal brown, also in reference to Oliver's name (David Brown Oliver). The school's newspaper has run an advice column \\"Dear Moppet\\" since the 1920s. The school's alma mater, written in 1925, originally had as many as seven verses which can be found in several copies of the \\"Omicron\\" (the school year book) from the 1970s. Today, however, only one verse is widely known and is sung each day during morning announcements. The school is home to the Zeta Rho Chapter of the National Honor Society. The school's original motto 'On, Sail On!' was changed to \\"Believe, Achieve, Succeed!\\" The school serves primarily as a neighborhood school for the surrounding North Side area, and also attracts non-local students to its magnet programs, JROTC and Law and Public Service. Oliver offers all academic programs at the Gifted, Scholars, Advanced Placement and standard academic levels. Oliver offers eight Applied Technology and Career Development Programs for students interested in vocational training. On November 23, 2011, the Pittsburgh Board of Education approved a facility reform plan that would close Oliver as an active city high school for the 2012-13 school year.

Sapolsky. The book proclaims itself as a \\"Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping\\" on the front cover of its third and most recent edition. The title derives from Sapolsky's idea that for animals such as zebras, stress is generally episodic (e.g., running away from a lion), while for humans, stress is often chronic (e.g., worrying about losing your job). Therefore, many wild animals are less susceptible than humans to chronic stress-related disorders such as ulcers, hypertension, decreased neurogenesis and increased hippocampal neuronal atrophy. However, chronic stress occurs in some social primates (Sapolsky studies baboons) for individuals on the lower side of the social dominance hierarchy. Sapolsky focuses on the effects of glucocorticoids on the human body, stating that such hormones may be useful to animals in the wild escaping their predators, (see Fight-or-flight response) but the effects on humans, when secreted at high quantities or over long periods of time, are much less desirable. Sapolsky relates the history of endocrinology, how the field reacted at times of discovery, and how it has changed through the years. While most of the book focuses on the biological machinery of the body, the last chapter of the book focuses on self-help. Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers explains how social phenomena such as child abuse and the chronic stress of poverty affect biological stress, leading to increased risk of disease and disability.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1961 to 1972 for the Chicago White Sox and Oakland Athletics. In references, he is called Joe Horlen or Joel Horlen with roughly equal frequency. From 1964-68, Horlen led all American League pitchers with a 2.32 ERA.The lost memories of Joe Horlen - San Antonio Express-News In his career, Horlen won 116 games against 117 losses, with a 3.11 earned run average and 1,065 strikeouts in 2,002 innings pitched. He is the only baseball player to play for teams that won a Pony League World Series (1952), a College World Series (Oklahoma State-1959), and a Major League World Series (Oakland-1972). Early and personal life Horlen was born in San Antonio, Texas.Joe Horlen Stats  Baseball- Reference.com He attended Luther Burbank High School, in San Antonio. Horlen is a convert to Judaism.The Big Book of Jewish Sports People, by Peter Horvitz, page 53The Big Book of Jewish Baseball - Peter S. Horvitz, Joachim Horvitz - Google Books College Horlen was a star pitcher at Oklahoma State University. He was named to the American Baseball Coaches Association All- America second team, as he helped lead Oklahoma State to the College World Series in 1959. Minor league career Horlen was signed by the Chicago White Sox in . That year he pitched for the Lincoln Chiefs.Joe Horlen Minor Leagues Statistics & History  Baseball-Reference.com The next season he pitched in Class A for the Charleston White Sox, and was 7-5 with a 2.93 ERA. He began 1961 pitching for the AAA San Diego Padres, for whom he was 12-9 with a 2.51 ERA. Major league career =Chicago White Sox (1961‚Äì71)= He made his Major League debut against the Minnesota Twins in the second game of a September 4, doubleheader. He won the game in relief while wearing a numberless uniform ‚Äî- as the only available road uniform did not have a number. Horlen pitched as a spot starter in his first two full seasons with the White Sox. In 1963, he returned to the minors to pitch four games for the AAA Indianapolis Indians, going 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. In he earned a spot in the starting rotation, posting a 13‚Äì9 record and setting career bests in earned run average (1.88; 2nd in the American League only to Dean Chance's 1.65) and strikeouts (138). He also led the majors by allowing only 6.07 hits per 9 innings, bettering Sandy Koufax's National League-leading 6.22. In the next 42 years, only 8 right-handed pitchers bettered that ratio in a season. He also led the AL in Walks + Hits per IP (WHIP) (.935). That year his White Sox battled the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles for the pennant, but finished second, one game behind the Yankees and one game ahead of the Orioles. In 1965 he was 2nd in the league in shutouts (4), and was 3rd in walks/9 IP (1.60). In 1966 he led the league in wild pitches (14), was 6th in hit batsmen (6), and was 2nd in ERA (2.43). Horlen's best season was in ; he finished 19‚Äì7 and led American League pitchers with a 2.06 ERA and 6 shutouts, was 2nd in W-L percentage (.731), 4th in wins, complete games (13), and walks/9 IP (2.02), and 7th in innings pitched (258). He also led the AL in Walks + Hits per IP (WHIP) (.953). He was named to the American League All- Star team for the only time in his career, but did not pitch in the game. The highlight of Horlen's season was a clutch performance on September 10 as the White Sox were involved in a four-way pennant race with the Twins, Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers; he no-hit the Tigers in the first game of a doubleheader at Comiskey Park. Not until the Tigers' Jack Morris no-hit the White Sox in would another no-hitter be pitched in a White Sox home game, and the next no-hitter by a White Sox in a White Sox home game wouldn't be pitched until , by Mark Buehrle at U.S. Cellular Field. Horlen recorded victories in his next three starts, the next one coming five days later against the Twins. However, on September 27, which would be known by White Sox fans as \\"Black Wednesday\\", the lowly Kansas City Athletics swept a doubleheader from the White Sox and effectively eliminated Eddie Stanky's \\"Hitless Wonders\\" (the White Sox led the Majors with a 2.45 earned run average but also posted a .225 batting average, with no regular batting above .250) from pennant contention. Horlen lost the second game, with 21-year-old Catfish Hunter shutting out the White Sox 4‚Äì0. The two games were the last played by the Athletics in Kansas City; they moved to Oakland for the start of the season. The White Sox finished fourth, three games behind the Red Sox who, after finishing next to last in , won the pennant on the final day, finishing one game ahead of the Twins and Tigers. Horlen finished runner-up to Jim Lonborg, the star of the Red Sox staff, in the American League Cy Young Award balloting, and 4th in MVP voting, won by another Red Sox, Carl Yastrzemski. In 1968 he led the AL in hit batsmen (14). In 1970 he was 5th in walks/9 IP (2.14). In spring training of , two weeks after voting unanimously in favor of a strike, the White Sox released Horlen, who had been the Sox‚Äô player representative. =Oakland Athletics (1972)= He later signed with Oakland, and pitched mostly in relief as the Athletics won the World Series ‚Äî the first World Series title for the franchise since the Philadelphia Athletics in 1930. After the major leagues In 1973 he pitched for the AA San Antonio Brewers, going 6-1 with a 2.87 ERA. In 1989, Horlen played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association. In 2004, he was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame. As of 2017, he was suffering from Alzheimers.

Vinogradova (1929‚Äì2001) was a specialist in Russian cognitive neuroscience. In 1969 she founded the Laboratory of Systemic Organization of Neurons in the Institute of Biological Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (Pushchino) and headed this Laboratory till the end of her life. From the early days of her scientific career, Prof. Vinogradova was fortunate to work with prominent neuropsychologist and neuroscientists. She studied psychology under the supervision of Prof. Alexander Luria, investigated psychophysiology of the orienting reflex with Prof. Evgeny Sokolov, and learned electrophysiology from Prof. Jan Bures. On the basis of extracellular unit recording from the hippocampus and other relevant structures in awake animals during sensory and electrical stimulation, she developed a hypothesis of information processing in the limbic system. She concluded that the hippocampus is at the core of orienting reflex and works as a comparator determining whether information should be stored in memory (if it is new) or ignored (if it is old). These ideas were developed in her books Orienting Reflex and Its Neurophysiological Mechanisms (Moskva, 1962) and Hippocampus and Memory (Nauka, 1975), and later published in English as a chapter of the book Hippocampus (Plenum Press, 1984) and the review Hippocampus as a comparator system (Hippocampus, 2001, v. 11:578-98). A significant part of Prof. Vinogradova‚Äôs scientific career was devoted to the analysis of the role of theta rhythm in hippocampal function. She and her co- workers presented evidence that the ability to generate the theta-rhythm is an intrinsic property of the medial septum nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (Progr. Neurobiol. 1995, v.37: 523-83). Prof. Vinogradova contributed extensive time and effort to support of international relations of Soviet and Russian neuroscience. In 1958 she was a member of the Organizing Committee of the Moscow Symposium of Neurobiology to which Western neuroscientists were invited to the Soviet Union for the first time. This Symposium could be considered the beginning of collaborative relations between neuroscientists from the Soviet Union and other countries. Prof. Vinogradova was an internationally influential neuroscientist. In 1979 she received the Kenneth Craik award from St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge (UK), for contributions to the understanding of hippocampal functions. She was a member of IBRO since its foundation and a member of the European Science Foundation and a member of the editorial board of several scientific journals. She was invited as lecturer to scientific institutions worldwide. ''' Main publications #Vinogradova O.S. Registration of information and the limbic system // In G. Horn and R.A. Hinde (Eds.)

The Hamilton Tiger-Cats defeated the BC Lions 21-10, in front of 36,545 spectators. The game is best remembered for a controversial sequence involving American players Angelo Mosca and Willie Fleming. Mosca was accused of kicking Fleming's head while the latter laid on the field. Fleming left the game, leading to a long-standing grudge between alumni of both teams. In 2011, Mosca and former Lions quarterback Joe Kapp had a physical altercation regarding the play at a CFL Alumni Association charity luncheon. After both players traded words, event host Ron James invited both players to make a peace gesture. Kapp jokingly presented Mosca with an ornament flower he had picked at his table. When Mosca emphatically refused it, Kapp tried to shove it in his face. Mosca swung his cane at Kapp in retaliation, hitting him in the head. An irate Kapp then knocked Mosca down to the floor with a pair of punches and kicked him, before turning to the stunned attendance and shouting \\"Sportsmanship! That's what it's all about folks, sportsmanship.\\" The event was captured on video by one of the attendees and became the object of significant media attention, in particular because of the 48-year gap between the original play and the altercation that stemmed from it. At the time of the incident, Kapp and Mosca were both 73. Monday Night Football aired the fight footage in a pre-game segment, and Mosca appeared on Dr. Phil to discuss the feud. Kapp emphatically declined to appear. The cane used by Mosca in the fight was auctioned for charity in 2012, and sold for CDN$7,700. Because of Mosca's second career as a professional wrestler for such promotions as NWA Georgia and the then-WWF, it has been suggested that the confrontation may have been staged as a publicity stunt for Mosca's upcoming biography Tell It To My Face. However, these claims remain unsubstantiated.

The hill played an important role in the early development of tourism in Valkenburg. Today, several major tourist attractions are situated on or nearby Cauberg. The hill's fame is mainly due to the many cycling races and championships that were held here. The length of the climb is around 1200 m, with a maximum grade of 12%. History The first part of the word Cauberg may be derived from the Celtic word kadeir, meaning 'height' or 'hill'. Berg is a Germanic word meaning 'hill' or 'mount' as well. Perhaps the family names 'Cauberghs' and 'Van Caldenborgh' are related to Cauberg. Previously the name of the hill was also spelled 'Couberg'. Although the road via Cauberg formed the shortest connection between Valkenburg and Maastricht, in former ages most unmotorized traffic due to the steepness of the hill followed the longer but much more level route along the Geul river. The road was paved with cobblestones only in 1934; in 1969 the cobblestone surface was replaced by asphalt. On 29 September 1954 a serious accident happened on Cauberg when the driver of a Belgian coach lost control over his vehicle after a malfunction of the brakes. The coach, which had a group of miners from the Li√®ge area on board, who had been on an outing to Valkenburg zoo, rushed down the hill, crashed into a limestone monument at the bottom of the hill and then drove into the gable of a hotel on Grendelplein. 18 passengers and a bystander lost their lives. In the 19th century Valkenburg developed as an early tourist destination in the Netherlands. Cauberg, with its limestone quarries, played an important role in this. Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers, who lived in Valkenburg for some years, helped design Rotspark ('Rocky Park') on the northeastern slope of Cauberg, which featured a viewing tower (1898, demolished) and an open-air theater (1916). After the Second World War a zoo and an 'aquarium grotto' were added to this. In the 1960s and 70s, Valkenburg became very popular with teenage tourists. On top of Cauberg, Europacamping became one of the largest camping sites in the country, with mostly youthful campers. Nearby on Cauberg was a racing circuit for kart racing (skelterbaan). The area was redeveloped in the 1980s and now features a holiday village, a spa center and a casino. Sights Landal holiday village The foot of Cauberg hill is situated almost in the center of Valkenburg, outside the medieval city gate of Grendelpoort. At the bottom of the hill is one of Valkenburg's main visitor attractions, Gemeentegrot, an abandoned chalk quarry offering guided tours through a labyrinth of man-made caves which include an underground lake, limestone sculptures of prehistoric animals and charcoal drawings depicting local history scenes. Higher up the hill is a Lourdes grotto, a 1926 copy of the original grotto at Lourdes with an open air chapel. Only a few yards further up the hill stands a memorial chapel with a carillon, commemorating the Limburgian members of the Dutch resistance that were killed during World War II. Here the underground fighters Sjeng (John) Coenen and Joep (Joe) Francotte were murdered on 5 September 1944, just before the liberation of Valkenburg.Resistance in Valkenburg during World War II.. (Website) Opposite lies a leafy hill cemetery, that features terraced graves, unique in the Netherlands, as well as a Gothic revival graveyard chapel and some limestone mausoleums, one of which was designed by Pierre Cuypers. Halfway up the hill is situated Thermae 2000, a spa facility in a pyramidal building that opened in 1989. On the other side of the road, amidst an extension of Rotspark, is a branch of Holland Casino in a modern building with an imposing view of the town and the Geul valley. On top of the hill, close to the village of Vilt, is a Landal holiday village, built in a postmodern style to resemble a typical Limburg village, as well as a castle site.

To some extent, such an arrangement can be considered to be similar to asymmetric federalism. Description A federacy is a form of government with features of both a federation and unitary state. In a federacy, at least one of the constituent parts of the state is autonomous, while the other constituent parts are either not autonomous or comparatively less autonomous. An example of such an arrangement is Finland, where √Öland, which has the status of autonomous province, has considerably more autonomy than the other provinces. The autonomous constituent part enjoys a degree of independence as though it was part of federation, while the other constituent parts are as independent as subunits in a unitary state. This autonomy is guaranteed in the country's constitution. The autonomous subunits are often former colonial possessions or are home to a different ethnic group from the rest of the country. These autonomous subunits often have a special status in international relations. Federacies Several states are federacies. The exact autonomy of the subunits differs from country to country. =Antigua and Barbuda= Barbuda is autonomous within Antigua and Barbuda. =Australia and Norfolk Island= Norfolk Island self-government was revoked by the Australian Federal Government in 2015. Its laws were subsumed into the laws of the Australian federal government and be subordinate to them. On 1 July 2016, the federal government increased federal regulations so that federal laws would also apply to Norfolk Island and to make it semi-autonomous. Since then, opposition by several organizations have protested these action to the United Nations to include the island on its list of \\"non-self-governing territories\\". =Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan= Nakhchivan is an autonomous part of Azerbaijan. =Fiji and Rotuma= Rotuma has the status of dependency in Fiji. =Finland and √Öland= The archipelago of √Öland is a region of Finland, but compared to the other regions, it enjoys a high degree of home rule. Extensive autonomy was granted to it in the Act on the Autonomy of √Öland of 1920 (last revised 1991), and the autonomy was affirmed by a League of Nations decision in 1921. The Parliament of √Öland (Lagtinget) handles duties that in other provinces are exercised by state provincial offices of the central government. √Öland sends one representative to the Finnish parliament, and is a member of the Nordic Council. It is demilitarised, and the population is exempt from conscription. √Öland has issued its own postage stamps since 1984, and runs its own police force. Most of √Öland's inhabitants speak Swedish as their first language (91.2% in 2007). √Öland's autonomous status was a result of disputes between Sweden and Imperial Russia in 1809, and between Finland and Sweden 1917‚Äì1921. =France and its overseas lands= The French Republic is divided into 18 r√©gions, 13 of which are in metropolitan France (Corsica, one of these, is strictly speaking not a ', but is often counted as such). Five of the ' are ' (overseas regions). France also has five collectivit√©s d'outre- mer, one territoire d'outre-mer, and one collectivit√© sui generis. All are integral parts of France and subject to French law, but New Caledonia (the '), and French Polynesia (one of the five ', but with the designation of pays d'outre-mer) have considerably more autonomy. All except the uninhabited French Southern and Antarctic Lands are represented in the French parliament. Defence and diplomatic affairs are responsibilities of France, but they do participate in some organisations directly. R√©union, for example, is a member of the Indian Ocean Commission. In addition, France has the remote Clipperton Island in the Pacific under direct authority of the Minister of Overseas France. French overseas territories were in the past colonial possessions. =Iraq and Kurdistan= Arab Iraq and the Kurdistan Region have de jure full sovereignty over internal matters for their respective regions. The agreement was upheld in the country's 2005 constitution. =Kashmir and India/Pakistan= After independence from British rule, princely states of British India were given the choice to opt for either India or Pakistan. The Kashmir state was ruled by a Hindu king Maharaja Hari Singh but the majority of its population was Muslim. According to Burton Stein's History of India, :\\"Kashmir was neither as large nor as old an independent state as Hyderabad; it had been created rather off-handedly by the British after the first defeat of the Sikhs in 1846, as a reward to a former official who had sided with the British. The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14‚Äì15 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pathan tribesman launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to sway its ruler into their favour and became fugitive leader. Instead the Maharaja appealed to MountbattenViscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India. for assistance, and the governor- general agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.\\"Stein, Burton. 2010. A History of India. Oxford University Press. 432 pages. . Page 358. Currently, the region is divided amongst three countries in a territorial dispute: Pakistan controls the northwest portion (Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir), India controls the central and southern portion (Jammu and Kashmir) and Ladakh, and the People's Republic of China controls the northeastern portion (Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract). India controls the majority of the Siachen Glacier area including the Saltoro Ridge passes, whilst Pakistan controls the lower territory just southwest of the Saltoro Ridge. India controls of the disputed territory; Pakistan ; and the PRC, the remaining . = Mauritius and Rodrigues = On 20 November 2001, the Mauritius National Assembly unanimously adopted two laws giving Rodrigues its autonomy, creating a decentralised government system. This new legislation has allowed the implementation of a regional assembly in Rodrigues constituting 18 members and an executive council headed by a Chief Commissioner. The council meets every week to make decisions, draw up laws and manage the budget. The Chief Commissioner has the main task of informing the Mauritian Prime Minister of the management of the island's concerns. =Moldova and Gagauzia= In 1994 Gagauzia, a territory in the southern part of the Republic of Moldova inhabited by the Gagauz people, an ethnic group distinct from the majority Moldovans, was given autonomy including \\"the right of external self- determination\\". This is in contrast to the other subdivisions of Moldova (raioane) which are county-level administrative areas with little autonomy. However, the eastern part of Moldova is an internationally unrecognized breakaway republic (Transnistria) which is de facto self-governing. =Netherlands, Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten= The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of four autonomous countries, linked by the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands as constituent parts: the Netherlands, an autonomous, independent country, and Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten, three separate, non-independent, autonomous countries. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten formerly made up the Netherlands Antilles, which was a colony of the Netherlands until 1954. Aruba reached an agreement on decolonization with the Kingdom of the Netherlands following a referendum held in 1977, and became autonomous and separate from the Antilles, with a status aparte: meaning the status of an autonomous country with its full autonomous country status officially recognized in the Charter since 1986. The Charter links the four separate autonomous countries. The three countries Aruba, Cura√ßao, and St.Maarten don't have statehood but do have Dutch nationality and passport in common with the Netherlands. All four countries, including the State of the Netherlands, have separate constitutions, governments and parliaments, but Aruba alone has its own national currency and Central Bank. The Council of Ministers of the Kingdom as a whole consists de facto of the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands together with three ministers plenipotentiary, one nominated by each of the other countries. The legislature of the Kingdom consists of the parliament of the Netherlands. De facto the cabinet and the parliament of the Netherlands are responsible for the administration of the dependencies Aruba, Cura√ßao and St. Maarten besides being responsible for the Dutch government. There is limited participation of politicians of the other countries. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten share a Common Court of Appeals; the Dutch Hoge Raad (\\"High Council\\") acts as their supreme court. Dutch nationals related to these territories are fully European citizens; however, Dutch-Caribbean citizens residing in Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten are normally not entitled to vote in Dutch elections, but can vote in elections for the European Parliament. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten are overseas countries and territories (OCTs), listed under Annex II of the EC Treaty. Hence EC law does not apply there. The Netherlands Antilles was scheduled to be dissolved as a unified political entity on 15 December 2008, so that the five constituent islands would attain new constitutional statuses within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but this dissolution was postponed until 10 October 2010. Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten gained autonomy as non-independent countries within the Kingdom, like Aruba did in 1986, and the three remaining islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became special municipalities of the Netherlands itself.\\"Antillen opgeheven op 10-10-2010\\" (in Dutch). NOS. 1 October 2009. . Retrieved 1 October 2009. =New Zealand and Cook Islands= Cook Islands is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and as such is part of the \\"Umbrella Agreement\\" including Australia and New Zealand, called the \\"Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations\\" (PACER). This agreement includes the future creation of a free trade area amongst the 14 ACP Forum Islands Countries (FICs) called the \\"Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement\\" (PICTA), without Australia and New Zealand. Under the Cotonou Agreement, Cook Islands is committed to negotiating the new reciprocal Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the ACP states and the EU, which was due to come into force in 2008. Cook Islands also benefits from the 9th EDF (PRIP) Regional Trade and Economic Integration Programme which provides approximately ‚Ç¨9 million to assist the Region in implementing PICTA, negotiate trade agreements with developed partners (e.g. EPA), intensify links with the WTO and address supply-side constraints. =Nicaragua, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region, and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region= Nicaragua is divided into 15 departments and two autonomous regions: North Caribbean Coast and South Caribbean Coast. The two autonomous regions formed the historical department of Zelaya and part of the Mosquito Coast. =Papua New Guinea and Bougainville= Papua New Guinea is divided into 20 provinces. Among them Bougainville has an autonomous government. =Saint Kitts and Nevis= Nevis is autonomous within Saint Kitts and Nevis, with its own deputy governor and government. =S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe= Pr√≠ncipe has had self-government from S√£o Tom√© since 1995. =Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo= Serbia has two 'autonomous provinces' defined in its constitution: Vojvodina, and Kosovo & Metochia. A partially recognized Republic of Kosovo administers the latter, resulting in a territorial dispute. =Tajikistan and Gorno-Badakhshan= Badakhshan is an autonomous region in Tajikistan consisting of 7 local districts. Its government is considered somewhat sovereign to the Tajik government, but the region has from time to time been in militant conflict just as in 2014. =Tanzania and Zanzibar= Tanzania is divided in 30 regions. Five of those regions together form Zanzibar. This island is a self- governing region. It elects its own president who has control over the internal matters of the island. Zanzibar was an independent sultanate and a British protectorate, while Tanganyika was a German Schutzgebiet until 1919, when it became a British mandate territory. The two were united in 1964, after a popular revolt against the Sultan of Zanzibar. = Trinidad and Tobago = Tobago has its own House of Assembly, with its Chief Secretary. It handles some of the responsibilities of the Trinidad and Tobago central government. =Ukraine and Crimea= Soviet postal stamp of 1951 (3 years before Crimean transfer) The Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine exists in unregulated form as the Constitution of Ukraine states that Ukraine is an unitary state. Following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea (second annexation), there appeared number of speculations around the region. To justify the annexation, there appeared a story about \\"drunkard\\" and Ukrainian sympathizer Nikita Khrushchev who supposedly unconstitutionally transferred the territory from Russia to Ukraine. In reality following the World War II, the peninsula was in a critical situation which even more intensified after deportation of the Crimean Tatars (indigenous population) in spring of 1944. In 1944 in Ukraine was created new Kherson Oblast out of Mykolaiv and Zaporizhia oblasts. In summer of 1945 the peninsula was stripped of its autonomous status as its title nation was removed and turned to regular oblast of Russia. To resolve the issue of drought in Crimea, in 1950 in Ukraine started construction of Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant and a new city of Nova Kakhovka to serve it. At the same time there was adopted decision to build North Crimean Canal. The new power station improve supply of power to peninsula, while its dam created Kakhovka Reservoir, waters of which were used for amelioration of steppe areas of Kherson oblast and Crimea. In 1954 to justify transfer of Crimean Oblast to Ukraine, there was created myth about union of Ukrainian and Russian nations for eternity based on so called Pereyaslav Council which took place exactly 300 years before the transfer. During 1960s to Crimea has dug the North Crimean Canal through the steppe territory of Crimea all the way to the city of Kerch. By the time of dissolution of the Soviet Union, Crimean Oblast was favorite vacation spot for top Communist official from the whole Soviet Union and in Foros during the 1991 August Putch at his \\"gosdacha\\" stayed president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1989 political sanctions against Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union were lifted and they started to return to their homeland. In 1991 as part of the so called \\"Novo-Ogarevo process\\" (reorganization of the Soviet Union), in Crimean Oblast was organized referendum on revival of autonomy, but not with its lost title nation. After the August putsch in Crimea was conducted another referendum about Ukrainian independence. In 1992 in Crimea ensued conflict around the Black Sea Fleet which was based out of Sevastopol which threatened to get escalated into an armed conflict. In 1993 the Russian parliament adopted an official statement \\"About status of the Sevastopol City\\" where it laid territorial claims against Ukraine despite constitutions of both Ukraine and Russia as well as the friendship treaty. The issue was brought to the Security Council.Complaint by Ukraine regarding the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation concerning Sevastopol. United Nations electronic library. In 2003 there took place so called Tuzla Island conflict. =United States and Puerto Rico= The relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico is a federacy. Puerto Rico residents are United States citizens and may freely travel between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico. Residents of Puerto Rico are exempt from some federal taxes. Puerto Rico's autonomy is granted by Congress. Federal taxes do not automatically apply to Puerto Rico unless the Puerto Rican government wants them to. Although the U.S. government has full say over its foreign policy, Puerto Rico does maintain direct contacts with its Caribbean neighbors. Puerto Rico does not have full voting representation in the U.S. Congress, nor do its people vote for electors in U.S. presidential elections. =Uzbekistan and Karakalpakstan= Karakalpakstan is an autonomous republic that occupies the whole western portion of Uzbekistan. Comparison to other systems of autonomy =Devolution= A federacy differs from a devolved state, such as Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom, because, in a devolved state, the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits (e.g. Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, Northern Ireland Assembly in the case of the UK) without changing the constitution. =Associated states= A federacy also differs from an associated state, such as the Federated States of Micronesia (in free association with the United States) and Cook Islands and Niue (which form part of the Realm of New Zealand). There are two kinds of associated states: in the case of Micronesia, association is concluded by treaty between two sovereign states; in the case of the Cook Islands and Niue, association is concluded by domestic legal arrangements. =Crown dependencies= The relations between the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, i.e. the Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands, are very similar to a federate relation: the Islands enjoy independence from the United Kingdom, which, via The Crown, takes care of their foreign relations and defence ‚Äì although the UK Parliament does have overall power to legislate for the dependencies. However, the islands are neither an incorporated part of the United Kingdom nor are they considered to be independent or associated states. The Isle of Man does not have a monarch but Queen Elizabeth II holds the position of Lord of Mann. = Overseas territories = British overseas territories are vested with varying degrees of power; some enjoy considerable independence from the United Kingdom, which only takes care of their foreign relations and defence. However, they are neither considered to be part of the United Kingdom, nor recognised as sovereign or associated states. =Asymmetric federations= In an asymmetric federation one of the substates has more independence than the others. Examples of this are Canada where Quebec has been given political deference to craft independent language and education policies. Some unitary states, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, may also be regarded as asymmetric federations. For example, in Spain, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia (later also Andalusia, Aragon, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Navarre, Valencia, etc.) have been granted greater autonomy and political deference than the rest of the Spanish autonomous communities (see nationalities and regions of Spain). The difference between an asymmetric federation and federacy is indistinct; a federacy is essentially an extreme case of an asymmetric federation, either due to large differences in the level of autonomy, or the rigidity of the constitutional arrangements. Criticisms Jaime Lluch has critiqued the classification and description of \\"federacy\\" as used by Elazar and Watts. Lluch argues that the category of \\"federacy\\" is misapplied to the case of Puerto Rico (and to other comparable cases), and that it is an example of \\"conceptual stretching\\". He finds that \\"federacies\\" is in the end not a helpful category to understanding the types of institutional arrangements referred and recommends that scholars of comparative federalism need to find a more nuanced category to describe contemporary actually-existing autonomies such as Puerto Rico. Lluch shows that federacies have little to do with federalism, and are in fact distinct status arrangements that are more properly seen as \\"autonomies,\\" of which there is a wide variety. This variety includes autonomies which are classified along a continuum that would take several \\"federacies\\" and reclassify them thus: * Autonomies in Unitary States: Corsica, Aland Islands, Faroe Islands, Crimea and Gagauzia. * Non-federal autonomies in \\"federal political systems\\" (which he defines as systems having two (or more) levels of government, which combine elements of shared-rule through common institutions and regional self- rule for the governments of the constituent units. This broad category includes a spectrum of polities including unions, constitutionally decentralized unions, federations, confederations and associated states): Puerto Rico, the Northern Marianas, Guam, Nunavut, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey. * Devolutionary autonomies in federal political systems: Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, South Tyrol, Valle d'Aosta, Sardinia, Sicily and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. * Semi-federal autonomies in federal political systems: Catalonia, Basque Country and Galicia. =The case of Puerto Rico= In examining the Puerto Rico case, Lluch notes that although Elazar has mischaracterized the nature of the Puerto Rico-USA relationship, it is still cited as the prototype of a \\"federacy\\". Lluch defines Puerto Rico as a non- federal autonomy, which is officially an unincorporated territory belonging to the federal political system that is the USA, and subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and states that it is not a \\"free-associated\\" state. Similar conclusions were made by three Presidential Task Forces on Puerto Rico's Status in 2005, 2007 and 2011. In particular, Lluch notes that contrary to Elazar's assertions in his 1987 and 1991 works, the power to terminate or modify the Puerto Rico-USA relationship rests squarely on the U.S. Congress and that the US government contends that sovereignty over Puerto Rico resides solely in the United States and not in the people of Puerto Rico. Lluch notes that both Watts and Elazar define a \\"federacy\\" as \\"political arrangements where a large unit is linked to a smaller unit or units, but the smaller unit retains considerable autonomy and has a minimum role in the government of the larger one, and where the relationship can be dissolved only by mutual agreement\\". However contrary to this definition he notes that far from having a minimum role in the government of the United States, Puerto Rico has no effective representation in Congress, except for a token representative that has no right to vote there. Nor do the residents of Puerto Rico vote for the U.S. President. However, Puerto Ricans are eligible to join US political parties, and both major parties conduct primary elections for national positions in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico thus has no direct representation in the institutions of the central state. He notes that essentially the Puerto Rico- USA relationship exhibits some elements of empire, and nearly none of federalism. Puerto Rico is better conceptualized as an exemplar of autonomism with the category of \\"federacy\\" being less helpful to explain it.

Originally built by Commonwealth Engineering and the Midland Railway Workshops for the Western Australian Government Railways in the late 1960s, all but one were sold in 1993 to New Zealand Rail, and were then owned by Auckland Transport. The units were completely withdrawn from service on 5 December 2014, following completion of electrification of Auckland's network. History In 1967 and 1968 ten two-carriage stainless steel sets were manufactured for the Western Australian Government Railways. Each set consisted of an ADK power car manufactured by Commonwealth Engineering, and an ADB trailer built by the WAGR's Midland Railway Workshops. The ADK cars were manufactured in Granville and railed via Melbourne and Adelaide requiring a change of bogies at each of these locations and again at Kalgoorlie. Following the electrification of the Perth rail network they were rendered surplus and in 1993 all except ADK 689 were sold, along with the newer ADL/ADC class, to New Zealand Rail to replace 56-foot carriages on suburban trains in Auckland. In October 1993, prior to being privatised, New Zealand Rail sold the class to the Auckland Regional Council (ARC).ADK/ADL New Zealand Diesel & Electric Traction In 2004 the ARC- funded an upgrade, which included refurbishment of the interiors, painting in the new MAXX blue colour scheme and mechanical improvements to extend their life by 10 years. After the upgrade, they ran as four-car rather than two-car sets. All were refurbished except ADB 773 (in use at Lock 'n' Load paintball arena) and ADK 689 (which was not exported to New Zealand). Westrail planned on converting ADK 689 to a self-propelled track inspection carriage but this did not eventuate. Unlike the ADL/ADC class and SA sets, the units have not been fitted with Electronic Train Protection (ETP) equipment, owing to their imminent replacement by the AM class. All are scheduled for withdrawal by late 2014. , all services on the Manukau Line are operated by the AM class. As a result of this, all ADK units were placed into storage. Services to Papakura formerly run by ADKs are now run by ADLs, also displaced from the Manukau Line. A farewell trip was run by the Railway Enthusiasts Society on 16 November 2014, running on every suburban line in Auckland. The units were completely withdrawn on 20 July 2015.

Train derailment  On May 12, 1989, at 7:36 a.m. a 6-locomotive/69-car Southern Pacific freight train (SP 7551 East, computer symbol 1 MJLBP-11) that was transporting trona, lost control while descending Cajon Pass, derailed on an elevated curve and plowed into a residential area on Duffy Street. The location is just northeast of where the 210 Foothill Freeway crosses the Cajon Creek wash. Locomotives The conductor, head-end brakeman, and two residents were killed in the wreck. Seven houses on the street immediately next to the tracks were demolished by the wreck, as were the lead locomotives and all of the freight cars. Clerks in Mojave had miscalculated the weight of the train, while the engineer and crew at the head end were unaware that one of the rear helper engines had inoperative dynamic brakes. Hence there was not enough dynamic braking force available to maintain control of train speed during the descent. When the helper engineer realized that the train speed was not being adequately controlled, he made an emergency brake application, which deactivated dynamic braking, resulting in a runaway condition. The train reached a speed of about 100 miles per hour (mph) before derailing on an elevated 35 mph curve next to Duffy Street, sending the head end locomotives and several cars off the high railroad bed and into houses on the street below, completely demolishing them. Buried house on Duffy St. Destroyed house on Duffy St. Upon retrieving the locomotives' \\"black boxes\\" (event recorders) and the recorded data therein, it was discovered that the third head end locomotive's dynamic brakes were not functioning at all, although the sound of the cooling fans misled crews into believing dynamic braking was functional. It was also determined after the wreck that the engineer operating the helper locomotives knew of the faulty dynamic brakes on one of his units, but did not communicate that information to the head end crew. The combination of weight miscalculation, poor communication and faulty brake equipment resulted in a total train weight that was too great to adequately control on the down grade. Once dynamic braking had been defeated by the helper engineer's emergency brake application the enormous weight of the heavily loaded cars caused rapid acceleration that could not be resisted solely by mechanical braking. The train catapulted from the 35 mph curve next to Duffy Street, scattering locomotives and cars, as well as lading. It was composited by 4 EMD SD40T-2s, 2 EMD SD40-2s and 69 hopper cars loaded with trona. = Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East = The crew that was called for train 7551 East were as follows: * Frank Holland, Engineer (age 33) * Everett Crown,‚Ä† Conductor (age 35) * Allan Riess,‚Ä† Brakeman on 3rd locomotive (age 43) * Lawrence Hill, Engineer on helper unit 7443 (age 42) * Robert Waterbury, Brakeman on helper unit 7443 (age 57) (‚Ä†=Killed in the wreck.) Killed in the wreck were Conductor Crown (fatally crushed in the nose of unit SP 8278) and Brakeman Riess (fatally crushed in the cab of unit SP 7549), along with two young boys, Jason Thompson (age 7 years) and Tyson White (age 9 years), who were crushed and asphyxiated when the train destroyed one of the houses on Duffy Street. Engineer Holland remained in his seat at the control stand in unit SP 8278 at the head of the train, and suffered several cracked ribs and a punctured lung. However, he was able to crawl out of his wrecked locomotive and was helped down by eyewitnesses on the scene. Engineer Hill and Brakeman Waterbury, who were in the helper locomotives, received minor injuries.  Pipeline rupture and fire  Buried six feet underground alongside the track is a 14-inch high-pressure petroleum transit pipeline operated by Calnev Pipeline. The pipeline was marked with stakes during cleanup to avoid the risk of it being accidentally damaged. Pipeline officials remained on site as safety observers during the cleanup of the rail cars, but not during the cleanup of the trona material. Service on the track where the derailment happened was restored four days after the crash. Thirteen days after the train wreck on May 25, 1989, at 8:05 a.m., shortly after eyewitnesses heard a train pass through the derailment site, the pipeline burst at a point on the curve where the derailment happened, showering the neighborhood with gasoline, which ignited into a large fire that burned for close to seven hours and emitted a plume of flames three hundred feet into the air. By the time the fire was out, it had fatally burned two people, and destroyed eleven more houses and 21 cars. Of the houses destroyed, five were directly across the street from houses that had been destroyed in the derailment, while another was the only house on the track side of Duffy Street to have been spared damage during the derailment. Four more houses received moderate smoke and fire damage, while three others had only smoke damage. The total property damage was US$14.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ), with more of this damage resulting from the fire than from the train derailment, although there were more fatalities from the derailment.  Aftermath  1989 attempts to have the Calnev pipeline kept shut off after its failure were unsuccessful. Many residents received settlements from Southern Pacific and/or Calnev and moved after this disaster. The plots on the south side of Duffy Street closest to the rail line were rezoned as open space by the city so they would not be rebuilt. Other nearby plots which could be redeveloped sat empty for years, though as of 2016, at least three houses have been rebuilt there. Southern Pacific also changed its cargo weight procedures, which required that the clerks assume that every freight car on every train was carrying the maximum load it was designed to carry if the submitted paperwork did not indicate a weight. By assuming the maximum weight of the train, that would guarantee that the dispatcher would assign at least the minimum number of locomotives needed to ensure that the train would have enough braking capacity needed to keep the train under control on steep grades. Seven years after the accident, Southern Pacific was bought up by Union Pacific, which still runs trains over the rails where the derailment happened. = Disposal of the train's equipment = All four of the locomotives at the front of the train (SP 8278, SP 7551, SP 7549 and SP 9340) were damaged beyond repair and were destroyed. They were sold for parts to Precision National and scrapped at the crash site. Both helper units derailed, but were still operable. Unit SP 8317 was sold to Precision National, repaired, then resold to Helm Leasing for continued service. Unit SP 7443 was repaired and repainted by SP and returned to service. It was finally retired on March 17, 2000 and sold to National Railway Equipment Company, who rebuilt it with 5‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥ gauge trucks for MRS Log√≠stica (in Brazil) #5313. All 69 hopper cars were destroyed and scrapped at the crash site. As a result of this and other runaway incidents involving locomotives with dynamic braking, the Federal Railroad Administration reversed its mandate that dynamic braking be disabled when train brakes are placed in emergency. The mandate now is that they must all remain functional.  Investigation  = Part 1: Train derailment = Much of the NTSB's investigation into the two disasters was focused on the activities surrounding the derailment. SP MJLBP1-11 was carrying trona that had been mined and loaded onto the freight cars for shipment to a buyer. The shipment would move by rail to the Port of Los Angeles, then by ship to Colombia, South America. This would be the second such shipment. The buyer had purchased 6,900 tons of trona; thus the mining company, Lake Minerals, contracted for 69 100-ton coal hopper cars (which had a combination of D&RGW; and SP reporting marks), which were to be loaded by an outside contractor at Rosamond. When the mining company turned in the final contract to the clerk (Thomas Blair) for the bill of lading, they had not filled in any weight, under the assumption that the railroad would know that they had filled the 100-ton cars to capacity. The clerk filled in the bill of lading as 60 tons per hopper car, going by a visual comparison of 100 tons of coal. As a result, the train was listed as weighing about 6,151 tons total (2,011 tons from the freight cars themselves, 4,140 tons of cargo), significantly lighter than its actual weight (Warren, 3). At 9:00 PM on May 11, a three-man crew consisting of Frank Holland, an engineer; Everett Crown, a conductor; and Allan Riess, a brakeman, was brought on duty at SP's Bakersfield yard. They were transported by company van to Mojave to take charge of a three-unit set of locomotives, consisting of SP 7551 (an EMD SD45R formerly painted in the SPSF failed merger scheme), SP 7549 (an EMD SD45R) and SP 9340 (an EMD SD45T-2). While at Mojave, the crew obtained the necessary paperwork for their train, including a Car and Tonnage Profile (a printout generated by SP's TOPS computer system that showed, among other things, the assumed train weight of 6,151 tons). Upon boarding the locomotives, it was discovered that the head unit, #7551, was dead and could not be started. The crew was then instructed to take unit SP 8278 (an EMD SD40T-2 \\"Tunnel Motor\\") from another consist and add it to theirs, ahead of the dead 7551. The crew departed Mojave at 12:15 a.m. on May 12, and headed south (railroad direction east) approximately three miles to Fleta, where they were to pick up the 69 freight cars. Due to maintenance equipment being parked on the track at the south end of the Fleta siding, it was necessary for the train crew to pick up the cars from the north end, take them back to Mojave and run around them, before heading south to Palmdale, where it was originally intended to pick up an additional helper that would be placed on the rear of the train to aid in braking after cresting Cajon Pass. After a shift change in the train dispatcher's office, the new dispatcher correctly recalculated the tonnage of the train to be approximately 8,900 tons, based on his previous experience with these types of moves. Braking ability diminishes exponentially for every degree of grade ‚Äî at a 2.2% grade, the dynamic brakes of one fully operational locomotive was capable of maintaining the speed of 1,700 to 1,800 tons of weight (either in freight cars or freight) at a speed of 25 mph. Dynamic braking ability is most effective near a speed of 25 mph and diminishes if the train travels slower or faster than this optimal speed, so engineers try to maintain speeds between 25 mph-30 mph on steep grades. The dispatcher determined that they would need the dynamic brakes of 5.23 functional engines (6 total) to maintain this optimal speed between 25 and 30 MPH, so picking up only the one additional helper locomotive at Palmdale, as originally planned, would not provide sufficient dynamic braking effort for the 2.2% grade on the west side of Cajon Pass where the derailment happened, so instead of adding the single unit at Palmdale, the dispatcher ordered a two-unit helper set dispatched from the helper pool in West Colton, California. Consequently, at 1:30 AM on May 12, a crew consisting of Lawrence Hill, an engineer, and Robert Waterbury, a brakeman (acting in a position known as a \\"lookout\\") was brought on duty at West Colton and transported by company van to Dike (located at Devore), where they boarded a two-unit helper locomotive consisting of units SP #7443 (an EMD SD45R) and SP 8317 (another EMD SD40T-2 Tunnel Motor). Their instructions were to first help a northbound train (timetable westward) up the hill to Oban, then bring MJLBP-11 back down Cajon Pass to West Colton. The two critical factors in this runaway and subsequent derailment were (1) the incorrect train tonnage provided to the crew, and (2) the lack of fully operative dynamic brakes on all but two of the locomotives between the head-end and helper locomotive consists. Each hopper car had wheels that were equipped with an ordinary air brake. The air brakes consist of a metal shoe that presses against the flange of the wheels when the air brakes are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more efficiently the friction can convert to traction instead of heat. The faster a wheel moves, the more efficiently friction converts the other way around. Thus, air brakes work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 mph as this is the speed at which traction is gained more than heat via the input of friction. The effectiveness of the air brakes on MJLBP-11's fully loaded hopper cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) would have had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased. The second locomotive in the head-end set, SP 7551, since it was dead-in-tow, did not have operative dynamic brakes, just air brakes. The event recorder downloaded from unit SP 7549 (the third locomotive), showed that it was producing traction current in motoring but no current in dynamic braking. The dynamic brakes of the fourth locomotive, SP 9340, operated sporadically and were of limited use. Unit SP 8317 (of the two- unit helper engine set coupled to the rear of the train) also did not have an operative dynamic brake. Thus, among the four locomotives in front and the set of helpers on the end, only SP 8278 at the front of the train and SP 7443 at the back of the train had fully functioning dynamic brakes. This information was not passed on to the train dispatcher. The train engineer knew only that the second unit of the head-end consist (SP 7551) had no brakes, but believed he had more than sufficient dynamic brakes to maintain the speed of 6,151 tons (as was still listed in the cargo manifest) because 6,151 tons would only require the dynamic braking effort of five engines. With a true weight of 8,900 tons, however, the train would have needed the functioning dynamic brakes of at least six or seven engines (with moderate dependence on the air brakes), or five engines (with a heavy input from the air brakes) in order to maintain control. As soon as the train crested the apex of the grade at Hiland and started downgrade on the south side of Cajon Pass, it became apparent to Holland at the head end that he was having trouble controlling the speed of the train. When he realized that the train was gathering too much speed, he did all he could to control the train speed using the train's air brakes and the dynamic brakes of the lead locomotives, and asked the helper engine's engineer to do as much as he could to help also, not knowing that he had only one working dynamic brake in his set. As a last attempt to stop the train, the helper engineer initiated an emergency brake application from his helper locomotive, but this ended up disabling all of the dynamic brakes on the train, allowing the train to pick up speed. After the activation of the emergency brake, the only brakes which were operational were the air brakes, which were now melting from the friction and heat. When the NTSB investigators arrived at the crash site (about twelve hours after the accident), they observed that the wheels had gotten so hot that they had started to expand off the wheel axles by the time they left the rails. The train was traveling at a calculated speed of 110 mph (177 km/h) when it entered a four-degree curve just north of the Highland Avenue overpass which had a maximum authorized speed of 40 mph and derailed, plowing into the houses on the outside of the curve. All but one of the houses on the side of Duffy Street nearer the tracks were destroyed. The one house on that side of the street that was spared damage during the derailment was destroyed in the pipeline rupture. Six hundred and eighty feet of track were also destroyed in the wreck. The NTSB report determined that if the train had started down the hill at a speed lower than 15 mph, it might have been possible for the crew to regain control of their train and brakes. It was also discovered that the SP's engineer training program did not have any material on how to regain control of a runaway train, and the railroad's oversight on mountain operations was inadequate. The report stated that the derailment was inevitable due to the number of unfortunate circumstances that happened during the trip. The engineers weren't found to be at fault at all, as they acted within reason. = Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage = The initial inspections of specific portions of the pipeline found no damage from the wreck, and so they deemed it safe to recharge the pipeline with product at full pressure. In particular, as this pipeline supplied Las Vegas, Calnev was under pressure to quickly resume the flow of product, and a San Bernardino resident later remarked that serving Las Vegas was worth more than everything in their California town. The pipeline operators monitored the initial flow in the pipeline, and as there was no leakage, everything was assumed to be fine. After Calnev's initial inspection and product refill, cleanup of the train wreckage began. The hoppers were removed first, a process which took two days. On May 15, the locomotives were removed and the houses that had been damaged were also demolished, and 680 feet of track was rebuilt. An excavator was then brought in to remove trona spilled from the freight cars, starting on May 16, the same day that SP resumed service on the track through the crash site, and ending on May 19, six days before the rupture. Despite stakes being placed along the pipeline's route to show where it was to the crews cleaning up the spilled trona, the cleanup nonetheless caused undetected damage to the pipeline. NTSB investigators found gashes that were determined to have been left by a backhoe cleaning up the spilled cargo. Over time, these gashes caused the integrity of the pipeline to weaken and eventually rupture. During cleanup, Calnev only inspected short segments of the pipeline - generally around places where train wreckage had landed on top of the pipe. Other short excavations discovered other debris, including bogies from the hoppers. They did not carry out an excavation of the pipeline through the entire length of the derailment site for a further inspection, or, a hydrostatic test, either of which, if done, would have found the damage and prevented the rupture. Immediately after the rupture, the pipeline control operators detected a sudden change in pumping pressure (indicating possible rupture or severe leakage) in the area, but failed to take immediate action to stop the flow of product. Additionally, the stop-and-check valves downstream from the rupture failed to close, allowing product to flow back down the pipe through Cajon Pass, which strengthened the intensity and duration of the fire. The valves were already defective at the time of the derailment, and this was not rectified in the two weeks between the derailment and the rupture. During inspection of the pipeline after the rupture, more debris from one of the wrecked locomotives was discovered near the point of rupture. At the point of the rupture, the pipeline was only buried 2 1/2 feet underneath the ground, much closer to the surface than the pipeline had been at the time of the derailment.

The title is a parody of the famous 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John le Carr√©. In this EMH-centric episode the fictional USS Voyager spacecraft, lost on the wrong side of the Galaxy has a run in with some mysterious aliens. Plot The Doctor (Robert Picardo) asks Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to alter his program to allow him to captain the ship if an emergency occurs. Janeway refuses the request. Despite this, the Doctor alters his own sub-routines, allowing him to daydream, while Voyager is traveling through an apparently harmless nebula. Among other ego-fulfilling fantasies, the daydreams include one where he becomes the \\"Emergency Command Hologram\\" and defeats an attacking alien vessel using a fictional deadly photonic cannon. The Doctor finds that his daydreams are occurring when he doesn't want them to, a side effect of his faulty programming, and the crew disables the new routines. Meanwhile, undetected by Voyager, the crew of an observation ship of the Hierarchy species has been monitoring Voyagers passage. As they have done with other ships that pass through the nebula, the Hierarchy determines whether there is any value on the ships, and if so, attacks them. They are unable to scan Voyager via normal means, and instead use a microscopic tunneling scan. This latches onto the Doctor's program, allowing them to witness events experienced by the hologram, though they are unaware of where reality stops and the Doctor's fantasies begin. Though the Hierarchy's crewman Phlox (Jay Leggett) soon realizes their mistake, the Hierarchy has already issued the command to attack Voyager for their anti- matter reserves. Phlox uses the tunneling scan to reactivate the Doctor's daydreaming programs to allow him to communicate with the hologram. Phlox explains the situation to the Doctor, who in turn reports this to Janeway. As Voyagers crew becomes aware of the approaching Hierarchy ships, Janeway arranges for the deception to be complete, temporarily turning the Doctor into the Emergency Command Hologram. The Doctor, less confident in reality than his daydreams, is still able to bluff regarding use of the photonic cannon and the Hierarchy quickly retreats. Janeway commends the Doctor for his performance and arranges a team to evaluate the prospects of putting the hologram in charge of the ship under emergency situations. Production The episode was originally titled \\"The Secret Life of Neelix\\" and was intended to be a story about when Neelix's daydreams take on a life of their own when aliens become involved. However it was shifted around and rewritten to become a story involving the Doctor. The premise is based on the short story \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\" by James Thurber in which Walter Mitty daydreams heroic adventures while running an errand for his wife. The title of this episode is a reference to the 1974 spy novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy by John le Carr√©. Writer Joe Menosky describes the episode as \\"five days of scriptwriting paradise\\" because \\"the story itself becomes your friend and collaborator; it is rich enough to support you and keep feeding you ideas as you execute the script.\\" During the writing of the script, Menosky asked actor Robert Picardo for \\"a list of what the Doctor's fantasies might be. Needless to say, a life drawing of Seven of Nine was the first suggestion [Picardo] made.\\" Actor Robert Picardo described the filming of the episode as \\"the most fun I've had in shooting the entire series ... It was great fun and one of our most successful outings at humor on our show.\\" Reception The episode is a significant departure from typical Voyager episodes due to the story's extensive use of comedic elements, making it a favorite among many viewers. It has been cited as \\"most entertaining episode of the season to date, and a Voyager classic.\\" In 2019, CBR ranked this the 15th best holodeck-themed episode of all Star Trek franchise episodes up to that time. The Hollywood Reporter rated \\"Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy\\" the 7th best episode of Star Trek: Voyager. In 2009, Time Magazine rated \\"Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy\\" as one of the top ten moments of Star Trek overall including film, and the only Star Trek: Voyager episode in their ranking. In 2020, SyFy Wire ranked this episode the 11th best episode of Star Trek: Voyager.

The episode first aired on the UPN network on September 18, 1995. The story was written by freelancers Jimmy Diggs and Steve J. Kay, based on Diggs' experience while serving in the United States Navy. It was rewritten by executive producer Jeri Taylor and guest writer Kenneth Biller. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not they are ready to have children. Taylor incorporated Diggs‚Äô suggestion to name a character \\"Samantha Wildman\\" after an organ donor who saved his wife‚Äôs life. The script was Biller's first work for the series and earned him a permanent spot on the Voyager writing staff after impressing the producers. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 5.7/9 percent, placing it in 87th position for the week overall. The episode was praised by the cast, and although director Winrich Kolbe was satisfied, he felt that Kes could have been taken further in the episode. Critics gave the episode a mixed response, lauding Lien's performance while criticizing the character dynamics and the message about women wanting motherhood. Plot On stardate 48921.3, encounters a cloud of space-dwelling lifeforms, and Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) takes the ship in for a closer look. The ship is soon drawn in and engulfed by the swarm of creatures, whose proximity disables the helm controls and shields. The crew endeavor to escape without harming the swarm, but when the creatures begin attaching themselves to the hull, they wreak even more havoc on the ship‚Äôs systems. A version of the creatures as large as Voyager arrives, and the crew realize that they have been mistaken for another of the species; the smaller creatures are attempting to mate with the ship. When the larger creature attacks, Voyager adopts a position of submission, based on behavior the crew observed in the smaller members of the species. Losing interest, the smaller creatures detach from Voyager and allow it to leave. In response to Voyagers exposure to the swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the Doctor‚Äôs (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old‚Äîbut Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready. Throughout the episode, concerns arise over shipboard fraternization. After Captain Janeway and Chakotay (Robert Beltran) discuss whether the ship is an appropriate place to raise children, Ensign Samantha Wildman (Nancy Hower) announces that she is pregnant by her husband, who is still in the Alpha Quadrant. Production \\"The Alamak\\" and \\"The Running\\" were temporary titles during the development of the episode, before settling on the final title: \\"Elogium\\". The episode was originally written for the show's first season, but was held over by UPN to give the second season a jump-start on other networks' programming. In other countries, including the United Kingdom, the episode was included in the first season. Executive producer and co-creator Jeri Taylor described \\"Elogium\\" as a fitting end to that season \\"because it leaves us with the revelation that someone aboard the U.S.S. Voyager is pregnant!\\" Though the production of the episode required extensive computer graphics, \\"Elogium\\"'s production required little other extra production features like extra cast or sets, making it a bottle episode. Jimmy Diggs wrote the A-story of \\"Elogium\\" based on an experience he had while serving in the United States Navy. One starless night when he was tasked with cleaning the ship as it came into port, giant spotlights were employed to assist the sailors. As the ship traveled, Diggs witnessed the gradual accumulation of thousands of sea creatures following the ship. That \\"special, unique memory\\" was the basis for his first script sold to Star Trek. He was already working as an intern on the staff on the basis of a previous script when he met with Taylor and Brannon Braga to pitch further stories, including \\"Elogium\\". He later said that the story was sold on the strength of a single line of dialogue: when the crew finally figures out how to shed the alien creatures, Tuvok's line of \\"Captain, I believe that we've lost our sex appeal.\\" made Braga laugh and caused him to \\"say the magic word, 'Sold. With this, Diggs became the third African American to write for Star Trek. The composition of shots including the Voyager and the alien creatures were accomplished with heavy use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) produced by Amblin Imaging and Santa Barbara Studios. When viewing the alien swarm at a distance, the special effect was a composition from magnified footage of sperm. When viewed close-up however, the alien swarm was computer-generated. Jeri Taylor rewrote the script to weave in Kes' need to mate as the B-story. Diggs later wrote to Jeri Taylor, requesting a character be named after Samantha Wildman, a young girl whose kidney donation saved his wife's life. Taylor wrote in the character of Samantha Wildman, who recurred as the department head of xenobiology because her namesake had been a fervent animal lover. Diggs described his motivation for lobbying for the name: I couldn't imagine the selflessness of people who, in the middle of their grief over the loss of their child, could think about someone else, could save someone else's life.' Jimmy says that in ancient times, the gods would immortalize heroes by placing them in the stars. 'Samantha Wildman will live on,' he says. 'She's taken her [place] in the stars. Comic-Con. Biller helped revise the initial story for the teleplay. The teleplay was written by Kenneth Biller and Taylor; Biller wrote the A-story that focused on the swarm of alien creatures while Taylor focused on the B-story of Kes' elogium. Instead of writing from Digg's full prose story, Biller worked from a seven-page treatment. Biller reacted to the plot with the thought: \\"a show about eating and sex ‚Äî these are things I know a lot about‚Ä¶\\" Biller explained in a later interview that he fought for Neelix and Kes to already be living together and having sex when drafting the teleplay, but he was shot down by Taylor and Rick Berman out of concern for Kes' young age and that it would be more interesting to show the couple grappling with this for the first time. \\"Elogium\\" inaugurated Biller's term as a writer for Star Trek: Voyager. When he brought in the script for series co-creators Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor to review, he was told that it was a very good script. However, Piller said that \\"I don't think the teaser works at all.\\" Biller received so many notes on the script that he began to feel as though the experience were an audition. After rewriting the script, Taylor expressed his pleasure with Biller's technical descriptions within the script and asked if Biller had a science background; ironically, Biller had instead attended Brown University specifically to avoid taking science courses‚Äîthe technical details were all made up. The day after presenting the rewrite, Taylor asked Biller to join the Voyager writing staff. Biller had been unaware of the vacancy, having come on board for the fee and expecting nothing more. Though initially reluctant, Biller took Taylor's offer for the \\"opportunity to write television that was about something.\\" Taylor and Biller conceded that it was UPN's holding back of the episode until the second season that resulted in Ensign Wildman's strange gestation period of seven or eight months. Reception =Ratings= \\"Elogium\\" was first broadcast on September 18, 1995. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received ratings of 5.7/9 percent. This meant that it was watched by 5.7 percent of all televisions in the United States, and 9 percent of those watching television at the time. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Projections\\", which received ratings of 6.1/10 percent and less than the following episode, \\"Non Sequitur\\", which was rated at 6.0/9 percent. \\"Elogium\\" was placed in 87th position overall for the highest ratings for the week of broadcast. =Cast and crew response= Several members of the cast of Voyager found the episode enjoyable. Mulgrew praised \\"Elogium\\" for her opportunity to interact with the Kes character on a maternal level. Mulgrew thought the episode was a great vessel for Lien to stretch her acting chops, calling her \\"a constant and wonderful surprise.\\" Lien herself thought that the episode was a great vehicle to learn more about her character and the Ocampa species; she said \\"[i]t really took my character to a different level.\\" Russ thought that \\"Elogium\\" (along with \\"Emanations\\") were stories that challenged concepts, ideas, attitudes, and traditions‚Äîall things that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry originally wrote science fiction about: \\"That, I think, is the most important part of Star Trek.\\" Director Winrich Kolbe praised Lien's performance in \\"Elogium\\", but was disappointed that he could not take the character even further, saying that \\"[t]he show went soft at the end.\\" Kolbe complained that it wasn't uncommon for a wonderful concept to fall victim to a failing of courage and determination. =Critical response= However, critics had a more mixed response. In his book Delta Quadrant: The unofficial guide to Voyager, David McIntee found Chakotay's revelation and Lien's acting the only high points of the episode. Otherwise, he felt the \\"sexual-politics statements\\" were cheesy and overdone, and that all of the possible clich√©s of Kes' elogium (puberty, PMS, pregnancy, abortion, and menopause) were trodden upon and ill- used. McIntee accused the plot of being dull and the acting as subpar; although he thought the plot was supposed to touch on teenage pregnancy, it instead emphasized that all women wish to be mothers, and all men are \\"immature bastards.\\" He rated the episode 1 out of 10. Reviewers Lance Parkin and Mark Jones thought the episode was \\"Voyager at its very worst\\", repeating fans' complaints that if Ocampan women only give birth once their population would eventually disappear as it would halve every generation. Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera thought the episode flowed well, and that the treknobabble was reasonable and logical, but that the episode didn't make good use of the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars. Home media release The first home media release for \\"Elogium\\" came as part of a two episode release on VHS alongside \\"Projections\\" in the United Kingdom in 1995. In the United States, it was released on a single episode cassette on September 5, 2000. The episode was first released on DVD as part of the second season box set (in both the UK and the US) in 2004.

History The program began in 1976. The first coach, Chuck Erbe, led the team to four national championships, 1 NCAA (1981) and three AIAW (1976‚Äì77, 1980). Women's volleyball also has 10 final four appearances (1981, 1982, 1985, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011), finishing as the National runner-up in 1982.

The Women of Troy dropped just one set through the first three rounds of the NCAA tournament before facing Stanford in the quarterfinal. Though the Cardinal had defeated USC in both regular-season matches, the Women of Troy edged Stanford in a five-setter, led by Falyn Fonoimoana's season-high 25 kills.

Amongst others, he was a member of the Architectural Advisory Board for the U.S. Capitol and of the New York State Council of Parks. He was awarded a Gold Medal of Honor by the Architectural League of New York in 1931 for his works in Westchester County. In 1934 he became a consultant for the New York City Parks Department under parks commissioner Robert Moses. His works in the city include the Central Park Zoo, the Conservatory Garden, the expansion of Riverside Park, and many other public spaces. The following year, he teamed up with Michael Rapuano (1904 - 1975),Sculpture Review: In Memoriam: Michael Rapuano, Sculpture Review XXV(1) ; Spring 1976. founding the firm of Clarke & Rapuano. From 1935 to his retirement in 1950 he taught landscape architecture at Cornell University, where he was the Dean of Architecture from 1939 on. Clarke designed the landscape architecture of the 1939 New York World's Fair, and he and his firm of Clarke & Rapuano were also deeply involved in the design of the 1964 New York World's Fair, which were both held at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. For the 1964 exhibition, Clarke designed the Unisphere, and his company designed many of the fountains and statues in the park, as well as the \\"Garden of Meditation\\" exhibit.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission: The Unisphere with its surrounding pool and fountains, May 16, 1995. Designation List 263; LP-1925. URL last accessed June 30, 2006. Clarke was also appointed the landscape architect and engineer for the Garden State Parkway. He had closely worked with Robert Moses and combined the examples of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Merritt Parkway to give the highway an efficient and beautiful appearance. In addition to his practice in New York, Clarke was appointed in 1932 to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C., and served as its chairman from 1937 to 1950. He led the Commission in opposition to several controversial issues during this period, including the design of the neo-classical Jefferson Memorial by John Russell Pope, the siting of the new Pentagon complex near Arlington Cemetery, and the construction of the so-called \\"Truman Balcony\\" within the south portico of the White House.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Chapter 3; Carroll William Westfall, \\"The Jefferson Memorial: A Pyrrhic Victory for American Architecture'; and Appendix B, p. 542. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1945 and was a member and Special Committee chairman for the American Academy in Rome from 1944-1945. In 1944, Clarke was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1946. Clarke retired from his firm in 1972 and later consulted on the construction of the United Nations Headquarters. He also became a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History. Clarke died on August 8, 1982 while aboard the ship Royal Viking Star on a cruise off the coast of Denmark.

Life  James George Deck in military uniform of the 14th Madras Infantry Deck was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, to John Deck, a postmaster, and Mary (n√©e Welch or Welsh). His ancestors included Huguenots who left France before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Well-educated, he could speak fluent French and was literate in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. After receiving military training in Paris at the age of 17 he joined the British East India Company, and he purchased a military commission with the 14th Madras Infantry, where he served from 1824 to 1826. After returning to England he experienced an evangelical conversion and entered a private Anglican theological college. On 22 April 1829 he married Alicia Field, the daughter of his tutor Samuel Field. In India he resigned his commission in 1835 for religious reasons, and returned to England, tutoring the sons of Indian Army officers. Intending to enter the Anglican ministry, he became involved with the Plymouth Brethren instead; he was baptised by full immersion and became an evangelist for the movement, preaching first in Taunton and then in Weymouth. When the Bethesda controversy came to a head in 1848, the Brethren movement split into the Exclusive Brethren (led by John Nelson Darby) and the Open Brethren (led by George Mueller). Deck unsuccessfully attempted reconciliation, and then after suffering a stroke and partial paralysis decided to emigrate to New Zealand. With his wife and eight surviving children, he arrived in Wellington on 13 August 1853, and moving to 240 ha of land purchased at Waiwhero, NgƒÅtƒ´moti, in Nelson Province, joining other former Indian Army officers. Only a few weeks later his wife Alicia died, and his 20-year-old daughter Mary began caring for the family. In July 1855 Deck married Lewanna Atkinson, who bore five children before she and her youngest son died of measles in 1865. On the first day of 1863 Deck founded the first \\"formal\\" Brethren assembly at NgƒÅtƒ´moti, along with local families such as the Salisburys, although historian Peter Lineham believes that there had already been an informal group meeting on Brethren lines in nearby Motueka for some time. The Nelson Brethren Assemblies rapidly developed thereafter, and when the family moved to Wellington in 1865 Deck's preaching had such effect that more Assemblies were established. After five years he returned to Motueka. James George Deck late in life, with the splendid white beard for which he was well known Deck had kept little contact with British Brethren and was unwilling to import the Exclusive-Open schism from the United Kingdom. But in 1875 the news of the division that had occurred in England became known in New Zealand, and with visits by Exclusive Brethren leaders George Wigram and John Nelson Darby the division was enforced, effectively splitting the Brethren movement in New Zealand almost a generation after the split had occurred in the British Isles. After Darby's visit Deck, perhaps reluctantly, sided with the Exclusive Brethren, but refused to isolate himself from assemblies that sided with the Open Brethren. According to Lineham, Deck has some claim to be the founder of both the Exclusive and Open Brethren in New Zealand. Deck appears to have been emotionally affected by the schism, so much so that he ceased writing hymns, for which he is internationally known. He died on 14 August 1884 at Motueka.  Impact  Within 40 years of Deck's first Brethren meeting the 1900 census revealed that nearly 2% of the New Zealand population were Brethren. The Brethren movement in New Zealand had an influence in New Zealand's rapid social development despite Deck's followers remaining outside of political institutions. One person brought up in the Motueka Assembly who left the Brethren and involved himself in politics was Keith Holyoake who went on to become a long serving Prime Minister and then Governor General. Family Deck had fourteen children, nine with Alicia and five with Lewanna. Twelve children survived childhood. After Lewenna's death, Mary again took over caring for the children, and with her sisters established a boarding school for girls at their family home in the Waiwhero Valley and later at \\"Sandridge\\", the home on Motueka's Thorp Street where James George Deck lived from around 1874 until his death. Deck's sons and descendants were involved in both \\"open\\" and \\"exclusive\\" assemblies. His son John, along with his wife Emily, helped found the South Seas Evangelical Mission in Australia in 1877. References  Further reading  *Lineham, P. J. (1977). There we found Brethren.

His early bands included the Wiltshire-based The Sonics (not to be confused with the 1960s US band of the same name) and London-based The Attack, which released \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\" a few days prior to Jeff Beck. He went on to lead a psychedelic, progressive, hard rock band called Andromeda, before being asked to join Atomic Rooster, featuring re- recorded guitar parts and vocals for their 1970 self-titled debut album, and the albums Death Walks Behind You (1970) and In Hearing of Atomic Rooster (1971). Cann wrote \\"Devil's Answer\\", Atomic Rooster's biggest hit, which reached No.4 in the UK singles charts in July 1971. Upon departing Atomic Rooster in 1971 he formed Daemon, later renamed Bullet, then Hard Stuff, releasing two albums on Purple Records based more heavily on aggressive guitar work. In 1974 he was a temporary guitarist in Thin Lizzy for a tour of Germany. Sometime following this, his manager suggested a name change for him from John Cann to John Du Cann. As a result of being signed to the same management company, 1977 saw the pairing of Du Cann with Francis Rossi of the British rock band Status Quo. Rossi was invited to produce Du Cann's proposed new album, The World's Not Big Enough, which remained unreleased until 1992. The session musicians for this album included Rossi on guitar, Andy Bown on keyboards, future Quo drummer Pete Kircher and bassist John McCoy. The album was described in Record Collector magazine at the time as sounding like \\"Quo mixed with the Sex Pistols\\". In September 1979 Du Cann had a hit on the UK Singles Chart with \\"Don't Be A Dummy\\", an unreleased version of which (featuring vocals by Gary Numan) had featured in a Lee Cooper Jeans television advertisement in 1978. The single reached number 33 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1979, Cann and Crane re-formed Atomic Rooster with Preston Heyman on drums (with whom they recorded their 1980 self-titled album). Following this, after a brief spell with former Cream drummer Ginger Baker (who was released after only three weeks), Paul Hammond returned to his place on the drums, and the band released two more singles on Polydor with minimal success. In 1981, the band were booked at the last minute at the Reading Festival, but Cann was unable to make it, and Mick Hawksworth sat in with the band on bass guitar, while Crane took over on lead vocals. In late 1982, Cann had had enough of the non-success of the band, and left for the final time. In the late 1990s he was introduced to the Angel Air record label by John McCoy. He was later active cataloguing and remastering his personal tape archive and compiling reissues for the label, for which he received full credit and royalties. Du Cann died at his home in Norwich on 21 September 2011 after a heart attack. His personal collection of 75 guitars, 30 amplifiers, records and CDs was auctioned in January 2012. An original copy of the Andromeda LP made ¬£800, whilst his well used 1963 Fender Strat sold for ¬£6500. His mother was the only beneficiary of his estate. He is buried at Greenacres Burial Ground at Colney, near Norwich, UK. His gravestone is inscribed with the first line of \\"Devil's Answer\\".

History The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) was founded in 1980 at the initiative of Mr Masayoshi Ohira and Mr Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Ministers of Japan and Australia respectively. Its founding name was the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference with the final word changed to Council years later. The Council brings together leading thinkers, and decision makers from government and business in an informal setting to discuss and formulate ideas on the most significant challenges facing the Asia Pacific. It regularly develops and advocates regional policy initiatives to aid in the stable economic development of the region. PECC‚Äôs regional community building efforts led to the establishment of the official APEC process in 1989, the Council is one of the three official observers of the APEC process. Participation in the PECC Process depends on a commitment to economic cooperation in the Pacific. PECC participants, seek to achieve increased, open regional economic cooperation and interaction, while recognizing both the realities of, and the benefits accruing from, global interdependence and continuing to encourage increased economic cooperation and interaction with other nations and regions. PECC organizes an annual General Meeting to develop strategic perspectives to promote the Pacific Community. Participants in the PECC General Meeting are delegates from PECC member committees and observers. There is a Standing Committee, the PECC's governing body, which consists of all of the full member committees, and two institutional members and invited associate member committees in a limited capacity. this SC meets once a year.PECC SC http://www.pecc.org/resources/doc_download/593-annex-4-pecc-standing- committee-members The Co-chairs are elected for 3-year terms, Dr Charles E.

It was held in conjunction with Canada-Asia 2013 and organized by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. The opening plenary session, 'Key Trends Shaping the Asia-Pacific\\" examined the latest economic, political, and social trends in the Asia-Pacific, identifying the emerging opportunities and uncertainties in the region. Will slower economic growth be the norm in Asia over the next few years and how will this affect both the regional and global economy? What will be the impact of a rapidly growing urban population‚Äîparticularly one with an increasing middle class with evolving needs and expectations? Given the two on-going regional trade negotiations, what will be the future of trade in the Asia Pacific? The opening plenary session was followed by concurrent breakout sessions which covered diverse topics including: infrastructure deficit in the Asia-Pacific, creativity and innovation in Asia, promoting inclusive growth and resilient societies in Asia, green growth, and risks to growth in the Asia-Pacific. Later plenary sessions covered Canada's Asia strategy and how economies are responding to the rise of Asia. Thereafter, breakout sessions addressed Canada's contribution to sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific, and preparation of Canada's next generation to compete in an international environment increasingly influenced by developments in Asia. The last time PECC GM was held in Vancouver was in November 1986 when Mr. Eric Trigg served as the International Chair of PECC.

The most correct and accurate methods for calculating the fractional integral require a record of all previous history, and therefore would require a linear space complexity solution O(n), where n is the number of samples measured for the complete history. The fractor ( fractional capacitor ) is an analog component useful in control systems. In order to model the components behavior in a digital simulation, or replace the fractor in a digital controller, a linear solution is untenable. In order to reduce the space complexity however, it is necessary to lose information in some way. The Coopmans approximation is a robust, simple method that uses a simple convolution to compute the fractional integral, then recycles old data back through the convolution. The convolution sets up a weighting table as described by the fractional calculus, which varies based on the size of the table, the sampling rate of the system, and the order of the integral. Once computed the weighting table remains static. The data table is initialized as all zeros, which represents a lack of activity for all previous time. New data is added to the data buffer in the fashion of a ring buffer, so that the newest point is written over the oldest data point. The convolution is solved by multiplying corresponding elements from the weight and data tables, and summing the resulting products. As described, the loss of the old data by overwriting with new data will cause echoes in a continuous system as disturbances that were absorbed into the system are suddenly removed. The solution to this is the crux of the Coopmans approximation, where the old data point, multiplied by its corresponding weight term, is added to the newest data point directly. This allows a smooth (though exponential, rather than power law) decay of the system history. This approximation has the desirable effect of removing the echo, while preserving the space complexity of the solution. The negative effect of the approximation is that the phase character of the solution is lost as the system frequency approaches DC. However, all digital systems are guaranteed to suffer this flaw, as all digital systems have finite memory, and therefore will fail as the memory requirement approaches infinity.

The current specification (2009) is MIL-DTL-5541F, which superseded MIL-C-5541E in July 2006. The specification is approved for use by all departments and agencies of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Although prepared specifically for DoD applications, the standard is used for many commercial applications as well. It has gained world wide use across many fields versus the more verbose ISO equivalent (i.e., ISO 8081:1985, Aerospace process, Chemical conversion coating for aluminum alloys, General purpose). Note that chromate conversion coatings have been used for over 50 years as treatment to coated or as-fabricated surfaces to boost corrosion resistance and provide a good basis for the subsequent application of paint. However, these treatments use hexavalent chromium chemicals that are extremely toxic. This has led to progressively greater restrictions, imposed by national and international legislation, related to concerns over health and safety and environmental protection, on the use of these treatments. Scope of the Standard The MIL- DTL-5541 specification covers chemical conversion coatings that form protective coatings by chemical reaction with aluminum and aluminum alloy; these coatings are categorized by the following types and classes. *Type I: Addresses compositions containing hexavalent chromium. This film typically appears to be gold or brown in color, but in some cases may be optionally specified as having no color (Having no color is described as \\"clear\\"). *Type II: Addresses compositions containing no hexavalent chromium. This film typically appears to have no color (Having no color is described as \\"clear\\"). AND *Class 1A: Provides maximum protection against corrosion, whether painted or unpainted. This is a relatively thick coating used as a final finish or pre-treatment to paint or powder coating. *Class 3: Provides protection against corrosion where low electrical resistance is required. This is a thin coating providing low contact resistance, and the coating weight is lower as is the corrosion resistance. There may be some advantages using this thinner film in bonding applications.

They are designated as a post treatment to ion-vapor deposition (IVD) aluminum used on many military platforms as a cadmium alternative or galvanic corrosion inhibitor. Type I and II conversion coatings provide corrosion protection on unpainted items, as well as improve adhesion of paint finish systems on aluminum and aluminum alloys. The conversion coatings covered by this specification exceed most commercially available products. This is a requirement due to their use on military aircraft. *Class 1A: These chemical conversion coatings provide corrosion prevention on unpainted items and they improve adhesion of paint finish systems on aluminum and aluminum alloys. Coatings of this type may be used, for example, on tanks, tubing, and component structures where paint finishes are not required for interior surfaces, but are required for the exterior surfaces. *Class 3: These chemical conversion coatings provide a corrosion preventive film for electrical and electronic applications where lower resistant contacts, relative to class 1A coatings, and anodic coatings in accordance with MIL-A-8625, are required. Because Class 3 coatings are thinner they are more susceptible to corrosion than class 1A coatings. If it is required to paint areas surrounding electrical Class 3 coatings improve adhesion of paint systems on aluminum and aluminum alloy material. Keep in mind that un-coated aluminum will naturally oxidize if left un-coated. If your goal is to ground to the surface of your aluminum part, then a thin class 3 coating keeps the oxide from building up and provides a better surface for grounding to be accomplished. Also keep in mind that chemical conversion coating is not conductive, so to accomplish a good ground, sufficient pressure is required between the parts .

Biography Vilhelm Hansen (May 6, 1900 ‚Äì December 23, 1992) and Carla Hansen (September 19, 1906 ‚Äì December 6, 2001) were an artistic couple. He was a trained lithographist, while she was a writer. Vilhelm worked mainly as an advertising artist between the two World Wars, and only started making comics and illustrating the tales written by Carla in the 1940s. Their collaborative comic Rasmus Klump, about the adventures of a bear, a pelican, a penguin, and some other animals, debuted in Denmark on November 17, 1951, as a daily comic strip. It soon became one of the most popular European children comics, being translated and distributed into many languages and countries, mainly by the publishing houses Carlsen Comics and Casterman. While they no longer wrote or drew the stories after 1965, it was their names that stayed on the albums.

With a population 66,932 in 2008 it is the third largest Italian frazione after Ostia and Mestre. History The name remembers the Roman family of the Acilii, which during the Roman age owned their estates here. In the years around World War I the zone, once plagued by malaria, was reclaimed. The first modern settlements took place during the 1920s, but only the opening of the Via del mare and of the railway between Rome and Ostia boosted the development of the area. In 1940 Italian dictator Benito Mussolini inaugurated a settlement designed by the engineer Dario Pater. Here were hosted many inhabitants coming from Borgo, which had lost their homes because of the demolition of the spina. Today Acilia belongs to the X Municipio, the part of Rome that overlooks the Tyrrhenian Sea. Transport Acilia is served by a railway station on the suburban line Rome-Lido. Roman terminal of this line is at Roma Porta San Paolo station, very close to Piramide stop (Rome Metro, Line B) and not too far from the station of Roma Ostiense.

The ideas and discussions generated by PAFTAD have helped drive and shape other Pacific economic cooperation organisations, including Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). Each PAFTAD conference is organised around a particular theme, and research papers addressing the topic are presented and discussed. The results are published in the PAFTAD volume series. History Since its inception in 1968 the PAFTAD conference series has established itself as one of the leading sources of ideas and discussion on issues affecting economic development in the Asia Pacific. A private organisation with no formal government ties, PAFTAD has been, and continues to be a driving force for ideas about policy innovation and development at both the national and regional levels. The essence of PAFTAD‚Äôs contribution is both intellectual and practical: it generates ideas about regional economic exchange and integration, provides empirical evidence to support or reject policy proposals and facilitates ongoing debate among policy influential experts. The ideas and evidence generated by PAFTAD have entered the public policy dialogue of most Asia Pacific economies, due in no small part to the intellectual and policy leadership shown by PAFTAD participants at both a national and regional level. 34th PAFTAD Conference - Beijing 2009 Theme: ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Role in the World Economy‚Äù Host: China Centre for Economic Research (CCER), Peking University Fellowship for Young Scholars Young Fellows at PAFTAD 32 in Vietnam. The PAFTAD Fellowship for Young Scholars is available to graduate students and faculty members aged 35 years and below, and is considered one of the most distinguished fellowships available to young scholars in the region. The PAFTAD International Steering Committee selects 8 aspiring researchers as PAFTAD Fellows to present papers on themes related to Asia Pacific trade and economic development for each conference. Selection is based on the quality of a written submission as judged by the Selection Panel from PAFTAD‚Äôs distinguished International Steering Committee. This year the Fellowships will take young scholars to Beijing where they will present their papers the day prior to PAFTAD's 34th Conference on December 6 and participate in the PAFTAD Conference itself on 7‚Äì9 December.

The extent of PAFTAD‚Äôs contribution to regional development was apparent in the formation of APEC. Two of PAFTAD‚Äôs earliest leaders, Professor Sir John Crawford and Dr Saburo Okita, were instrumental in leading their countries to establish the tripartite Pacific Economic Cooperation Committee (PECC). In turn PECC, which shares many members in common with PAFTAD, developed recognition among nations of the region of the need for a framework to support and enhance the rapid growth in regional trade, investment and technology transfer: APEC.

The Prime Minister is the holder of the third highest office of Cuba. The office of Prime Minister was first instituted in 1940 in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of Cuba as amended in that year. The first Prime Minister of Cuba was Carlos Saladrigas Zayas (1900‚Äì1957), the nephew of former President Alfredo Zayas. The prime minister was also sometimes referred to as \\"Premier\\". Between 1940 and 1959, Cuba saw fifteen changes of prime minister; F√©lix Lanc√≠s S√°nchez exercised the role twice (1944‚Äì1945 and 1950‚Äì1951) while Fulgencio Batista held the position concurrently with that of President of Cuba for one month (April 1952) following a military coup. Fidel Castro became prime minister in 1959, replacing Jos√© Mir√≥ Cardona.1959: Castro sworn in as Cuban PM BBC online. On 2 December 1976 a new national constitution, restructuring the government, came into force. Under that constitution, the Prime Minister's post was effectively merged with that of the President, who served as chairman of both the Council of State and the Council of Ministers of Cuba. The 1976 constitution created a governmental structure that partly copied that of the Soviet Union. However, unlike in the Soviet Union, where the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers were distinct posts, the Cuban Council of State and Council of Ministers were chaired by the same person. Furthermore, unlike English and Russian, Spanish does not distinguish between the terms \\"chairman/–ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å\\" and \\"president/–ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç\\", translating both as \\"presidente\\". On 24 February 2019, another constitution ‚Äì Cuba's current ‚Äì was adopted in a referendum. Under it, the government was again re-organized, and the separate posts of President and Prime Minister were restored. Manuel Marrero was named prime minister for a 5-year term by President Miguel D√≠az- Canel on 21 December 2019, under the new constitutional provisions, and was approved unanimously by the National Assembly to serve the same day.Cuba names Manuel Marrero Cruz prime minister.
