The use of hyphens is called hyphenation. Non- hyphenated is an example of a hyphenated word. The hyphen should not be confused with dashes (figure dash , en dash , em dash , horizontal bar ), which are longer and have different uses, or with the minus sign , which is also longer and more vertically centred in some typefaces. As an orthographic concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In terms of character encoding and display, the entity is represented by any of several characters and glyphs (including hard hyphens, soft or optional hyphens, and non-breaking hyphens), depending on the context of use (discussed below). Although hyphens are not to be confused with en dashes and minus signs, there are some overlaps in usage (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable, depending on user preference, as discussed below) and in informal typing (which often uses the same character called a \\"hyphen-minus\\" to represent any of the hyphen, the minus sign and the en dash, see below).  Etymology  The word is derived from Ancient Greek (), contracted from (), \\"in one\\" (literally \\"under one\\").. The word () was used for an undertie-like sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity, before the space 'character' was in regular use.  Use in English  The English language does not have definitive hyphenation rules, though various style guides provide detailed usage recommendations, and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or \\"hanging\\" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., nineteenth- and writers). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension. The use of the hyphen in English compound nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary removed the hyphens from 16,000 entries, such as fig-leaf (now fig leaf), pot-belly (now pot belly) and pigeon-hole (now pigeonhole).. The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g. toolbar, hyperlink, pastebin). Despite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in columns with narrow measure, as when used with newspapers).  Separating  = Justification and line-wrapping = When flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables (syllabification), and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins (justification) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of rivers. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the column (called the measure in typography) is very narrow. For example: { - valign=\\"top\\"  Justified text without hyphenation   Justified text with hyphenation - valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify\\" We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America ...  style=width:3em;  style=\\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify;\\" We, therefore, the tatives of the United States of America ... } The details of doing this properly are complex and language- dependent, and can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices. Hyphenation algorithms, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts. It may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition)‚Äînot only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and soft hyphens having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). Webster's Third New International Dictionary and the Chambers Dictionary use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans‚ÄìEnglish dictionary uses the opposite convention. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition) repeated an integral hyphen at the start of the following line. = Prefixes and suffixes = Prefixes (such as de-, pre-, re-, and non-A fairly comprehensive list, although not exhaustive, is given at Prefix > List of English derivational prefixes.) and suffixes (such as ', ', ', and ') may or may not be hyphenated. (The unhyphenated style is also called closed up or solid.) A rule of thumb is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarity‚Äîspecifically, clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause. The clear‚Äìunclear distinction involves some subjectivity, because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on, for example, subject matter familiarity). Nonetheless, consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words. This is explained further below. Many long- established words, such as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous. In contrast, for some other words, the closed-up style may not be as clear, and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness, including odd appearance or misguided parsing of syllables. An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word ' (versus coworker) to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group cow (which might suggest cow () before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or style guide preference, because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it. Words for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective, to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be homographs, such as recreation (fun or sport) versus ' (the act of creating again), retreat (turn back) versus ' (give therapy again), and ' (not in ion form) versus unionized (organized into trade unions). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a proper (capitalized) noun or adjective (', ');.. (2) an acronym (', '); or (3) a number (', '). Style guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency, the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and inter-document consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the \\"follow dictionary X\\" rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled- letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary thus closes up preempt, reexamine, deemphasize, nonnegotiable, posttransfusion, and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of \\"awkwardness\\" for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, reexamine and deemphasize are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the '/coworker example (mentioned earlier) or with antiinflammatory/', many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas many others do not, and in such cases, dictionary styles vary (Dorland's, antiinflammatory; Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, '). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus ', not shelllike). There is a trend that words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows. An excellent example is email/'; the number of people who find email awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s, and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly. For some instances, the consensus depends on occupational speciality or subspecialty. Although ' is still hyphenated by most users (and by both Dorland's and Merriam-Webster's Medical), the solid styling (protooncogene) is gaining popularity, with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way. A hyphen can clarify that two adjacent vowels‚Äîwhether two of the same letter (e.g., oo, ee) or two different letters (e.g., ae, ei)‚Äîare pronounced separately rather than being merged in a diphthong. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated ' and ' have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid deescalate and cooperation have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy) and nondoubling (for example, a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ee and ei); regarding de+e/re+e/pre+e and de+i/re+i/pre+i, nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as reiterate and reinforce) need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as reexamine/' or deemphasize/'). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, aa and ii) but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus intraarterial and antiinflammatory) or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are \\"odd-looking\\" because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus ' and '). A diaeresis can also sometimes be used, either to indicate non-diphthong status (e.g., co√∂peration and na√Øve) or to indicate non-silent terminal -e (e.g., Bront√´), but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use; it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples, including co√∂peration, na√Øve, and Bront√´, are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; for whatever reason, it never had any popularity in the de+e/re+e/pre+e or de+i/re+i/pre+i subclasses‚Äîthus seldom re√´xamine, re√Øterate, de√´mphasize, or others). Many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in naive/na√Øve (on the basis that it is not necessary in order for the reader to recognize the word), and *na-ive draws attention to itself as a style that is never used. = Syllabification and spelling = Hyphens are occasionally used to denote syllabification, as in syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion. Various British and North American dictionaries use an interpunct, sometimes called a \\"middle dot\\" or \\"hyphenation point\\", for this purpose, as in syl¬∑la¬∑bi¬∑fi¬∑ca¬∑tion. This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example, ', ', '). Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, W-O-R-D spells \\"word\\". In nineteenth-century American literature, hyphens were also used irregularly to divide syllables in words from indigenous North American languages, without regard for etymology or pronunciation: e.g. \\"Shuh-shuh-gah\\" (from Ojibwe zhashagi, \\"blue heron\\") in The Song of Hiawatha. This usage is now rare and proscribed, except in some place names such as Ah-gwah-ching.  Joining  = Compound modifiers = Compound modifiers are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an adverb‚Äìadjective combination appears before a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in player or paintings. Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a \\"player of American football\\" or an \\"American player of football\\" and whether the writer means paintings that are \\"little celebrated\\" or \\"celebrated paintings\\" that are little.Gary Blake and Robert W. Bly, The Elements of Technical Writing, p. 48. New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in candy, and can be adverbial as well as adjectival ( frightening). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, some style guides prefer the construction high school students, to students.E.g. Although the expression is technically ambiguous (\\"students of a high school\\"/\\"school students who are high\\"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun‚Äìnoun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: grade point average and department store manager. When a compound modifier follows the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, \\"that gentleman is well respected\\", not \\"that gentleman is well-respected\\"; or \\"a patient-centered approach was used\\" but \\"the approach was patient centered.\\" But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, \\"A cost-effective method was used\\" and \\"The method was cost-effective\\" (cost-effective is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries). When one of the parts of the modifier is a proper noun or a proper adjective, there is no hyphen (e.g., \\"a South American actor\\"). When the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in -ly (e.g., \\"a poorly written novel\\"), various style guides advise no hyphen. However, some do allow for this use. For example, The Economist Style Guide advises: \\"Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions... Less common adverbs, including all those that end -ly, are less likely to need hyphens.\\" In the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb‚Äìadjective modifiers with the adverb ending in -ly (e.g., \\"a craftily-constructed chair\\"). However, this has become rare. For example, wholly owned subsidiary and quickly moving vehicle are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: \\"quickly\\" cannot modify \\"vehicle\\". However, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide. For example, the phrase reasons (\\"reasons that are more important\\") is distinguished from more important reasons (\\"additional important reasons\\"), where more is an adjective. Similarly, scenery (with a mass-noun) is distinct from more beautiful scenery. (In contrast, the hyphen in \\"a reason\\" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words‚Äîsuch as well, ill, little, and much‚Äîattract special attention in this category. The hyphen in \\"well-[past_participled] noun\\", such as in \\"well- differentiated cells\\", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because early has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with advanced-stage disease and adult-onset disease, like the parallelism of early-stage disease and early-onset disease. Similarly, the hyphen in little-celebrated paintings clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings. Hyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun), although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus woman and woman or wingspan and wingspan, but the woman is 28 years old and a wingspan of 32 feet. However, with symbols for SI units (such as m or kg)‚Äîas opposed to the names of these units (such as metre or kilogram)‚Äîboth the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology recommend use without a hyphen: a 25 kg sphere. When the units are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: a sphere, a roll of film.\\"The International System of Units (SI)\\", Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, 2006\\"Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)\\", NIST Special Publication 811, National Institute of Standards and Technology, March 2008 In spelled-out fractions, hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus majority and portion but I drank two- thirds of the bottle or I kept three-quarters of it for myself. However, at least one major style guide hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun). In English, an en dash, , sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, San Francisco‚Äìarea residents, hormone receptor‚Äìpositive cells, cell cycle‚Äìrelated factors, and public- school‚Äìprivate-school rivalries). A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (hormone-receptor-positive cells, cell-cycle-related factors). (For other aspects of en dash‚Äìversus‚Äìhyphen use, see Dash > En dash.) = Object‚Äìverbal-noun compounds = When an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as egg-beater (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, egg-beater, egg beater, and eggbeater are all common. An example of an ambiguous phrase appears in they stood near a group of alien lovers, which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; they stood near a group of alien-lovers clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as \\"alien\\" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase a hungry pizza-lover, the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as \\"pizza\\" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous. Similarly, there's a man-eating shark in these waters is nearly the opposite of there's a man eating shark at table 6; the first is a shark, and the second a man. A government-monitoring program is a program that monitors the government, whereas a government monitoring program is a government program that monitors something else. = Personal names = Some married couples compose a new surname (sometimes referred to as a double-barrelled name) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname. With already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Sam Taylor-Johnson. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a descendant of Louis Leml√© Dreyfus whose son was L√©opold Louis-Dreyfus. = Other compounds = Connecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in lily-of-the-valley, cock-a-hoop, clever- clever, tittle-tattle and orang-utan. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, orang-utan is also written as orangutan or orang utan, and lily-of- the-valley may be hyphenated or not. = Suspended hyphens = A suspended hyphen (also called a suspensive hyphen or hanging hyphen, or less commonly a dangling or floating hyphen) may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words that are connected by \\"and\\", \\"or\\", or \\"to\\". For example, nineteenth-century and twentieth-century may be written as nineteenth- and twentieth-century. This usage is now common and specifically recommended in some style guides.E.g. Suspended hyphens are also used, though less commonly, when the base word comes first, such as in \\"investor-owned and \\". Uses such as \\"applied and sociolinguistics\\" (instead of \\"applied linguistics and sociolinguistics\\") are frowned upon; the Indiana University style guide uses this example and says \\"Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open\\" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words). This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, ' becomes ' (not ') when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.  Other uses  A hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), telephone numbers or sports scores. It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an en dash (see examples at ). The hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words (filleting for redaction or censoring), as in G-d, although an en dash can be used as well (\\"G‚Äìd\\"). The hyphen is often used in reduplicatives.  Varied meanings  Some stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens to mark attributive phrases: * Disease-causing poor nutrition is poor nutrition that causes disease. * Disease causing poor nutrition is a disease that causes poor nutrition. * A hard-working man is a man who works hard. * A hard working man is a working man who is tough. * A man-eating shark is a shark that eats humans. * A man eating shark is a man who is eating shark meat. * Three- hundred-year-old trees are an indeterminate number of trees that are each 300 years old. * Three hundred-year-old trees are three trees that are each 100 years old. * Three hundred year-old trees are 300 trees that are each a year old.  Origin and history  epistle of St Jerome to Paulinus from the University of Texas copy. The page has 40 lines. The first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of Dionysius Thrax. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low tie mark between the two words.Nicolas, Nick. \\"Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation \\". 2005. Accessed 7 October 2014. In Greek these marks were known as enotikon, officially romanized as a hyphen. [Ellƒ´nik√≥s Organism√≥s Typopo√≠ƒ´sƒ´s, \\"Hellenic Organization for Standardization\\"]. [ELOT 743, 2ƒ´ Ekdosƒ´, \\"ELOT 743, \\"]. ELOT (Athens), 2001. With the introduction of letter-spacing in the Middle Ages, the hyphen, still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines. The modern format of the hyphen originated with Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, with the publication of his 42-line Bible. His tools did not allow for a sublinear hyphen, and he thus moved it to the middle of the line. Examination of an original copy on vellum (Hubay index #35) in the U. S. Library of Congress shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame. Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His double hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle:  In computing   Hyphen-minuses  In the ASCII character encoding, the hyphen is encoded as character 45. This character is called the hyphen-minus, as it is also used as a minus sign and even sometimes for en dashes. In Unicode, the hyphen-minus is encoded as so that Unicode remains compatible with ASCII. Unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately, as U+2010 and U+2212 respectively, along with the em dash U+2014 , en dash U+2013 and other related characters: these are the forms used in professional type-setting. The hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character that attempts to fulfil several roles, and wherever optimal typography is desired, the formal hyphen, minus, or other symbol should be used instead. For example, compare (minus) and (hyphen-minus); in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character will. However, the Unicode hyphen is inconvenient to enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus character remains very common. It is often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent an em dash in ASCII text. The hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying command-line options. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the getopt function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters, , to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with pipelining in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized in lieu of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a standard stream, instead of a file, is to be worked with.  Hard and soft hyphens  Although software (hyphenation algorithms) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed. In contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a hard hyphen (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation may occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.  Non-breaking hyphens  The non-breaking hyphen, nonbreaking hyphen, or no-break hyphen looks identical to the regular hyphen, but word processors treat it as a letter, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons. The word segmentation rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a word boundary and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. However, this is not always desirable behavior, especially when it could lead to ambiguity (e.g. recreation and re‚Äëcreation would be indistinguishable with a line break after re), or in languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in Irish or Romanian would be undesirable). In Unicode it is defined as .  Usage in date notation  In parts of Europe and in India, the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date. Germans and Slavs also used Roman numerals for the month; 14‚ÄëVII‚Äë1789 (14 July 1789), for example, is one way of writing the first Bastille Day, though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour. Plaques on the wall of the Moscow Kremlin are written this way. Use of hyphens, as opposed to the slashes used in the English language, is specified for international standards. International standard ISO 8601, which was accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., DIN 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen. This method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \\\\ and / as directory separators, but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \\\\ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.  Unicode  Apart from dash and minus sign, Unicode has multiple hyphen characters: * , a character of multiple uses * (see note) Note: The serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line. And in non-Latin scripts: (used only as a line-breaking hyphen) * (used in ancient Near- Eastern linguistics and in blackletter typefaces) * (used in hebrew) * (has the Unicode property of \\"Hyphen\\" despite its name) * (compatibility character for a small hyphen-minus, used in East Asian typography) * (compatibility character for a wide hyphen-minus, used in East Asian typography) * (compatibility character for a wide katakana middle dot, has the Unicode property of \\"Hyphen\\" despite its name) Unicode distinguishes the hyphen from the general interpunct. The characters below do not have the Unicode property of \\"Hyphen\\" despite their names:  (See interpunct and bullet (typography) for more round characters.)

In the English language, a semicolon can be used between two closely related independent clauses, provided they are not already joined by a coordinating conjunction. Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate the items in a list, particularly when the elements of that list contain commas. The semicolon is likely the least understood of the standard marks, and so it is not used by many English speakers. In the QWERTY keyboard layout, the semicolon resides in the unshifted homerow beneath the little finger of the right hand and has become widely used in programming languages as a statement separator or terminator.  History  The first printed semicolon was the work of the Italian printer Aldus Manutius the Elder in 1494. Manutius established the practice of using the semicolon to separate words of opposed meaning and to allow a rapid change in direction in connecting interdependent statements. Ben Jonson was the first notable English writer to use the semicolon systematically. The modern uses of the semicolon relate either to the listing of items or to the linking of related clauses.  English  Although terminal marks (i.e. full stops, exclamation marks, and question marks) indicate the end of a sentence, the comma, semicolon, and colon are normally sentence-internal, making them secondary boundary marks. The semicolon falls between terminal marks and the comma; its strength is equal to that of the colon.The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, Chapter 19, ¬ß 7. The plural of semicolon in English is semicola or semicolons.  Constraints  # When a semicolon marks the left boundary of a constituent (e.g., the beginning of a clause or a phrase), the right boundary is marked by punctuation of equal or greater strength. # When two or more semicolons are used within a single construction, all constituents are at the same level, unlike commas, which can separate, for example, subordinate clauses from main clauses.  Usage  Semicolons are followed by a lower case letter, unless that letter would ordinarily be capitalized mid-sentence (e.g., the word \\"I\\", acronyms/initialisms, or proper nouns). In older English printed texts, colons and semicolons are offset from the preceding word by a non-breaking space, a convention still current in present-day continental French texts. Ideally, the space is less wide than the inter-word spaces. Some guides recommend separation by a hair space. Modern style guides recommend no space before them and one space after. They also typically recommend placing semicolons outside ending quotation marks, although this was not always the case. For example, the first edition of The Chicago Manual of Style (1906) recommended placing the semicolon inside ending quotation marks. Applications of the semicolon in English include: * Between items in a series or listing containing internal punctuation, especially parenthetic commas, where the semicolons function as serial commas. The semicolon divides the items on the list to more discrete parts, without which the remaining jumble of commas could cause confusion for the reader. This is sometimes called the \\"super comma\\" function of the semicolon:  The people present were Jamie, a man from New Zealand; John, the milkman's son; and George, a gaunt kind of man with no friends.  Several fast food restaurants can be found within the following cities: London, England; Paris, France; Dublin, Ireland; and Madrid, Spain.  Here are three examples of familiar sequences: one, two, and three; a, b, and c; first, second, and third.  (Fig. 8; see also plates in Harley 1941, 1950; Schwab 1947). :*There does not have to be an unreasonable amount of commas, however, for the usage of semicolons to be justified: ...either of the following punishments: :::1. Death; :::2. Imprisonment; :::3. Fine; :::4. Removal from office; or, :::5. Disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit in this State. * Between closely related independent clauses not conjoined with a coordinating conjunction, when the two clauses are balanced, opposed or contradictory:  My wife would like tea; I would prefer coffee.  I went to the basketball court; I was told it was closed for cleaning.  I told Kate she's running for the hills; I wonder if she knew I was joking. *:Either clause may include commas; this is especially common when parallel wording is omitted from the second: :*Ted has two dogs; Sam, one. * In rare instances, when a comma replaces a period (full stop) in a quotation, or when a quotation otherwise links two independent sentences:  \\"I have no use for this,\\" he said; \\"you are welcome to it.\\"  \\"Is this your book?\\" she asked; \\"I found it on the floor.\\"A period (full stop) may also be used here: * \\"I have no use for this,\\" he said. \\"You are welcome to it.\\" * \\"Is this your book?\\" she asked. \\"I found it on the floor.\\"  Other languages   Arabic  In Arabic, the semicolon is called Fasila Manqoota () which means literally \\"a dotted comma\\", and is written inverted . In Arabic, the semicolon has several uses: * It can be used between two phrases, in which the first phrase causes the second.  Example: \\"He played a lot; so, his clothes became dirty\\". () * It can be used between two phrases, where the second is a reason for the first.  Example: \\"Your sister did not get high marks; she didn't study\\". ()  Greek, Church Slavonic  In Greek and Church Slavonic, a semicolon indicates a question, similar to a Latin question mark. To indicate a long pause or separate sections, each with commas (the semicolon's purpose in English), Greek uses, but extremely rarely, the , an Interpunct . Church Slavonic example: –≥–¥—£ —î—Å—Ç—å —Ä–æ–∂–¥e–π—Å—ß —Ü–∞—Ä—å —ó—É–¥e–π—Å–∫—ñ–π; (Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? ‚Äì Matthew 2:1) Greek Example: Œ§Œπ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒºŒπŒ± Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÉœçŒΩŒ¥ŒµœÉŒ∑; (What is a interpunct?)  French  In French, a semicolon (point-virgule, literally \\"dot-comma\\") is a separation between two full sentences, used where either a colon or a comma would not be appropriate. The phrase following a semicolon has to be an independent clause, which is related to the previous one (but not explaining it, contrary to a sentence introduced by a colon). The dash character is used in French writing too, but not as widely as the semicolon. Usage of these devices (semicolon and dash) varies from author to author.  Literature  Some authors have avoided and rejected the usage of the semicolon throughout their works. Lynne Truss stated: \\"Samuel Beckett spliced his way merrily through such novels as Molloy and Malone Dies, thumbing his nose at the semicolon all the way. James Joyce preferred the colon, as he thought it was more authentically classical. P. G. Wodehouse did an effortlessly marvelous job without it, George Orwell tried to avoid the semicolon completely in Coming Up for Air (1939), Martin Amis included just one semicolon in Money (1984), and Umberto Eco was congratulated by an academic reader for using zero semicolons in The Name of the Rose (1983).\\" In response to Truss, Ben Macintyre, a columnist in The Times, wrote: \\"Americans have long regarded the semi-colon with suspicion, as a genteel, self-conscious, neither-one-thing- nor-the other sort of punctuation mark, with neither the butchness of a full colon nor the flighty promiscuity of the comma. Hemingway, Chandler and Stephen King wouldn‚Äôt be seen dead in a ditch with a semi-colon (though Truman Capote might). Real men, goes the unwritten rule of American punctuation, don‚Äôt use semi-colons.\\" In his book titled A Man Without a Country, Kurt Vonnegut writes: \\"Semicolons are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.\\"  Encoding in digital media  The semicolon was common on typewriters and therefore was assigned a position in most computer codes, such as EBCDIC at 94 (0x5E), and ASCII at 59 (0x3B). The ASCII position was inherited by Unicode, which has also added several related characters: * ‚Äì inherited from ASCII ‚Äì Arabic script * ‚Äì Ge Ωez script * ‚Äì used in old writing systems, such as Hungarian Runichttp://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3664.pdf * ‚Äì used in the APL programming language * ‚Äì \\"indicates sudden glottal closure\\" * ‚Äì Bamum script * ‚Äì determines orientation when wide-character scripts are written vertically instead of horizontally * ‚Äì Small Form Variants are for compatibility with Chinese National Standard CNS 11643 * ‚Äì for use in wide-character scripts such as kanji * ‚Äì deprecated tags block  Computing usage   Programming  In computer programming, the semicolon is often used to separate multiple statements (for example, in Perl, Pascal, PL/I, and SQL; see Pascal: Semicolons as statement separators). In other languages, semicolons are called terminators and are required after every statement (such as in Java, and the C family). Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s. An influential and frequently-cited study in this debate was , which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator: \\"The most important [result] was that having a semicolon as a statement terminator was better than having a semicolon as a statement separator.\\"Software Metrics: An Analysis and Evaluation, 1981, 324}} The study has been criticized as flawed by proponents of semicolon as a separator, due to participants being familiar with a semicolon-as-terminator language and unrealistically strict grammar. Nevertheless, the debate ended in favor of semicolon as terminator. Therefore, semicolon provides structure to the programming language. Semicolons are optional in a number of languages, including BCPL, Python, Eiffel, and Go, meaning that they are part of the formal grammar for the language, but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g. by end of line that ends a statement (in Go)). As languages can be designed without them, semicolons are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some. The use of semicolons in control flow structures and blocks of code is varied ‚Äì semicolons are generally omitted after a closing brace, but included for a single statement branch of a control structure (the \\"then\\" clause), except in Pascal, where a semicolon terminates the entire if...then...else clause (to avoid dangling else) and thus is not allowed between a \\"then\\" and the corresponding \\"else\\", as this causes unnesting. This use originates with ALGOL 60, and falls between the comma used as a list separator and the period/full stop used to mark the end of the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses, and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the comma operator that separates expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period as the end of the program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in Erlang (1986), where commas separate expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.What Sucks About Erlang, Damien Katz, 9 March 2008 In some cases the distinction between a separator and a terminator is strong, such as early versions of Pascal, where a final semicolon yields a syntax error. In other cases a final semicolon is treated either as optional syntax, or as being followed by a null statement, which is either ignored or treated as a NOP (no operation or null command); compare trailing commas in lists. In some cases a blank statement is allowed, allowing a sequence of semicolons or the use of a semicolon by itself as the body of a control flow structure. For example, a blank statement (a semicolon by itself) stands for a NOP in C/C++, which is useful in busy waiting synchronization loops. APL uses semicolons to separate declarations of local variables, and to separate axes when indexing multi-dimensional arrays, for example \`matrix[2;3]\`. Other languages (for instance, some assembly languages and LISP dialects, CONFIG.SYS and INI files) use semicolons to mark the beginning of comments. Example C code: int main() { int x, y; x = 1; y = 2; printf(\\"X + Y = %d\\", x + y); return 0; } Or in JavaScript: var x = 1; var y = 2; alert(\\"X + Y = \\" + (x + y)); Conventionally, in many languages, each statement is written on a separate line, but this is not typically a requirement of the language. In the above examples, two statements are placed on the same line; this is legal, because the semicolon separates the two statements. Thus programming languages like Java, the C family, Javascript etc. use semicolons to obtain a proper structure in the respective languages.  Data  The semicolon is often used to separate elements of a string of text. For example, multiple e-mail addresses in the \\"To\\" field in some e-mail clients have to be delimited by a semicolon. In Microsoft Excel, the semicolon is used as a list separator, especially in cases where the decimal separator is a comma, such as \` 0,32; 3,14; 4,50\`, instead of \`0.32, 3.14, 4.50\`. In MATLAB and GNU Octave, the semicolon can be used as a row separator when defining a vector or matrix (whereas a comma separates the columns within a row of a vector or matrix) or to execute a command silently, without displaying the resulting output value in the console. In HTML, a semicolon is used to terminate a character entity reference, either named or numeric. The declarations of a style attribute in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are separated and terminated with semicolons.\\"CSS Syntax\\", W3Schools The file system of VAX/VMS, Files-11, uses semicolons to indicate a file's version number.\\"VMS Help ‚Äì Ext File Specs, Using File Specification Differences\\" The semicolon is permitted in long filenames in the Microsoft Windows file systems NTFS and VFAT, but not in its short names.\\"Filename\\", microsoft.com, 31 May 2018 In some delimiter-separated values file formats, the semicolon is used as the separator character, as an alternative to comma-separated values.  Mathematics  In the argument list of a mathematical function f(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots; a_1, a_2, \\\\dots), a semicolon may be used to separate variables from fixed parameters. In differential geometry, a semicolon preceding an index is used to indicate the covariant derivative of a function with respect to the coordinate associated with that index. In the calculus of relations, the semicolon is used in infix notation for the composition of relations: A;B \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\\\\\{(x,z): \\\\exists y \\\\ \\\\ xAy \\\\ \\\\land\\\\ yBz \\\\\\\\} .  Other uses  The semicolon is commonly used as parts of emoticons, in order to indicate winking or crying, as in \`;)\` and \`;_;\`. Project Semicolon is the name of a faith-based anti-suicide initiative (since the semicolon continues a sentence rather than ending it) which has led to the punctuation mark becoming a highly symbolic and popular tattoo, which is most commonly done on the wrist. The Humphrey point is sometimes used instead of a decimal point in duodecimal numbers.

The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungus in the plant's rhizosphere, its root system. Mycorrhizae play important roles in plant nutrition, soil biology and soil chemistry. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi. The association is sometimes mutualistic. In particular species or in particular circumstances mycorrhizae may have a parasitic association with host plants. Definition A mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a green plant and a fungus. The plant makes organic molecules such as sugars by photosynthesis and supplies them to the fungus, and the fungus supplies to the plant water and mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus, taken from the soil. Mycorrhizas are located in the roots of vascular plants, but mycorrhiza-like associations also occur in bryophytes and there is fossil evidence that early land plants that lacked roots formed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Most plant species form mycorrhizal associations, though some families like Brassicaceae and Chenopodiaceae cannot. Different forms for the association are detailed in the next section. The most common is the arbuscular type that is present in 70% of plant species, including many crop plants such as wheat and rice. Types Mycorrhizas are commonly divided into ectomycorrhizas and endomycorrhizas. The two types are differentiated by the fact that the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane.Harley, J.L. and S.E. Smith 1983. Mycorrhizal symbiosis (1st ed.). Academic Press, London.Allen, Michael F. 1991. The ecology of mycorrhizae. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Endomycorrhiza includes arbuscular, ericoid, and orchid mycorrhiza, while arbutoid mycorrhizas can be classified as ectoendomycorrhizas. Monotropoid mycorrhizas form a special category. Ectomycorrhiza Beech is ectomycorrhizal Leccinum aurantiacum, an ectomycorrhizal fungus Ectomycorrhizas, or EcM, are symbiotic associations between the roots of around 10% of plant families, mostly woody plants including the birch, dipterocarp, eucalyptus, oak, pine, and rose families, orchids, and fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota. Some EcM fungi, such as many Leccinum and Suillus, are symbiotic with only one particular genus of plant, while other fungi, such as the Amanita, are generalists that form mycorrhizas with many different plants. An individual tree may have 15 or more different fungal EcM partners at one time. Thousands of ectomycorrhizal fungal species exist, hosted in over 200 genera. A recent study has conservatively estimated global ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness at approximately 7750 species, although, on the basis of estimates of knowns and unknowns in macromycete diversity, a final estimate of ECM species richness would probably be between 20,000 and 25,000. Ectomycorrhizas consist of a hyphal sheath, or mantle, covering the root tip and a Hartig net of hyphae surrounding the plant cells within the root cortex. In some cases the hyphae may also penetrate the plant cells, in which case the mycorrhiza is called an ectendomycorrhiza. Outside the root, ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium forms an extensive network within the soil and leaf litter. Nutrients can be shown to move between different plants through the fungal network. Carbon has been shown to move from paper birch trees into Douglas-fir trees thereby promoting succession in ecosystems. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor has been found to lure and kill springtails to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, Eastern White Pine inoculated with L. bicolor was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails.Fungi kill insects and feed host plants BNET.com When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine. The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete L. bicolor, was published in 2008. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication. L. bicolor is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast, L. bicolor possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. =Arbutoid mycorrhiza= This type of mycorrhiza involves plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally and in terms of the fungi involved. It differs from ectomycorrhiza in that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an ectendomycorrhiza.Some plants may depend more on friendly fungi than own leaves: Study Endomycorrhiza Endomycorrhizas are variable and have been further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas. Wheat is arbuscular mycorrhizal =Arbuscular mycorrhiza= Arbuscular mycorrhizas, or AM (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, or VAM), are mycorrhizas whose hyphae penetrate plant cells, producing structures that are either balloon-like (vesicles) or dichotomously branching invaginations (arbuscules) as a means of nutrient exchange. The fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. the interior of the cell), but invaginate the cell membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are formed only by fungi in the division Glomeromycota. Fossil evidence and DNA sequence analysis suggest that this mutualism appeared 400-460 million years ago, when the first plants were colonizing land. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in 85% of all plant families, and occur in many crop species. The hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce the glycoprotein glomalin, which may be one of the major stores of carbon in the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have (possibly) been asexual for many millions of years and, unusually, individuals can contain many genetically different nuclei (a phenomenon called heterokaryosis). =Ericoid mycorrhiza= An ericoid mycorrhizal fungus isolated from Woollsia pungens Ericoid mycorrhizas are the third of the three more ecologically important types. They have a simple intraradical (grow in cells) phase, consisting of dense coils of hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don't extend very far into the surrounding soil. They might form sporocarps (probably in the form of small cups), but their reproductive biology is little understood. Ericoid mycorrhizas have also been shown to have considerable saprotrophic capabilities, which would enable plants to receive nutrients from not-yet-decomposed materials via the decomposing actions of their ericoid partners. =Orchid mycorrhiza= All orchids are myco-heterotrophic at some stage during their lifecycle and form orchid mycorrhizas with a range of basidiomycete fungi. Their hyphae penetrate into the root cells and form pelotons (coils) for nutrient exchange. =Monotropoid mycorrhiza= This type of mycorrhiza occurs in the subfamily Monotropoideae of the Ericaceae, as well as several genera in the Orchidaceae. These plants are heterotrophic or mixotrophic and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, parasitic type of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Mutualist dynamics Nutrient exchanges and communication between a mycorrhizal fungus and plants. Mycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The Orchidaceae are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds. Recent research into ectomycorrhizal plants in boreal forests has indicated that mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship that may be more complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. They go on to explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines. It has also been suggested that evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships can explain much more variation in the strength of mycorrhizal mutualisms than ecological factors. Within mutualistic mycorrhiza, the plant gives carbohydrates (products of photosynthesis) to the fungus, while the fungus gives the plant water and minerals in exchange. Sugar-water/mineral exchange In this mutualism, fungal hyphae (E) increase the surface area of the root and uptake of key nutrients while the plant supplies the fungi with fixed carbon (A=root cortex, B=root epidermis, C=arbuscle, D=vesicle, F=root hair, G=nuclei). The mycorrhizal mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium's higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant root hairs, and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants' roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant's mineral absorption capabilities. Unaided plant roots may be unable to take up nutrients that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus, many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake.C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

Washington DC Inga alley cropping, proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction,Elkan, Daniel. Slash-and-burn farming has become a major threat to the world's rainforest The Guardian 21 April 2004 relies upon mycorrhiza within the root system of species of Inga to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.rainforestsaver.org: What is Inga alley cropping? In some more complex relationships, mycorrhizal fungi do not just collect immobilised soil nutrients, but connect individual plants together by mycorrhizal networks that transport water, carbon, and other nutrients directly from plant to plant through underground hyphal networks.Simard, S.W.; Beiler, K.J.; Bingham, M.A.; Deslippe, J.R.; Philip, L.J. and Teste, F.P. 2012. \\"Mycorrhizal networks: Mechanisms, ecology and modeling\\". \\"Fungal Biology Review\\" 26: 39-60 Suillus tomentosus, a basidiomycete fungus, produces specialized structures known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae with its plant host lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). These structures have been shown to host nitrogen fixing bacteria which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites. Mechanisms The mechanisms by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi differs from that of plants. For example, they may secrete organic acids that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils. Disease, drought and salinity resistance and its correlation to mycorrhizae Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens. These associations have been found to assist in plant defense both above and belowground. Mycorrhizas have been found to excrete enzymes that are toxic to soil borne organisms such as nematodes. More recent studies have shown that mycorrhizal associations result in a priming effect of plants that essentially acts as a primary immune response. When this association is formed a defense response is activated similarly to the response that occurs when the plant is under attack. As a result of this inoculation, defense responses are stronger in plants with mycorrhizal associations. AMF was also significantly correlated with soil biological fertility variables such as soil microbial communities and associated disease suppressiveness. Thus, ecosystem services provided by AMF may depend on the soil microbiome. Furthermore, AMF was significantly correlated with soil physical variable, but only with water level and not with aggregate stability. and are also more resistant to the effects of drought. The significance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi includes alleviation of salt stress and its beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. Although salinity can negatively affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, many reports show improved growth and performance of mycorrhizal plants under salt stress conditions Porcel R, Aroca, R, Ruiz-Lozano JM (2012) \\"Salinity stress alleviation using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. A review\\" Agronomy for Sustainable Development 32: 181-200 Resistance to insects Research has shown that plants connected by mycorrhizal fungi can use these underground connections to produce and receive warning signals. Specifically, when a host plant is attacked by an aphid, the plant signals surrounding connected plants of its condition. The host plant releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that attract the insect's predators. The plants connected by mycorrhizal fungi are also prompted to produce identical VOCs that protect the uninfected plants from being targeted by the insect. Additionally, this assists the mycorrhizal fungi by preventing the plant's carbon relocation which negatively affects the fungi's growth and occurs when the plant is attacked by herbivores. Colonization of barren soil Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients.Root fungi turn rock into soil Planet Earth Online 3 July 2009 The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in early succession or on degraded landscapes. The introduction of alien mycorrhizal plants to nutrient-deficient ecosystems puts indigenous non-mycorrhizal plants at a competitive disadvantage. This aptitude to colonize barren soil is defined by the category Oligotroph. Resistance to toxicity Fungi have been found to have a protective role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and contaminated soils. Pine trees inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth. One study discovered the existence of Suillus luteus strains with varying tolerance of zinc. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of Suillus bovinus conferred resistance to plants of Pinus sylvestris. This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances. Occurrence of mycorrhizal associations At around 400 million years old, the Rhynie chert contains an assemblage of fossil plants preserved in sufficient detail that mycorrhizas have been observed in the stems of Aglaophyton major. Mycorrhizas are present in 92% of plant families studied (80% of species), with arbuscular mycorrhizas being the ancestral and predominant form, and the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the plant kingdom. The structure of arbuscular mycorrhizas has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record, with both the development of ectomycorrhizas, and the loss of mycorrhizas, evolving convergently on multiple occasions. Discovery Associations of fungi with the roots of plants have been known since at least the mid-19th century. However early observers simply recorded the fact without investigating the relationships between the two organisms. This symbiosis was studied and described by Franciszek Kamie≈Ñski in 1879‚Äì1882.Kamie≈Ñski, F. (1882). \\"Les organes v√©g√©tatifs de Monotropa hypopitys L.\\".

Paul John Holbrook \\"Jack\\" Vance (August 28, 1916 ‚Äì May 26, 2013) was an American mystery, fantasy, and science fiction writer. Though most of his work has been published under the name Jack Vance, he also wrote several mystery novels under different pen names. Vance won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984 and he was a Guest of Honor at the 1992 World Science Fiction Convention in Orlando, Florida. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 15th Grand Master in 1997 and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers. Among his awards for particular works were: Hugo Awards, in 1963 for The Dragon Masters, in 1967 for The Last Castle, and in 2010 for his memoir This is Me, Jack Vance!; a Nebula Award in 1966, also for The Last Castle; the Jupiter Award in 1975; the World Fantasy Award in 1990 for Lyonesse: Madouc. He also won an Edgar Award for the best first mystery novel in 1961 for The Man in the Cage. While his first publications were stories in science fiction magazines, as he became well known, he published novellas and novels, a number of which were translated into Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Italian and German. An Integral Edition of all Vance's works was published in 44 volumes and in 2010 a six-volume The Complete Jack Vance was released. A 2009 profile in The New York Times Magazine described Vance as \\"one of American literature's most distinctive and undervalued voices\\". He died at his home in Oakland, California on May 26, 2013, aged 96.  Biography  Vance's great-grandfather is believed to have arrived in California from Michigan a decade before the Gold Rush and married a San Francisco woman.Williams, David B. THE WORLD-THINKER: A biographical sketch and literary assessment of Jack Vance Early family records were apparently destroyed in the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Vance‚Äôs maternal grandfather, L. M. (Ludwig Mathias) Hoefler, was a successful lawyer in San Francisco. Vance grew up in the family's large house in San Francisco on Filbert Street. When Vance's father left the family to live in his ranch in Mexico, the family's house in San Francisco was rented out to the father's sister. With the separation of his parents, and the loss of use of the San Francisco house, Vance's mother moved him and his siblings to their maternal grandfather's California ranch near Oakley in the delta of the Sacramento River. This setting formed Vance's love of the outdoors, and allowed him time to indulge his passion as an avid reader of his mother's large book collection, which included Edgar Rice Burroughs‚Äô Tarzan of the Apes and his Barsoom novels and Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island. When Vance explored the nearby town, he started reading pulp fiction magazines at the local drugstore. With the death of his grandfather, who supported the family, which coincided with the economic challenges of Great Depression, the Vance's family fortune nosedived, and Vance was forced to leave junior college and work to support himself, assisting his mother when able. Vance plied many trades for short stretches: as a bellhop (a \\"miserable year\\"), in a cannery, and on a gold dredge.Jack Vance, Biographical Sketch (2000) in Jack Vance: critical appreciations and a bibliography, British Library, 2000. Vance described this era as a time of personal change: ‚ÄúOver a span of four or five years, I developed from an impractical little intellectual into a rather reckless young man, competent at many skills and crafts, and determined to try every phase of life.‚Äù Subsequently, he entered the University of California, Berkeley where, over a six-year period, he studied mining engineering, physics, journalism and English. Vance wrote one of his first science fiction stories for an English class assignment; his professor's reaction was \\"We also have a piece of science fiction\\" in a scornful tone, Vance's first negative review. He worked for a while as an electrician in the naval shipyards at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii‚Äîfor \\"56 cents an hour\\". After working on a degaussing crew for a period, he left about a month before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Vance graduated in 1942. Weak eyesight prevented military service. He found a job as a rigger at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, and enrolled in an Army Intelligence program to learn Japanese, but washed out. In 1943, he memorized an eye chart and became an able seaman in the Merchant Marine. In later years, boating remained his favorite recreation; boats and voyages are a frequent motif in his work. He worked as a seaman, a rigger, a surveyor, a ceramicist, and a carpenter before he established himself fully as a writer, which did not occur until the 1970s. Jack Vance playing the jazz banjo and kazoo in 1979 in San Francisco From his youth, Vance had been fascinated by Dixieland and traditional jazz. He was an amateur of the cornet and ukulele, often accompanying himself with a kazoo, and was a competent harmonica player. His first published writings were jazz reviews for The Daily Californian, his college paper, and music is an element in many of his works. In 1946, Vance met and married Norma Genevieve Ingold (died March 25, 2008), another Cal student. Vance continued to live in Oakland, in a house he built and extended with his family over the years, including a hand-carved wooden ceiling from Kashmir. The Vances had extensive travels,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/30/jack-vance- dies-96-science-fiction including one around-the-world voyage, and often spent several months at a time living in places like Ireland, Tahiti, South Africa, Positano (in Italy) and on a houseboat on Lake Nagin in Kashmir. Vance began trying to become a professional writer in the late 1940s, as part of the San Francisco Renaissance, a movement of experimentation in literature and the arts. His first lucrative sale was one of the early Magnus Ridolph stories to Twentieth Century Fox, who also hired him as a screenwriter for the Captain Video television series. The proceeds supported the Vances for a year's travel in Europe. There are various references to the Bay Area Bohemian life in his work. In the 1950s, Vance started a pottery and ceramics hobby, buying a kiln; this interest was an influence on his story \\"The Potters of Firsk‚Äù (1950). Science fiction authors Frank Herbert and Poul Anderson were among Vance's closest friends. In the early 1950s, when Frank Herbert was a reporter, he interviewed Vance, and the men became friends. They moved to Mexico with their families to establish a \\"writer‚Äôs colony\\" at Lake Chapala, near Guadalajara. In 1962, Vance, Frank Herbert and Poul Anderson jointly built a houseboat which they sailed in the Sacramento Delta. The Vances and the Herberts lived near Lake Chapala in Mexico together for a period. Vance's interest in houseboats led him to depict them in ‚ÄúThe Moon Moth‚Äù (1961), The Palace of Love (1967), and in chapter 2 of Wyst: Alastor 1716 (1978). In the early 1980s, Vance‚Äôs became increasingly interested in sailing, and he started building a 36-foot trimaran. Later, he owned a 17-foot cutter-rigged boat, called Venture, a 35-foot ketch-rigged boat named Columbia, later a 45-foot boat named Hinano. While Vance derived pleasure from his sailing hobby, his increasingly poor eyesight and the high costs of outfitting, berthing, and maintaining the vessel led him to sell Hinano. Vance's failing eyesight also led him to cease his amateur jazz hobby. Although legally blind since the 1980s, Vance continued to write with the aid of BigEd software, written especially for him by Kim Kokkonen. His final novel was Lurulu. Although Vance had stated Lurulu would be his final book,Jack Vance, Preface in The Jack Vance Treasury, Terry Dowling and Jonathan Strahan (editors), Subterranean Press, he subsequently completed an autobiography, which was published in July 2009.  Death  Vance died on the morning of May 26, 2013 at the age of 96 in his home in the Oakland Hills. Vance's son John Holbrook Vance II described the cause as the complications of old age, saying, \\"everything just finally caught up with him.\\" Tributes to Vance were given by various authors, including George R. R. Martin, Michael Moorcock, Neil Gaiman, and Elizabeth Bear. Steven Gould, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, described Vance as \\"one of the greatest science fiction and fantasy writers of the 20th century\\". A memorial site set up by his family to post tributes received hundreds of messages in the days following his death. Work French edition of The Many Worlds of Magnus Ridolph, illustrating \\"The Kokod Warriors\\" Vance made his debut in print with \\"The World-Thinker\\", a 16-page story published by Sam Merwin in Thrilling Wonder Stories, Summer 1945. His lifetime output totals more than 60 books‚Äîperhaps almost 90. His work has been published in three categories: science fiction, fantasy and mystery. Among Vance's earliest published work was a set of fantasy stories written while he served in the merchant marine during the war. They appeared in 1950, several years after Vance had started publishing science fiction in the pulp magazines, under the title The Dying Earth.Vance's original title, used for the Vance Integral Edition, is Mazirian the Magician. Vance wrote many science fiction short stories in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were published in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, The Telephone was Ringing in the Dark, published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jack-vance-gz7hktrdpjw Some of these are not mysteries, such as Bird Isle, and many fit uneasily in the category. These stories are set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea. Many themes important to his more famous science fiction novels appeared first in the mysteries. The most obvious is the \\"book of dreams\\", which appears in Bad Ronald and The View from Chickweed's Window, prior to being featured in The Book of Dreams. The revenge theme is also more prominent in certain mysteries than in the science fiction (The View from Chickweed's Window in particular). Bad Ronald was adapted to a TV film of the same name aired on ABC in 1974, as well as a French production (M√©chant gar√ßon) in 1992; this and Man in the Cage are the only works by Vance to be made into film to date. Vance's Hugo Award-winning novella The Dragon Masters was the cover story on the August 1962 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction Certain of the science fiction stories are also mysteries, penned using his full name John Holbrook Vance, three under the house pseudonym Ellery Queen, and one each using the pseudonyms Alan Wade, Peter Held, John van See, and Jay Kavanse. Some editions of his published works give his year of birth as 1920.In addition to the comic Magnus Ridolph stories, two major stories feature the effectuator Miro Hetzel, a futuristic detective, and Araminta Station is largely concerned with solving various murders. Vance returned to the \\"dying Earth\\" setting (a far distant future in which the sun is slowly going out, and magic and technology coexist) to write the picaresque adventures of the ne'er-do-well scoundrel Cugel the Clever, and those of the magician Rhialto the Marvellous. These books were written in 1963, 1978 and 1981. His other major fantasy work, Lyonesse (a trilogy comprising Suldrun's Garden, The Green Pearl, and Madouc), was completed in 1989 and set on a mythological archipelago off the coast of France in the early Middle Ages. Vance's stories written for pulps in the 1940s and 1950s covered many science fiction themes, with a tendency to emphasize mysterious and biological themes (ESP, genetics, brain parasites, body switching, other dimensions, cultures) rather than technical ones. Robots, for example, are almost entirely absent, though the short story \\"The Uninhibited Robot\\" features a computer gone awry. Many of the early stories are comic. By the 1960s, Vance had developed a futuristic setting that he came to call the Gaean Reach, a fictional region of space settled by humans. Thereafter, all his science fiction was, more or less explicitly, set therein. The Gaean Reach per se is loose and expanding. Each planet has its own history, state of development and culture. Within the Reach conditions tend to be peaceable and commerce tends to dominate. At the edges of the Reach, out in the lawless Beyond, conditions are usually less secure. Vance influenced many writers in the genre. Most notably, Michael Shea wrote a sequel to Eyes of the Overworld, featuring Cugel the Clever, before Vance did one himself (called Cugel's Saga). Vance gave permission, and the book by Shea went into print before Vance's. Shea's book, A Quest For Simbilis, is entirely in keeping with the vision of Vance. Cugel is a complete rogue, who is nevertheless worthy of sympathy in always failing to achieve his goals.  Literary influences  Vance's novella \\"Gateway to Strangeness\\" was the cover story in the August 1962 issue of Amazing Stories, illustrated by Alex Schomburg. Under the title \\"Dust of Far Suns\\", it became the title piece in a Vance story collection in 1981 When asked about literary influences, Vance most often cited Jeffery Farnol, a writer of adventure books, whose style of \\"high\\" language he mentions (the Farnol title Guyfford of Weare being a typical instance); P. G. Wodehouse, an influence apparent in Vance's taste for overbearing aunts; and L. Frank Baum, whose fantasy elements were directly borrowed by Vance (see 'The Emerald City of Oz').articles in Cosmopolis In the introduction to Dowling and Strahan's The Jack Vance Treasury, Vance mentions that his childhood reading including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Verne, Robert W. Chambers, science fiction published by Edward Stratemeyer, the magazines Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, and Lord Dunsany. According to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance's earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of James Branch Cabell.Lin Carter, Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy, New York: Ballantine Books, 1973, p. 151. SBN 345-03309-4-125. . . Fantasy historian Lin Carter notes several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance's work, and suggests that the early \\"pseudo-Cabell\\" experiments bore fruit in The Dying Earth (1950).Carter, pp. 151‚Äì53. SF critic Don Herron Jack Vance, Writers of the 21st Century series, New York: Taplinger, 1980, p. 87 ff. cites Clark Ashton Smith as an influence on Vance's style and characters' names.  Characteristics and commentary  Vance's science fiction runs the gamut from stories written for pulps in the 1940s to multi-volume tales set in the space age. While Vance's stories have a wide variety of temporal settings, a majority of them belong to a period long after humanity has colonized other stars, culminating in the development of a region of interstellar space called the Gaean Reach. In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has an aura of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class. Vance's stories are seldom concerned directly with war. The conflicts are rarely direct. Sometimes at the edges of the Reach or in the lawless Beyond a planet is menaced or craftily exploited, though more extensive battles are described in The Dragon Masters, \\"The Miracle Workers\\", and the Lyonesse Trilogy, in which medieval-style combat abounds. His characters usually become inadvertently enmeshed in low-intensity conflicts between alien cultures; this is the case in Emphyrio, the Tschai series, the Durdane series, or the comic stories in Galactic Effectuator, featuring Miro Hetzel. Personal, cultural, social, or political conflicts are the central concerns. This is most particularly the case in the Cadwal series, though it is equally characteristic of the three Alastor books, Maske: Thaery, and, one way or another, most of the science fiction novels. Another way in which Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most speculative fiction writers are the extensive details ranging from the culture of language, to food, and music. In the story entitled The Moon Moth, for example, natives must master a number of musical instruments in order to communicate with each other -spoken words are modulated to acquire different meanings, or may be said to be given full meaning, (respect, derision or sarcasm) by means of the musical sounds. These fascinating details paint a far more detailed and complex picture of life in his books. The \\"Joe Bain\\" stories (The Fox Valley Murders, The Pleasant Grove Murders, and an unfinished outline published by the VIE) are set in an imaginary northern California county; these are the nearest to the classical mystery form, with a rural policeman as protagonist. Bird Isle, by contrast, is not a mystery at all, but a Wodehousian idyll (also set near San Francisco), while The Flesh Mask or Strange People ... emphasize psychological drama. The theme of both The House on Lily Street and Bad Ronald is solipsistic megalomania, taken up again in the Demon Princes cycle of science fiction novels. Three books published under the house name Ellery Queen were written to editorial requirements and heavily revised by the publisher. (Volume 45 of The Vance Integral Edition contains the original text for the three Ellery Queen novels. Vance previously refused to acknowledge them for their degree of rewriting.) Four others reflect Vance's world travels: Strange People, Queer Notions based on his stay in Positano, Italy; The Man in the Cage, based on a trip to Morocco; The Dark Ocean, set on a merchant marine vessel; and The Deadly Isles, based on a stay in Tahiti. The mystery novels reveal much about Vance's evolution as a science fiction and fantasy writer. He stopped working in the mystery genre in the early 1970s, except for science-fiction mysteries; see below. Bad Ronald is especially noteworthy for its portrayal of a trial-run for Howard Alan Treesong of The Book of Dreams. The Edgar-Award-winning The Man in the Cage is a thriller set in North Africa at around the period of the French-Algerian war. A Room to Die In is a classic 'locked-room' murder mystery featuring a strong-willed young woman as the amateur detective. Bird Isle, a mystery set at a hotel on an island off the California coast, reflects Vance's taste for farce. Vance's two rural Northern California mysteries featuring Sheriff Joe Bain were well received by the critics. The New York Times said of The Fox Valley Murders: \\"Mr. Vance has created the county with the same detailed and loving care with which, in the science fiction he writes as Jack Vance, he can create a believable alien planet.\\" And Dorothy B. Hughes, in The Los Angeles Times, wrote that it was \\"fat with character and scene\\". As for the second Bain novel, The New York Times said: \\"I like regionalism in American detective stories, and I enjoy reading about the problems of a rural county sheriff ... and I bless John Holbrook Vance for the best job of satisfying these tastes with his wonderful tales of Sheriff Joe Bain ...\\". Vance has also written mysteries set in his science fiction universes. An early 1950s short story series features Magnus Ridolph, an interstellar adventurer and amateur detective who is elderly and not prone to knocking anyone down, and whose exploits appear to have been inspired, in part, by those of Jack London's South Seas adventurer, Captain David Grief. The \\"Galactic Effectuator\\" novelettes feature Miro Hetzel, a figure who resembles Ridolph in his blending of detecting and troubleshooting (the \\"effectuating\\" indicated by the title). A number of the other science fiction novels include mystery, spy thriller, or crime-novel elements: The Houses of Iszm, Son of the Tree, the Alastor books Trullion and Marune, the Cadwal series, and large parts of the Demon Princes series. According to writer Michael Chabon, \\"Jack Vance is the most painful case of all the writers I love who I feel don‚Äôt get the credit they deserve. If ‚ÄòThe Last Castle‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Dragon Masters‚Äô had the name Italo Calvino on it, or just a foreign name, it would be received as a profound meditation, but because he's Jack Vance and published in Amazing Whatever, there's this insurmountable barrier.\\" Vance fans developed a website called Totality (pharesm.org), which enables users to do electronic searches of the Vance Integral Edition texts.  Publication  For most of his career, Vance's work suffered the vicissitudes common to most writers in his chosen field: ephemeral publication of stories in magazine form, short-lived softcover editions, in which stories sometimes were insensitively edited beyond his control. As he became more widely recognized, conditions improved, and his works became internationally renowned among aficionados. Much of his work has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Esperanto, French, Spanish, Russian, and Italian. Beginning in the 1960s, Jack Vance's work has also been extensively translated into German. In the large German-language market, his books continue to be widely read. Vance was an original member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. Its purpose was to promote the sword and sorcery subgenre (such as Dying Earth stories by Vance), and some new works were published in Flashing Swords! anthologies edited by Carter, in both mass- market paperback and Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club editions. In 1976, the fantasy/sf small press Underwood-Miller released their first publication, the first hardcover edition of The Dying Earth in a high-quality limited edition of just over 1000 copies. Other titles in the \\"Dying Earth\\" cycle also received hardcover treatment from Underwood-Miller shortly thereafter, such as The Eyes of the Overworld and Cugel's Saga. After these first publications and until the mid-1990s, Underwood-Miller published many of Vance's works, including his mystery fiction, often in limited editions featuring dustjacket artwork by leading fantasy artists. The entire Jack Vance output from Underwood-Miller comes close to a complete collection of Vance's previously published works, many of which had not seen hardcover publication. Also, many of these editions are described as \\"the author's preferred text\\", meaning that they have not been drastically edited. In the mid-1990s, Tim Underwood and Charles Miller parted company. However, they have continued to publish Vance titles individually, including such works as Emphyrio and To Live Forever by Miller, and a reprint edition of The Eyes of the Overworld by Underwood. Because of the low print-run on many of these titles, often they could only be found in science fiction bookstores at the time of their release.  The Vance Integral Edition  An Integral Edition of all Vance's works was published in a limited edition of 44 hardback volumes. A special 45th volume contains the three novels Vance wrote as Ellery Queen. This edition was created from 1999 to 2006 by 300 volunteers working via the internet, under the aegis of the author. The texts and titles used are those preferred by the author. In 2010, Afton House Books presented The Complete Jack Vance in six large volumes using texts prepared by the Vance Integral Edition. In 2012, Spatterlight Press started offering DRM-free e-books editions of many of the works of Jack Vance, based on the source texts collected by the Integral Edition project. It is the intent of Spatterlight Press to publish the complete Integral Edition in e-book form, and also as print-on-demand paperbacks. Gollancz use the VIE texts in their \\"SF Gateway\\" e-ditions starting in 2012.  List of works Books inspired by Vance * A Quest for Simbilis by Michael Shea (DAW, NY, 1974) (authorised sequel of the Cugel novel Eyes of the Overworld although Vance later wrote his own sequel Cugel the Clever; Shea also wrote Nifft the Lean (DAW, NY, 1982), and The Mines of Behemoth (1997) about a Cugel-like character; and In Yana, The Touch of Undying (DAW, NY, 1985) which is also Vancian.

He was one of the co-creators of the Godzilla series, as well as the main creator of the Ultra Series. During his rise to post-war fame in the wake of Godzilla (1954), many press accounts gave Tsuburaya's birthdate as July 7, which falls on the high day of Tanabata (star festival), a sign of good fortune. This is akin to an American saying that he or she was born on the Fourth of July. Tsuburaya's actual birthdate of July 10 has been verified by his last surviving son, Akira, and the company Eiji founded, Tsuburaya Productions, as the official entry in the Tsuburaya family register.  Early life  Tsuburaya described his childhood as filled with \\"mixed emotions.\\" He was the first son of Isamu and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. His mother died when he was only three and his father moved to China for the family business. Young Eiji was raised by his barely older uncle, Ichiro, and his paternal grandmother, Natsu. He attended elementary school at the Sukagawa Choritsu Dai'ichi Jinjo Koutou Shogakko beginning in 1908, and two years later, he took up the hobby of building model airplanes, due to the sensational success of Japanese aviators, an interest he would retain for the rest of his life. In 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated the equivalent of High School, and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon Flying school at Haneda. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya attended trade school. He became quite successful in the research and development department of the Utsumi toy company, but a chance meeting at a company party in 1919, set the course for his destiny‚Äîhe was offered a job by director Yoshiro Edamasa, a job that would train him to be a motion picture cameraman. While the Tsuburaya family's traditional religion was Nichiren Buddhism, Tsuburaya converted to Roman Catholicism in his later years (his wife had already been a practicing Roman Catholic).  Early career and war propaganda  In 1919, his first job in the film industry was as an assistant cinematographer at the Nihon Katsudou Shashin Kabushiki-gaisha (Nihon Cinematograph Company) in Kyoto, which later became better known as Nikkatsu. After serving as a member of the correspondence staff to the military from 1921 to 1923, he joined Ogasaware Productions. He was head cameraman on Hunchback of Enmeiin (Enmeiin no Semushiotoko), and served as assistant cameraman on Teinosuke Kinugasa's ground-breaking 1925 film, Kurutta Ippeiji (A Page of Madness). He joined Shochiku Kyoto Studios in 1926 and became full- time cameraman there in 1927. He began using and creating innovative filming techniques during this period, including the first use of a camera crane in Japanese film. In the 1930 film Chohichiro Matsudaira, he created a film illusion by super-imposition. Thus began the work for which he would become known--tokusatsu, or special visual effects. The year 1930 was also the year of his marriage to Masano Araki. Hajime, the first of their three sons, was born a year later. During the 1930s, he moved among a number of studios and became known for his meticulous work. It was during this period that he saw a film that would point towards his future career. After his international success with Godzilla in 1954, he said, \\"When I worked for Nikkatsu Studios, King Kong came to Kyoto and I never forgot that movie. I thought to myself, 'I will someday make a monster movie like that.'\\"Taylor, Al. \\"The Man Who Made Godzilla Famous.\\" Fantastic Films and Other Imaginative Media January 1980, p.19. In 1938 he became head of Special Visual Techniques at Toho Tokyo Studios, setting up an independent special effects department in 1939. He expanded his technique greatly during this period and earned several awards, but did not stay long at Toho. During the war years (the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II) he directed a number of propaganda films and produced their special effects for Toho's Educational Film Research Division created by decree of the imperial government. Those include K≈çd≈ç Nippon (The Imperial Way of Japan) (1938), Kaigun Bakugeki-tai (Naval Bomber Squadron) (1940), The Burning Sky (Moyuru ≈çzora) (1940), Hawai Mare oki kaisen (The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya) (1942), Decisive Battle in the Skies (Kessen-no ≈åzora-e) (1943) and Kato hayabusa sento-tai (1944). According to legend, Tsuburaya's work on The War at Sea... was so impressive that General MacArthur's film unit is said to have sold footage of the film to Frank Capra for use in Movietone newsreels as footage of the attack on Pearl Harbor.Ragone, August. Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters: Defending the Earth with Ultraman and Godzilla. San Francisco, California: Chronicle Books. . 2007. Pg.29 During the occupation of Japan following the war, Tsuburaya's wartime association with such propaganda films proved a hindrance to his finding work for some time. He went freelance with his own production company, Tsuburaya Visual Effects Research (working on films for other studios), until he returned to Toho in the early 1950s.  Toho years  As head of Toho's Visual Effects Department (which was known as the \\"Special Arts Department\\" until 1961), that he established in 1939, he supervised an average of sixty craftsmen, technicians and cameramen. It was here that he became part of the team, along with director Ishir≈ç Honda and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, that created the first Godzilla film in 1954, and were dubbed by Toho's advertising department as \\"The Golden Trio\\". For his work in , Tsuburaya won his first \\"Film Technique Award\\". In contrast to the stop motion technique most famously used by Willis O'Brien to create the 1933 King Kong, Tsuburaya used a man in a rubber suit to create his giant monster effects. This technique, now most closely associated with Japanese kaiju or monster movies, has come to be called \\"suitmation,\\" a term originated in the Japanese fan press during the 1980s. Through intense lighting and high-speed filming, Tsuburaya was able to add to the realism of the effects by giving them a slightly slower, ponderous weightiness. This technique, using detailed miniatures with men-in-monster-suits, is still being used today (but combined with CGI techniques as well) and is now considered a traditional Japanese craft art. The tremendous success of Godzilla led Toho to produce a series of science fiction films, films introducing new monsters, and further films involving the Godzilla character itself. The most critically and popularly successful of these films were those involving the team of Tsuburaya, Honda and Tanaka, along with the fourth member of the Godzilla team, composer Akira Ifukube. Tsuburaya continued producing the special effects for non-kaiju films like The H-Man (1958), and The Last War (1961), and won another Japanese Movie Technique Award for his work in the 1957 science-fiction film The Mysterians. He also won another award in 1959 for the creation of the \\"Toho Versatile System,\\" an optical printer for widescreen pictures, which he built in-house and first used on The Three Treasures in 1959. (Tsuburaya was continually frustrated by both the poor state of equipment he was forced to use, and Toho's money-pinching that prevented the acquisition of new motion picture technologies.) A loyal company man, Tsuburaya continued to work at Toho Studios until his death in 1970 of a heart attack.  Tsuburaya Productions  In the 1940s, Tsuburaya started his own special effects laboratory (set up at his home), and in 1963, founded his own studio for visual effects, Tsuburaya Productions. In 1966 alone, this company aired the first Ultra series for television, Ultra Q beginning in January, followed it with the highly popular Ultraman in July, and premiered a comedy- monster series, Booska, the Friendly Beast in November. Ultraman became the first live-action Japanese television series to be exported around the world, and spawned the Ultra series which continues to this day.  Recognition  In honor of the 114th anniversary of his birth, Google made an animated doodle of his skill with special effects on July 7, 2015.  Works   Special effects  During his 50-year career, Tsuburaya worked on approximately 250 films in total.

Sinn F√©in's Constance Markievicz had become the first elected female MP in 1918, but refused to take her seat in line with party policy. Astor was an American citizen who moved to England at age 26 and married Waldorf Astor. He succeeded to the peerage and entered the House of Lords; she then entered politics and won his former seat in Plymouth in 1919, becoming the first woman to sit as an MP in the House of Commons.Constance Gore-Booth was the first female MP elected to the House of Commons in December 1918, but she did not take her seat in line with Sinn F√©in's abstentionist policy; she was detained in Holloway Prison at the time. Her first husband was American Robert Gould Shaw II; the couple separated after four years and divorced in 1903. She served in Parliament as a member of the Conservative Party for Plymouth Sutton until 1945, when she was persuaded to step down. Astor has been criticised for her sympathetic view of Nazism.  Early life  Nancy Witcher Langhorne was born at the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. She was the eighth of eleven children born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and his wife Nancy Witcher Keene. Following the abolition of slavery, Chiswell struggled to make his operations profitable, and with the destruction of the war, the family lived in near-poverty for several years before Nancy was born. After her birth, her father gained a job as a tobacco auctioneer in Danville, the centre of bright leaf tobacco and a major marketing and processing centre. In 1874, he won a construction contract with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, using former contacts from his service in the Civil War. By 1892, when Nancy was thirteen years old, her father had re-established his wealth and built a sizeable home.Langhorne House, birthplace of Lady Astor, 117 Broad Street, Danville, Virginia , virginia.org Chiswell Langhorne later moved his family to an estate, known as Mirador, in Albemarle County, Virginia. Nancy Langhorne had four sisters and three brothers who survived childhood. All of the sisters were known for their beauty; Nancy and her sister Irene both attended a finishing school in New York City. There Nancy met her first husband, socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, a first cousin of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who commanded the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit in the Union Army to be composed of African Americans. They married in New York City on 27 October 1897, when she was 18. Nancy's childhood home, the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. The marriage was unhappy. Shaw's friends said Nancy became puritanical and rigid after marriage; her friends said that Shaw was an abusive alcoholic. During their four-year marriage, they had one son, Robert Gould Shaw III (called Bobby). Nancy left Shaw numerous times during their marriage, the first during their honeymoon. In 1903, Nancy's mother died; at that time, Nancy Shaw gained a divorce and moved back to Mirador to try to run her father's household, but was unsuccessful. Nancy Shaw took a tour of England and fell in love with the country. Since she had been so happy there, her father suggested that she move to England. Seeing she was reluctant, her father said this was also her mother's wish; he suggested she take her younger sister Phyllis. Nancy and Phyllis moved together to England in 1905. Their older sister Irene had married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and became a model for his Gibson Girls.  England  A contemporary view of Cliveden, Nancy Astor's country house Nancy Shaw had already become known in English society as an interesting and witty American, at a time when numerous wealthy young American women had married into the aristocracy. Her tendency to be saucy in conversation, yet religiously devout and almost prudish in behaviour, confused many of the English men but pleased some of the older socialites. Nancy also began to show her skill at winning over critics. She was once asked by an English woman, \\"Have you come to get our husbands?\\" Her unexpected response, \\"If you knew the trouble I had getting rid of mine...\\" charmed her listeners and displayed the wit for which she became known.Sykes (1984), p. 75 Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, 1908. She did marry an Englishman, albeit one born in the United States, Waldorf Astor; when he was twelve, his father, William Waldorf Astor had moved the family to England, raising his children in the English aristocratic style. The couple were well matched, as they were both American expatriates with similar temperaments. They were of the same age, and born on the same day, 19 May 1879. Astor shared some of Nancy's moral attitudes, and had a heart condition that may have contributed to his restraint. After the marriage, the Astors moved into Cliveden, a lavish estate in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames that was a wedding gift from Astor's father. Nancy Astor developed as a prominent hostess for the social elite.Her social efforts were not always successful. Harold Nicolson recorded an entry in his diary for 29 November 1930: \\"Down to Cliveden. A desultory drivel. After dinner, in order to enliven the party, Lady Astor dons a Victorian hat and a pair of false teeth. It does not enliven the party.\\" The Astors also owned a grand London house, No. 4 St. James's Square, now the premises of the Naval & Military Club. A blue plaque unveiled in 1987 commemorates Astor at St. James's Square. Through her many social connections, Lady Astor became involved in a political circle called Milner's Kindergarten. Considered liberal in their age, the group advocated unity and equality among English- speaking people and a continuance or expansion of the British Empire.  Religious views  With Milner's Kindergarten, Astor began her association with Philip Kerr. The friendship became important in her religious life; they met shortly after Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis regarding his once devout Catholicism. They were attracted to Christian Science, to which they both eventually converted. After converting, she began to proselytise for that faith and played a role in Kerr's conversion to it. She also tried to convert Hilaire Belloc's daughters to Christian Science, which led to a rift between them.Nancy Astor: Portrait of a Pioneer by John Grigg, p. 114 Despite having Catholic friends such as Belloc for a time, Astor's religious views included a strong vein of Anti-Catholicism. Christopher Sykes argues that Kerr, an ex- Catholic, influenced this, but others argue that Astor's Protestant Virginia origins are a sufficient explanation for her Anti-Catholic views. (Anti- Catholicism was also tied into historic national rivalries.) In 1927, she reportedly told James Louis Garvin that if he hired a Catholic, \\"bishops would be there within a week.\\" She attempted to discourage the hiring of Jews or Catholics to senior positions at The Observer,\\"First Woman in Parliament\\", The Tablet a newspaper owned by her husband.Alfred M. Gollin, The Observer and J. L. Garvin, 1908‚Äì1914 (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), pp. 300‚Äì303.  First campaign for Parliament  Several elements of Viscountess Astor's life influenced her first campaign, but she became a candidate after her husband succeeded to the peerage and House of Lords. He had enjoyed a promising political career for several years before World War I in the House of Commons; after his father's death, he succeeded to his father's peerage as the 2nd Viscount Astor. He automatically became a member of the House of Lords and consequently had to forfeit his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons. With this change, Lady Astor decided to contest the by-election for the vacant Parliamentary seat. Astor had not been connected with the women's suffrage movement in the British Isles. The first woman elected to the British Parliament, Constance Markievicz, said Lady Astor was \\"of the upper classes, out of touch\\". Countess Markiewicz had been in Holloway prison for Sinn F√©in activities during her election, and other suffragettes had been imprisoned for arson. However, as Astor was met as she arrived at Paddington station on the day after her election by a crowd of suffragettes, including unnamed women who had been imprisoned and on hunger strike, one said, \\"This is the beginning of our era. I am glad to have suffered for this.\\" Astor was hampered in the popular campaign for her published and at times vocal teetotalism and her ignorance of current political issues. Astor appealed to voters on the basis of her earlier work with the Canadian soldiers, allies of the British, charitable work during the war, her financial resources for the campaign and her ability to improvise. Her audiences appreciated her wit and ability to turn the tables on hecklers. Once a man asked her what the Astors had done for him and she responded with, \\"Why, Charlie, you know,\\"A mildly sexual innuendo and later had a picture taken with him. This informal style baffled yet amused the British public. She rallied the supporters of the current government, moderated her Prohibition views, and used women's meetings to gain the support of female voters. A by-election was held on 28 November 1919, and she took up her seat in the House on 1 December as a Unionist (also known as \\"Tory\\") Member of Parliament. Viscountess Astor was not the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament. That was achieved by Constance Markievicz, who was the first woman MP elected to Westminster in 1918, but as she was an Irish Republican, she did not take her seat. As a result, Lady Astor is sometimes erroneously referred to as the first woman MP, or the first woman elected to the U.K. Parliament, rather than the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament.  Early years in Parliament  Portrait of Nancy Astor by John Singer Sargent, 1909 Astor's Parliamentary career was the most public phase of her life. She gained attention as a woman and as someone who did not follow the rules, often attributed to her American upbringing. On her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realising that she was the person who was causing the commotion. She learned to dress more sedately and avoided the bars and smoking rooms frequented by the men.Sykes (1984), p. 238Masters (1981), p. 100 Early in her first term, MP Horatio Bottomley wanted to dominate the \\"soldier's friend\\" issue, and, believing she was an obstacle, sought to ruin her political career. He capitalised on her opposition to divorce reform and her efforts to maintain wartime alcohol restrictions. Bottomley portrayed her as a hypocrite, as she was divorced; he said the reform bill she opposed would allow women to have the same kind of divorce she had in America. Bottomley was later imprisoned for fraud, which Astor used to her advantage in other campaigns.Sykes (1984), pp. 242‚Äì60 Astor made friends among women MPs, including members of the other parties. Margaret Wintringham was elected after Astor had been in office for two years. Astor befriended Ellen Wilkinson, a member of the Labour Party (and a former Communist). Astor later proposed creating a \\"Women's Party\\", but the female Labour MPs opposed this, as their party was in power and had promised them positions. Over time, political differences separated the women MPs; by 1931 Astor became hostile to female Labour members such as Susan Lawrence.Sykes (1984), pp. 266‚Äì67, 354, 377Masters (1981), p. 137 Nancy Astor's accomplishments in the House of Commons were relatively minor. She never held a position with much influence, and never any post of ministerial rank, although her time in Commons saw four Conservative Prime Ministers in office. The Duchess of Atholl (elected to Parliament in 1923, four years after Lady Astor) rose to higher levels in the Conservative Party before Astor did. Astor felt if she had more position in the party, she would be less free to criticise her party's government. She did gain passage of a bill to increase the legal drinking age to eighteen unless the minor has parental approval.Sykes (1984), pp. 299‚Äì309, 327 During this period Nancy Astor continued to be active outside government, supporting the development and expansion of nursery schools for children's education. She was introduced to the issue by socialist Margaret McMillan, who believed that her late sister helped guide her in life. Lady Astor was initially skeptical of this aspect, but later the two women became close; Astor used her wealth to aid their social efforts.Sykes (1984), pp. 329‚Äì30Masters (1981), p. 140 Although active in charitable efforts, Astor became noted for a streak of cruelty. On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she expressed her pleasure. When people complained, she did not apologise but said, \\"I'm a Virginian; we shoot to kill.\\" Angus McDonnell, a Virginia friend, angered her by marrying without consulting her on his choice. She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he \\"really must do better than that.\\" During the course of her adult life, Astor alienated many with her sharp words as well.Sykes (1984), pp. 285, 326Masters (1981), p. 58 Astor as sketched in 1922 by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch During the 1920s, Astor made several effective speeches in Parliament, and gained support for her Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Persons under 18) Bill (nicknamed \\"Lady Astor's Bill\\"), raising the legal age for consuming alcohol in a public house from 14 to 18. Her wealth and persona brought attention to women who were serving in government. She worked to recruit women into the civil service, the police force, education reform, and the House of Lords. She was well-liked in her constituency, as well as the United States during the 1920s, but her success is generally believed to have declined in the following decades.Sykes (1984), pp. 317‚Äì8 327‚Äì8Masters (1981), pp. 115‚Äì18 In May 1922, Astor was guest of honour at a Pan-American conference held by the U.S. League of Women Voters in Baltimore, Maryland. Astor became the first President of the newly formed Electrical Association For Women in 1924. She chaired the first ever International Conference of Women In Science, Industry and Commerce, a three- day event held London in July 1925, organised by Caroline Haslett for the Women's Engineering Society in co-operation with other leading women's groups. Astor hosted a large gathering at her home in St James's to enable networking amongst the international delegates, and spoke strongly of her support of and the need for women to work in the fields of science, engineering and technology. She was concerned about the treatment of juvenile victims of crime: \\"The work of new MPs, such as Nancy Astor, led to a Departmental Committee on Sexual Offences Against Young People, which reported in 1925.\\"Adrian Bingham et al.: \\"A Hidden History\\". History Today, October 2015, Vol. 65, No. 10, p. 46. Retrieved 25 October 2015  1930s  The 1930s were a decade of personal and professional difficulty for Lady Astor. In 1929, she won a narrow victory over the Labour candidate. In 1931, Bobby Shaw, her son from her first marriage, was arrested for homosexual offences. As her son had previously shown tendencies towards alcoholism and instability, Astor's friend Philip Kerr, now the 11th Marquess of Lothian, suggested the arrest might act as a catalyst for him to change his behaviour, but he was incorrect. Astor made a disastrous speech stating that alcohol use was the reason England's national cricket team was defeated by the Australian national cricket team. Both the English and Australian teams objected to this statement. Astor remained oblivious to her growing unpopularity almost to the end of her career.Sykes (1984), pp. 351‚Äì52, 371‚Äì80Masters (1981), pp. 161‚Äì68 Astor's friendship with George Bernard Shaw helped her through some of her problems, although his own nonconformity caused friction between them. They held opposing political views and had very different temperaments. However, his own tendency to make controversial statements or put her into awkward situations proved to be a drawback for her political career.Sykes (1984), pp. 382‚Äì95Masters (1981), pp. 145‚Äì49, 170‚Äì75 After Bobby Shaw was arrested, Gertrude Ely, a Pennsylvania Railroad heiress from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania offered to provide a guided tour to Moscow for Lady Astor and Bobby. Because of public comments by her and her son during this period, her political career suffered. Her son made many flattering statements about the Soviet Union, while Astor often disparaged the nation because she did not approve of Communism. In a meeting, she asked Joseph Stalin directly why he had slaughtered so many Russians, but many of her criticisms were translated as less challenging statements. Some of her conservative supporters feared she had \\"gone soft\\" on Communism. (Her question to Stalin may have been translated correctly only because he insisted that he be told what she had said.) The Conservatives felt that her son's praise of the USSR served as a coup for Soviet propaganda; they were unhappy with her tour.Masters (1981), pp. 170‚Äì75  Anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic and anti-Communist views  Astor's anti- Semitism has been widely documented and criticised, particularly in light of Theresa May's unveiling of a statue in her honour with Boris Johnson in attendance, and more recently after Labour MP Rachel Reeves commemorated Astor in a series of tweets. The then-leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, praised installation of the statue, commenting \\"I'm really pleased the statue is going up\\". Astor was reportedly a supporter of the Nazis as a solution to what she saw as the \\"world problems\\" of Jews and Communists. In 1938 she met Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. (himself a well-documented anti-semite), asking him not to take offence at her anti-catholic views, writing \\"I'm glad you are smart enough not to take my [views] personally\\" and highlighting the fact that she had a number of Catholic friends. Astor and Kennedy's correspondence is reportedly filled with anti-Semitic language, with Edward J. Renehan Jr. writing that: > As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor > looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these \\"world > problems\\" (Nancy's phrase). ... Kennedy replied that he expected the \\"Jew > media\\" in the United States to become a problem, that \\"Jewish pundits in New > York and Los Angeles\\" were already making noises contrived to \\"set a match > to the fuse of the world\\". Astor commented to Kennedy that Hitler would have to do worse than \\"give a rough time...to the killers of christ\\" for Britain and America to risk \\"Armageddon to save them. The wheel of history swings round as the Lord would have it. Who are we to stand in the way of the future?\\" Astor made various other documented anti-Semitic comments, such as her complaint that the Observer newspaper, which was owned at the time by her husband, was \\"full of homosexuals and Jews\\", and her tense, anti-semitic exchange with MP Alan Graham in 1938, as described by Harold Nicolson: Dr David Feldman of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism has also related that whilst attending a dinner at the Savoy Hotel in 1934, Astor asked the League of Nations' high commissioner for refugees whether he believed \\"that there must be something in the Jews themselves that had brought them persecution throughout the ages\\". Dr Feldman acknowledged, though, that this was \\"not an unusual view\\" and explained it \\"was a conventional idea in the UK at the time\\". Some years later, in a 1947 during a visit to New York, she apparently \\"clashed\\" with reporters, renouncing her anti-Semitism, telling one that she was \\"not anti-Jewish but gangsterism isn't going to solve the Palestine problem\\". Astor was also deeply involved in the so-called Cliveden set, a coterie of aristocrats described by one journalist as having subscribed to their own form of fascism. In this capacity, Astor was considered a ‚Äúlegendary hostess‚Äù for the group which in 1936 welcomed, amongst others, Hitler‚Äôs foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. Ribbentrop communicated to Hitler, regarding the likelihood of an agreement between Germany and England and singled out the ‚ÄúAstorgruppe‚Äù as one of the circles ‚Äòthat want a fresh understanding with Germany and who hold that it would not basically be impossible to achieve‚Äô. The Sunday newspaper, Reynolds News, also reported during the period that ‚ÄòCliveden has been the centre of friendship with German influence‚Äô. To this end, several of her friends and associates, especially the Marquess of Lothian were involved in the policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany. Astor, however, was frustrated that the group be viewed as a pro- German conspiracy, and her husband, William Waldorf Astor wrote in a letter to the Times that ‚Äò[t]o link our weekends with any particular clique is as absurd as is the allegation that those of us who desire to establish better relations with Germany or Italy are pro-Nazis or pro-Fascists.‚Äô. The Cliveden set was also depicted by war agitators as the prime movers for peace. At the request of her friend, Felix Frankfurter (a future US Supreme Court justice), Astor intervened with the Nazis in Vienna and secured the release of Frankfurter's Jewish uncle, Solomon.: Relates how she told Alan Crosland Graham \\"Only a Jew like you would dare to be rude to me\\" Astor did occasionally meet with Nazi officials in keeping with Neville Chamberlain's policies and she was known to distrust and dislike British Foreign Secretary (later prime minister) Anthony Eden. She is alleged to have told one Nazi official that she supported their re-armament because Germany was \\"surrounded by Catholics\\". She also told Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German ambassador, who later became the foreign minister of Germany, that Hitler looked too much like Charlie Chaplin to be taken seriously. These statements are the only documented incidents of her direct expressions to Nazis.Masters (1981), pp. 185‚Äì192Sykes (1984), pp. 440‚Äì450 Astor became increasingly harsh in her anti-Catholic and anti- Communist sentiments. After passage of the Munich Agreement, she said that if the Czech refugees fleeing Nazi oppression were Communists, they should seek asylum with the Soviets instead of the British. While supporters of appeasement felt that this was out of line, the Marquess of Lothian encouraged her comments.Sykes (1984), pp. 446‚Äì453, 468  World War II  When the war began, Astor admitted that she had made mistakes, and voted against Chamberlain, but left-wing hostility to her politics remained. In a 1939 speech, the pro-Soviet Labour MP Stafford Cripps called her \\"The Member for Berlin\\". Her fear of Catholics increased and she made a speech saying that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the Foreign Office. Based on her opposition to Communists, she insulted Stalin's role (from 1941) as one of the Allied Powers during the war. Her speeches became rambling and incomprehensible; an opponent said that debating her had become \\"like playing squash with a dish of scrambled eggs\\".Harold Nicolson in a letter to his sons, 18 March 1943 On one occasion she accosted a young American soldier outside the Houses of Parliament. \\"Would you like to go in?\\" she asked. The GI replied: \\"You are the sort of woman my mother told me to avoid\\".Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 53 Guinness Publishing The period from 1937 to the end of the war was personally difficult for her: from 1937‚Äì38 Astor lost both her sister Phyllis and her only surviving brother. In 1940, the Marquess of Lothian died. He had been her closest Christian Scientist friend even after her husband converted. George Bernard Shaw's wife died three years later. During the war, Astor's husband had a heart attack. After this, their marriage grew cold, likely due to her subsequent discomfort with his health problems. She ran a hospital for Canadian soldiers as she had during the First World War, but openly expressed a preference for the earlier soldiers.Sykes (1984), pp. 520‚Äì522, 534Masters (1984), pp. 200‚Äì205Thornton (1997), p. 434 It was generally believed that it was Lady Astor who, during a World War II speech, first referred to the men of the 8th Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the \\"D-Day Dodgers\\". Observers thought she was suggesting they were avoiding the \\"real war\\" in France and the future invasion. The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the popular German song \\"Lili Marleen\\", called \\"The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers\\". This song has also been attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade. When told she was one of the people listed to be arrested, imprisoned and face possible execution in \\"The Black Book\\" under a German invasion of Britain, Lady Astor commented: \\"It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called 'Cliveden Set' was pro- Fascist.\\"  Final years  A statue at Cliveden, overlooking 42 inscribed stones dedicated to the dead of World War I. Sir Bertram MacKennal's figure represents Canada with the head reputedly modelled by Lady Astor Lady Astor believed her party and her husband caused her retirement in 1945. As the Conservatives believed she had become a political liability in the final years of World War II, her husband said that if she stood for office again the family would not support her. She conceded but, according to contemporary reports, was both irritated and angry about her situation.Sykes (1984), pp. 554‚Äì56Thornton (1997) Lady Astor struggled in retirement, which put further strain on her marriage. In a speech commemorating her 25 years in parliament, she stated that her retirement was forced on her and that it should please the men of Britain. The couple began travelling separately and soon were living apart. Lord Astor also began moving towards left-wing politics in his last years, and that exacerbated their differences. However, the couple reconciled before his death on 30 September 1952.Sykes (1984), pp. 556‚Äì57, 573‚Äì75Thornton (1997), p. 444 Lady Astor's public image suffered, as her ethnic and religious views were increasingly out of touch with cultural changes in Britain. She expressed a growing paranoia regarding ethnic minorities. In one instance, she stated that the President of the United States had become too dependent on New York City. To her this city represented \\"Jewish and foreign\\" influences that she feared. During a US tour, she told a group of African-American students that they should aspire to be like the black servants she remembered from her youth. On a later trip, she told African-American church members that they should be grateful for slavery because it had allowed them to be introduced to Christianity. In Rhodesia she proudly told the white minority government leaders that she was the daughter of a slave owner.Sykes (1984), pp. 580, 586‚Äì94, 601‚Äì06 After 1956, Nancy Astor became increasingly isolated. In 1959, she was honoured by receiving the Freedom of City of Plymouth. By this time, she had lost all her sisters and brothers, her colleague \\"Red Ellen\\" Wilkinson died in 1947, George Bernard Shaw died in 1950, and she did not take well to widowhood. Her son Bobby Shaw became increasingly combative and after her death he committed suicide. Her son, Jakie, married a prominent Catholic woman, which hurt his relationship with his mother. She and her other children became estranged. Gradually she began to accept Catholics as friends. However, she said that her final years were lonely. Lady Astor died in 1964 at her daughter Nancy Astor's home at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Octagon Temple at Cliveden.  Alleged quotations  She was known for exchanges with Winston Churchill, though most of these are not well documented. Churchill told Lady Astor that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which she retorted, \\"You're not handsome enough to have such fears.\\" Lady Astor is also said to have responded to a question from Churchill about what disguise he should wear to a masquerade ball by saying, \\"Why don't you come sober, Prime Minister?\\" Although variations on the following anecdote exist with different people, the story is being told of Winston Churchill's encounter with lady Astor who, after failing to shake him in an argument, broke off with the petulant remark, ‚ÄúOh, if you were my husband, I‚Äôd put poison in your tea.‚Äù ‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù Winston responded, ‚Äúif I were your husband, I‚Äôd drink it with pleasure.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I Were Your Wife I‚Äôd Put Poison in Your Tea!‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I Were Your Husband I‚Äôd Drink It‚Äù, Quoteinvestigator.com.  Commemoration  A bronze statue of Lady Astor was installed in Plymouth, near her former family home, in 2019 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her election to Parliament. During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the word \\"Nazi\\" was spray-painted on its base. The statue was on a list published on a website called Topple the Racists.

Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation. The colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus. Most sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. Some other sources exclude the anal canal. In humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the colon ascending the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract. Structure 3D File generated from computed tomography of large intestine Illustration of the large intestine. The colon is the last part of the digestive system. It has a segmented appearance due to a series of saccules called Haustra . It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. About 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water arrives in the colon each day. The length of the average adult human colon is 65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females. Sections Sections of the colon In mammals, the colon consists of six sections: the cecum plus the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. Sections of the colon are: * The ascending colon including the cecum and appendix * The transverse colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon * The descending colon * The sigmoid colon ‚Äì the s-shaped region of the large intestine * The rectum The parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy. In terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter. The descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon averaging 4‚Äì5 cm in diameter. Diameters larger than certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon. =Cecum and appendix= The cecum is the first section of the colon and involved in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction. The appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells. =Ascending colon= The ascending colon is the first of four main sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm). One of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis. The ascending colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. In ruminants, the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon. Taking into account all ages and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%). =Transverse colon= The transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure, also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen). The transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum called the greater omentum. On the posterior side, the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse mesocolon. The transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it). The proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The \\"watershed\\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia. =Descending colon= The descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. One function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the rectum. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. The arterial supply comes via the left colic artery. The descending colon is also called the distal gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. Gut flora are very dense in this region. =Sigmoid colon= The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus). The walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular, and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum. The sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2 and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. The IMA terminates as the superior rectal artery. Sigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used to examine the sigmoid colon. =Rectum= The rectum is the last section of the large intestine. It holds the formed feces awaiting elimination via defecation. It is about 13 cm long. Appearance The cecum ‚Äì the first part of the large intestine * Taeniae coli ‚Äì three bands of smooth muscle * Haustra ‚Äì bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli * Epiploic appendages ‚Äì small fat accumulations on the viscera The taenia coli run the length of the large intestine. Because the taenia coli are shorter than the large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.Anatomy at a Glance by Omar Faiz and David Moffat Blood supply Arterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Flow between these two systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel to the colon for its entire length. Historically, a structure variously identified as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. This variably present structure would be important if either vessel were occluded. However, at least one review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature. Venous drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver. Lymphatic drainage Lymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition. Nerve supply Sympathetic supply : Superior & inferior mesenteric ganglia Parasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves Development Variation One variation on the normal anatomy of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to five metres longer than normal. This condition, referred to as redundant colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. A significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming this problem.

Microanatomy Colonic crypts Colonic crypts (intestinal glands) within four tissue sections. The cells have been stained to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI), and the nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. Panels A, B were cut across the long axes of the crypts and panels C, D were cut parallel to the long axes of the crypts. In panel A the bar shows 100 ¬µm and allows an estimate of the frequency of crypts in the colonic epithelium. Panel B includes three crypts in cross-section, each with one segment deficient for CCOI expression and at least one crypt, on the right side, undergoing fission into two crypts. Panel C shows, on the left side, a crypt fissioning into two crypts. Panel D shows typical small clusters of two and three CCOI deficient crypts (the bar shows 50 ¬µm). The images were made from original photomicrographs, but panels A, B and D were also included in an article and illustrations were published with Creative Commons Attribution- Noncommercial License allowing re-use. The wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations. The invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts. File:Micrograph of normal large intestinal crypts.jpgMicrograph of normal large instestinal crypts. File:Anatomy of normal large intestinal crypts.jpgAnatomy of normal large intestinal crypts The colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the crypt lumen). Four tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. In these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). The nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. As seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. Baker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. Thus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic crypt. Nooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. Cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. There are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts. As estimated from the image in panel A, there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium. Since the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close to 10 million) crypts. In the four tissue sections shown here, many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei. As seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area. Overall, the percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age. Colonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80‚Äì84 years of age. Crypts of the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning. Most crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts) with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D). =Mucosa= About 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different regions and include CEACAM7. Function Histological section. The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum. The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation. The large intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis. Recycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. Examples include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling. The appendix contains a small amount of mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. However, the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development. The appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the patient. By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon.La funci√≥n de la hidroterapia de colon Retrieved on 2010-01-21 The bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. No protein is made available. In humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available, thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. The large intestine produces no digestive enzymes ‚Äî chemical digestion is completed in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. The pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).Function Of The Large Intestine Retrieved on 2010-01-21 Standing gradient osmosis Water absorption at the colon typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen. Gut flora The large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Species diversity varies by geography and diet. The microbes in a human distal gut often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams (0.44 pounds). This mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called the latest human organ to be \\"discovered\\" or in other words, the \\"forgotten organ\\". The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria inhabiting this region. Undigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by passive diffusion. The bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty acids. These bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. Although this source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement, it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. An individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing bacteria. Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. Bacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides produces these. Some of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from the amino acid tryptophan. The normal flora is also essential in the development of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics. They are also involved in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. These are antibodies produced by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion. The two most prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. The ratio between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project. Bacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer. Bifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'. A mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria. Clinical significance Disease Following are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon: Colonoscopy Colonoscopyimage, splenic flexure, normal mucosa. You can see spleen through it : the black part Colonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous. Colonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy‚Äîthe difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. A colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon (1200‚Äì1500 mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon. as PDF A sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with stool based test such as fecal occult blood test (FOBT), Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)or A multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation test (Epi proColon). About 5% of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy. as PDF Virtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. Furthermore, virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. If a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to be performed. Additionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch. Other animals The large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods, in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve. In most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. Although the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop into a true colon. In some small mammals, the colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse colon is typically present only in primates. However, the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. The rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \\"rectum\\" found in these species. In fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca. In sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. The gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure. Additional images Image:illu_intestine.jpgIntestines File:Slide12bek.JPGColon. Deep dissection. Anterior view.

He was the last colonial governor of Virginia. Lord Dunmore was named governor of the Province of New York in 1770. He succeeded to the same position in the Colony of Virginia the following year, after the death of Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt. As Virginia's governor, Dunmore directed a series of campaigns against the trans-Appalachian Indians, known as Lord Dunmore's War. He is noted for issuing a 1775 document (Dunmore's Proclamation) offering freedom to any slave who fought for the Crown against the Patriots in Virginia. Dunmore fled to New York after the Burning of Norfolk in 1776, and later returned to Britain. He was Governor of the Bahama Islands from 1787 to 1796. Family and early life Murray was born in Taymouth, Scotland, the eldest son of William Murray, 3rd Earl of Dunmore, by his marriage to Catherine Nairne; he was a nephew of John Murray, 2nd Earl of Dunmore. In 1745, both Murray, then only 15, and his father joined the ill- fated Rising of \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" (Charles Edward Stuart), and the young Murray was appointed as a page to Prince Charles. The second Earl, his uncle, remained loyal to the Hanoverians. After the Jacobite army was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, William Murray was imprisoned in Tower of London and his family was put under house arrest. By 1750, William Murray had received a conditional pardon. John Murray was now aged twenty and joined the British Army. In 1756, after the deaths of his uncle and father, he became the fourth Earl of Dunmore. In 1759 Dunmore married Lady Charlotte, a daughter of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway. Their daughter Lady Augusta Murray later became an unwanted daughter-in-law of King George III, when she married his son Prince Augustus Frederick without the consent of the King. The Dunmores had another daughter close to her age, Lady Catherine Murray, and soon after they landed in Virginia they had another child, Lady Virginia Murray. Their daughter Lady Susan Murray (1768‚Äì1826) had three husbands and children by each: first Joseph Tharp, heir to a Jamaica sugar fortune; second John Drew, son of the Chichester banker John Drew; and finally a clergyman in Ireland, the Reverend Archibald Edward Douglas. Colonial governor of New York Dunmore was named the British governor of the Province of New York from 1770 to 1771. Soon after his appointment, in 1770, Virginia's governor, Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt (Lord Botetourt) died, and Dunmore was eventually named to replace him.Dunmore Biography. Colonial governor of Virginia Dunmore's War Dunmore became royal governor of the Colony of Virginia on 25 September 1771. Despite growing issues with Great Britain, his predecessor, Lord Botetourt, had been a popular governor in Virginia, even though he served only two years before his death. As Virginia's colonial governor, Dunmore directed a series of campaigns against the Indians known as Lord Dunmore's War. The Shawnee were the main target of these attacks, and his avowed purpose was to strengthen Virginia's claims in the west, particularly in the Ohio Country, but as a byproduct it was known he would increase his own power base. Some even accused Dunmore of colluding with the Shawnees and arranging the war to deplete the Virginia militia and help safeguard the Loyalist cause, should there be a colonial rebellion. Dunmore, in his history of the Indian Wars, denied these accusations.Roosevelt, Theodore (1889). , Chapters VIII \\"Lord Dunmore's War\\" and XI \\"The Battle of the Great Kanawha\\", passim. Battle for control Lacking in diplomatic skills, Dunmore tried to govern without consulting the House of Burgesses of the Colonial Assembly for more than a year, which exacerbated an already tense situation. When Dunmore finally convened the Colonial Assembly in March 1773, which was the only way he could deal with fiscal issues to financially support his war through additional taxation, the burgesses instead first resolved to form a committee of correspondence to communicate their continued concerns about the Townshend Acts and Gaspee Affair to Great Britain. Dunmore immediately postponed the Assembly. Many of burgesses gathered a short distance away at the Raleigh Tavern and continued discussing their problems with the new taxes, perceived corruption and lack of representation in England. When Dunmore reconvened the Assembly in 1774, the burgesses passed a resolution declaring 1 June 1774 a day of fasting and prayer in Virginia. In response, Dunmore dissolved the House. The burgesses again reconvened as the Second Virginia Convention and elected delegates to the Continental Congress. Dunmore issued a proclamation against electing delegates to the Congress, but failed to take serious action.\\"Proclamation\\". In March 1775, Patrick Henry's \\"Give me Liberty, or give me Death!\\" speech delivered at St. John's Episcopal Church in Richmond helped convince delegates to approve a resolution calling for armed resistance.Red Hill . In the face of rising unrest in the colony, Dunmore sought to deprive Virginia's militia of military supplies. Dunmore gave the key to the Williamsburg magazine to Lieutenant Henry Colins, commander of HMS Magdalen, and ordered him to remove the powder, provoking what became known as the Gunpowder Incident. On the night of 20 April 1775, royal marines loaded fifteen half-barrels of powder into the governor's wagon, intent on transporting it down the Quarterpath Road to the James River and the British warship. Local militia rallied, and word of the incident spread across the colony. Confrontation with the Hanover militia The Hanover militia, led by Patrick Henry, arrived outside of Williamsburg on 3 May. That same day, Dunmore evacuated his family from the Governor's Palace to his hunting lodge, Porto Bello in nearby York County. On 6 May, Dunmore issued a proclamation against \\"a certain Patrick Henry... and a Number of deluded Followers\\" who had organised \\"an Independent Company... and put themselves in a Posture of War.\\" Dunmore threatened to impose martial law, and eventually retreated to Porto Bello to join his family. Dislodged by the Virginia rebels and wounded in the leg, on 8 June, Dunmore took refuge on the British warship in the York River. Over the next months, Dunmore sent many raiding parties to plunder plantations along the James, York and Potomac rivers, particularly those owned by rebels. The raiders exacerbated tensions, since they not only stole supplies, they also encouraged slaves to rebel. In December, Washington commented \\"I do not think that forcing his lordship on shipboard is sufficient. Nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia, as motives of resentment actuate his conduct to a degree equal to the total destruction of that colony.\\" Dunmore's Proclamation Dunmore is noted for Dunmore's Proclamation, also known as Lord Dunmore's Offer of Emancipation. Dated 7 November 1775, but proclaimed a week later, Dunmore thereby formally offered freedom to slaves who abandoned their Patriot masters to join the British. Dunmore had previously withheld his signature from a bill against the slave trade. The proclamation appeared to respond to the legislature's proclamation that Dunmore had resigned his position by boarding a warship off Yorktown nearly six months earlier. However, by the end of the war, an estimated 800 to 2000 escaped slaves sought refuge with the British; some served in the army, though the majority served in noncombatant roles. Dunmore organized these Black Loyalists into his Ethiopian Regiment. However, despite winning the Battle of Kemp's Landing on 17 November 1775, Dunmore lost decisively at the Battle of Great Bridge on 9 December 1775. Following that defeat, Dunmore loaded his troops, and many Virginia Loyalists, onto British ships. Smallpox spread in the confined quarters, and some 500 of the 800 members of the Ethiopian Regiment died. Final skirmishes and return to Britain On New Year's Day in 1776, Dunmore gave orders to burn waterfront buildings in Norfolk from which patriot troops were firing on his ships. However, the fire spread. The city burned, and with it any hope that Dunmore's loyalists could return to Virginia.Guy, Louis L. jr. bad link as of 12/16/12 --no independent access to Norfolk Historical Society Courier (Spring 2001) Dunmore retreated to New York.

Dunmore continued to draw his pay as the colony's governor until 1783, when Britain recognized American independence. From 1787 to 1796, Dunmore served as governor of the Bahamas. During his tenure as governor, the British issued land grants to American Loyalists who went into exile. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to slaves they brought with them, the loyalist planters' descendants imported more African slaves for labour. Peerage Dunmore sat as a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords from 1761 to 1774 and from 1776 to 1790. Death Dunmore died on 25 February 1809 in Ramsgate in Kent. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, George. The Countess of Dunmore died in 1819. Legacy *Dunmore County, Virginia, formed in 1772, was named in his honour.

As blazoned for Sir Guncelin de Badlesmere, on the Herald's Roll of Arms also on The Camden Roll & St George's RollThe Heralds' Roll, Part 5 Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere (18 August 127514 April 1322) was an English soldier, diplomat, Member of Parliament, landowner and nobleman. He was the son and heir of Sir Gunselin de Badlesmere (died ca. 1301) and Joan FitzBernard. He fought in the English army both in France and Scotland during the later years of the reign of Edward I of England and the earlier part of the reign of Edward II of England. He was executed after participating in an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Earl of Lancaster. Career The earliest records of Bartholomew's life relate to his service in royal armies, which included campaigns in Gascony (1294), Flanders (about 1297) and Scotland (1298, 1300, 1301‚Äì04, 1306‚Äì08, 1310‚Äì11, 1314‚Äì19). However, even at a relatively young age his activities were not limited to soldiering. In October 1300, was one of the household of Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln who were permitted by the King to accompany the Earl when he set out for Rome during the following month in order to complain to Pope Boniface VIII of injury done by the Scots.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1296-1302, p. 370.J.

This led to a hearing on 30 April of that year in relation to property in Kent at Badlesmere and Donewelleshethe, where it was confirmed that the heir was his son Bartholomew, then aged 26.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 4, No. 38. Bartholomew de Badlesmere and Fulk Payfrer were the knights who represented the county of Kent at the Parliament that sat at Carlisle from January 1306/7 until 27 March 1307.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1302-1307, pp. 524-25. Also in 1307 Bartholomew was appointed governor of Bristol Castle. In that role he took charge of the subjugation of the city when it defied royal authority in 1316. In 1310, Bartholomew acted as deputy Constable of England on behalf of the Earl of Hereford. Bartholomew served as his lieutenant when Hereford refused to perform his duties in the Scottish campaign of 1310-11. He was one of the retinue of the Earl of Gloucester at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314, Bartholomew's own sub-retinue consisting of at least 50 men. He was criticised for not coming to his aid when Gloucester lost his life in an impetuous attack on the Scottish sheltron on that occasion. In the following January, Bartholomew was one of the many notables who attended the funeral of Piers Gaveston. On 28 April 1316, Bartholomew was one of four men who were authorised to grant safe conducts in the King's name to Robert Bruce and other Scots so that they could come to England to negotiate a truce. In December of that year, he was commissioned, along with the Bishop of Ely and the Bishop of Norwich to go on an embassy to Pope John XXII at Avignon to seek his help against the Scots and request a Bull to release the King from his oath to the Ordinances. In June of the same year, Bartholomew's daughter Elizabeth married Edward, the son and heir of Roger Mortimer. Elizabeth's father was sufficiently wealthy to pay ¬£2,000 for the marriage, in exchange for which extensive property was settled on the bride. On 1 November 1317, the King appointed Bartholomew as custodian of Leeds Castle in Kent Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward II, Vol. 3 (1317‚Äì1321), p. 46. This was followed by a transaction on 20 March 1317/18 by which the King granted the castle and manor of Leeds along with the advowson of the priory of Leeds to Bartholomew and his heirs in exchange for the manor and advowson of Adderley, Shropshire, which Bartholomew surrendered to the King Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward II, Vol. 3 (1317‚Äì1321), p. 128. By late November 1317, Bartholomew made a compact with a number of noblemen and prelates, including the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Hereford and the Archbishop of Canterbury with the aim of reducing the influence on the King of advisors of whom they disapproved. Bartholomew and his associates formed a loose grouping which has been referred to by modern historians as the \\"Middle Party\\", who detested alike Edward's minions, like the Despensers, and his violent enemies like Lancaster. However, although he was very hostile to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, Bartholomew helped to make peace between the king and the earl in 1318. On 1 October 1318, Bartholomew was with the King at York, setting out to repel an invasion by the Scots.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, p. 14. Nineteen days later, he was appointed as the King's household steward in place of William Montagu. This position was of major importance, as it provided continual access to the King's presence and considerable influence over who else could obtain access to him. Bartholomew was still holding this appointment in June 1321. Financial grants that he received during this period included ¬£500 on appointment as steward and over ¬£1,300 in October 1319. In 1319, Bartholomew obtained the king's licence to found a priory on his manor of Badlesmere, but the proposed priory was never established. In June of the following year, he hosted a splendid reception at Chilham Castle for Edward II and his entourage when they were travelling to Dover en route for France. Also in 1320, he was granted control of Dover Castle and Wardenship of the Cinque Ports and in 1321 was appointed governor of Tunbridge Castle. During the earlier part of 1321, Bartholomew, along with the Bishop of Worcester and the Bishop of Carlisle and others represented the King in unsuccessful negotiations with the Scots for either a permanent peace or an extended truce. Rebellion By the summer of 1321, Bartholomew defied the King by associating with their mutual enemy the Earl of Lancaster and his allies in their active opposition to Edward's \\"evil councillors\\" such as the Despensers. The Lancastrian forces moved from the North to London, reaching the capital by the end of July. In the autumn, the King started to apply pressure targeted on Bartholomew, probably partly because many of his manors were closer to London than those of magnates such as Lancaster and partly because of anger at the disloyalty of his own household steward. Edward took control of Dover Castle and forbade Bartholomew entrance to the county of Kent, an injunction that he promptly breached. Bartholomew then returned to Witney, Oxfordshire, where a tournament attended by many of his new allies was being held. When returning to London from a pilgrimage to Canterbury, the Queen did not take the most direct route but detoured to Leeds Castle, where she and her armed retinue demanded access, precipitating the siege and its aftermath that is described in detail in the article about Bartholomew's wife. Although Bartholomew assembled an armed force and marched from Witney towards Kent, by the time he reached Kingston upon Thames it was clear that he would not receive help from Lancaster and his followers and so he was not able to take effective action to relieve the siege. During the following months, civil war broke out. On 26 December 1321, the King ordered the Sheriff of Gloucester to arrest Bartholomew.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, p. 413. Shortly afterwards, the King offered safe conducts to the rebels who would come over to him, with the specific exception of Bartholomew de Badlesmere. Details contained in arrest warrants signpost the progress of Bartholomew and his companions across England. By 15 January 1321/2, they had occupied and burned the town of Bridgnorth and sacked the castles at Elmley and Hanley.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, pp. 511-12. By 23 February, the rebels had been sighted in Northamptonshire.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, p. 519. On 1 March, Bartholomew was reported as one of a number of prominent rebels who had reached Pontefract.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, p. 526. On 11 March the sheriff of Nottingham and Derby was ordered to arrest the same group, who had taken Burton upon Trent but they departed from that town when the royal army approached.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1318-1323, p. 522. On 16 March 1321/2, the Earl of Lancaster and his allies were defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge. Death Bartholomew fled south from Boroughbridge and, according to the \\"Livere de Reis\\", was captured in a small wood near Brickden and taken by the Earl of Mar to Canterbury. Alternative details appear in John Leland's \\"Collectanea\\", which states that \\"Syr Barptolemew Badelesmere was taken at Stow Parke yn the Manoyr of the Bishop of Lincoln that was his nephew.\\" Stow Park is about 10 miles north-west of the centre of Lincoln, where the bishop was Henry Burghersh. Stow Park was one of the principal residences of the Bishop in that era but none of the medieval buildings still survive above ground. The identity of \\"Brickden\\" is uncertain but may well refer to Buckden, Huntingdonshire, another place where the Bishop of Lincoln had a manor house (Buckden Towers). If so, that may be the reason for the differing accounts of the place that Bartholomew had reached when he was arrested, as they both featured residences of his nephew. Bartholomew was tried at Canterbury on 14 April 1322 and sentenced to death. On the same day he was drawn for three miles behind a horse to Blean, where he held property.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 7, No. 109, page 90. There he was hanged and beheaded. His head was displayed on the Burgh Gate at Canterbury and the rest of his body left hanging at Blean. There it probably remained for quite some time, as it was not until the Lent Parliament of 1324 that the prelates successfully petitioned for the bodies of the nobles still hanging on the gallows to be given ecclesiastical burial. In a book that was first published in 1631, the antiquary John Weever stated that Bartholomew was buried at White Friars, Canterbury; this was a community of the Order of St Augustine.More about the Austin Friars at Canterbury appears in the List of monastic houses in Kent  Property  By the latter part of his life, Bartholomew possessed a vast portfolio of properties, either in his own right or jointly with his wife Margaret. These assets were forfeited because of Bartholomew's rebellion. During the first four years of reign of Edward III, a series of inquisitions post mortem established the properties to which Margaret was entitled and also those of which her son Giles would be the right heir. Much of the property was restored to Bartholomew's widow or assigned to Giles, who at that juncture was still a minor in the King's wardship.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 7, Nos. 104, 308, and 399. Some of the properties that Bartholomew held are listed below; the list is not exhaustive and he did not necessarily hold all of them at the same time. * Bedfordshire: The manor of Sondyington (i.e. Sundon). * Buckinghamshire: The manor of Hambleden. Also the manors of Cowley and Preston, both of which were in the parish of Preston Bissett. * Essex: The manors of Chingford, Latchley (i.e. Dagworth Manor at Pebmarsh), Little Stambridge and Thaxted. * Gloucestershire: The manor of Oxenton. * Herefordshire: The manor of Lenhales and Lenhales Castle at Lyonshall. * Hertfordshire: The manors of Buckland, Mardleybury (at Welwyn) and Plashes (at Standon). * Kent: The manors of Badlesmere, Bockingfold (north of Goudhurst), Chilham, Hothfield, Kingsdown, Lesnes, Rydelyngwelde (i.e. Ringwould), Tonge and Whitstable. Bartholomew's possessions in this county included Chilham Castle and Leeds Castle. * Oxfordshire: The manor of Finmere. * Shropshire: The manors of Adderley and Ideshale (at Shifnal). * Suffolk: The manors of Barrow and Brendebradefeld (i.e. Bradfield Combust). * Sussex: The manors of Eastbourne and Laughton. Also reversions of the manors of Drayton, Etchingham and West Dean. * Wiltshire: The manors of Castle Combe, Knook, Orcheston and West Heytesbury The relevant inquisitions post mortem also contain details of numerous advowsons and other property rights that Bartholomew owned. Family Bartholomew married Margaret, the widow of Gilbert de Umfraville. The marriage had taken place by 30 June 1308, when the couple were jointly granted the manor of Bourne, Sussex.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward II, 1307-1313, page 83. Margaret was a daughter of Thomas de Clare and his wife Juliana FitzGerald.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 6, No. 275, page 159. A comprehensive overview of their children can be seen in the records of numerous inquisitions post mortem that were held after the death of their son Giles on 7 June 1338.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 8, No. 185. The evidence given at each hearing rested on local knowledge and there were some inconsistencies about the names of Giles' sisters and their precise ages. However, taken as a whole, it is clear from the inquisition records that the names of Bartholomew's children were as follows, listed in descending order of age: *Margery de Badlesmere, married William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros of Hamlake *Maud de Badlesmere, married Robert FitzPayn, then John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford *Elizabeth de Badlesmere, married Sir Edmund Mortimer, then William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton *Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere, married Elizabeth Montagu, and died without issue *Margaret de Badlesmere, married John Tiptoft, 2nd Baron Tibetot.

It is Shakespeare's bloodiest and most violent work. It has traditionally been one of his least respected plays. Though extremely popular in its day, it had fallen out of favor by the later 17th century. The Victorian era disapproved of it largely because of what was regarded as its distasteful graphic violence.

Their conflict seems set to boil over into violence until a tribune, Marcus Andronicus, announces that the people's choice for the new emperor is Marcus's brother, Titus, who will shortly return to Rome from a victorious ten-year campaign against the Goths. Titus subsequently arrives to much fanfare, bearing with him as prisoners the Queen of the Goths (Tamora), her three sons (Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius), and Aaron the Moor (her secret lover). Despite Tamora's desperate pleas, Titus sacrifices her eldest son, Alarbus, to avenge the deaths of his own sons during the war. Distraught, Tamora and her two surviving sons vow to obtain revenge on Titus and his family. Meanwhile, Titus refuses the offer of the throne, arguing that he is not fit to rule and instead supporting the claim of Saturninus, who then is duly elected. Saturninus tells Titus that for his first act as emperor, he will marry Titus's daughter Lavinia. Titus agrees, although Lavinia is already betrothed to Saturninus's brother, Bassianus, who refuses to give her up. Titus's sons tell Titus that Bassianus is in the right under Roman law, but Titus refuses to listen, accusing them all of treason. A scuffle breaks out, during which Titus kills his own son, Mutius. Saturninus then denounces the Andronici family for their effrontery and shocks Titus by marrying Tamora. Putting into motion her plan for revenge, Tamora advises Saturninus to pardon Bassianus and the Andronici family, which he reluctantly does. During a royal hunt the following day, Aaron persuades Demetrius and Chiron to kill Bassianus, so they may rape Lavinia. They do so, throwing Bassianus's body into a pit and dragging Lavinia deep into the forest before violently raping her. To keep her from revealing what has happened, they cut out her tongue and cut off her hands. Meanwhile, Aaron writes a forged letter, which frames Titus's sons Martius and Quintus for the murder of Bassianus. Horrified at the death of his brother, Saturninus arrests Martius and Quintus, and sentences them to death. Some time later, Marcus discovers the mutilated Lavinia and takes her to her father, who is still shocked at the accusations levelled at his sons, and upon seeing Lavinia, he is overcome with grief. Aaron then visits Titus and falsely tells him that Saturninus will spare Martius and Quintus if either Titus, Marcus, or Titus's remaining son, Lucius, cuts off one of their hands and sends it to him. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus's) left hand and sends it to the emperor but, in return, a messenger brings Titus Martius and Quintus's severed heads, along with Titus's own severed hand. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths. Later, Lavinia writes the names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held with her mouth and between her mutilated arms. Meanwhile, Tamora secretly gives birth to a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child's race a secret and flees with the baby to save it from Saturninus' inevitable wrath. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius. Nicholas Rowe Back in Rome, Titus's behaviour suggests he might be deranged. Convinced of his madness, Tamora, Chiron, and Demetrius approach him, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape. Tamora (as Revenge) tells Titus that she will grant him revenge on all of his enemies if he can convince Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Titus agrees and sends Marcus to invite Lucius to a reconciliatory feast. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, and is about to leave when Titus insists that Rape and Murder (Chiron and Demetrius, respectively) stay with him. When Tamora is gone, Titus has them restrained, cuts their throats and drains their blood into a basin held by Lavinia. Titus morbidly tells Lavinia that he plans to \\"play the cook\\", grind the bones of Demetrius and Chiron into powder, and bake their heads. The next day, during the feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. When Saturninus answers that he should, Titus kills Lavinia and tells Saturninus of the rape. When the Emperor calls for Chiron and Demetrius, Titus reveals that they have been baked in the pie Tamora has just been eating. Titus then kills Tamora and is immediately killed by Saturninus, who is subsequently killed by Lucius to avenge his father's death. Lucius is then proclaimed Emperor. He orders that Titus and Lavinia be laid in their family tomb, that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora's body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron, however, is unrepentant to the end, regretting only that he had not done more evil in his life.  Setting and sources   Setting  The story of Titus Andronicus is fictional, not historical, unlike Shakespeare's other Roman plays, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, all of which are based on real historical events and people. Even the time in which Titus is set may not be based on a real historical period. According to the prose version of the play (see below), the events are \\"set in the time of Theodosius\\", who ruled from 379 to 395. On the other hand, the general setting appears to be what Clifford Huffman describes as \\"late- Imperial Christian Rome\\", possibly during the reign of Justinian I (527‚Äì565).Huffman (1972: 735) Also favouring a later date, Grace Starry West argues, \\"the Rome of Titus Andronicus is Rome after Brutus, after Caesar, and after Ovid. We know it is a later Rome because the emperor is routinely called Caesar; because the characters are constantly alluding to Tarquin, Lucretia, and Brutus, suggesting that they learned about Brutus' new founding of Rome from the same literary sources we do, Livy and Plutarch.\\"West (1982: 74) Others are less certain of a specific setting, however. For example, Jonathan Bate has pointed out that the play begins with Titus returning from a successful ten-year campaign against the Goths, as if at the height of the Roman Empire, but ends with Goths invading Rome, as if at its death.Bate (1995: 19) Similarly, T. J. B. Spencer argues that \\"the play does not assume a political situation known to Roman history; it is, rather a summary of Roman politics. It is not so much that any particular set of political institutions is assumed in Titus, but rather that it includes all the political institutions that Rome ever had.\\"Spencer (1957: 32) Sources In his efforts to fashion general history into a specific fictional story, Shakespeare may have consulted the Gesta Romanorum, a well known thirteenth- century collection of tales, legends, myths, and anecdotes written in Latin, which took figures and events from history and spun fictional tales around them.Jones (1977: 90) In Shakespeare's lifetime, a writer known for doing likewise was Matteo Bandello, who based his work on that of writers such as Giovanni Boccaccio and Geoffrey Chaucer, and who could have served as an indirect source for Shakespeare. So, too, could the first major English author to write in this style, William Painter, who borrowed from, amongst others, Herodotus, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius, Claudius Aelianus, Livy, Tacitus, Giovanni Battista Giraldi, and Bandello himself.Waith (1984: 35) Tereus Confronted with the Head of his Son Itylus (1637) by Peter Paul Rubens However, it is also possible to determine more specific sources for the play. The primary source for the rape and mutilation of Lavinia, as well as Titus' subsequent revenge, is Ovid's Metamorphoses (), which is featured in the play itself when Lavinia uses it to help explain to Titus and Marcus what happened to her during the attack. In the sixth book of Metamorphoses, Ovid tells the story of the rape of Philomela, daughter of Pandion I, King of Athens. Despite ill omens, Philomela's sister, Procne, marries Tereus of Thrace and has a son for him, Itys. After five years in Thrace, Procne yearns to see her sister again, so she persuades Tereus to travel to Athens and accompany Philomela back to Thrace. Tereus does so, but he soon begins to lust after Philomela. When she refuses his advances, he drags her into a forest and rapes her. He then cuts out her tongue to prevent her from telling anyone of the incident and returns to Procne, telling her that Philomela is dead. However, Philomela weaves a tapestry, in which she names Tereus as her assailant, and has it sent to Procne. The sisters meet in the forest and together plot their revenge. They kill Itys and cook his body in a pie, which Procne then serves to Tereus. During the meal, Philomela reveals herself, showing Itys' head to Tereus and telling him what they have done.Waith (1984: 27‚Äì28) For the scene where Lavinia reveals her rapists by writing in the sand, Shakespeare may have used a story from the first book of Metamorphoses; the tale of the rape of Io by Zeus, where, to prevent her from divulging the story, he turns her into a cow. Upon encountering her father, she attempts to tell him who she is but is unable to do so until she thinks to scratch her name in the dirt using her hoof.Maxwell (1953: 92) Titus' revenge may also have been influenced by Seneca's play Thyestes, written in the first century AD. In the mythology of Thyestes, which is the basis for Seneca's play, Thyestes, son of Pelops, King of Pisa, who, along with his brother Atreus, was exiled by Pelops for the murder of their half-brother, Chrysippus. They take up refuge in Mycenae and soon ascend to co-inhabit the throne. However, each becomes jealous of the other, and Thyestes tricks Atreus into electing him as the sole king. Determined to re-attain the throne, Atreus enlists the aid of Zeus and Hermes, and has Thyestes banished from Mycenae. Atreus subsequently discovers that his wife, Aerope, had been having an affair with Thyestes, and he vows revenge. He asks Thyestes to return to Mycenae with his family, telling him that all past animosities are forgotten. However, when Thyestes returns, Atreus secretly kills Thyestes' sons. He cuts off their hands and heads, and cooks the rest of their bodies in a pie. At a reconciliatory feast, Atreus serves Thyestes the pie in which his sons have been baked. As Thyestes finishes his meal, Atreus produces the hands and heads, revealing to the horrified Thyestes what he has done.Waith (1984:36‚Äì37) Another specific source for the final scene is discernible when Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. This is a reference to the story of Verginia from Livy's Ab urbe condita (). Around 451 BC, a decemvir of the Roman Republic, Appius Claudius Crassus, begins to lust after Verginia, a plebeian girl betrothed to a former tribune, Lucius Icilius. She rejects Claudius' advances, enraging him, and he has her abducted. However, both Icilius and Verginia's father, famed centurion Lucius Verginius, are respected figures and Claudius is forced to legally defend his right to hold Verginia. At the Forum, Claudius threatens the assembly with violence, and Verginius' supporters flee. Seeing that defeat is imminent, Verginius asks Claudius if he may speak to his daughter alone, to which Claudius agrees. However, Verginius stabs Verginia, determining that her death is the only way he can secure her freedom.Kahn (1997: 70‚Äì71) For the scene where Aaron tricks Titus into cutting off one of his hands, the primary source was probably an unnamed popular tale about a Moor's vengeance, published in various languages throughout the sixteenth century (an English version entered into the Stationers' Register in 1569 has not survived).Waith (1984: 28‚Äì29) In the story, a married noble man with two children chastises his Moorish servant, who vows revenge. The servant goes to the moated tower where the man's wife and children live, and rapes the wife. Her screams bring her husband, but the Moor pulls up the drawbridge before the nobleman can gain entry. The Moor then kills both children on the battlements in full view of the man. The nobleman pleads with the Moor that he will do anything to save his wife, and the Moor demands he cut off his nose. The man does so, but the Moor kills the wife anyway, and the nobleman dies of shock. The Moor then flings himself from the battlements to avoid punishment. Shakespeare also drew on various sources for the names of many of his characters. For example, Titus could have been named after the Emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus, who ruled Rome from 79 to 81. Jonathan Bate speculates that the name Andronicus could have come from Andronicus V Palaeologus, co- emperor of Byzantium from 1403 to 1407, but, since there is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare might have come across these emperors, it is more likely that he took the name from the story \\"Andronicus and the lion\\" in Antonio de Guevara's Epistolas familiares. That story involves a sadistic emperor named Titus who amused himself by throwing slaves to wild animals and watching them be slaughtered. However, when a slave called Andronicus is thrown to a lion, the lion lies down and embraces the man. The emperor demands to know what has happened, and Andronicus explains that he had once helped the lion by removing a thorn from its foot. Bate speculates that this story, with one character called Titus and another called Andronicus, could be why several contemporary references to the play are in the form Titus & ondronicus.Bate (1995: 93‚Äì94) Geoffrey Bullough argues that Lucius' character arc (estrangement from his father, followed by banishment, followed by a glorious return to avenge his family honour) was probably based on Plutarch's Life of Coriolanus.Bullough (1964: 24) As for Lucius' name, Frances Yates speculates that he may be named after Saint Lucius, who introduced Christianity into Britain.France Yates, Astraea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1975), 70‚Äì79 On the other hand, Jonathan Bate hypothesises that Lucius could be named after Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, arguing that \\"the man who led the people in their uprising was Lucius Junius Brutus. This is the role that Lucius fulfills in the play.\\"Bate (1995: 92) The name of Lavinia was probably taken from the mythological figure of Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, King of Latium, who, in Virgil's Aeneid, courts Aeneas as he attempts to settle his people in Latium. A. C. Hamilton speculates that the name of Tamora could have been based upon the historical figure of Tomyris, a violent and uncompromising Massagetae queen.A. C. Hamilton, The Early Shakespeare (San Marino: Huntington Library, 1967), 87 Eugene M. Waith suggests that the name of Tamora's son, Alarbus, could have come from George Puttenham's The Arte of English Poesie (1589), which contains the line \\"the Roman prince did daunt/Wild Africans and the lawless Alarbes.\\"Quoted in Waith (1984: 87) G. K. Hunter has suggested Shakespeare may have taken Saturninus' name from Herodian's History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus, which features a jealous and violent tribune named Saturninus.Hunter (1983b: 183) On the other hand, Waith speculates that Shakespeare may have been thinking of an astrological theory which he could have seen in Guy Marchant's The Kalendayr of the shyppars (1503), which states that Saturnine men (i.e. men born under the influence of Saturn) are \\"false, envious and malicious.\\"Quoted in Waith (1984: 83) Shakespeare most likely took the names of Caius, Demetrius, Marcus, Martius, Quintus, √Ümilius, and Sempronius from Plutarch's Life of Scipio Africanus. Bassianus' name probably came from Lucius Septimius Bassianus, better known as Caracalla, who, like Bassianus in the play, fights with his brother over succession, one appealing to primogeniture and the other to popularity.Law (1943: 147) Ballad, prose history, and source debate Any discussion of the sources of Titus Andronicus is complicated by the existence of two other versions of the story; a prose history and a ballad (both of which are anonymous and undated). The first definite reference to the ballad \\"Titus Andronicus' Complaint\\" is an entry in the Stationers' Register by the printer John Danter on 6 February 1594, where the entry \\"A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus\\" is immediately followed by \\"Entred also vnto him, the ballad thereof\\". The earliest surviving copy of the ballad is in Richard Johnson's The Golden Garland of Princely Pleasures and Delicate Delights (1620), but the date of its composition is unknown. The prose was first published in chapbook form some time between 1736 and 1764 by Cluer Dicey under the title The History of Titus Andronicus, the Renowned Roman General (the ballad was also included in the chapbook), however it is believed to be much older than that. The copyright records from the Stationers' Register in Shakespeare's own lifetime provide some tenuous evidence regarding the dating of the prose. On 19 April 1602, the publisher Thomas Millington sold his share in the copyright of \\"A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus\\" (which Danter had initially entered into the Register in 1594) to Thomas Pavier. The orthodox belief is that this entry refers to the play. However, the next version of the play to be published was for Edward White, in 1611, printed by Edward Allde, thus prompting the question of why Pavier never published the play despite owning the copyright for nine years. Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr. believes that the original Danter entry in 1594 is not a reference to the play but to the prose, and the subsequent transferrals of copyright relate to the prose, not the play, thus explaining why Pavier never published the play. Similarly, W. W. Greg believes that all copyright to the play lapsed upon Danter's death in 1600, hence the 1602 transferral from Millington to Pavier was illegitimate unless it refers to something other than the play; i.e. the prose. Both scholars conclude that the evidence seems to imply the prose existed by early 1594 at the latest.For an extensive examination of the complex copyright history of the play and prose, see Adams (1936) and W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration, Volume 1: Stationers' Records, Plays to 1616 (London: Bibliographic Society, 1939) However, even if the prose was in existence by 1594, there is no solid evidence to suggest the order in which the play, ballad and prose were written and which served as source for which. Traditionally, the prose has been seen as the original, with the play derived from it, and the ballad derived from both play and prose. Adams Jr., for example, firmly believed in this order (prose-play-ballad)Adams (1936: 8) as did John Dover WilsonDover Wilson (1948: viii) and Geoffrey Bullough.Bullough (1966: 7‚Äì20) This theory is by no means universally accepted however. For example, Ralph M. Sargent agrees with Adams and Bullough that the prose was the source of the play, but he argues that the poem was also a source of the play (prose-ballad-play).Sargent (1971) On the other hand, Marco Mincoff rejects both theories, arguing instead that the play came first, and served as a source for both the ballad and the prose (play- ballad-prose).Mincoff (1971) G. Harold Metz felt that Mincoff was incorrect and reasserted the primacy of the prose-play-ballad sequence.Metz (1975) G.K. Hunter however, believes that Adams, Dover Wilson, Bullough, Sargent, Mincoff and Metz were all wrong, and the play was the source for the prose, with both serving as sources for the ballad (play-prose-ballad).Hunter (1983a) and Hunter (1983b) In his 1984 edition of the play for The Oxford Shakespeare, Eugene M. Waith rejects Hunter's theory and supports the original prose-play- ballad sequence.Waith (1984: 30‚Äì34) On the other hand, in his 1995 edition for the Arden Shakespeare 3rd Series, Jonathan Bate favours Mincoff's theory of play-ballad-prose.Bate (1995: 83‚Äì85) In the introduction to the 2001 edition of the play for the Penguin Shakespeare (edited by Sonia Massai), Jacques Berthoud agrees with Waith and settles on the initial prose-play-ballad sequence.Massai (2001: xxix) In his 2006 revised edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Alan Hughes also argues for the original prose-play-ballad theory, but hypothesizes that the source for the ballad was exclusively the prose, not the play.Hughes (2006: 10) Ultimately, there is no overriding critical consensus on the issue of the order in which the play, prose and ballad were written, with the only tentative agreement being that all three were probably in existence by 1594 at the latest. Date and text Date Title page of the first quarto (1594) The earliest known record of Titus Andronicus is found in Philip Henslowe's diary on 24 January 1594, where Henslowe recorded a performance by Sussex's Men of \\"Titus & ondronicus\\", probably at The Rose. Henslowe marked the play as \\"ne\\", which most critics take to mean \\"new\\". There were subsequent performances on 29 January and 6 February.Bate (1995: 70) Also on 6 February, the printer John Danter entered into the Stationers' Register \\"A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus\\". Later in 1594, Danter published the play in quarto under the title The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedie of Titus Andronicus (referred to by scholars as Q1) for the booksellers Edward White and Thomas Millington, making it the first of Shakespeare's plays to be printed. This evidence establishes that the latest possible date of composition is late 1593. There is evidence, however, that the play may have been written some years earlier than this. Perhaps the most famous such evidence relates to a comment made in 1614 by Ben Jonson in Bartholomew Fair. In the preface, Jonson wrote \\"He that will swear, Jeronimo or Andronicus are the best plays, yet shall pass unexcepted at, here, as a man whose judgement shows it is constant, and hath stood still these five and twenty, or thirty years.\\" The success and popularity of Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, to which Jonson alludes, is attested by many contemporary documents, so by placing Titus alongside it, Jonson is saying that Titus too must have been extremely popular in its day, but by 1614, both plays had come to be seen as old fashioned. If Jonson is taken literally, for the play to have been between 25 and 30 years old in 1614, it must have been written between 1584 and 1589, a theory which not all scholars reject out of hand. For example, in his 1953 edition of the play for the Arden Shakespeare 2nd Series, J.C. Maxwell argues for a date of late 1589.Maxwell (1953: xxvi) Similarly, E.A.J. Honigmann, in his 'early start' theory of 1982, suggests that Shakespeare wrote the play several years before coming to London , and that Titus was actually his first play, written .See E.A.J. Honigmann, Shakespeare's Impact on his Contemporaries (London: Macmillan, 1982) In his Cambridge Shakespeare edition of 1994 and again in 2006, Alan Hughes makes a similar argument, believing the play was written very early in Shakespeare's career, before he came to London, possibly .Hughes (2006: 6) However, the majority of scholars tend to favour a post-1590 date, and one of the primary arguments for this is that the title page of Q1 assigns the play to three different playing companies; Derby's Men, Pembroke's Men and Sussex's Men (\\"As it was Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Su≈ø≈øex their Seruants\\"). This is highly unusual in copies of Elizabethan plays, which usually refer to one company only, if any.Jonathan Bate records only two printed plays prior to Q1 of Titus which mention more than one acting company; John Lyly's Sapho and Phao and Campaspe, with both plays advertised as performed by Queen's Men and Paul's Men (Bate; 1995: 75) If the order of the listing is chronological, as Eugene M. Waith and Jacques Berthoud, for example, believe it is, it means that Sussex's Men were the last to perform the play, suggesting it had been on stage quite some time prior to 24 January 1594.See Waith (1984: 8) and Massai (2001: xxiv) Waith hypothesises that the play originally belonged to Derby's Men, but after the closure of the London theatres on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of plague, Derby's Men sold the play to Pembroke's Men, who were going on a regional tour to Bath and Ludlow. The tour was a financial failure, and the company returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. At that point, they sold the play to Sussex's Men, who would go on to perform it on 24 January 1594 at The Rose.Waith (1984: 8‚Äì10) If one accepts this theory, it suggests a date of composition as some time in early to mid-1592. However, Jonathan Bate and Alan Hughes have argued that there is no evidence that the listing is chronological, and no precedent on other title pages for making that assumption. Additionally, a later edition of the play gives a different order of acting companies ‚Äì Pembroke's Men, Derby's Men, Sussex' Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men, suggesting the order is random and cannot be used to help date the play.See Bate (1995: 75) and Hughes (2006: 3) As such, even amongst scholars who favour a post-1590 date, 1592 is by no means universally accepted. Jacques Berthoud, for example, argues that Shakespeare had close associations with Derby's Men and \\"it would seem that Titus Andronicus must already have entered the repertoire of Derby's Men by the end of 1591 or the start of 1592 at the latest.\\"Massai (2001: xxiv) Berthoud believes this places the date of composition some time in 1591. Another theory is provided by Jonathan Bate, who finds it significant that Q1 lacks the \\"sundry times\\" comment found on virtually every sixteenth-century play; the claim on a title page that a play had been performed \\"sundry times\\" was an attempt by publishers to emphasise its popularity, and its absence on Q1 indicates that the play was so new, it hadn't been performed anywhere. Bate also finds significance in the fact that prior to the rape of Lavinia, Chiron and Demetrius vow to use Bassianus' body as a pillow. Bate believes this connects the play to Thomas Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller, which was completed on 27 June 1593. Verbal similarities between Titus and George Peele's poem The Honour of the Garter are also important for Bate. The poem was written to celebrate the installation of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland as a Knight of the Garter on 26 June 1593. Bate takes these three pieces of evidence to suggest a timeline which sees Shakespeare complete his Henry VI trilogy prior to the closing of the theatres in June 1592. At this time, he turns to classical antiquity to aid him in his poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. Then, towards the end of 1593, with the prospect of the theatres being reopened, and with the classical material still fresh in his mind, he wrote Titus as his first tragedy, shortly after reading Nashe's novel and Peele's poem, all of which suggests a date of composition of late 1593.Bate (1995: 66‚Äì79) Title page of the second quarto (1600) Other critics have attempted to use more scientific methods to determine the date of the play. For example, Gary Taylor has employed stylometry, particularly the study of contractions, colloquialisms, rare words and function words. Taylor concludes that the entire play except Act 3, Scene 2 was written just after Henry VI, Part 2 and Henry VI, Part 3, which he assigns to late 1591 or early 1592. As such, Taylor settles on a date of mid-1592 for Titus. He also argues that 3.2, which is only found in the 1623 Folio text, was written contemporaneously with Romeo and Juliet, in late 1593.See Gary Taylor, \\"The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays\\", in Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery (eds.), William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 69‚Äì144 Title page of the third quarto (1611) However, if the play was written and performed by 1588 (Hughes), 1589 (Maxwell), 1591 (Berthoud), 1592 (Waith and Taylor), or 1593 (Bate), why did Henslowe refer to it as \\"ne\\" in 1594? R.A. Foakes and R.T. Rickert, modern editors of Henslowe's Diary, argue that \\"ne\\" could refer to a newly licensed play, which would make sense if one accepts Waith's argument that Pembroke's Men had sold the rights to Sussex's Men upon returning from their failed tour of the provinces. Foakes and Rickert also point out that \\"ne\\" could refer to a newly revised play, suggesting editing on Shakespeare's part some time in late 1593.Foakes and Rickert (1961, xxx) Waith sees this suggestion as especially important insofar as John Dover Wilson and Gary Taylor have shown that the text as it exists in Q1 does seem to indicate editing.For more information on the theory of 1593 editing, see Dover Wilson (1948: xxxiv‚Äìxxxv) and Gary Taylor, \\"The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays\\", in Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery (eds.), William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 69‚Äì144 However, that \\"ne\\" does actually stand for \\"new\\" is not fully accepted; in 1991, Winifred Frazer argued that \\"ne\\" is actually an abbreviation for \\"Newington Butts\\". Brian Vickers, amongst others, finds Frazer's arguments convincing, which renders interpretation of Henslow's entry even more complex.See Winifred Frazer, \\"Henslowe's \\"ne\\"\\", Notes and Queries, 38:1 (Spring, 1991), 34‚Äì35, and Vickers (2002: 149) for more information on this theory Text The 1594 quarto text of the play, with the same title, was reprinted by James Roberts for Edward White in 1600 (Q2). On 19 April 1602, Millington sold his share in the copyright to Thomas Pavier. However, the next version of the play was published again for White, in 1611, under the slightly altered title The Most Lamentable Tragedie of Titus Andronicus, printed by Edward Allde (Q3). Q1 is considered a 'good text' (i.e. not a bad quarto or a reported text), and it forms the basis for most modern editions of the play. Q2 appears to be based on a damaged copy of Q1, as it is missing a number of lines which are replaced by what appear to be guess work on the part of the compositor. This is especially noticeable at the end of the play where four lines of dialogue have been added to Lucius' closing speech; \\"See justice done on Aaron, that damned Moor,/By whom our heavy haps had their beginning;/Then afterwards to order well the state,/That like events may ne'er it ruinate.\\" Scholars tend to assume that when the compositor got to the last page and saw the damage, he presumed some lines were missing, when in fact none were.Dover Wilson (1948: vii) Q2 was considered the control text until 1904, when the copy of Q1 now at the Folger Shakespeare Library was discovered in Sweden.Andrew Murphy, Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing (Cambridge University Press, 2003), 23 Together with a 1594 printing of Henry VI, Part II, the Folger's Q1 Titus is the earliest extant printed Shakespearean play.Esther Ferington (ed.), Infinite Variety: Exploring the Folger Shakespeare Library (University of Washington Press, 2002), 155 Q2 also corrects a number of minor errors in Q1. Q3 is a further degradation of Q2, and includes a number of corrections to the Q2 text, but introduces many more errors. The First Folio text of 1623 (F1), under the title The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus, is based primarily on the Q3 text (which is why modern editors use Q1 as the control rather than the usual practice in Shakespeare of using the Folio text). However, the Folio text includes material found in none of the quarto editions, primarily Act 3, Scene 2 (also called the 'fly-killing scene'). It is believed that while Q3 was probably the main source for the Folio, an annotated prompter's copy was also used, particularly in relation to stage directions, which differ significantly from all of the quarto texts.See Adams (1936: 19‚Äì25) for an extensive comparison between the four versions of the play: Q1, Q2, Q3 and F1. See also the various collations to the many modern editions of the play, such as Dover Wilson (1948), Maxwell (1953), Harrison (1958), Barnet (1963, 1989 and 2005), Cross (1966 and 1977), Waith (1984), Hughes (1994 and 2006), Bate (1995), MacDonald (2000) and Massai (2001) As such, the text of the play that is today known as Titus Andronicus involves a combination of material from Q1 and F1, the vast majority of which is taken from Q1. The Peacham drawing () The Peacham drawing An important piece of evidence relating to both the dating and text of Titus is the so-called 'Peacham drawing' or 'Longleat manuscript'; the only surviving contemporary Shakespearean illustration, now residing in the library of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat. The drawing appears to depict a performance of Titus, under which is quoted some dialogue. Eugene M. Waith argues of the illustration that \\"the gestures and costumes give us a more vivid impression of the visual impact of Elizabethan acting than we get from any other source.\\"Waith (1984: 27) Far from being an acknowledged source of evidence however, the document has provoked varying interpretations, with its date in particular often called into question. The fact that the text reproduced in the drawing seems to borrow from Q1, Q2, Q3 and F1, while also inventing some of its own readings, further complicates matters. Additionally, a possible association with Shakespearean forger John Payne Collier has served to undermine its authenticity, while some scholars believe it depicts a play other than Titus Andronicus, and is therefore of limited use to Shakespeareans.See for example June Schlueter, \\"Rereading the Peacham Drawing\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, 50:2 (Summer, 1999), 171‚Äì184 and Brian Vickers, Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 149‚Äì150. Analysis and criticism Critical history Although Titus was extremely popular in its day, over the course of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries it became perhaps Shakespeare's most maligned play, and it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that this pattern of denigration showed any signs of subsiding.For a thorough overview of the early critical history of the play, see Dover Wilson (1948: vii‚Äìxix). One of the earliest, and one of the most famous critical disparagements of the play occurred in 1687, in the introduction to Edward Ravenscroft's theatrical adaptation, Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter'd from Mr. Shakespeare's Works. Speaking of the original play, Ravenscroft wrote, \\"'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his works. It seems rather a heap of rubbish than a structure.\\"Quoted in Bate (1995: 79) In 1765, Samuel Johnson questioned the possibility of even staging the play, pointing out that \\"the barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any audience.\\"Quoted in Bate (1995: 33) In 1811, August Wilhelm Schlegel wrote that the play was \\"framed according to a false idea of the tragic, which by an accumulation of cruelties and enormities, degenerated into the horrible and yet leaves no deep impression behind.\\"A.W. Schlegel, Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature (London: George Bell & Sons, 1879), 442 In 1927, T.S. Eliot famously argued that it was \\"one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written, a play in which it is incredible that Shakespeare had any hand at all, a play in which the best passages would be too highly honoured by the signature of Peele.\\"T.S. Eliot, \\"Seneca in Elizabethan Translation\\", Selected Essays 1917‚Äì1932 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1950), 67 In 1948, John Dover Wilson wrote that the play \\"seems to jolt and bump along like some broken-down cart, laden with bleeding corpses from an Elizabethan scaffold, and driven by an executioner from Bedlam dressed in cap and bells.\\"Dover Wilson (1948: xii) He goes on to say that if the play had been by anyone other than Shakespeare, it would have been lost and forgotten; it is only because tradition holds that Shakespeare wrote it (which Dover Wilson highly suspects) that it is remembered, not for any intrinsic qualities of its own. However, although the play continued to have its detractors, it began to acquire its champions as well. In his 1998 book, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, Harold Bloom defended Titus from various critical attacks it's had over the years, insisting the play is meant to be a \\"parody\\" and it's only bad \\"if you take it straight.\\" He claims the uneven reactions audiences have had are a result of directors misunderstanding Shakespeare's intent, which was \\"mocking and exploiting Marlowe,\\" and its only suitable director would be Mel Brooks.See Bloom (1998; 77‚Äì86) Another champion came in 2001, when Jacques Berthoud pointed out that until shortly after World War II, \\"Titus Andronicus was taken seriously only by a handful of textual and bibliographic scholars. Readers, when they could be found, mostly regarded it as a contemptible farrago of violence and bombast, while theatrical managers treated it as either a script in need of radical rewriting, or as a show-biz opportunity for a star actor.\\" By 2001 however, this was no longer the case, as many prominent scholars had come out in defence of the play. One such scholar was Jan Kott. Speaking of its apparent gratuitous violence, Kott argued that > Titus Andronicus is by no means the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More > people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole > Shakespearean repertory I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's > death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have > seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching > Titus Andronicus we come to understand ‚Äì perhaps more than by looking at any > other Shakespeare play ‚Äì the nature of his genius: he gave an inner > awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare > discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on > earth.Kott (1964: 27) In his 1987 edition of the play for the Contemporary Shakespeare series, A.L. Rowse speculates as to why the fortunes of the play have begun to change during the 20th century; \\"in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed. Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable.\\"A.L. Rowse, Titus Andronicus; Contemporary Shakespeare Series (Maryland: University of America Press, 1987), 15 Thomas Kirk illustration of Aaron protecting his son from Chiron and Demetrius in Act 4, Scene 2; engraved by J. Hogg (1799) Director Julie Taymor, who staged a production Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most \\"relevant of Shakespeare's plays for the modern era.\\"Julie Taymor, DVD Commentary for Titus; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2000 As she believes we live in the most violent period in history, Taymor feels that the play has acquired more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; \\"it seems like a play written for today, it reeks of now.\\" Jonathan Forman, when he reviewed Taymor's film for the New York Post, agreed and stated: \\"It is the Shakespeare play for our time, a work of art that speaks directly to the age of Rwanda and Bosnia.\\" =Authorship= Perhaps the most frequently discussed topic in the play's critical history is that of authorship. None of the three quarto editions of Titus name the author, which was normal for Elizabethan plays. However, Francis Meres does list the play as one of Shakespeare's tragedies in Palladis Tamia in 1598. Additionally, John Heminges and Henry Condell felt sure enough of Shakespeare's authorship to include it in the First Folio in 1623. As such, with what little available solid evidence suggesting that Shakespeare did indeed write the play, questions of authorship tend to focus on the perceived lack of quality in the writing, and often the play's resemblance to the work of contemporaneous dramatists. The first to question Shakespeare's authorship is thought to have been Edward Ravenscroft in 1678, and over the course of the eighteenth century, numerous renowned Shakespeareans followed suit; Nicholas Rowe, Alexander Pope, Lewis Theobald, Samuel Johnson, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, William Guthrie, John Upton, Benjamin Heath, Richard Farmer, John Pinkerton, and John Monck Mason, and in the nineteenth century, William Hazlitt and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Vickers (2002: 152n11) All doubted Shakespeare's authorship. So strong had the anti- Shakespearean movement become during the eighteenth century that in 1794, Thomas Percy wrote in the introduction to Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, \\"Shakespeare's memory has been fully vindicated from the charge of writing the play by the best critics.\\"Quoted in Waith (1984: 12) Similarly, in 1832, the Globe Illustrated Shakespeare claimed there was universal agreement on the matter due to the un-Shakespearean \\"barbarity\\" of the play. However, despite the fact that so many Shakespearean scholars believed the play to have been written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.See Vickers (2002: 150‚Äì156) for a summary of the pre 20th century pro and anti- Shakespearean arguments. Twentieth century criticism moved away from trying to prove or disprove that Shakespeare wrote the play, and has instead come to focus on the issue of co-authorship. Ravenscroft had hinted at this in 1678, but the first modern scholar to look at the theory was John Mackinnon Robertson in 1905, who concluded that \\"much of the play is written by George Peele, and it is hardly less certain that much of the rest was written by Robert Greene or Kyd, with some by Marlow.\\"Robertson (1905: 479) In 1919, T.M. Parrott reached the conclusion that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1,Parrott (1919: 21‚Äì27) and in 1931, Philip Timberlake corroborated Parrott's findings.Philip Timberlake, The Feminine Ending in English Blank Verse: A Study of its Use by Early Writers in the Measure and its Development in the Drama up to the Year 1595 (Wisconsin: Banta, 1931), 114‚Äì119 Illustration of Aaron protecting his son from Chiron and Demetrius in Act 4, Scene 2; from Joseph Graves' Dramatic tales founded on Shakespeare's plays (1840) The first major critic to challenge Robertson, Parrott and Timberlake was E.K. Chambers, who successfully exposed inherent flaws in Robertson's methodology.Vickers (2002: 137) In 1933, Arthur M. Sampley employed the techniques of Parrott to argue against Peele as co-author,Sampley (1936: 693) and in 1943, Hereward Thimbleby Price also argued that Shakespeare wrote alone.Price (1943: 55‚Äì65) Beginning in 1948, with John Dover Wilson, many scholars have tended to favour the theory that Shakespeare and Peele collaborated in some way. Dover Wilson, for his part, believed that Shakespeare edited a play originally written by Peele.Dover Wilson (1948: xxxvi‚Äìxxxvii) In 1957, R.F. Hill approached the issue by analysing the distribution of rhetorical devices in the play. Like Parrott in 1919 and Timberlake in 1931, he ultimately concluded that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, while Shakespeare wrote everything else.Hill (1957: 60‚Äì68) In 1979, Macdonald Jackson employed a rare word test, and ultimately came to an identical conclusion as Parrott, Timberlake and Hill.Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare (Salzburg: Salzburg University Press, 1979), 147‚Äì153 In 1987, Marina Tarlinskaja used a quantitative analysis of the occurrence of stresses in the iambic pentameter line, and she too concluded that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.Shakespeare's Verse: Iambic Pentameter and the Poet's Idiosyncrasies (New York: P. Lang, 1987), 121‚Äì124 In 1996, Macdonald Jackson returned to the authorship question with a new metrical analysis of the function words \\"and\\" and \\"with\\". His findings also suggested that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.Jackson (1996: 138‚Äì145) However, there have always been scholars who believe that Shakespeare worked on the play alone. Many of the editors of the various twentieth century scholarly editions of the play for example, have argued against the co-authorship theory; Eugene M. Waith in his Oxford Shakespeare edition of 1985, Alan Hughes in his Cambridge Shakespeare edition of 1994 and again in 2006, and Jonathan Bate in his Arden Shakespeare edition of 1995. In the case of Bate however, in 2002, he came out in support of Brian Vickers' book Shakespeare, Co-Author which restates the case for Peele as the author of Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.Chernaik (2004: 1030) Vickers' analysis of the issue is the most extensive yet undertaken. As well as analysing the distribution of a large number of rhetorical devices throughout the play, he also devised three new authorship tests; an analysis of polysyllabic words, an analysis of the distribution of alliteration and an analysis of vocatives. His findings led him to assert, with complete confidence, that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1.Vickers (2002: 219‚Äì239) Vickers' findings have not been universally accepted.Carroll (2004) Language Jean-Michel Moreau illustration of Lucius telling his father the tribunes have left, from Act 3, Scene 1; engraved by N. le Mire (1785) The language of Titus has always had a central role in criticism of the play insofar as those who doubt Shakespeare's authorship have often pointed to the apparent deficiencies in the language as evidence of that claim. However, the quality of the language has had its defenders over the years, critics who argue that the play is more linguistically complex than is often thought, and features a more accomplished use of certain linguistic motifs than has hitherto been allowed for. One of the most basic such motifs is repetition. Several words and topics occur time and again, serving to connect and contrast characters and scenes, and to foreground certain themes. Perhaps the most obvious recurring motifs are those of honour, virtue and nobility, all of which are mentioned multiple times throughout the play, especially during the first act; the play's opening line is Saturninus' address to \\"Noble patricians, patrons of my right\\" (l.1). In the second speech of the play, Bassianus states \\"And suffer not dishonour to approach/The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,/To justice, continence and nobility;/But let desert in pure election shine\\" (ll.13‚Äì16). From this point onwards, the concept of nobility is at the heart of everything that happens. H.B. Charlton argues of this opening Act that \\"the standard of moral currency most in use is honour.\\"H.B. Charlton, Shakespearean Tragedy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1949), 105 When Marcus announces Titus' imminent arrival, he emphasises Titus' renowned honour and integrity; \\"And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,/Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,/Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms./Let us entreat by honour of his name/Whom worthily you would have now succeed\\" (ll.36‚Äì40). Marcus' reference to Titus' name is even itself an allusion to his nobility insofar as Titus' full title (Titus Pius) is an honorary epitaph which \\"refers to his devotion to patriotic duty.\\"Waith (1984: 84n23) Bassianus then cites his own admiration for all of the Andronici; \\"Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy/In thy uprightness and integrity,/And so I love and honour thee and thine,/Thy noble brother Titus, and his sons\\" (ll.47‚Äì50). Upon Titus' arrival, an announcement is made; \\"Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,/Successful in the battles that he fights,/With honour and with fortune is returned\\" (ll.65‚Äì68). Once Titus has arrived on-stage, it is not long before he too is speaking of honour, virtue and integrity, referring to the family tomb as a \\"sweet cell of virtue and nobility\\" (l.93). After Titus chooses Saturninus as Emperor, they praise one another's honour, with Saturninus referring to Titus' \\"honourable family\\" (ll.239) and Titus claiming \\"I hold me highly honoured of your grace\\" (ll.245). Titus then says to Tamora, \\"Now, madam, are you prisoner to an Emperor ‚Äì/To him that for your honour and your state/Will use you nobly and your followers\\" (ll.258‚Äì260). Even when things begin to go awry for the Andronici, each one maintains a firm grasp of his own interpretation of honour. The death of Mutius comes about because Titus and his sons have different concepts of honour; Titus feels the Emperor's desires should have precedence, his sons that Roman law should govern all, including the Emperor. As such, when Lucius reprimands Titus for slaying one of his own sons, Titus responds \\"Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;/My sons would never so dishonour me\\" (l.296). Moments later, Saturninus declares to Titus \\"I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once,/Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,/Confederates all to dishonour me\\" (ll.301‚Äì303). Subsequently, Titus cannot quite believe that Saturninus has chosen Tamora as his empress and again sees himself dishonoured; \\"Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,/Dishonoured thus and challeng'd of wrongs\\" (ll.340‚Äì341). When Marcus is pleading with Titus that Mutius should be allowed to be buried in the family tomb, he implores, \\"Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter/His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,/That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.\\" (ll.375‚Äì377). Having reluctantly agreed to allow Mutius a royal burial, Titus then returns to the issue of how he feels his sons have turned on him and dishonoured him; \\"The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,/To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome\\" (ll.384‚Äì385). At this point, Marcus, Martius, Quintus and Lucius declare of the slain Mutius, \\"He lives in fame, that died in virtue's cause\\" (ll.390). Other characters also become involved in the affray resulting from the disagreement among the Andronici, and they too are equally concerned with honour. After Saturninus has condemned Titus, Bassianus appeals to him, \\"This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,/Is in opinion and in honour wronged\\" (ll.415‚Äì416). Then, in a surprising move, Tamora suggests to Saturninus that he should forgive Titus and his family. Saturninus is at first aghast, believing that Tamora is now dishonouring him as well; \\"What madam, be dishonoured openly,/And basely put it up without revenge?\\" (ll.442‚Äì443), to which Tamora replies, > Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forefend > I should be author to dishonour you. > But on mine honour dare I undertake > For good Lord Titus' innocence in all, > Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs. > Then at my suit look graciously on him; > Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose. > :::::::(ll.434‚Äì440) The irony here, of course, is that her false appeal to honour is what begins the bloody cycle of revenge which dominates the rest of the play. Thomas Kirk illustration of Young Lucius fleeing from Lavinia in Act 4, Scene 1; engraved by B. Reading (1799) Although not all subsequent scenes are as heavily saturated with references to honour, nobility and virtue as is the opening, they are continually alluded to throughout the play. Other notable examples include Aaron's description of Tamora; \\"Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,/And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown\\" (2.1.10‚Äì11). An ironic and sarcastic reference to honour occurs when Bassianus and Lavinia encounter Aaron and Tamora in the forest and Bassianus tells Tamora \\"your swarthy Cimmerian/Doth make your honour of his body's hue,/Spotted, detested, and abominable\\" (2.3.72‚Äì74). Later, after the Clown has delivered Titus' letter to Saturninus, Saturninus declares \\"Go, drag the villain hither by the hair./Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege\\" (4.4.55‚Äì56). Another example is seen outside Rome, when a Goth refers to Lucius \\"Whose high exploits and honourable deeds/Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt\\" (5.1.11‚Äì12). A further significant motif is metaphor related to violence; \\"the world of Titus is not simply one of meaningless acts of random violence but rather one in which language engenders violence and violence is done to language through the distance between word and thing, between metaphor and what it represents.\\" For example, in 3.1 when Titus asks Aaron to cut off his hand because he believes it will save his sons' lives he says, \\"Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.\\" Therefore, in the language of Titus, \\"to lend one's hand is to risk dismemberment.\\" No discussion of the language of Titus is complete without reference to Marcus's speech upon finding Lavinia after her rape: > Who is this? My niece that flies away so fast? > Cousin, a word: where is your husband? > If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me! > If I do wake, some Planet strike me down, > That I may slumber in eternal sleep! > Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands > Hath lopped, and hewed and made thy body bare > Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments, > Whose circling shadows, Kings have sought to sleep in, > And might not gain so great a happiness > As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me? > Alas, a crimson river of warm blood, > Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind, > Doth rise and fall between thy ros'd lips, > Coming and going with thy honey breath. > But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee, > And, lest thou should'st detect him, cut thy tongue. > Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame; > And notwithstanding all this loss of blood, > As from a conduit with three issuing spouts, > Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face, > Blushing to be encountered with a cloud. > Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so? > O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast, > That I might rail at him to ease my mind! > Sorrow conceal'd, like an oven stopped, > Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. > Fair Philomela, why she but lost her tongue, > And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind; > But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee. > A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met, > And he hath cut those pretty fingers off, > That could have better sowed then Philomel. > O, had the monster seen those lily hands > Tremble, like aspen leaves, upon a lute, > And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, > He would not then have touched them for his life. > Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony > Which that sweet tongue hath made, > He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep, > As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. > Come, let us go, and make thy father blind, > For such a sight will blind a father's eye. > One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads; > What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes? > Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee; > O, could our mourning ease thy misery! > :::::::(2.4.11‚Äì57) Edward Smith illustration of Lavinia pleading with Tamora for mercy from Act 2, Scene 3 (1841) In this much discussed speech, the discrepancy between the beautiful imagery and the horrific sight before us has been noted by many critics as jarring, and the speech is often severely edited or completely removed for performance; in the 1955 RSC production, for example, director Peter Brook cut the speech entirely. There is also a great deal of disagreement amongst critics as to the essential meaning of the speech. John Dover Wilson, for example, sees it as nothing more than a parody, Shakespeare mocking the work of his contemporaries by writing something so bad. He finds no other tonally analogous speech in all of Shakespeare, concluding it is \\"a bundle of ill-matched conceits held together by sticky sentimentalism.\\"Dover Wilson (1948: liii‚Äìliv) Similarly, Eugene M. Waith determines that the speech is an aesthetic failure that may have looked good on the page but which is incongruous in performance.Waith (1984: 61) However, defenders of the play have posited several theories which seek to illustrate the thematic relevance of the speech. For example, Nicholas Brooke argues that it \\"stands in the place of a choric commentary on the crime, establishing its significance to the play by making an emblem of the mutilated woman.\\"Nicholas Brooke, Shakespeare's Early Tragedies (New York: Barnes & Noble, 1968), 306 Actress Eve Myles, who played Lavinia in the 2003 RSC production suggests that Marcus \\"tries to bandage her wounds with language,\\" thus the speech has a calming effect and is Marcus' attempt to soothe Lavinia. Another theory is suggested by Anthony Brian Taylor, who argues simply that Marcus is babbling; \\"beginning with references to \\"dream\\" and \\"slumber\\" and ending with one to sleep, the speech is an old man's reverie; shaken by the horrible and totally unexpected spectacle before him, he has succumbed to the senile tendency to drift away and become absorbed in his own thoughts rather than confront the harshness of reality.\\"Taylor (1997: 149) Jonathan Bate however, sees the speech as more complex, arguing that it attempts to give voice to the indescribable. Bate thus sees it as an illustration of language's ability to \\"bring back that which has been lost,\\" i.e. Lavinia's beauty and innocence is figuratively returned in the beauty of the language.Bate (1995: 111) Similarly, for Brian Vickers, \\"these sensual pictorial images are appropriate to Lavinia's beauty now forever destroyed. That is, they serve one of the constant functions of tragedy, to document the metabol√©, that tragic contrast between what people once were and what they have become.\\"Vickers (2002: 240) Jacques Berthoud provides another theory, arguing that the speech \\"exhibits two qualities seldom found together: an unevasive emotional recognition of the horrors of her injuries, and the knowledge that, despite her transformation into a living grave of herself, she remains the person he knows and loves.\\" Thus the speech evokes Marcus' \\"protective identification\\" with her.Massai (2001: xxxi‚Äìxxxvi) D.J. Palmer feels that the speech is an attempt to rationalise in Marcus' own mind the sheer horror of what he is seeing; > Marcus' lament is an effort to realise a sight that taxes to the utmost the > powers of understanding and utterance. The vivid conceits in which he > pictures his hapless niece do not transform or depersonalise her: she is > already transformed and depersonalised ... Far from being a retreat from the > awful reality into some aesthetic distance, then, Marcus' conceits dwell > upon this figure that is to him both familiar and strange, fair and hideous, > living body and object: this is, and is not, Lavinia. Lavinia's plight is > literally unutterable ... Marcus' formal lament articulates unspeakable > woes. Here and throughout the play the response to the intolerable is > ritualised, in language and action, because ritual is the ultimate means by > which man seeks to order and control his precarious and unstable > world.Palmer (1972: 321‚Äì322) In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several scholars have argued that while the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech \\"became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had the sense of a suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream.\\"Shakespeare Survey, 41 (1988) Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes \\"we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience.\\"Dessen (1988: 60) Samuel Woodforde illustration of Tamora watching Lavinia dragged away to be raped, from Act 2, Scene 3; engraved by Anker Smith (1793) Looking at the language of the play in a more general sense has also produced a range of critical theories. For example, Jacques Berthoud argues that the rhetoric of the play is explicitly bound up with its theme; \\"the entire dramatic script, soliloquies included, functions as a network of responses and reactions. [The language's] primary and consistent function is interlocutory.\\"Massai (2001: xxxi) An entirely different interpretation is that of Jack Reese, who argues that Shakespeare's use of language functions to remove the audience from the effects and implications of violence; it has an almost Brechtian verfremdungseffekt. Using the example of Marcus' speech, Reese argues that the audience is disconnected from the violence through the seemingly incongruent descriptions of that violence. Such language serves to \\"further emphasise the artificiality of the play; in a sense, they suggest to the audience that it is hearing a poem read rather than seeing the events of that poem put into dramatic form.\\"Reese (1970: 78) Gillian Kendall, however, reaches the opposite conclusion, arguing that rhetorical devices such as metaphor augment the violent imagery, not diminish it, because the figurative use of certain words complements their literal counterparts. This, however, \\"disrupts the way the audience perceives imagery.\\"Kendall (1989: 300) An example of this is seen in the body politic/dead body imagery early in the play, as the two images soon become interchangeable. Another theory is provided by Peter M. Sacks, who argues that the language of the play is marked by \\"an artificial and heavily emblematic style, and above all a revoltingly grotesque series of horrors which seem to have little function but to ironise man's inadequate expressions of pain and loss\\".Sacks (1982: 587) Themes Performance The earliest definite recorded performance of Titus was on 24 January 1594, when Philip Henslowe noted a performance by Sussex's Men of Titus & ondronicus. Although Henslowe doesn't specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men.Waith (1984: 2) The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season.Bate (1995: 70) and Hughes (2006: 13) The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.Ungerer (1961: 102) Some scholars, however, have suggested that the January 1594 performance may not be the first recorded performance of the play. On 11 April 1592, Henslowe recorded ten performances by Derby's Men of a play called Titus and Vespasian, which some, such as E.K. Chambers, have identified with Shakespeare's play.Halliday (1964: 496‚Äì497) Most scholars, however, believe that Titus and Vespasian is more likely a different play about the two real life Roman Emperors, Vespasian, who ruled from 69 to 79, and his son Titus, who ruled from 79 to 81. The two were subjects of many narratives at the time, and a play about them would not have been unusual.Waith (1984: 8) Dover Wilson further argues that the theory that Titus and Vespasian is Titus Andronicus probably originated in an 1865 English translation of a 1620 German translation of Titus, in which Lucius had been renamed Vespasian.Dover Wilson (1948: xli) Philip James de Loutherbourg illustration of Quintus trying to help Martius from the hole in Act 2, Scene 3; engraved by 'Hall' (1785) Although it is known that the play was definitely popular in its day, there is no other recorded performance for many years. In January 1668, it was listed by the Lord Chamberlain as one of twenty-one plays owned by the King's Company which had, at some stage previously, been acted at Blackfriars Theatre; \\"A Catalogue of part of his Mates Servants Playes as they were formally acted at the Blackfryers & now allowed of to his Mates Servants at ye New Theatre.\\"Hughes (2006: 22) However, no other information is provided. During the late seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adaptations of the play came to dominate the stage, and after the Burley performance in 1596 and the possible Blackfriars performance some time prior to 1667, there is no definite recorded performance of the Shakespearean text in England until the early twentieth century. After over 300 years absent from the English stage, the play returned on 8 October 1923, in a production directed by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic, as part of the Vic's presentation of the complete dramatic works over a seven-year period. The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes' performance but criticised Walter's as monotonous.Dessen (1989: 12) Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.Harcourt Williams, Old Vic Saga (London: Winchester, 1949), 51 The earliest known performance of the Shakespearean text in the United States was in April 1924 when the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity of Yale University staged the play under the direction of John M. Berdan and E.M. Woolley as part of a double bill with Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay.Dessen (1989: 14) While some material was removed from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, the rest of the play was left intact, with much attention devoted to the violence and gore. The cast list for this production has been lost.Waith (1984: 50‚Äì51) The best known and most successful production of the play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus.Dessen (1989: 15) The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, it was a huge commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J.C. Trewin for example, wrote \\"the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection.\\"See Dessen (1989: 17‚Äì19) for a cross section of reviews concentrating on the music and Olivier. The production is also noted for muting the violence; Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Martius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing \\"stylised distancing effects.\\" The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.J.C. Trewin, Shakespeare on the English Stage, 1900‚Äì1964 (London: Barry Rocklith, 1965), 235‚Äì237. An overview of the production can also be found in Dessen (1989: 14‚Äì23) The success of the Brook production seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, there has been a steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the end of the play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.An overview of this production can be found in Dessen (1989: 33‚Äì35) Later in 1967, as a direct reaction to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by \\"bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure.\\" He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply doesn't work, as it raises too many practical question, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not take her to the hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that \\"if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals.\\"Quoted in Dessen (1989: 24) As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and Feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid- scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator was also used (played by Charles Dance), who, prior to each act, would announce what was going to happen in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing \\"Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning.\\"New York Times, 10 August 1967An overview of the production can be found in Dessen (1989: 24‚Äì29) In 1972, Trevor Nunn directed an RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, as part of a presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth- century England; he was \\"less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life.\\"Massai (2001: lxxx) In his program notes, Nunn famously wrote \\"Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.\\" He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on- stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.An overview of the production can be found in Dessen (1989: 35‚Äì40) The play was performed for the first time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but everything else was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself.A cross section of reviews of this production can be found in Dessen (1989: 48‚Äì50) As such, \\"for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence.\\"Hughes (2006: 42) A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s.Bate (1996: 1) Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \\"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing,\\" and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience.An extensive overview of this production can be found in Dessen (1989: 57‚Äì70) Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.Hughes (2006: 47n1) In 1988, Mark Rucker directed a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well- received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus in a much more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that by the time of the performance, he weighed 240 lbs. Standing at six-foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.An overview of the production can be found in Dessen (1989: 40‚Äì44) In 1994, Julie Taymor directed the play at the Theater for the New City. The production featured a prologue and epilogue set in the modern era, foregrounded the character of Young Lucius, who acts as a kind of choric observer of events, and starred Robert Stattel as Titus, Melinda Mullins as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron and Miriam Healy-Louie as Lavinia. Heavily inspired in her design by Joel-Peter Witkin, Taymor used stone columns to represent the people of Rome, who she saw as silent and incapable of expressing any individuality or subjectivity.Stephen Pizzello, \\"From Stage to Screen\\", American Cinematographer, 81:2 (February 2000); available on R1 Special Edition DVD of Titus; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2000 Controversially, the play ended with the implication that Lucius had killed Aaron's baby, despite his vow not to. In 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, \\"Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.\\" One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in Plays International in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued \\"the questions raised by Titus went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... Titus Andronicus has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.\\"All information on Doran‚Äôs production taken from Hughes (2006: 49) For the first time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the direction of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.An overview of this production can be found in Hughes (2006: 51‚Äì53) Laura Rees as Lavinia in Lucy Bailey's 2006 production at Shakespeare's Globe; note the 'realistic' effects and blood In 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium ‚Äì a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium. Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia in Yukio Ninagawa's 2006 production (Taitasu Andoronikasu) at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre; note the use of red ribbons as a stylised substitute for blood The second 2006 production opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June as part of the Complete Works Festival, under the title Taitasu Andoronikasu. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey's production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons coming from her mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, at the back of the stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron's baby out to the audience and crying out \\"The horror! The horror!\\" Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; \\"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\\" Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers √âlisab√©thains, said of the scene, \\"audience members turned their heads away in real distress.\\"Eleanor Collins, \\"Titus Andronicus, directed by Lucy Bailey, The Globe, London, 31 May & 11 July 2006\\", Cahiers √âlisab√©thains, 70:2 (Autumn, 2006), 49‚Äì51 Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \\"almost too ghastly to behold.\\" Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \\"chills the blood.\\" Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; \\"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \\"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\\" Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \\"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers √âlisab√©thains, for example, wrote \\"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\\"Neil Allan and Scott Revers, \\"Titus Andronicus, directed by Yukio Ninagawa for The Ninagawa Company, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, 21 June 2006\\", Cahiers √âlisab√©thains, Special Issue: The Royal Shakespeare Company Complete Works (2007), 39‚Äì41 Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \\"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\\"Paul Taylor, \\"Review of Yukio Ninagawa's Titus Andronicus\\", The Independent (22 June 2006) Ninagawa himself said \\"\\"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\\" In her 2013 essay, \\"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn√®s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \\"visual emblem\\"; \\"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to \\"dissonance,\\" the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\\"Agn√®s Lafont, \\"Mythological reconfigurations on the contemporary stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\\", Early Modern Literary Studies, Special Issue 21 (2013) In 2007, Gale Edwards directed a production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company at the Harman Center for the Arts, starring Sam Tsoutsouvas as Titus, Valerie Leonard as Tamora, Colleen Delany as Lavinia and Peter Macon as Aaron. Set in an unspecific modern milieu, props were kept to a minimum, with lighting and general staging kept simple, as Edwards wanted the audience to concentrate on the story, not the staging. The production received generally very favourable reviews. In 2011, Michael Sexton directed a modern military dress production at The Public Theater on a minimalistic set made of plywood boards. The production had a low budget and much of it was spent on huge volumes of blood that literally drenched the actors in the final scene, as Sexton said he was determined to outdo his contemporaries in terms of the amount of on-stage blood in the play. The production starred Jay O. Sanders (who was nominated for a Lucille Lortel) as Titus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Tamora, Ron Cephas Jones as Aaron and Jennifer Ikeda as Lavinia. In 2013, Michael Fentiman directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Stephen Boxer as Titus, Katy Stephens as Tamora, Kevin Harvey as Aaron and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia. Emphasising the gore and violence, the production carried a trailer with warnings of \\"graphic imagery and scenes of butchery.\\" It played at The Swan until October 2013. Also in 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Jon Ciccarelli as part of a special Halloween festival for the Historic Jersey City and Harsimus Cemetery. The production contrasted a military and modern Goth culture, but quickly disintegrated into an anarchic state, stressing the black comedy of the play. Outside Britain and the United States, other significant productions include Qiping Xu's 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein's 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich's 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire play in a crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre's 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as a metaphor for the struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu PurcƒÉrete's 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as a metaphor for the fall of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu (this production is one of the most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).All information taken from Hughes (2006: 47‚Äì50). For more information on the Stein and Mesguich productions see Dominique Goy-Blanquet's \\"Titus resartus\\" in Foreign Shakespeare: Contemporary Performance, edited by Dennis Kennedy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 36‚Äì76 Adaptations Plays The first known adaptation of the play originated in the later years of the sixteenth century. In 1620, a German publication entitled Englische Comedien und Tragedien contained a play called Eine sehr kl√§gliche Tragaedia von Tito Andronico und der hoffertigen K√§yserin darinnen denckw√ºrdige actiones zubefinden (A most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus and the haughty empress, wherein are found memorable events). Transcribed by Frederick Menius, the play was a version of Titus performed by Robert Browne and John Greene's group of travelling players. The overriding plot of Tito Andronico is identical to Titus, but all the character names are different, with the exception of Titus himself. Written in prose, the play does not feature the fly killing scene (3.2), Bassianus does not oppose Saturninus for the throne, Alarbus is absent, Quintus and Mutius are only seen after their death, many of the classical and mythological allusions have been removed; stage directions are much more elaborate, for example, in the banquet scene, Titus is described as wearing blood soaked rags and carrying a butcher knife dripping with blood.See Dover Wilson (1948: xl‚Äìxli), Waith (1984: 7) and Bate (1995: 44‚Äì48) for more information on Tito Andronico Another European adaptation came in 1637, when Dutch dramatist Jan Vos wrote a version of the play entitled Aran en Titus, which was published in 1641, and republished in 1642, 1644, 1648 and 1649, illustrating its popularity. The play may have been based on a 1621 work, now lost, by Adriaen Van den Bergh, which may itself have been a composite of the English Titus and the German Tito Andronico. Vos' play focuses on Aaron, who, in the final scene, is burned alive on stage, beginning a tradition amongst adaptations of foregrounding the Moor and ending the play with his death.Bate (1995: 47) John Bell's edition of Shakespeare (1776) The earliest English language adaptation was in 1678 at Drury Lane, by Edward Ravenscroft; Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter'd from Mr. Shakespeares Works, probably with Thomas Betterton as Titus and Samuel Sandford as Aaron.Dover Wilson (1948: lxviii) In his preface, Ravenscroft wrote \\"Compare the Old Play with this you'l finde that none in all that Authors Works ever receiv'd greater Alterations or Additions, the language not only Refin'd, but many Scenes entirely New: Besides most of the principal Characters heighten'd and the Plot much incresas'd.\\" The play was a huge success and was revived in 1686, and published the following year. It was revived again in 1704 and 1717.Waith (1984: 45) The 1717 revival was especially successful, starring John Mills as Titus, Mrs. Giffard as Tamora, James Quin as Aaron and John Thurmond as Saturninus. The play was revived again in 1718 and 1719 (with John Bickerstaff as Aaron) and 1721 (with Thomas Walker in the role).Hughes (2006: 25) Quin had left Drury Lane in 1718 and gone to Lincoln's Inn Fields, which was owned by John Rich. Rich's actors had little Shakespearean experience, and Quin was soon advertised as the main attraction. In 1718, the adaptation was presented twice at Lincoln, both times with Quin as Aaron. In the 1720‚Äì1721 season, the play earned ¬£81 with three performances.Hughes (2006: 26) Quin became synonymous with the role of Aaron, and in 1724 he chose the adaptation as the play to be performed at his benefit.Halliday (1964: 399, 403, 497) Ravenscroft made drastic alterations to the play. He removed all of 2.2 (preparing for the hunt), 3.2 (the fly killing scene), 4.3 (firing the arrows and sending the clown to Saturninus) and 4.4 (the execution of the clown). Much of the violence was toned down; for example both the murder of Chiron and Demetrius and Titus' amputation take place off stage. A significant change in the first scene, and one with major implications for the rest of the play, is that prior to the sacrifice of Alarbus, it is revealed that several years previously, Tamora had one of Titus' sons in captivity and refused to show him clemency despite Titus' pleas. Aaron has a much larger role in Ravenscroft than in Shakespeare, especially in Act 1, where lines originally assigned to Demetrius and Tamora are given to him. Tamora doesn't give birth during the action, but earlier, with the baby secretly kept by a nurse. To maintain the secret, Aaron kills the nurse, and it is the nurse's husband, not Lucius, who captures Aaron as he leaves Rome with the child. Additionally, Lucius' army is not composed of Goths, but of Roman centurions loyal to the Andronici. The last act is also considerably longer; Tamora and Saturninus both have lengthy speeches after their fatal stabbings. Tamora asks for her child to be brought to her, but she stabs it immediately upon receiving it. Aaron laments that Tamora has now outdone him in evil; \\"She has out-done me in my own Art ‚Äì/Out-done me in Murder ‚Äì Kille'd her own Child./Give it me ‚Äì I‚Äôle eat it.\\" He is burned alive as the climax of the play.Detailed overviews of the various changes made by Ravenscroft can be found in Dover Wilson (1948: lxvii‚Äìlxviii), Dessen (1989: 7‚Äì11), Bate (1995: 48‚Äì54) and Hughes (2006: 21‚Äì24) In January and February 1839 an adaptation written and directed by and also starring Nathaniel Bannister was performed for four nights at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. The playbill had a note reading \\"The manager, in announcing this play, adapted by N.H. Bannister from the language of Shakespeare alone, assures the public that every expression calculated to offend the ear, has been studiously avoided, and the play is presented for their decision with full confidence that it will merit approbation.\\" In his History of the Philadelphia Stage, Volume IV (1878), Charles Durang wrote, \\"Bannister ably preserved the beauties of its poetry, the intensity of its incidents, and excluded the horrors with infinite skill, yet preserved all the interest of the drama.\\" Nothing else is known about this production.See Waith (1984: 87), Dessen (1989: 11) and Barnet (2005: 154) African‚ÄìAmerican actor Ira Aldridge as Aaron, The most successful adaptation of the play in Britain premiered in 1850, written by Ira Aldridge and C.A. Somerset. Aaron was rewritten to make him the hero of the piece (played by Aldridge), the rape and mutilation of Lavinia were removed, Tamora (Queen of Scythia) became chaste and honourable, with Aaron as her friend only, and Chiron and Demetrius act only out of love for their mother. Only Saturninus is a truly evil character. Towards the end of the play, Saturninus has Aaron chained to a tree, and his baby flung into the Tiber. Aaron frees himself however and leaps into the river after the child. At the end, Saturninus poisons Aaron, but as Aaron dies, Lavinia promises to look after his child for him, due to his saving her from rape earlier in the piece. An entire scene from Zaraffa, the Slave King, a play written specifically for Aldridge in Dublin in 1847 was included in this adaptation.Dessen (1989: 11‚Äì12) and Hughes (2006: 29) After the initial performances, Aldridge kept the play in the repertoire, and it was extremely successful at the box office and continued to be staged in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least 1857, when it received a glowing review from The Sunday Times on 26 April. It was generally agreed amongst reviewers of the period that the Aldridge/Somerset rewrite was considerably superior to Shakespeare's original.Waith (1984: 49) For example, The Era reviewer wrote, > The deflowerment of Lavinia, cutting out her tongue, chopping off her hands, > and the numerous decapitations which occur in the original, are wholly > omitted, and a play not only presentable but actually attractive is the > result. Aaron is elevated into a noble and lofty character; Tamora, the > queen of Scythia, is a chaste though decidedly strong-minded female, and her > connection with the Moor appears to be of legitimate description; her sons > Chiron and Demetrius are dutiful children, obeying the behests of their > mother. Thus altered, Mr. Aldridge's conception of the part of Aaron is > excellent ‚Äì gentle and impassioned by turns; now burning with jealousy as he > doubts the honour of the Queen; anon, fierce with rage, as he reflects upon > the wrongs which have been done him ‚Äì the murder of Alarbus and the > abduction of his son; and then all tenderness and emotion in the gentler > passages with his infant.From The Era, 26 April 1857; quoted in Barnet > (2005: 155) The next adaptation was in 1951, when Kenneth Tynan and Peter Myers staged a thirty-five-minute version entitled Andronicus as part of a Grand Guignol presentation at the Irving Theatre. Produced in the tradition of Theatre of Cruelty, the production edited together all of the violent scenes, emphasised the gore, and removed Aaron entirely. In a review in the Sunday Times on 11 November, Harold Hobson wrote the stage was full of \\"practically the whole company waving gory stumps and eating cannibal pies.\\"Barnet (2005: 155) In 1957 the Old Vic staged a heavily edited ninety-minute performance as part of a double bill with an edited version of The Comedy of Errors. Directed by Walter Hudd, both plays were performed by the same company of actors, with Derek Godfrey as Titus, Barbara Jefford as Tamora, Margaret Whiting as Lavinia and Robert Helpmann as Saturninus. Performed in the manner of a traditional Elizabethan production, the play received mixed reviews. The Times, for example, felt that the juxtaposition of the blood tragedy and the frothy comedy was \\"ill-conceived\\".Barnet (2005: 157) In 1970, Swiss dramatist Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt adapted the play into a German language comedy entitled Titus Andronicus: Kom√∂die nach Shakespeare (Titus Andronicus: A Comedy After Shakespeare). Of the adaptation he wrote \\"it represents an attempt to render Shakespeare's early chaotic work fit for the German stage without having the Shakespearean atrocities and grotesqueries passed over in silence.\\" Working from a translation of the First Folio text by Wolf Graf von Baudissin, D√ºrrenmatt altered much of the dialogue and changed elements of the plot; the fly killing scene (3.2) and the interrogation of Aaron (5.1) were removed; Titus has Aaron cut off his hand, and after he realises he has been tricked, Marcus brings Lavinia to him rather than the other way around as in the original play. Another major change is that after Aaron is presented with his love child, he flees Rome immediately, and successfully, and is never heard from again. D√ºrrenmatt also added a new scene, where Lucius arrives at the Goth camp and persuades their leader, Alarich, to help him. At the end of the play, after Lucius has stabbed Saturninus, but before he has given his final speech, Alarich betrays him, kills him, and orders his army to destroy Rome and kill everyone in it.All information taken from Lukas Erne, \\"Lamentable tragedy or black comedy?: Frederick D√ºrrenmatt's adaptation of Titus Andronicus, in Sonia Massai (editor), World Wide Shakespeare: Local Appropriations in Film and Performance (New York: Routledge, 2005), 88‚Äì94 In 1981, John Barton followed the 1957 Old Vic model and directed a heavily edited version of the play as a double bill with The Two Gentlemen of Verona for the RSC, starring Patrick Stewart as Titus, Sheila Hancock as Tamora, Hugh Quarshie as Aaron and Leonie Mellinger as Lavinia. Theatricality and falseness were emphasised, and when actors were off stage, they could be seen at the sides of the stage watching the performance. The production received lukewarm reviews, and had an average box office.Waith (1984: 54) In 1984, German playwright Heiner M√ºller adapted the play into Anatomie Titus: Fall of Rome. Ein Shakespearekommentar (Anatomy Titus: Fall of Rome. A Shakespearean Commentary). Interspersing the dialogue with a chorus like commentary, the adaptation was heavily political and made reference to numerous twentieth century events, such as the rise of the Third Reich, Stalinism, the erection of the Berlin Wall and the attendant emigration and defection issues, and the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. M√ºller removed the entire first act, replacing it was a narrated introduction, and completely rewrote the final act. He described the work as \\"terrorist in nature\\", and foregrounded the violence; for example Lavinia is brutally raped on stage and Aaron takes several hacks at Titus' hand before amputating it. First performed at the Schauspielhaus Bochum, it was directed by Manfred Karge and Matthias Langhoff, and is still regularly revived in Germany.Steve Earnst, \\"Anatomie Titus Fall of Rome at the Deutsches Theater\\", Western European Stages, (Winter, 2008) In 1989, Jeanette Lambermont directed a heavily edited kabuki version of the play at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, in a double bill with The Comedy of Errors, starring Nicholas Pennell as Titus, Goldie Semple as Tamora, Hubert Baron Kelly as Aaron and Lucy Peacock as Lavinia. In 2005, German playwright Botho Strau√ü adapted the play into Sch√§ndung: nach dem Titus Andronicus von Shakespeare (Rape: After Titus Andronicus by Shakespeare), also commonly known by its French name, Viol, d'apr√®s Titus Andronicus de William Shakespeare. Set in both a contemporary and an ancient world predating the Roman Empire, the adaptation begins with a group of salesmen trying to sell real estate; gated communities which they proclaim as \\"Terra Secura\\", where women and children are secure from \\"theft, rape and kidnapping.\\" Mythology is important in the adaptation; Venus is represented as governing nature, but is losing her power to the melancholic and uninterested Saturn, leading to a society rampant with Bedeutungslosigkeit (loss of meaning, insignificance). Written in prose rather than blank verse, changes to the text include the rape of Lavinia being Tamora's idea instead of Aaron's; the removal of Marcus; Titus does not kill his son; he does not have his hand amputated; Chiron is much more subservient to Demetrius; Aaron is more philosophical, trying to find meaning in his acts of evil rather than simply revelling in them; Titus does not die at the end, nor does Tamora, although the play ends with Titus ordering the deaths of Tamora and Aaron.Mechele Leon, Review, Theatre Journal, 58:2 (May 2006), 313‚Äì314Sylvie Ballestra-Puech, \\"Violence and Melancholy in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, Botho Strauss' Rape and Sarah Kane's Blasted, Loxias, 31 (December 2010) In 2008, M√ºller's Anatomie Titus was translated into English by Julian Hammond and performed at the Cremorne Theatre in Brisbane, the Canberra Theatre, the Playhouse in the Sydney Opera House and the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne by the Bell Shakespeare Company and the Queensland Theatre Company. Directed by Michael Gow and with an all-male cast, it starred John Bell as Titus, Peter Cook as Tamora, Timothy Walter as Aaron and Thomas Campbell as Lavinia. Racism was a major theme in this production, with Aaron initially wearing a gorilla mask, and then poorly applied blackface, and his baby 'played' by a golliwogg. In 2012, as part of the Globe to Globe Festival at Shakespeare's Globe, the play was performed under the title Titus 2.0. Directed by Tang Shu-wing, it starred Andy Ng Wai-shek as Titus, Ivy Pang Ngan-ling as Tamora, Chu Pak-hong as Aaron and Lai Yuk-ching as Lavinia. Performed entirely in Cantonese, from an original script by Cancer Chong, the play had originally been staged in Hong Kong in 2009. The production took a minimalist approach and featured very little blood (after Lavinia has her hands cut off, for example, she simply wears red gloves for the rest of the play). The production features a narrator throughout, who speaks both in first person and third person, sometimes directly to the audience, sometimes to other characters on the stage. The role of the narrator alternates throughout the play, but is always performed by a member of the main cast. The production received excellent reviews, both in its original Hong Kong incarnation, and when restaged at the Globe.Yong Li Lan, \\"Tang Shu-wing's titus and the acting of violence\\", in Susan Bennett and Christie Carson (editors), Shakespeare Beyond English: A Global Experiment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 115‚Äì120 In 2014, Noelle Fair and Lisa LaGrande adapted the play into Interpreting her Martyr'd Signs, the title of which is taken from Titus' claim to be able to understand the mute Lavinia. Focusing on the backstories of Tamora and Lavinia, the play is set in Purgatory shortly after their deaths, where they find themselves in a waiting area with Aaron as their salvation or damnation is decided upon. As they try to come to terms with their unresolved conflict, Aaron serves as a master of ceremonies, initiating a dialogue between them, leading to a series of flashbacks to their lives prior to the beginning of the play. Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, an absurdist comic play by Taylor Mac and directed by George C. Wolfe, began previews at the Booth Theatre on Broadway on 11 March 2019 with an opening of 21 April 2019. The cast included Nathan Lane, Kristine Nielsen, and Julie White and involved servants tasked with cleaning up the carnage from the original play. Musicals Titus Andronicus: The Musical!, written by Brian Colonna, Erik Edborg, Hannah Duggan, Erin Rollman, Evan Weissman, Matt Petraglia, and Samantha Schmitz, was staged by the Buntport Theater Company in Denver, Colorado four times between 2002 and 2007. Staged as a band of travelling thespian players who are attempting to put on a serious production of Titus, and starring Brian Colonna as Titus, Erin Rollman as Tamora (and Marcus), Hannah Duggan as both Aaron and Lavinia (when playing Aaron she wore a fake moustache), Erik Edborg as Lucius and Saturninus, and Evan Weissman as Someone Who Will Probably Die (he is killed over thirty times during the play). The piece was very much a farce, and included such moments as Lavinia singing an aria to the tune of \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" by Britney Spears, after her tongue has been cut out; Saturninus and Lucius engaged in a sword fight, but both being played by the same actor; Chiron and Demetrius 'played' by a gas can and a car radio respectively; the love child being born with a black moustache. A number of critics felt that the play improved on Shakespeare's original, and several wondered what Harold Bloom would have made of it.Hughes (2006: 47n2) Tragedy! A Musical Comedy, written by Michael Johnson and Mary Davenport was performed at the 2007 New York International Fringe Festival in the Lucille Lortel Theatre. Directed by Johnson, the piece starred Francis Van Wetering as Titus, Alexandra Cirves as Tamora, Roger Casey as Aaron (aka The Evil Black Guy) and Lauren Huyett as Lavinia. Staged as a farce, the production included moments such as Lavinia singing a song entitled \\"At least I can still sing\\" after having her hands cut off, but as she reaches the finale, Chiron and Demetrius return and cut out her tongue; Lucius is portrayed as a homosexual in love with Saturninus, and everyone knows except Titus; Titus kills Mutius not because he defies him, but because he discovers that Mutius wants to be a tap dancer instead of a soldier; Bassianus is a transvestite; Saturninus is addicted to prescription medication; and Tamora is a nymphomaniac. Film In 1969, Robert Hartford-Davis planned to make a feature film starring Christopher Lee as Titus and Lesley-Anne Down as Lavinia, but the project never materialised. The 1973 horror comedy film Theatre of Blood, directed by Douglas Hickox featured a very loose adaptation of the play. Vincent Price stars in the film as Edward Lionheart, who regards himself as the finest Shakespearean actor of all time. When he fails to be awarded the prestigious Critic's Circle Award for Best Actor, he sets about exacting bloody revenge on the critics who gave him poor reviews, with each act inspired by a death in a Shakespeare play. One such act of revenge involves the critic Meredith Merridew (played by Robert Morley). Lionheart abducts Merridew's prized poodles, and bakes them in a pie, which he then feeds to Merridew, before revealing all and force-feeding the critic until he chokes to death.Jos√© Ram√≥n D√≠az Fern√°ndez, \\"The Roman Plays on Screen: An Annotated Filmo-Bibliography\\", in Sarah Hatchuel and Nathalie Vienne-Guerrin (eds.), Shakespeare on Screen: The Roman Plays (Rouen: Universit√© de Rouen, 2008), 340 A 1997 straight-to-video adaptation, which cuts back on the violence, titled Titus Andronicus: The Movie, was directed by Lorn Richey and starred Ross Dippel as Titus, Aldrich Allen as Aaron) and Maureen Moran as Lavinia.Mariangela Tempera, \\"Titus Andronicus: Staging the Mutilated Roman Body\\", in Maria Del Sapio Garbero, Nancy Isenberg and Maddalena Pennacchia (eds.), Questioning Bodies in Shakespeare's Rome (G√∂ttingen: Hubert & Co., 2010), 115 Another straight-to-video- adaptation was made in 1998, directed by Christopher Dunne, and starring Robert Reese as Titus, Candy K. Sweet as Tamora, Lexton Raleigh as Aaron, Tom Dennis as Demitrius, with Levi David Tinker as Chiron and Amanda Gezik as Lavinia. This version enhanced the violence and increased the gore. For example, in the opening scene, Alarbus has his face skinned alive, and is then disembowelled and set on fire.Pascale Aebischer, Shakespeare's Violated Bodies: Stage and Screen Performance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 24‚Äì31 In 1999, Julie Taymor directed an adaptation entitled Titus, starring Anthony Hopkins as Titus, Jessica Lange as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron (reprising his role from Taymor's 1994 theatrical production) and Laura Fraser as Lavinia. As with Taymor's stage production, the film begins with a young boy playing with toy soldiers and being whisked away to Ancient Rome, where he assumes the character of young Lucius. A major component of the film is the mixing of the old and modern; Chiron and Demetrius dress like modern rock stars, but the Andronici dress like Roman soldiers; some characters use chariots, some use cars and motorcycles; crossbows and swords are used alongside rifles and pistols; tanks are seen driven by soldiers in ancient Roman garb; bottled beer is seen alongside ancient amphorae of wine; microphones are used to address characters in ancient clothing. According to Taymor, this anachronistic structure was created to emphasise the timelessness of the violence in the film, to suggest that violence is universal to all humanity, at all times: \\"Costume, paraphernalia, horses or chariots or cars; these represent the essence of a character, as opposed to placing it in a specific time. This is a film that takes place from the year 1 to the year 2000.\\" At the end of the film, young Lucius takes the baby and walks out of Rome; an image of hope for the future, symbolised by the rising sun in the background. Originally, the film was to end as Taymor's 1994 production had, with the implication that Lucius is going to kill Aaron's baby, but during production of the film, actor Angus Macfadyen, who played Lucius, convinced Taymor that Lucius was an honourable man and wouldn't go back on his word.Jonathan Bate, \\"A Shakespeare tale whose time has come\\", The New York Times, 2 January 2000 Lisa S. Starks reads the film as a revisionist horror movie and feels that Taymor is herself part of the process of twentieth century re-evaluation of the play: \\"In adapting a play that has traditionally evoked critical condemnation, Taymor calls into question that judgement, thereby opening up the possibility for new readings and considerations of the play within the Shakespeare canon.\\"Starks (2002: 122) William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, directed by Richard Griffin and starring Nigel Gore as Titus, Zoya Pierson as Tamora, Kevin Butler as Aaron and Molly Lloyd as Lavinia, was released direct to video in 2000. Shot on DV in and around Providence, Rhode Island with a budget of $12,000, the film is set in a modern business milieu. Saturninus is a corporate head who has inherited a company from his father, and the Goths feature as contemporary Goths.Courtney Lehmann, \\"Film Adaptations: What is a Film Adaptation? or, Shakespeare du jour\\", in Richard Burt (ed.), Shakespeares After Shakespeare: An Encyclopaedia of the Bard in Mass Media and Popular Culture, Volume One (Westport: Greenwood Press, 2006), 130 In 2017, Titus Andronicus was adapted as The Hungry by director Bornilla Chatterjee set in contemporary New Delhi, India. It stars Naseeruddin Shah as Tathagat Ahuja (representing Titus), Tisca Chopra as Tulsi Joshi (representing Tamora), Neeraj Kabi as Arun Kumar (Aaron) and Sayani Gupta as Loveleen Ahuja (Lavinia) Television In 1970, Finnish TV channel Yle TV1 screened an adaptation of the play written and directed by Jukka Sipil√§, starring Leo Lastum√§ki as Titus, Iris-Lilja Lassila as Tamora, Eugene Holman as Aaron and Maija Leino as Lavinia.Jos√© Ram√≥n D√≠az Fern√°ndez, \\"The Roman Plays on Screen: An Annotated Filmo-Bibliography\\", in Sarah Hatchuel and Nathalie Vienne-Guerrin (eds.) Shakespeare on Screen: The Roman Plays (Rouen: Universit√© de Rouen, 2008), 338 In 1985, the BBC produced a version of the play for their BBC Television Shakespeare series. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was the thirty-seventh and final episode of the series and starred Trevor Peacock as Titus, Eileen Atkins as Tamora, Hugh Quarshie as Aaron and Anna Calder-Marshall as Lavinia. Because Titus was broadcast several months after the rest of the seventh season, it was rumoured that the BBC were worried about the violence in the play and that disagreements had arisen about censorship. This was inaccurate however, with the delay caused by a BBC strike in 1984. The episode had been booked into the studio in February and March 1984, but the strike meant it couldn't shoot. When the strike ended, the studio couldn't be used as it was being used by another production, and then when the studio became available, the RSC was using Trevor Peacock, and filming didn't take place until February 1985, a year later than planned.Susan Willis, The BBC Shakespeare: Making the Televised Canon (North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), 30 Initially, director Jane Howell wanted to set the play in present-day Northern Ireland, but she ultimately settled on a more conventional approach. All the body parts seen throughout were based upon real autopsy photographs, and were authenticated by the Royal College of Surgeons. The costumes of the Goths were based on punk outfits, with Chiron and Demetrius specifically based on the band KISS. For the scene when Chiron and Demetrius are killed, a large carcass is seen hanging nearby; this was a genuine lamb carcass purchased from a kosher butcher and smeared with Vaseline to make it gleam under the studio lighting.For much factual information on this production, see Mary Z. Maher, \\"Production Design in the BBC's Titus Andronicus\\" in J.C. Bulman and H.R. Coursen (eds.), Shakespeare on Television: An Anthology of Essays and Reviews (New Hampshire: University Press of New England, 1988), 144‚Äì150 In an unusual design choice, Howell had the Roman populace all wear identical generic masks without mouths, so as to convey the idea that the Roman people were faceless and voiceless, as she felt the play depicted a society which \\"seemed like a society where everyone was faceless except for those in power.\\"Quoted in Barnet (2005: 159) The production was one of the most lauded plays of the series and garnered almost universally positive reviews.For more information on this production, see Dessen (1989: 44‚Äì48). For a detailed overview of the production process itself, see Susan Willis, The BBC Shakespeare: Making the Televised Canon (North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), 292‚Äì314 Young Lucius stares at the body of Aaron's baby in Jane Howell's adaptation for the BBC Television Shakespeare; in the background, his father is being inaugurated as the new emperor For the most part, the adaptation followed Q1 exactly (and F1 for 3.2) with some minor alterations. For example, a few lines were cut from various scenes, such as Lavinia's \\"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long\\" (2.3.87), thus removing the continuity error regarding the duration of the Goths residence in Rome. Other examples include Titus' \\"Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,/To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er,/How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?\\" (3.2.26‚Äì28), Marcus' \\"What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora/Performers of this heinous, bloody deed\\" (4.1.78‚Äì79), and Titus and Marcus' brief conversation about Taurus and Aries (4.3.68‚Äì75). The adaptation also includes some lines from Q1 which were removed in subsequent editions; at 1.1.35 Titus' \\"bearing his valiant sons/in coffins from the field\\" continues with \\"and at this day,/To the Monument of that Andronicy/Done sacrifice of expiation,/And slaine the Noblest prisoner of the Gothes.\\" These lines are usually omitted because they create a continuity problem regarding the sacrifice of Alarbus, which hasn't happened yet in the text. However, Howell got around this problem by beginning the play at 1.1.64 ‚Äì the entrance of Titus. Then, at 1.1.168, after the sacrifice of Alarbus, lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.63 (the introductions of Bassianus and Saturninus) take place, thus Titus' reference to Alarbus' sacrifice makes chronological sense. Another notable stylistic technique used in the adaptation is multiple addresses direct to camera. For example, Saturninus' \\"How well the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts\\" (1.1.46); Tamora's vow to slaughter the Andronici at 1.1.450‚Äì455 (thus absolving Saturninus from any involvement); Aaron's soliloquy in 2.1; Aaron's \\"Ay, and as good as Saturninus may\\" (2.1.91); Aaron's soliloquy in 2.3; Tamora's \\"Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,/And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower\\" (2.3.190‚Äì191); Aaron's two asides in 3.1 (ll.187‚Äì190 and 201‚Äì202); Lucius' \\"Now will I to the Goths and raise a power,/To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine\\" (3.1.298‚Äì299); Marcus' \\"O, heavens, can you hear a good man groan\\" speech (4.1.122‚Äì129); Young Lucius' asides in 4.2 (ll.6 and 8‚Äì9); Aaron's \\"Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,/There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,/And secretly to greet the Empress' friends\\" (4.2.172‚Äì174); and Tamora's \\"Now will I to that old Andronicus,/And temper him with all the art I have,/To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths\\" (4.4.107‚Äì109). The most significant difference from the original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who is a much more important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question \\"What are we doing to the children?\\"Quoted in Dessen (1989: 44) At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became \\"in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy.\\"Mary Maher, \\"Production Design in the BBC's Titus Andronicus\\" in J.C. Bulman and H.R. Coursen (eds.), Shakespeare on Television: An Anthology of Essays and Reviews (Hanover: University Press of New England, 1988), 146 In 2001, the animated sitcom South Park based an episode on the play. In \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\", Eric Cartman is swindled by Scott Tenorman. Cartman tries various methods to get his money back, but Scott remains always one step ahead. He then decides to exact revenge on Scott. After numerous failed attempts, he hatches a plan which culminates in him having Scott's parents killed, the bodies of whom he then cooks in chili, which he feeds to Scott. He then gleefully reveals his deception as Scott finds his mother's finger in the chilli.Anne Gossage, \\"Yon Fart Doth Smell of Elderberries Sweet\\": South Park and Shakespeare\\", in Leslie Stratyner and James R. Keller (eds.), The Deep End of South Park: Critical Essays on TV's Shocking Cartoon Series (North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2009), 50-52 The Netflix TV series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt features a character originally named Ronald Wilkerson that changed his name to Titus Andromedon, possibly derived from this play. Radio The play has very rarely been staged for radio.All information in this section comes from the British Universities Film and Video Council In 1923, extracts were broadcast on BBC radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the second episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare's plays, entitled Shakespeare Night. In 1953, BBC Third Programme aired a 130-minute version of the play, adapted for radio by J.C. Trewin and starring Baliol Halloway as Titus, Sonia Dresdal as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Janette Tregarthen as Lavinia. In 1973, BBC Radio 3 aired an adaptation directed by Martin Jenkins, starring Michael Aldridge as Titus, Barbara Jefford as Tamora, Julian Glover as Aaron and Frances Jeater as Lavinia. In 1986, Austrian radio channel √ñsterreich 1 staged an adaptation by Kurt Klinger, starring Romuald Pekny as Titus, Marion Degler as Tamora, Wolfgang B√∂ck as Aaron and Elisabeth Augustin as Lavinia.

He is seen as dominating the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. Romanticist writer Sir Walter Scott called him \\"Glorious John\\".Scott, W. Waverley, vol. 12, ch. 14, The Pirate: \\"I am desirous to hear of your meeting with Dryden\\". \\"What, with Glorious John?\\" Early life Dryden was born in the village rectory of Aldwincle near Thrapston in Northamptonshire, where his maternal grandfather was rector of All Saints. He was the eldest of fourteen children born to Erasmus Dryden and wife Mary Pickering, paternal grandson of Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet (1553‚Äì1632), and wife Frances Wilkes, Puritan landowning gentry who supported the Puritan cause and Parliament. He was a second cousin once removed of Jonathan Swift. As a boy, Dryden lived in the nearby village of Titchmarsh, where it is likely that he received his first education. In 1644 he was sent to Westminster School as a King's Scholar where his headmaster was Dr. Richard Busby, a charismatic teacher and severe disciplinarian.Hopkins, David, John Dryden, ed. by Isobel Armstrong, (Tavistock: Northcote House Publishers, 2004), 22 Having been re-founded by Elizabeth I, Westminster during this period embraced a very different religious and political spirit encouraging royalism and high Anglicanism. Whatever Dryden's response to this was, he clearly respected the headmaster and would later send two of his sons to school at Westminster. As a humanist public school, Westminster maintained a curriculum which trained pupils in the art of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue. This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking, as much of it displays these dialectical patterns. The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Dryden's capacity for assimilation. This was also to be exhibited in his later works. His years at Westminster were not uneventful, and his first published poem, an elegy with a strong royalist feel on the death of his schoolmate Henry, Lord Hastings from smallpox, alludes to the execution of King Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649, very near the school where Dr. Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle. In 1650 Dryden went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he would have experienced a return to the religious and political ethos of his childhood: the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of Thomas Hill who had been a rector in Dryden's home village.John Dryden The Major Works, ed. by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), ix‚Äìx Though there is little specific information on Dryden's undergraduate years, he would most certainly have followed the standard curriculum of classics, rhetoric, and mathematics. In 1654 he obtained his BA, graduating top of the list for Trinity that year. In June of the same year Dryden's father died, leaving him some land which generated a little income, but not enough to live on.John Dryden The Major Works, ed. by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), x Returning to London during the Protectorate, Dryden obtained work with Oliver Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe. This appointment may have been the result of influence exercised on his behalf by his cousin the Lord Chamberlain, Sir Gilbert Pickering. At Cromwell's funeral on 23 November 1658 Dryden processed with the Puritan poets John Milton and Andrew Marvell. Shortly thereafter he published his first important poem, Heroic Stanzas (1659), a eulogy on Cromwell's death which is cautious and prudent in its emotional display. In 1660 Dryden celebrated the Restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II with Astraea Redux, an authentic royalist panegyric. In this work the interregnum is illustrated as a time of chaos, and Charles is seen as the restorer of peace and order. Later life and career After the Restoration, as Dryden quickly established himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day, he transferred his allegiances to the new government. Along with Astraea Redux, Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics: To His Sacred Majesty: A Panegyric on his Coronation (1662) and To My Lord Chancellor (1662). These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron, but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers, not for the aristocracy, and thus ultimately for the reading public. These, and his other nondramatic poems, are occasional‚Äîthat is, they celebrate public events. Thus they are written for the nation rather than the self, and the Poet Laureate (as he would later become) is obliged to write a certain number of these per annum.Abrams, M.H., and Stephen Greenblatt eds. 'John Dryden' in The Norton Anthology of English Literature, 7th ed., (New York: Norton & Co, 2000), 2071 In November 1662 Dryden was proposed for membership in the Royal Society, and he was elected an early fellow. However, Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues. Dryden, by John Michael Wright, 1668 Dryden, by James Maubert, c. 1695 On 1 December 1663 Dryden married the royalist sister of Sir Robert Howard‚ÄîLady Elizabeth. Dryden's works occasionally contain outbursts against the married state but also celebrations of the same. Thus, little is known of the intimate side of his marriage. Lady Elizabeth bore three sons and outlived her husband. With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 after the Puritan ban, Dryden began writing plays. His first play The Wild Gallant appeared in 1663, and was not successful, but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays a year for the King's Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s, theatrical writing was his main source of income. He led the way in Restoration comedy, his best-known work being Marriage √† la Mode (1673), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success was All for Love (1678). Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published Annus Mirabilis, a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate (1668) and historiographer royal (1670). When the Great Plague of London closed the theatres in 1665, Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie (1668), arguably the best of his unsystematic prefaces and essays. Dryden constantly defended his own literary practice, and Of Dramatick Poesie, the longest of his critical works, takes the form of a dialogue in which four characters‚Äîeach based on a prominent contemporary, with Dryden himself as 'Neander'‚Äîdebate the merits of classical, French and English drama. The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss, and show the work of a writer of independent mind who feels strongly about his own ideas, ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading. He felt strongly about the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process, and his best heroic play Aureng-zebe (1675) has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama. His play All for Love (1678) was written in blank verse, and was to immediately follow Aureng-Zebe. At around 8pm on 18 December 1679, Dryden was attacked in Rose Alley behind the Lamb & Flag pub, near his home in Covent Garden, by thugs hired by the Earl of Rochester,John Richardson, with whom he had a long-standing conflict. The pub was notorious for staging bare-knuckle prize fights, earning the nickname \\"The Bucket of Blood.\\" Dryden's poem, \\"An Essay upon Satire,\\" contained a number of attacks on King Charles II, his mistresses and courtiers, but most pointedly on the Earl of Rochester, a notorious womaniser. Rochester responded by hiring thugs who attacked Dryden whilst walking back from Will's Coffee House (a popular London coffee house where the Wits gathered to gossip, drink and conduct their business) back to his house on Gerrard Street. Dryden survived the attack, offering ¬£50 for the identity of the thugs placed in the London Gazette, and a Royal Pardon if one of them would confess. No one claimed the reward. Dryden's greatest achievements were in satiric verse: the mock-heroic Mac Flecknoe, a more personal product of his laureate years, was a lampoon circulated in manuscript and an attack on the playwright Thomas Shadwell. Dryden's main goal in the work is to \\"satirize Shadwell, ostensibly for his offenses against literature but more immediately we may suppose for his habitual badgering of him on the stage and in print.\\"Oden, Richard, L. Dryden and Shadwell, The Literary Controversy and 'Mac Flecknoe' (1668‚Äì1679) It is not a belittling form of satire, but rather one which makes his object great in ways which are unexpected, transferring the ridiculous into poetry.Eliot, T.S., 'John Dryden', in Selected Essays, (London: Faber and Faber, 1932), 308 This line of satire continued with Absalom and Achitophel (1681) and The Medal (1682). His other major works from this period are the religious poems Religio Laici (1682), written from the position of a member of the Church of England; his 1683 edition of Plutarch's Lives Translated From the Greek by Several Hands in which he introduced the word biography to English readers; and The Hind and the Panther, (1687) which celebrates his conversion to Roman Catholicism.

When later in the same year James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, Dryden's refusal to take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs, William and Mary, left him out of favour at court. Thomas Shadwell succeeded him as Poet Laureate, and he was forced to give up his public offices and live by the proceeds of his pen. Dryden translated works by Horace, Juvenal, Ovid, Lucretius, and Theocritus, a task which he found far more satisfying than writing for the stage. In 1694 he began work on what would be his most ambitious and defining work as translator, The Works of Virgil (1697), which was published by subscription. The publication of the translation of Virgil was a national event and brought Dryden the sum of ¬£1,400.John Dryden The Major Works, ed. by Keith Walker, xiv His final translations appeared in the volume Fables Ancient and Modern (1700), a series of episodes from Homer, Ovid, and Boccaccio, as well as modernised adaptations from Geoffrey Chaucer interspersed with Dryden's own poems. As a translator, he made great literary works in the older languages available to readers of English. Dryden died on 12 May 1700, and was initially buried in St. Anne's cemetery in Soho, before being exhumed and reburied in Westminster Abbey ten days later.Winn, James Anderson. John Dryden and His World. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987. p. 512 He was the subject of poetic eulogies, such as Luctus Brittannici: or the Tears of the British Muses; for the Death of John Dryden, Esq. (London, 1700), and The Nine Muses. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque commemorates Dryden at 43 Gerrard Street in London's Chinatown. He lived at 137 Long Acre from 1682 to 1686 and at 43 Gerrard Street from 1686 until his death. In his will, he left The George Inn at Northampton to trustees, to form a school for the children of the poor of the town. This became John Dryden's School, later The Orange School. Reputation and influence Dryden near end of his life Dryden was the dominant literary figure and influence of his age. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet‚ÄîAuden referred to him as \\"the master of the middle style\\"‚Äîthat was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century. The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident in the elegies written about him.John Dryden The Major Works, 37 Dryden's heroic couplet became the dominant poetic form of the 18th century. Alexander Pope was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him; other writers were equally influenced by Dryden and Pope. Pope famously praised Dryden's versification in his imitation of Horace's Epistle II.i: \\"Dryden taught to join / The varying pause, the full resounding line, / The long majestic march, and energy divine.\\" Samuel Johnson summed up the general attitude with his remark that \\"the veneration with which his name is pronounced by every cultivator of English literature, is paid to him as he refined the language, improved the sentiments, and tuned the numbers of English poetry.\\" His poems were very widely read, and are often quoted, for instance, in Henry Fielding's Tom Jones and Johnson's essays. Johnson also noted, however, that \\"He is, therefore, with all his variety of excellence, not often pathetic; and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural, that he did not esteem them in others. Simplicity gave him no pleasure.\\" Readers in the first half of the 18th century did not mind this too much, but later generations considered Dryden's absence of sensibility a fault. One of the first attacks on Dryden's reputation was by William Wordsworth, who complained that Dryden's descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden's works), were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous \\"Intimations of Immortality\\" ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's \\"Alexander's Feast.\\" John Keats admired the \\"Fables,\\" and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th-century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as \\"classics of our prose.\\" He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was T. S. Eliot, who wrote that he was \\"the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century,\\" and that \\"we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden.\\"Eliot, T.S., John Dryden, 305‚Äì06 However, in the same essay, Eliot accused Dryden of having a \\"commonplace mind.\\" Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently, but, as a relatively straightforward writer (William Empson, another modern admirer of Dryden, compared his \\"flat\\" use of language with Donne's interest in the \\"echoes and recesses of words\\"), his work has not occasioned as much interest as Andrew Marvell's, John Donne's or Pope's.Robert M. Adams, \\"The Case for Dryden\\", New York Review of Books 17 March 1988 Dryden Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in prepositions because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.Gilman, E. Ward (ed.). 1989. \\"A Brief History of English Usage\\", Webster's Dictionary of English Usage. Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, pp. 7a‚Äì11a, Dryden created the proscription against preposition stranding in 1672 when he objected to Ben Jonson's 1611 phrase, \\"the bodies that those souls were frighted from,\\" though he did not provide the rationale for his preference.Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 627ff. Dryden often translated his writing into Latin, to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then Dryden translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers. The phrase \\"blaze of glory\\" is believed to have originated in Dryden's 1686 poem The Hind and the Panther, referring to the throne of God as a \\"blaze of glory that forbids the sight.\\" Poetic style What Dryden achieved in his poetry was neither the emotional excitement of the early nineteenth-century romantics nor the intellectual complexities of the metaphysicals. His subject matter was often factual, and he aimed at expressing his thoughts in the most precise and concentrated manner. Although he uses formal structures such as heroic couplets, he tried to recreate the natural rhythm of speech, and he knew that different subjects need different kinds of verse. In his preface to Religio Laici he says that \\"the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural, yet majestic... The florid, elevated and figurative way is for the passions; for (these) are begotten in the soul by showing the objects out of their true proportion.... A man is to be cheated into passion, but to be reasoned into truth.\\" Translation style While Dryden had many admirers, he also had his share of critics, Mark Van Doren among them. Van Doren complained that in translating Virgil's Aeneid, Dryden had added \\"a fund of phrases with which he could expand any passage that seemed to him curt.\\" Dryden did not feel such expansion was a fault, arguing that as Latin is a naturally concise language it cannot be duly represented by a comparable number of words in English. \\"He...recognized that Virgil 'had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space' (5:329‚Äì30). The 'way to please the best Judges...is not to Translate a Poet literally; and Virgil least of any other' (5:329).\\" For example, take lines 789‚Äì795 of Book 2 when Aeneas sees and receives a message from the ghost of his wife, Creusa. > iamque vale et nati serva communis amorem. haec ubi dicta dedit, lacrimantem > et multa volentem dicere deseruit, tenuisque recessit in auras. ter conatus > ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago, > par levibus ventis volucrique simillima somno. sic demum socios consumpta > nocte reviso Dryden translates it like this: > I trust our common issue to your care.' She said, and gliding pass'd unseen > in air. I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; And thrice about her > neck my arms I flung, And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung. Light as > an empty dream at break of day, Or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away. Thus > having pass'd the night in fruitless pain, I to my longing friends return > again Dryden's translation is based on presumed authorial intent and smooth English. In line 790 the literal translation of haec ubi dicta dedit is \\"when she gave these words.\\" But \\"she said\\" gets the point across, uses half the words, and makes for better English. A few lines later, with ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago, he alters the literal translation \\"Thrice trying to give arms around her neck; thrice the image grasped in vain fled the hands,\\" in order to fit it into meter and the emotion of the scene. In his own words, > The way I have taken, is not so streight as Metaphrase, nor so loose as > Paraphrase: Some things too I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own. > Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou'd have > no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc'd from > Virgil's Sense. They will seem (at least I have the Vanity to think so), not > struck into him, but growing out of him. (5:529) In a similar vein, Dryden writes in his Preface to the translation anthology Sylvae: > Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut > them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was > beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; > and where I have enlarg‚Äôd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always > think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly > in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc‚Äôd from him; or at least, if both those > considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if > he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou‚Äôd probably have > written. Personal life On 1 December 1663 Dryden married Lady Elizabeth Howard (died 1714). The marriage was at St. Swithin's, London, and the consent of the parents is noted on the licence, though Lady Elizabeth was then about twenty- five. She was the object of some scandals, well or ill founded; it was said that Dryden had been bullied into the marriage by her brothers. A small estate in Wiltshire was settled upon them by her father. The lady's intellect and temper were apparently not good; her husband was treated as an inferior by those of her social status. Both Dryden and his wife were warmly attached to their children. They had three sons: Charles (1666‚Äì1704), John (1668‚Äì1701), and Erasmus Henry (1669‚Äì1710). Lady Elizabeth Dryden survived her husband, but went insane soon after his death. Though some have historically claimed to be from the lineage of John Dryden, his three children had no children themselves.

Bush to Arnold Schwarzenegger showing the midpoint between the two extremes Morphing animation between two faces. Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shape into another through a seamless transition. Traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through dissolving techniques on film. Since the early 1990s, this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions. A similar method is applied to audio recordings in similar fashion, for example, by changing voices or vocal lines. Early transformation techniques Long before digital morphing, several techniques were used for similar image transformations. Some of those techniques are closer to a matched dissolve - a gradual change between two pictures without warping the shapes in the images - while others did change the shapes in between the start and end phases of the transformation. Tabula scalata Known since at least the end of the 16th century, Tabula scalata is a type of painting with two images divided over a corrugated surface. Each image is only correctly visible from a certain angle. If the pictures are matched properly, a primitive type of morphing effect occurs when changing from one viewing angle to the other. Mechanical transformations Around 1790 French shadow play showman Fran√ßois Dominique S√©raphin used a metal shadow figure with jointed parts to have the face of a young woman changing into that of a witch. Some 19th century mechanical magic lantern slides produced changes to the appearance of figures. For instance a nose could grow to enormous size, simply by slowly sliding away a piece of glass with black paint that masked part of another glass plate with the picture.https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/wipwaps06_uk.htm Matched dissolves In the first half of the 19th century \\"dissolving views\\" were a popular type of magic lantern show, mostly showing landscapes gradually dissolving from a day to night version or from summer to winter. Other uses are known, for instance Henry Langdon Childe showed groves transforming into cathedrals. The 1910 short film Narren-grappen shows a dissolve transformation of the clothing of a female character.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRLaG1TYakY&index;=2&list;=PL7R2kkNY- OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj Maurice Tourneur's 1915 film Alias Jimmy Valentine featured a subtle dissolve transformation of the main character from respected citizen Lee Randall into his criminal alter ego Jimmy Valentine. The Peter Tchaikovsky Story in a 1959 TV-series episode of Disneyland features a swan automaton transforming into a real ballet dancer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZQr0DUf3uM&index;=3&list;=PL7R2kkNY- OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj In 1985, Godley & Creme created a \\"morph\\" effect using analogue cross-fades on parts of different faces in the video for \\"Cry\\". Animation In animation, the morphing effect was created long before the introduction of cinema. A phenakistiscope designed by its inventor Joseph Plateau and/or painter Jean-Baptiste Madou was printed around 1835 and shows the head of a woman changing into a witch and then into a monster.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTP9bYRRrY&index;=1&list;=PL7R2kkNY- OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj √âmile Cohl's 1908 animated film Fantasmagorie featured much morphing of characters and objects drawn in simple outlines.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1d28X0lkJ4 Digital morphing An animated example of an ape morphing into a bird. In the early 1990s computer techniques that often produced more convincing results began to be widely used. These involved distorting one image at the same time that it faded into another through marking corresponding points and vectors on the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" images used in the morph. For example, one would morph one face into another by marking key points on the first face, such as the contour of the nose or location of an eye, and mark where these same points existed on the second face. The computer would then distort the first face to have the shape of the second face at the same time that it faded the two faces. To compute the transformation of image coordinates required for the distortion, the algorithm of Beier and Neely can be used. Early examples In or before 1986 computer graphics company Omnibus created a digital animation for a Tide commercial with a Tide detergent bottle smoothly morphing into the shape of the United States. The effect was programmed by Bob Hoffman. Omnibus re-used the technique in the movie Flight of the Navigator (1986). It featured scenes with a computer generated spaceship that appeared to change shape. The plaster cast of a model of the spaceship was scanned and digitally modified with techniques that included a reflection mapping technique that was also developed by programmer Bob Hoffman.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC0NX4dVmO0&list;=PLgiS6Xj7H6wn8L6K4jfwLh4sYwtEOnpRd&index;=37 The 1986 movie The Golden Child implemented rather crude digital morphing effects from animal to human and back. Willow (1988) featured a more detailed digital morphing sequence with a person changing into different animals. A similar process was used a year later in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to create Walter Donovan's gruesome demise. Both effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic using grid warping techniques developed by Tom Brigham and Doug Smythe (AMPAS).AMPAS - Index of Motion Picture Credits - Films In 1991, morphing appeared notably in the Michael Jackson music video \\"Black or White\\" and in the movies Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. The first application for personal computers to offer morphing was Gryphon Software Morph on the Macintosh. Other early morphing systems included ImageMaster, MorphPlus and CineMorph, all of which premiered for the Commodore Amiga in 1992. Other programs became widely available within a year, and for a time the effect became common to the point of clich√©. For high-end use, Elastic Reality (based on MorphPlus) saw its first feature film use in In The Line of Fire (1993) and was used in Quantum Leap (work performed by the Post Group). At VisionArt Ted Fay used Elastic Reality to morph Odo for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The Snoop Dogg music video \\"Who Am I? (What's My Name?)\\", where Snoop Dogg and the others morph into dogs. Elastic Reality was later purchased by Avid, having already become the de facto system of choice, used in many hundreds of films. The technology behind Elastic Reality earned two Academy Awards in 1996 for Scientific and Technical Achievement going to Garth Dickie and Perry Kivolowitz. The effect is technically called a \\"spatially warped cross-dissolve\\". The first social network designed for user-generated morph examples to be posted online was Galleries by Morpheus (morphing software). In Taiwan, Aderans, a hair loss solutions provider, did a TV commercial featuring a morphing sequence in which people with lush, thick hair morph into one another, reminiscent of the end sequence of the \\"Black or White\\" video. Present use Morphing algorithms continue to advance and programs can automatically morph images that correspond closely enough with relatively little instruction from the user. This has led to the use of morphing techniques to create convincing slow- motion effects where none existed in the original film or video footage by morphing between each individual frame using optical flow technology. Morphing has also appeared as a transition technique between one scene and another in television shows, even if the contents of the two images are entirely unrelated. The algorithm in this case attempts to find corresponding points between the images and distort one into the other as they crossfade. While perhaps less obvious than in the past, morphing is used heavily today. Whereas the effect was initially a novelty, today, morphing effects are most often designed to be seamless and invisible to the eye. A particular use for morphing effects is modern digital font design. Using morphing technology, called interpolation or multiple master tech, a designer can create an intermediate between two styles, for example generating a semibold font by compromising between a bold and regular style, or extend a trend to create an ultra-light or ultra-bold. The technique is commonly used by font design studios.

Surface anatomy (also called superficial anatomy and visual anatomy) is the study of the external features of the body of an animal.Seeley (2003) chap.1 p.2 In birds this is termed topography. Surface anatomy deals with anatomical features that can be studied by sight, without dissection. As such, it is a branch of gross anatomy, along with endoscopic and radiological anatomy.Standring (2008) Introduction, Anatomical nomenclature, p.2 Surface anatomy is a descriptive science. In particular, in the case of human surface anatomy, these are the form and proportions of the human body and the surface landmarks which correspond to deeper structures hidden from view, both in static pose and in motion. In addition, the science of surface anatomy includes the theories and systems of body proportions and related artistic canons. The study of surface anatomy is the basis for depicting the human body in classical art. Some pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy, phrenology and palmistry rely on surface anatomy. Human surface anatomy Surface anatomy of the thorax Front of thorax, showing surface relations of bones, lungs (purple), pleura (blue), and heart (red outline). Heart valves are labeled with \\"B\\", \\"T\\", \\"A\\", and \\"P\\". First heart sound: caused by atrioventricular valves - Bicuspid/Mitral (B) and Tricuspid (T). Second heart sound caused by semilunar valves -- Aortic (A) and Pulmonary/Pulmonic (P). Knowledge of the surface anatomy of the thorax (chest) is particularly important because it is one of the areas most frequently subjected to physical examination, like auscultation and percussion.Drake (2009) Ch.3 Thorax - Thorax surface anatomy, pp. 224-6 and Fig. 3.96 A In cardiology, Erb's point refers to the third intercostal space on the left sternal border where S2 heart sound is best auscultated. Some sources include the fourth left interspace. Human female breasts are located on the chest wall, most frequently between the second and sixth rib. Anatomical landmarks # On the trunk of the body in the thoracic area, the shoulder in general is the acromial, while the curve of the shoulder is the deltoid. # The back as a general area is the dorsum or dorsal area, and the lower back as the limbus or lumbar region. # The shoulderblades are the scapular area and the breastbone is the sternal region. # The abdominal area is the region between the chest and the pelvis. # The breast is called the mamma or mammary, the armpit as the axilla and axillary, and the navel as the umbilicus and umbilical. # The pelvis is the lower torso, between the abdomen and the thighs. # The groin, where the thigh joins the trunk, are the inguen and inguinal area. # The entire arm is referred to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. # The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis. # Anatomists divide the lower limb into the thigh (the part of the limb between the hip and the knee) and the leg (which refers only to the area of the limb between the knee and the ankle). # The thigh is the femur and the femoral region. # The kneecap is the patella and patellar while the back of the knee is the popliteus and popliteal area. # The leg (between the knee and the ankle) is the crus and crural area, the lateral aspect of the leg is the peroneal area, and the calf is the sura and sural region. # The ankle is the tarsus and tarsal, and the heel is the calcaneus or calcaneal. The foot is the pes and pedal region, and the sole of the foot the planta and plantar. # As with the fingers, the toes are also called the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal area. # The big toe is referred to as the hallux.

MSC also monitors and conducts research on climate, atmospheric science, air quality, water quantities, ice and other environmental issues. MSC operates a network of radio stations throughout Canada transmitting weather and environmental information 24 hours per day called Weatheradio Canada. History Private Observations Prior to 1840, meteorological observations in Canada were made by private individuals, other entities (like HBC), and explorers, but this information was not provided to the general public.Meteorology in Canada Her Majesty's Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory In 1840, British officials (British Ordnance Department) and the Royal Society established an observatory in Toronto, Canada West, one of a few across the British Empire and likely modeled after the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Meteorological Service of the Dominion The Toronto observatory ended in 1853, but the Government of Canada took over the service and continued collecting climate data. On May 1, 1871, the Government of Canada established the Meteorological Service of Canada by providing a $5000 grant to Professor G. T. Kingston of the University of Toronto to establish a network of weather observations. This information was collected and made available to the public from 1877 onwards. The MSC was then assigned under the Department of Marine and Fisheries.

The Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre also houses the Canadian Hurricane Centre plus manages the Newfoundland and Labrador Weather Office Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador. There are two centres dedicated to aviation weather forecasting: Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centre-East, located in Montreal, and Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centre-West, located in Edmonton. MSC also operates the Canadian Meteorological Centre, which is tasked with providing forecast guidance, and the Canadian Ice Service,Canadian Ice Service which provides ice observations and forecasts for mariners. In support of Canada's military, some MSC meteorologists are seconded to the Department of National Defence (Canada).

Despite official proclamations the Ming policy was not enforced in practice, and trade continued without hindrance. The early Qing dynasty's anti-insurgent \\"Great Clearance\\" was more definitive with devastating effects on communities along the coast. First imposed to deal with Japanese piracy amid the mopping up of Yuan partisans, the sea ban was completely counterproductive: by the 16th century, piracy and smuggling were endemic and mostly consisted of Chinese who had been dispossessed by the policy. China's foreign trade was limited to irregular and expensive tribute missions, and the military pressure from the Mongols after the disastrous Battle of Tumu led to the scrapping of Zheng He's fleets. Piracy dropped to negligible levels only upon the end of the policy in 1567, but a modified form was subsequently adopted by the Qing. This produced the Canton System of the Thirteen Factories, but also the opium smuggling that led to disastrous wars with Britain and other European powers in the 19th century. The Chinese policy was mimicked in Edo period Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate, where the policy was known as Sakoku (); it was also mimicked by Joseon Korea, which became known as the \\"Hermit Kingdom\\", before they were opened militarily in 1853 and 1876. Ming dynasty A map of wokou raiding, 14th‚Äì16th centuries. The early pirates were mostly based on outlying Japanese islands but targeted the Japanese as well as Korea and Ming China. The later ones were mostly Chinese dispossessed by Ming policy. Background The 14th century was a time of chaos throughout East Asia. The second bubonic plague pandemic began in Mongolia around 1330 and may have killed the majority of the population in Hebei and Shanxi and millions elsewhere. Another epidemic raged for three years from 1351‚Äì1354. Existing revolts over the government salt monopoly and severe floods along the Yellow River provoked the Red Turban Rebellion. The declaration of the Ming in 1368 did not end its wars with Mongol remnants under Toghon Tem√ºr in the north and under the Prince of Liang in the south. King Gongmin of Korea had begun freeing himself from the Mongols as well, retaking his country's northern provinces, when a Red Turban invasion devastated the areas and laid waste to Pyongyang. In Japan, Emperor Daigo II's Kenmu Restoration succeeded in overthrowing the Kamakura shogunate but ultimately simply replaced them with the weaker Ashikaga. The loose control over Japan's periphery led to pirates setting up bases on the realm's outlying islands, particularly Tsushima, Iki, and the Got≈çs. These wokou (\\"dwarf pirates\\") raided Japan as well as Korea and China. As a rebel leader, Zhu Yuanzhang promoted foreign trade as a source of revenue. As the Hongwu Emperor, first of the Ming Dynasty, however, he issued the first sea ban in 1371. All foreign trade was to be conducted by official tribute missions, handled by representatives of the Ming Empire and its \\"vassal\\" states. Private foreign trade was made punishable by death, with the offender's family and neighbors exiled from their homes.. A few years later, in 1384, the Maritime Trade Intendancies (Shibo Tiju Si) at Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou were shuttered. Ships, docks, and shipyards were destroyed and ports sabotaged with rocks and pine stakes.. Although the policy is now associated with imperial China generally, it was then at odds with Chinese tradition, which had pursued foreign trade as a source of revenue and become particularly important under the Tang, Song, and Yuan. The Treasure voyages of Zheng He were partly intended to monopolise overseas trade under the government. They were discontinued due to a rise in Mongol assertiveness after the Emperor's capture at the Battle of Tumu in 1449. The large scale of private overseas trade had caused price competition for the Ming government's purchases, such as warhorses for the northern frontier, and funds had to be reallocated. However, after the end of the Treasure voyages, Chinese trade within Asia and North Africa continued. Private, including unauthorised, Chinese trade in Southeast Asia expanded rapidly in the second half of the Ming dynasty. A 1613 edict prohibited maritime trade between the lands north and south of the Yangtze River, attempting to put a stop to captains claiming to be heading to Jiangsu and then diverting to Japan. Rationale Although the policy has generally been ascribed to national defense against the pirates, it was so obviously counterproductive and yet carried on for so long that other explanations have been offered. The initial conception seems to have been to use the Japanese need for Chinese goods to force them to terms. The Hongwu emperor seemed to indicate that the policy was designed to prevent foreign nations from collaborating with his subjects to challenge his rule; for instance, Srivijaya was banned from trading as the emperor suspected them of spying. The usage of trade was also a powerful tool to entice foreign governments to abide by the tributary system and pressure uncooperative leaders. Parallels with Song and Yuan measures restricting outflows of bullion have led some to argue that it was intended to support the Hongwu Emperor's printing of fiat currency, whose use was continued by his successors as late as 1450. (By 1425, rampant counterfeiting and hyperinflation meant people were already trading at about 0.014% of their original value.) Others assert that it was a side effect of a desire to elevate Confucian humaneness (, ren) and eliminate greed from the realm's foreign relations or a ploy to weaken the realm's southern subjects to the benefit of the central government.. Nonetheless, it may have been the case that the Hongwu Emperor prioritized protecting his state against the Northern Yuan remnants, leaving the policy and its local enforcers as the most he could accomplish. and his mention of them in his Ancestral Injunctions as responsible for their continuation. Effects The policy offered too little‚Äîdecennial tribute missions comprising only two ships‚Äîas a reward for good behavior and enticement for Japanese authorities to root out their smugglers and pirates. The Hongwu Emperor's message to the Japanese that his army would \\"capture and exterminate your bandits, head straight for your country, and put your king in bonds\\" received the Ashikaga shogun's reply that \\"your great empire may be able to invade Japan but our small state is not short of a strategy to defend ourselves\\".. Although the sea ban left the Ming army free to extirpate the remaining Yuan loyalists and secure China's borders, it tied up local resources. 74 coastal garrisons were established from Guangzhou in Guangdong to Shandong; under the Yongle Emperor, these outposts were notionally manned by 110,000 subjects.. The loss of income from taxes on trade contributed to chronic funding difficulties throughout the Ming, particularly for Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. By impoverishing and provoking both coastal Chinese and Japanese against the regime, it increased the problem it was purporting to solve.. The initial wave of Japanese pirates had been independently dealt with by Jeong Mong-ju and Imagawa Sadayo, who returned their booty and slaves to Korea;. . Ashikaga Yoshimitsu delivered 20 more to China in 1405, which boiled them alive in a cauldron in Ningbo.. However, the raids on China continued, most grievously under the Jiajing Emperor. By the 16th century, the \\"Japanese\\", \\"dwarf\\", and \\"eastern barbarian\\" pirates of the Jiajing wokou raids were mostly non-Japanese. Nonetheless, because the sea ban was added by the Hongwu Emperor to his Ancestral Injunctions, it continued to be broadly kept through most of the rest of his dynasty. For the next two centuries, the rich farmland of the south and the military theaters of the north were linked almost solely by the Jinghang Canal.. Bribery and disinterest occasionally permitted more leeway, as when the Portuguese began trading at Guangzhou (1517), Shuangyu (\\"Liampo\\"), and Quanzhou (\\"Chincheu\\"), but crackdowns also occurred, as with the expulsion of the Portuguese in the 1520s, on the islands off Ningbo and Zhangzhou in 1547, or at Yuegang in 1549. The Portuguese were permitted to settle at Macao in 1557, but only after several years of helping the Chinese suppress piracy. The sea ban was largely unenforceable from its earliest years, and no effective enforcement was ever implemented. Local authorities themselves were frequently involved in the illicit trade, and usually ignored edicts to restrict trade. Military officers brokered trade deals and the wealthy families in the coastal settlements depended on its income. Ordinary workers found employment in trade-related industries. Many of the official posts to enforce trade regulations were left vacant and the Maritime Trading Intendancies were abolished. The court generally ignored the issue of overseas trade. In the 1520s the emperor rejected all attempts to halt the trade as these came from officials who had opposed the emperor's policy of rituals, and very little trade took place under governmental channels instead of illicit means. The Grand secretary of the court in the 1530s was from coastal Zhejiang province, and he proceeded to block any attempt to enforce the sea ban. The most significant attempt to crush out the illicit trade was made by Zhu Wan, an official appointed by the court in the 1540s, but just as he was making headway in wiping out the smugglers he was removed by the court on accusations of unauthorised killings. Piracy dropped to negligible levels only after the general abolition of the policy in 1567 upon the ascension of the Longqing Emperor and at the urging of the governor of Fujian. Chinese merchants were then permitted to engage in all foreign trade except with Japan or involving weapons or other contraband goods; these included iron, sulfur, and copper. The number of foreign traders was capped by a license and quota system; no trading could take them away from China for longer than a year. Maritime trade intendancies were re√´stablished at Guangzhou and Ningbo in 1599, and Chinese merchants turned Yuegang (modern Haicheng, Fujian) into a thriving port. The end of the sea ban did not mark an imperial change of heart, however, so much as a recognition that the weakness of the later Ming state made it impossible to continue the prohibition. The state continued to attempt to regulate trade as heavily as it could, and foreigners were restricted to doing business through approved agents, with prohibitions against any direct business with ordinary Chinese. Accommodations could be made, but were slow in coming: the merchants of Yuegang were trading heavily with the Spanish within a year of Maynila's 1570 conquest by Mart√≠n de Goiti but it wasn't until 1589 that the throne approved the city's requests for more merchant licenses to expand the trade. Fu Yuanchu's 1639 memorial to the throne made the case that trade between Fujian and Dutch Taiwan had made the ban entirely unworkable. The lifting of the sea ban coincided with the arrival of the first Spanish galleons from the Americas, creating a global trade link that would not be interrupted until the following century.  China in the global trading system  China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade. Trade with Japan continued unobstructed despite the embargo, through Chinese smugglers, Southeast Asian ports, or Portuguese. China was entirely integrated in the world trading system. European nations had a great desire for Chinese goods such as silk and porcelain. The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit. Spaniards at the time of the Age of Exploration discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the Potos√≠ silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it, producing 40,000 tons of silver in 200 years. The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80% of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China. In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting silver heavily into China. Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east. Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. The city of Manila served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, Indian, Indonesia and China. However, there was a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well. Trade with Ming China via Manila served a major source of revenue for the Spanish Empire and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port.Schurz, William Lytle. The Manila Galleon, 1939. P 193. The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of Fujian who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, processed silk cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain. Qing dynasty Territory held (red) or influenced (pink) by Koxinga and his Ming partisans/pirates. Background As the Qing expanded south following their victory at Shanhai Pass, the Southern Ming were supported by the Zheng clan. Zheng Zhilong surrendered the passes through Zhejiang in exchange for a wealthy retirement, but his son Zheng Chenggong‚Äîbetter known by his Hokkien honorific Koxinga‚Äîcontinued to resist from Xiamen and then, after wresting its control from the Dutch, Taiwan. His dynasty then developed it as the independent state of Tungning, but were driven from their mainland bases in 1661. Policy The Qing regent Prince Rui resumed the sea ban in 1647, but it was not effective until a more severe order followed in 1661 upon the ascension of the Kangxi Emperor. In an evacuation as the \\"Great Clearance\\" or \\"Frontier Shift\\", coastal residents of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and parts of Shandong were required to destroy their property and move inland (about ), with Qing soldiers erecting boundary markers and enforcing the death penalty on those beyond it. Ships were destroyed, and foreign trade was again limited to that passing through Macao. Checks and adjustments were made the following year, and the inhabitants of five counties‚ÄîPanyu, Shunde, Xinhui, Dongguan, and Zhongshan‚Äîmoved again the year after that. Following numerous high-level memorials, the evacuation was no longer enforced after 1669. In 1684, following the destruction of Tungning, other bans were lifted. The year after that, customs offices were established in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Songjiang to deal with foreign trade. Repressive Qing policies such as the queue caused Chinese traders to emigrate in such large numbers, however, that the Kangxi Emperor began to fear the military implications. The immigrant community in Jakarta was estimated at 100,000 and rumors circulated that a Ming heir was living on Luzon. A ban on trade in the \\"Southern Ocean\\" followed in 1717, with tighter port inspections and travel restrictions. Emigrants were ordered to return to China within the next three years upon penalty of death; those emigrating in future were to face the same punishment. Legal trade in the South China Sea was resumed in 1727, but the East India Company's discovery that the prices and duties at Ningbo were both much lower than those at Guangzhou prompted them to begin shifting their trade north from 1755 to 1757. The Qianlong Emperor's attempt to discourage this through higher fees failed; in the winter of 1757, he declared that‚Äîeffective the next year‚ÄîGuangzhou (then romanized as \\"Canton\\") was to be the only Chinese port permitted to foreign traders, beginning the Canton System, with its Cohong and Thirteen Factories. Chinese merchants trading with foreigners, on the other hand, were not affected by any of these regulations. Effects The initial Qing sea ban curtailed Koxinga's influence on the Chinese mainland and ended with his state's defeat, which brought Taiwan into the Qing Empire. Nonetheless, it was quite harmful to the Chinese themselves, as documented in governors' and viceroys' memorials to the throne. Even before the Kangxi Emperor's restrictions, Jin Fu's 1659 memorial to the throne argued that the ban on foreign trade was limiting China's access to silver, harmfully restricting the money supply, and that lost trading opportunities cost Chinese merchants 7 or 8 million taels a year. The policies revived rebellions and piracy along the coast, while also providing a boon for black markets. The Great Clearance was completely disruptive to China's southern coasts. Of the roughly 16,000 residents of Xin'an County (roughly modern Shenzhen and Hong Kong) who were driven inland in 1661, only 1,648 were recorded returning in 1669. Powerful typhoons that year and in 1671 further destroyed local communities and discouraged resettlement. When trade restrictions were released, Fujian and Guangdong saw enormous outflows of migrants. The conflicts between the former residents and the newcomers such as the Hakka provoked lingering feuds that erupted into full-scale war in the 1850s and 1860s and that fueled Guangdong's piracy into the 20th century. European countries' trade with China was so extensive that they were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia. As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China. The restrictions imposed by the Qianlong Emperor that established the Canton System were highly lucrative for Guangzhou's Cohong‚Äîthe merchant Howqua became one of the world's wealthiest individuals‚Äîand normalized Guangzhou's tax base and inflow of foreign silver. Under the canton system, the Qianlong Emperor restricted trade to only licensed Chinese merchants, while the British government on their part issued a monopoly charter for trade only to the British East India Company. This arrangement was not challenged until the 19th century when the idea of free trade was popularised in the West. The Canton system did not completely affect Chinese trade with the rest of the world as Chinese merchants, with their large three-masted ocean junks, were heavily involved in global trade. By sailing to and from Siam, Indonesia and Philippines, they were major facilitators of the global trading system; the era was even described by Carl Trocki as a \\"Chinese century\\" of global commerce. Chinese merchants could also trade freely and legally with Westerners (Spanish and Portuguese) in Xiamen and Macao, or with any country when trade was conducted through ports outside China such as Manila and Batavia. By restricting imports mostly to bullion, however, it created strong pressure on the British‚Äîfor whom tea had become the national drink over the course of the 17th century‚Äîto find any means possible to adjust the balance of trade. This turned out to be smuggled Indian opium, which became so lucrative and important that the viceroy Lin Zexu's vigorous enforcement of existing laws against it prompted the First Opium War and the beginning of the unequal treaties that restricted Qing sovereignty in the 19th century. The 1842 Treaty of Nanking opened the ports of Xiamen (\\"Amoy\\"), Fuzhou (\\"Fuchow\\"), Ningbo (\\"Ningpo\\"), and Shanghai, but legal trade continued to be limited to specified ports to the end of the dynasty.

Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1972 to 1974. Jackson helped New York win four American League East divisional pennants, three American League pennants and two consecutive World Series titles, from 1977 to 1981. He also helped the California Angels win two AL West divisional pennants in 1982 and 1986. Jackson hit three consecutive home runs at Yankee Stadium in the clinching game six of the 1977 World Series. Jackson hit 563 career home runs and was an American League (AL) All-Star for 14 seasons. He won two Silver Slugger Awards, the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1973, two World Series MVP Awards, and the Babe Ruth Award in 1977. The Yankees and Athletics retired his team uniform number in 1993 and 2004. Jackson currently serves as a special advisor to the Yankees. Jackson led his teams to first place ten times over his 21-year career. Early years Jackson was born in the Wyncote neighborhood of Cheltenham Township, just north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Martinez Jackson, who was half Puerto Rican, worked as a tailor and was a former second baseman with the Newark Eagles of Negro league baseball. He was the youngest of four children from his mother, Clara. He also had two half- siblings from his father's first marriage. His parents divorced when he was four; his mother took four of his siblings with her, while his father took Reggie and one of the siblings from his first marriage, though one sibling later returned to Wyncote. Martinez Jackson was a single father, and theirs was one of the few black families in Wyncote. Jackson graduated from Cheltenham High School in 1964, where he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track and field. A tailback in football, he injured his knee in an early season game in his junior year in the fall of 1962. He was told by the doctors he was never to play football again, but Jackson returned for the final game of the season. In that game, Jackson fractured five cervical vertebrae, which caused him to spend six weeks in the hospital and another month in a neck cast. Doctors told Jackson that he might never walk again, let alone play football, but Jackson defied the odds again. On the baseball team, he batted .550 and threw several no-hitters. In the middle of his senior year, Jackson's father was arrested for bootlegging and was sentenced to six months in jail. Collegiate athletic career For football, Jackson was recruited by Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, all of whom were willing to break the color barrier just for Jackson. (Oklahoma had black football players before 1964, including Prentice Gautt, a star running back recruited in 1957, who played in the NFL.) Jackson declined Alabama and Georgia because he was fearful of the South at the time, and declined Oklahoma because they told him to stop dating white girls. For baseball, Jackson was scouted by Hans Lobert of the San Francisco Giants who was desperate to sign him. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins also made offers, and the hometown Philadelphia Phillies gave him a tryout but declined because of his \\"hitting skills\\". His father wanted his son to go to college, where Jackson wanted to play both football and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Arizona State University in Tempe; his high school football coach knew ASU's head football coach Frank Kush, and they discussed the possibility of his playing both sports. After a recruiting trip, Kush decided that Jackson had the ability and willingness to work to join the squad. One day after football practice, he approached ASU baseball coach Bobby Winkles and asked if he could join the team. Winkles said he would give Jackson a look, and the next day while still in his football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw; in five at bats he hit three home runs. He was allowed to practice with the team, but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the use of freshman players. Jackson switched permanently to baseball following his freshman year, as he did not want to become a defensive back. To hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles offered him a $50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team. Jackson declined the offer stating that he did not want to forfeit his college scholarship. In the beginning of his sophomore year in 1966, Jackson replaced Rick Monday (the first player ever selected in the Major League Baseball draft and a future teammate with the A's) at center field. He broke the team record for most home runs in a single season, led the team in numerous other categories and was first team All-American. Many scouts were looking at him play, including Tom Greenwade of the New York Yankees (who discovered Mickey Mantle), and Danny Murtaugh of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his final game at Arizona State, he showed his potential by being only a triple away from hitting for the cycle, making a sliding catch, and having an assist at home plate. Jackson was the first college player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium. Minor leagues In the 1966 Major League Baseball draft on June 7, Jackson was selected by the Kansas City Athletics. He was the second overall pick, behind 17-year-old catcher Steve Chilcott, who was taken by the New York Mets. According to Jackson, Winkles told him that the Mets did not select him because he had a white girlfriend. Winkles later denied the story, stating that he did not know the reason why Jackson was not drafted by the Mets. It was later confirmed by Joe McDonald that the Mets drafted Chilcott because of need, the person running the Mets at the time was George Weiss, so the true motive may never be known. Jackson, age 20, signed with the A's for $95,000 on June 13 and reported for his first training camp with the Lewis-Clark Broncs of the short season Single-A Northwest League in Lewiston, Idaho, managed by Grady Wilson. He made his professional debut as a center fielder in the season opener on June 24 at Bethel Park in Eugene, Oregon, but was hitless in five at-bats. In the next game, Jackson singled in the first inning and homered in the ninth. In the home opener at Bengal Field in Lewiston on June 30, he hit a double and a triple. In his final game as a Bronc on July 6, Jackson was hit in the head by a pitch in the first inning, but stayed in the game and drove in runs with two sacrifice flies. Complaining of a headache, he left the game in the ninth inning, was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital in Lewiston, and remained overnight for observation. Jackson played for two Class A teams in 1966, with the Broncs for just 12 games, and then 56 games with Modesto in the California League, where he hit 21 homers. He began 1967 with the Birmingham A's in the Double-A Southern League in Birmingham, Alabama, where Jackson got his first taste of racism, being one of only a few blacks on the team. He credits the team's manager at the time, John McNamara, for helping him through that difficult season. MLB career Kansas City / Oakland Athletics (1967‚Äì1975) Jackson debuted in the major leagues with the A's in 1967 in a Friday doubleheader in Kansas City on June 9, a shutout sweep of the Cleveland Indians by scores of and at Municipal Stadium. (Jackson had his first career hit in the nightcap, a lead-off triple in the fifth inning off of long reliever Orlando Pe√±a.) Jackson before the third game of the 1973 World Series. The Athletics moved west to Oakland prior to the 1968 season. Jackson hit 47 home runs in 1969, and was briefly ahead of the pace that Roger Maris set when he broke the single-season record for home runs with 61 in 1961, and that of Babe Ruth when he set the previous record of 60 in 1927. Jackson later said that the sportswriters were claiming he was \\"dating a lady named 'Ruth Maris.'\\" Slumping at the plate in May 1970, Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley threatened to send Jackson to the minors. Jackson hit 23 home runs while batting .237 for the 1970 season. The Athletics sent him to play in Puerto Rico, where he played for the Santurce team and hit 20 homers and knocked in 47 runs to lead the league in both departments. Jackson hit a memorable home run in the 1971 All-Star Game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. Batting for the American League against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis, the ball he hit soared above the right-field stands, striking the transformer of a light standard on the right field roof. While with the Angels in 1984, he hit a home run over that roof. In 1971, the Athletics won the American League's West division, their first title of any kind since 1931, when they played in Philadelphia. They were swept in three games in the American League Championship Series by the Baltimore Orioles. The A's won the division again in 1972; their series with the Tigers went the full five games, and Jackson scored the tying run in the clincher on a steal of home. In the process, however, he tore a hamstring and was unable to play in the World Series. The A's still managed to defeat the Cincinnati Reds in seven games. It was the first championship won by a San Francisco Bay Area team in any major league sport. During spring training in 1972, Jackson showed up with a mustache. Though his teammates wanted him to shave it off, Jackson refused. Finley liked the mustache so much that he offered each player $300 to grow one, and hosted a \\"Mustache Day\\" featuring the last MLB player to wear a mustache, Frenchy Bordagaray, as master of ceremonies. Jackson helped the Athletics win the pennant again in 1973, and was named Most Valuable Player of the American League for the season. The A's defeated the New York Mets in seven hard-fought games in the World Series. This time, Jackson was not only able to play, but his performance led to his being awarded the Series' MVP award. In the third inning of that seventh game, which ended in a 5‚Äì2 score, the A's jumped out to a 4‚Äì0 lead as both Bert Campaneris and Jackson hit two- run home runs off Jon Matlack‚Äîthe only two home runs Oakland hit the entire Series. The A's won the World Series again in 1974, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Besides hitting 254 home runs in nine years with the Athletics, Jackson was also no stranger to controversy or conflict in Oakland. Sports author Dick Crouser wrote, \\"When the late Al Helfer was broadcasting the Oakland A's games, he was not too enthusiastic about Reggie Jackson's speed or his hustle. Once, with Jackson on third, teammate Rick Monday hit a long home run. 'Jackson should score easily on that one,' commented Helfer. Crouser also noted that, \\"Nobody seems to be neutral on Reggie Jackson. You're either a fan or a detractor.\\" When teammate Darold Knowles was asked if Jackson was a hotdog (i.e., a show-off), he famously replied, \\"There isn't enough mustard in the world to cover Reggie Jackson.\\"\\"They Said It\\" Sports Illustrated, January 24, 1977 In February 1974, Jackson won an arbitration case for a $135,000 salary for the season, nearly doubling his previous year's $70,000. On June 5, outfielder Billy North and Jackson engaged in a clubhouse fight at Detroit's Tiger Stadium. Jackson injured his shoulder, and catcher Ray Fosse, attempting to separate the combatants, suffered a crushed disk in his neck, costing him three months on the disabled list. In October, the A's went on to win a third consecutive World Series. Prior to the 1975 season, Jackson sought $168,000, but arbitration went against him this time and he settled for $140,000.\\"A's trade Jackson, Holtzman,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Saturday, April 3, 1976. Retrieved August 31, 2017 The A's won a fifth consecutive division title, but the loss of pitcher Catfish Hunter, baseball's first modern free agent, left them vulnerable, and they were swept in the ALCS by the Boston Red Sox. Baltimore Orioles (1976) Paid $140,000 in 1975 and one of nine Oakland players refusing to sign 1976 contracts, Jackson sought a three-year $600,000 pact.\\"Orioles obtain Reggie Jackson; Baylor, Torrez go to Oakland,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Saturday, April 3, 1976. Retrieved May 4, 2020 With free agency imminent after the season and the expectations of higher salaries for which Athletics owner Finley was unwilling to pay, he was traded along with Ken Holtzman and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Van Bommel to the Baltimore Orioles for Don Baylor, Mike Torrez, and Paul Mitchell on April 2, 1976. Jackson had not signed a contract and threatened to sit out the season; he reported to the Orioles four weeks later, and made his first plate appearance on Baltimore and Oakland both finished second in their respective divisions in ; the Yankees and Royals advanced to the ALCS, the first without the A's since 1970. During Jackson's lone season in Baltimore he stole 28 bases, a career-best. New York Yankees (1977‚Äì1981) The Yankees won the pennant in 1976 but were swept in the World Series by the Reds. A month later on November 29, they signed Jackson to a five-year contract totaling $2.96 million ($ in current dollar terms). The number 9 that he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore was already used by Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles; Jackson asked for number 42 in memory of Jackie Robinson, but that number was given to pitching coach Art Fowler before the start of the season. Noting that Hank Aaron, at the time the holder of the career record for the most home runs, had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44 as a tribute to Aaron. Jackson wore number 20 for one game during spring training as a tribute to the also recently retired Frank Robinson, then he switched to number 44. Jackson's first season with the Yankees in 1977 was a difficult one. Although team owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella, were excited about his arrival, the team's field manager Billy Martin was not. Martin had managed the Tigers in 1972, when Jackson's A's beat them in the playoffs. Jackson was once quoted as saying of Martin, \\"I hate him, but if I played for him, I'd probably love him.\\" The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's version of the story is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be \\"the straw that stirs the drink.\\" But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson as saying, \\"This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad.\\"Jackson signs with the Yankees.Jackson has consistently denied saying anything negative about Munson in the interview and he has said that his quotes were taken out of context. However, Dave Anderson of The New York Times subsequently wrote that he had drinks with Jackson in July 1977, and that Jackson told him, \\"I'm still the straw that stirs the drink. Not Munson, not nobody else on this club.\\"Anderson, D: \\"1977: Reggie\\", \\"The Baseball Reader\\", page 11. Lippincott & Crowell, Publishers, 1980 Regardless, as Munson was beloved by his teammates, Martin, Steinbrenner and Yankee fans, the relationships between them and Jackson became very strained. On June 18, in a 10‚Äì4 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but notoriously slow runner, hit a ball into shallow right field that Jackson appeared to weakly attempt to field. Jackson failed to reach the ball, which fell far in front of him, thereby allowing Rice to reach second base. Furious, Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. They argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being 18 years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly, and the NBC TV cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country. Yankees management defused the situation by the next day, but the relationship between Jackson and Martin was permanently poisoned. However, George Steinbrenner made a crucial intervention when he gave Martin the option of either having Jackson bat in the fourth or \\"cleanup\\" spot for the rest of the season, or losing his job. Martin made the change and Jackson's hitting improved (he had 13 home runs and 49 RBIs over his next 50 games), and the team went on a winning streak. On September 14, while in a tight three-way race for the American League Eastern Division crown with the Red Sox and Orioles, Jackson ended a game with the Red Sox by hitting a home run off Reggie Cleveland, giving the Yankees a 2‚Äì0 win. The Yankees won the division by two and a half games over the Red Sox and Orioles, and came from behind in the top of the ninth inning in the fifth and final game of the American League Championship Series to beat the Kansas City Royals for the pennant. =Mr. October= During the World Series against the Dodgers, Munson was interviewed, and suggested that Jackson, because of his past post-season performances, might be the better interview subject. \\"Go ask Mister October\\", he said, giving Jackson a nickname that would stick. (In Oakland, he had been known as \\"Jax\\" and \\"Buck.\\") Jackson hit home runs in Games Four and Five of the Series. Jackson's crowning achievement came with his three-home-run performance in World Series-clinching Game Six, each on the first pitch, off three Dodgers pitchers. (His first plate-appearance, during the second inning, resulted in a four-pitch walk.) The first came off starter Burt Hooton, and was a line drive shot into the lower right field seats at Yankee Stadium. The second was a much faster line drive off reliever El√≠as Sosa into roughly the same area. With the fans chanting his name, \\"Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE!\\" The third came off reliever Charlie Hough, a knuckleball pitcher, making the distance of this home run particularly remarkable. It was a towering drive into the black-painted batter's eye seats in center, away. Jackson stated afterwards that the scouting reports provided by Gene Michael and Birdie Tebbetts played a large role in his success. Their reports indicated that the Dodgers would attempt to pitch him inside and Jackson was prepared. Since Jackson had hit a home run off Dodger pitcher Don Sutton in his last at bat in Game Five, his three home runs in Game Six meant that he had hit four home runs on four consecutive swings of the bat against as many Dodgers pitchers. Jackson became the first player to win the World Series MVP award for two teams. In 27 World Series games, he amassed 10 home runs, including a record five during the 1977 Series (the last three on first pitches), 24 RBI and a .357 batting average. Babe Ruth, Albert Pujols, and Pablo Sandoval are the only other players to hit three home runs in a single World Series game. Babe Ruth accomplishing the feat twice ‚Äì in 1926 and 1928 (both in Game Four). With 25 total bases, Jackson also broke Ruth's record of 22 in the latter Series; this remains a World Series record, Willie Stargell tying it in the 1979 World Series. Chase Utley (2009, Philadelphia) and George Springer (2017, Houston) have since tied Jackson's record for most home runs in a single World Series. An often forgotten aspect of the ending of this decisive Game 6 was the way Jackson left the field at the game's end. Fans had been getting somewhat rowdy in anticipation of the game's end, and some had actually thrown firecrackers out near Jackson's area in right field. Jackson was alarmed enough about this to walk off the field, in order to get a helmet from the Yankee bench to protect himself. Shortly after this point, as the end of the game neared, fans were actually bold enough to climb over the wall, draping their legs over the side in preparation for the moment when they planned to rush onto the field. When that moment came, after pitcher Mike Torrez caught a pop-up for the game's final out, Jackson started running at top speed off the field, actually body- checking past some of these fans filling the playing field in the manner of a football linebacker.ABC coverage of Game Six, as shown on the YES network. =The Bronx Zoo= Jackson bats at Yankee Stadium, July 1979. The Yankees' home opener of the 1978 season, on April 13 against the Chicago White Sox, featured a new product, the \\"Reggie!\\" bar. In 1976, while playing in Baltimore, Jackson had said, \\"If I played in New York, they'd name a candy bar after me.\\" The Standard Brands company responded with a circular \\"bar\\" of peanuts dipped in caramel and covered in chocolate, a confection that was originally named the \\"Wayne Bun\\" as it was made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The \\"Reggie!\\" bars were handed to fans as they walked into Yankee Stadium. Jackson hit a home run, and when he returned to right field the next inning, fans began throwing the Reggie bars on the field in celebration. Jackson told the press that this confused him, thinking that maybe the fans did not like the candy. The Yankees won the game, 4‚Äì2. But the Yankees could not maintain their success, as manager Billy Martin lost control. On July 23, after suspending Jackson for disobeying a sign during a July 17 game, Martin made a statement about his two main antagonists, referring to comments Jackson had made and team owner George Steinbrenner's 1972 violation of campaign-finance laws: \\"They're made for each other. One's a born liar, the other's convicted.\\" It was moments like these that gave the Yankees the nickname \\"The Bronx Zoo.\\" Martin resigned the next day (some sources have said he was actually fired), and was replaced by Bob Lemon, a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Cleveland Indians who had been recently fired as manager of the White Sox. Steinbrenner, a Cleveland-area native, had hired former Indians star Al Rosen as his team president (replacing another Cleveland figure, Gabe Paul). Steinbrenner jumped at the chance to involve another hero of his youth with the Yankees; Lemon had been one of Steinbrenner's coaches during the Bombers' pennant-winning 1976 season. After being 14 games behind the first-place Red Sox on July 18, the Yankees finished the season in a tie for first place. The two teams played a one-game playoff for the division title at Fenway Park, with the Yankees winning 5‚Äì4. Although the home run by light-hitting shortstop Bucky Dent in the seventh inning got the most notice, it was an eighth-inning home run by Jackson that gave the Yankees the fifth run they ended up needing. The next day, with the American League Championship Series with the Royals beginning, Jackson hit a home run off the Royals' top reliever at the time, Al Hrabosky, the flamboyant \\"Mad Hungarian.\\" The Yankees won the pennant in four games, their third straight. Jackson was once again in the center of events in the World Series, again against the Dodgers. Los Angeles won the first two games at Dodger Stadium, taking the second when rookie reliever Bob Welch struck Jackson out with two men on base with two outs in the ninth inning. The series then moved to New York, and after the Yankees won Game Three on several fine defensive plays by third baseman Graig Nettles, Game Four saw Jackson in the middle of a controversial play on the basepaths. In the sixth inning, after collecting an RBI single, Jackson was struck in the hip‚Äìpossibly on purpose‚Äìby a ball thrown by Dodger shortstop Bill Russell as Jackson was being forced at second base. Instead of completing a double play that would have ended the inning, the ball caromed into foul territory and allowed Thurman Munson to score the Yankees' second run of the inning. In spite of the Dodgers' protests of interference on Jackson's part, the umpires allowed the play to stand. The Yankees tied the game in the eighth inning and eventually won in the tenth. Following a blowout win in Game Five, both teams headed back to Los Angeles. In Game Six, Jackson got his revenge against Welch by blasting a two-run home run in the seventh inning, putting the finishing touch on a series-clinching, 7-2 win for the Yankees. =1980‚Äì81 seasons= In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by the Kansas City Royals. That year, he won the inaugural Silver Slugger Award as a designated hitter. As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won. Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers. California Angels (1982‚Äì1986) and Oakland Athletics (1987) Jackson in 1983 as a member of the California Angels. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed him to a five-year contract. On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting the \\"Reg-GIE!\\" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting \\"Steinbrenner sucks!\\" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made as Yankee owner. That season, the Angels won the American League West, and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off Bud Black of the Royals. In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at- bat, at Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5‚Äì2. Jackson was the last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics. Legacy Jackson played 21 seasons and reached the post-season in 11 of them, winning six pennants and five World Series. His accomplishments include winning both the regular-season and World Series MVP awards in 1973, hitting 563 career home runs (sixth all-time at the time of his retirement), maintaining a .490 career slugging percentage, being named to 14 All-Star teams, and the dubious distinction of being the all-time leader in strikeouts with 2,597 (he finished with 13 more career strikeouts than hits) and second on the all-time list for most Golden sombreros (at least four strikeouts in a game) with 23 ‚Äì he led this statistic until 2014, when he was surpassed by Ryan Howard. Jackson was the first major leaguer to hit 100 home runs for three different clubs, having hit over 100 for the Athletics, Yankees, and Angels. He is the only player in the 500 home run club that never had consecutive 30 home run seasons in a career.  Personal life  During his freshman year at Arizona State, he met Jennie Campos, a Mexican-American. Jackson asked Campos on a date, and discovered many similarities, including the ability to speak Spanish, and being raised in a single parent home (Campos' father was killed in the Korean War). An assistant football coach tried to break up the couple because Jackson was black and Campos was considered white. The coach contacted Campos' uncle, a wealthy benefactor of the school, and he warned the couple that their being together was a bad idea. But the relationship held up and she later became his wife. Jackson has been divorced since 1973. Kimberly, his only child, was born in the late 1980s. During the off-season, though still active in baseball, Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. Just over a month before signing with the Yankees in the fall of 1976, Jackson did analysis in the ABC booth with Keith Jackson and Howard Cosell the night his future team won the American League pennant on a homer by Chris Chambliss. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations. In addition, Jackson did color commentary for the 1984 National League Championship Series (alongside Don Drysdale and Earl Weaver). After his retirement as an active player, Jackson returned to his color commentary role covering the 1988 American League Championship Series (alongside Gary Bender and Joe Morgan) for ABC. Jackson appeared in the film The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, portraying an Angels outfielder hypnotically programmed to kill the Queen of England. He also appeared in Richie Rich, BASEketball, Summer of Sam and The Benchwarmers. In 1979, Jackson was a guest star in an episode of the television sitcom Diff'rent Strokes and also in an episode of The Love Boat. He played himself in the Archie Bunker's Place episode \\"Reggie-3 Archie-0\\" in 1982, a 1990 MacGyver episode, \\"Squeeze Play\\", The Jeffersons episode \\"The Unnatural‚Äù from 1985, and the Malcolm in the Middle episode \\"Polly in the Middle\\", from 2004. Jackson was also considered for the role of Geordi La Forge in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation, a role that ultimately went to LeVar Burton. From 1981 to 1982 he hosted for Nickelodeon's Reggie Jackson's World of Sports. He co-authored a book in 2010, Sixty-Feet Six-Inches, with fellow Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. The book, whose title refers to the distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate, details their careers and approach to the game. The Sega Master System baseball video game Reggie Jackson Baseball, endorsed by Jackson, was sold exclusively in the United States. Outside of the U.S., it was released as American Baseball. Jackson was the de facto spokesperson for the Upper Deck Company during the early 1990s, appearing in numerous advertisements, appearances, and participating in the company's Heroes of Baseball exhibition games. This affiliation also included Jackson being included the \\"Find the Reggie\\" promotion which inserted 2500 autograph cards into packs of 1990 Upper Deck Baseball High Series packs. This inclusion of an autograph card marked an important first in what would become a very popular trend in the trading card hobby. Jackson has endured three fires to personal property, including a June 20, 1976 fire at his home in Oakland that destroyed his 1973 MVP award, World Series trophies and All-Star rings. The same home was again burned down during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, which destroyed more baseball memorabilia in addition to other valuable collections. In 1988, a warehouse holding several of Jackson's collectible cars was damaged in a fire, with several of the cars, valued at $3.2 million, ruined. In Tampa in 2005, Jackson's car was struck from behind and flipped over several times. Jackson escaped with minor injuries, later saying \\"...it was God tapping me on the shoulder... It makes you think about your purpose, about His plan for you.\\" Jackson called on former San Francisco 49ers head coach and ordained minister Mike Singletary for spiritual guidance. Jackson credits Singletary, stating \\"he helped me drop that shell I put up.\\" Post-retirement honors Reggie Jackson during the 2009 World Series victory parade. Jackson and Steinbrenner reconciled, and Steinbrenner hired Jackson as a \\"special assistant to the principal owner\\", making him a consultant and a liaison to the team's players, particularly those of minority standing. By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, had come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by recent stars as Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. \\"His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him and what he's accomplished in his career. When Reggie Jackson tells a young kid how he might improve his swing, he tends to listen,\\" said Hal Steinbrenner, Yankees managing general partner and co-chairperson. Jackson was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1993. He chose to wear a Yankees cap on his Hall of Fame plaque after the Oakland Athletics unceremoniously fired him from a coaching position in 1991. The Yankees retired Jackson's uniform number 44 on August 14, 1993, shortly after his induction into the Hall of Fame. The Athletics retired his number 9 on May 22, 2004. He is one of only ten MLB players to have their numbers retired by more than one team, and one of only four to have different numbers retired by two MLB teams. In 1999, Jackson placed 48th on The Sporting News' 100 Greatest Baseball Players list. That same year, he was named one of 100 finalists for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, but was not one of the 30 players chosen by the fans. The Yankees dedicated a plaque in Jackson's honor on July 6, 2002 that now hangs in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls him \\"One of the most colorful and exciting players of his era\\" and \\"a prolific hitter who thrived in pressure situations.\\" Each Yankee so honored and still living was on hand for the dedication: Phil Rizzuto, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and Don Mattingly. Ron Guidry, a teammate of Jackson's for all five of his seasons with the Yankees, was there, and was to be honored with a Monument Park plaque the next season. Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks, players whom Jackson admired while growing up, attended the ceremony at his invitation. Like Jackson, each was a member of the Hall of Fame and had hit over 500 career home runs. Each had also played in the Negro Leagues, as had Jackson's father, Martinez Jackson. Reggie Jackson speaks with Alex Rodriguez during the 2006 season. Jackson expanded his love of antique cars into a chain of auto dealerships in California, and used his contacts to become one of the foremost traders of sports memorabilia. He has also been the public face of a group attempting to purchase a major league team, already having made unsuccessful attempts to buy the Athletics and the Angels. His attempt to acquire the Angels along with Jimmy Nederlander (minority owner of the New York Yankees), Jackie Autry (widow of former Angels owner Gene Autry) and other luminaries was thwarted by Mexican-American billionaire Arturo Moreno, who outbid Jackson's group by nearly $50 million for the team in the winter of 2002. In a July 2012 interview with Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked was critical of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes that the organization has lowered its standards for admission into the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs, including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating \\"I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was.\\" Of Alex Rodriguez, Jackson remarked, \\"Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers.\\" On July 12, the Yankees released a statement regarding the Sports Illustrated interview in which Jackson said, \\"In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players.\\" It had been reported that he was told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated that Jackson had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. Jackson stated, \\"I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team.\\" In 2007, ESPN aired a miniseries called The Bronx Is Burning about the 1977 Yankees, with the conflicts and controversies involving Jackson, portrayed by Daniel Sunjata, a central part of the storyline. The series infuriated Jackson, as he felt that he was portrayed as selfish and arrogant. He also expressed frustration that the filmmakers did not consult with him while making the miniseries, saying \\"I feel betrayed.\\" In 2008, Jackson threw the ceremonial first pitch at the Yankees' opening-day game, the last at the original Yankee Stadium. He also threw out the first pitch at the first game at the new Yankee Stadium (an exhibition game). On October 9, 2009, Jackson threw the ceremonial opening pitch at Game 2 of the ALDS between the Yankees and the Minnesota Twins. On October 18, 2010, the Ride of Fame honored Jackson with his image on a New York City double-decker tour bus.Gray Line New York's Ride Of Fame Campaign Honors Reggie Jackson Getty Images. October 18, 2010. On September 5, 2018, before an Athletics game against the Yankees in Oakland, Jackson was inducted into the new Oakland Athletics Hall of Fame. He joined fellow inductees Rickey Henderson, Dave Stewart, Dennis Eckersley, Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers.

An estimated 168 rust genera and approximately 7,000 species, more than half of which belong to the genus Puccinia, are currently accepted. Rust fungi are highly specialized plant pathogens with several unique features. Taken as a group, rust fungi are diverse and affect many kinds of plants. However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants. In addition, most rust fungi cannot be grown easily in pure culture. A single species of rust fungi may be able to infect two different plant hosts in different stages of its life cycle, and may produce up to five morphologically and cytologically distinct spore-producing structures viz., spermogonia, aecia, uredinia, telia, and basidia in successive stages of reproduction. Each spore type is very host specific, and can typically infect only one kind of plant. Rust fungi are obligate plant pathogens that only infect living plants. Infections begin when a spore lands on the plant surface, germinates, and invades its host. Infection is limited to plant parts such as leaves, petioles, tender shoots, stem, fruits, etc. Plants with severe rust infection may appear stunted, chlorotic (yellowed), or may display signs of infection such as rust fruiting bodies. Rust fungi grow intracellularly, and make spore- producing fruiting bodies within or, more often, on the surfaces of affected plant parts. Some rust species form perennial systemic infections that may cause plant deformities such as growth retardation, witch's broom, stem canker, galls, or hypertrophy of affected plant parts. Rusts get their name because they are most commonly observed as deposits of powdery rust-coloured or brown spores on plant surfaces. The Roman agricultural festival Robigalia (April 25) has ancient origins in combating wheat rust. Impacts Rusts are considered among the most harmful pathogens to agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Rust fungi are major concerns and limiting factors for successful cultivation of agricultural and forest crops. White pine blister rust, wheat stem rust, soybean rust, and coffee rust are examples of notoriously damaging threats to economically important crops. Life cycle All rusts are obligate parasites, meaning that they require a living host to complete their life cycle. They generally do not kill the host plant but can severely reduce growth and yield.Central Science Laboratory. (2006). Plant Healthcare: Rusts [Fact Sheet]. Retrieved from www.csldiagnostics.co.uk Cereal crops can be devastated in one season; oak trees infected in the main stem within their first five years by the rust Cronartium quercuum often die. Germinating urediniospore of Puccinia graminis, model from the late 19th century, Botanical Museum Greifswald Rust fungi can produce up to five spore types from corresponding fruiting body types during their life cycle, depending on the species. Roman numerals have traditionally been used to refer to these morphological types. *0-Pycniospores (Spermatia) from Pycnidia. These serve mainly as haploid gametes in heterothallic rusts. *I-Aeciospores from Aecia. These serve mainly as non-repeating, dikaryotic, asexual spores, and go on to infect the primary host. *II-Urediniospores from Uredia (Uredinia). These serve as repeating dikaryotic vegetative spores. These spores are referred to as the repeating stage because they can cause auto-infection on the primary host, re-infecting the same host on which the spores were produced. They are often profuse, red/orange, and a prominent sign of rust disease. *III- Teliospores from Telia. These dikaryotic spores are often the survival/overwintering stage of the life cycle. They usually do not infect a plant directly; instead they germinate to produce basidia and basidiospores. *IV-Basidiospores from Teliospores. These windborne haploid spores often infect the alternate host in Spring.Schumann, G. & D'Arcy, C. (2010). Essential plant pathology. APS PressScott, K.J, & Chakravorty, A.K., (1982), The Rust fungi. Academic Press. They are rarely observed outside of the laboratory. Rust fungi are often categorized by their life cycle. Three basic types of life cycles are recognized based on the number of spore types as macrocyclic, demicyclic, and microcyclic. The macrocyclic life cycle has all spore states, the demicyclic lacks the uredinial state, and the microcyclic cycle lacks the basidial, pycnial, and the aecial states, thus possess only uredinia and telia. Spermagonia may be absent from each type but especially the microcyclic life cycle. In macrocyclic and demicyclic life cycles, the rust may be either host alternating (heteroecious) (i.e., the aecial state is on one kind of plant but the telial state on a different and unrelated plant), or non-host alternating (autoecious) (i.e., the aecial and telial states on the same plant host). Heteroecious rust fungi require two unrelated hosts to complete their life cycle, with the primary host being infected by aeciospores and the alternate host being infected by basidiospores. This can be contrasted with an autoecious fungus which can complete all parts of its life cycle on a single host species. Understanding the life cycles of rust fungi allows for proper disease management.Peterson, R., (1974). The Rust Fungus Life Cycle. The Botanical Review. 40(4), 453-513. Host plant-rust fungus relationship There are definite patterns of relationship with host plant groups and the rust fungi that parasitize them. Some genera of rust fungi, especially Puccinia and Uromyces, comprise species that are capable of parasitizing plants of many families. Other rust genera appear to be restricted to certain plant groups. Host restriction may, in heteroecious species, apply to both phases of life cycle or to only one phase. Infection process The spores of rust fungi may be dispersed by wind, water or insect vectors.Craigie, J.H. (1931). Phytopathology, 21,1001 When a spore encounters a susceptible plant, it can germinate and infect plant tissues. A rust spores typically germinates on a plant surface, growing a short hypha called a germ tube. This germ tube may locate a stoma by a touch responsive process known as thigmotropism. This involves orienting to ridges created by epidermal cells on the leaf surface, and growing directionally until it encounters a stoma.Dickinson, M. Molecular Plant Pathology. 2003.Rust hypha attacking stoma (1600x magnification) Over the stoma, a hyphal tip produces an infection structure called an appressorium. From the underside of an appressorium, a slender hypha grows downward to infect plant cellsDeising, H.B., S. Werner, and M. Wernitz, The role of fungal appressoria in plant infection. Microbes Infect, 2000. 2(13): p. 1631-41. It is thought that the whole process is mediated by stretch- sensitive calcium ion channels located in the tip of the hypha, which produce electric currents and alter gene expression, inducing appressorium formation.Zhou, X.L., et al., A mechanosensitive channel in whole cells and in membrane patches of the fungus Uromyces. Science, 1991. 253(5026): p. 1415. Once the fungus has invaded the plant, it grows into plant mesophyll cells, producing specialized hyphae known as haustoria. The haustoria penetrate cell walls but not cell membrances: plant cell membranes invaginate around the main haustorial body forming a space known as the extra-haustorial matrix. An iron and phosphorus rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes in the space between the cells for water flow, known as the apoplast, thus preventing the nutrients reaching the plant's cells. The haustorium contains amino acid and hexose sugar transporters and H+-ATPases which are used for active transport of nutrients from the plant, nourishing the fungus.Voegele, R.T. and K. Mendgen, Rust haustoria: nutrient uptake and beyond. New Phytologist, 2003. 159(1): p. 93-100. The fungus continues growing, penetrating more and more plant cells, until spore growth occurs. The process repeats every 10 ‚Äì 14 days, producing numerous spores that can be spread to other parts of the same plant, or to new hosts. Common rust fungi in agriculture Cornell University. (2010).

The following are examples of disease management plans used to control macrocyclic and demicyclic diseases: Macrocyclic Disease: Developing a management plan for this type of disease depends largely on whether the repeating stage (urediniospores) occur on the economically important host plant or the alternate host. For example, the repeating stage in white pine blister rust disease does not occur on white pines but on the alternate host, Ribes spp. During August and September Ribes spp. give rise to teliospores which infect white pines. Removal of the alternate host disrupts the life cycle of the rust fungi Cronartium ribicola, preventing the formation of basidiospores which infect the primary host. Although spores from white pines cannot infect other white pines, survival spores may overwinter on infected pines and reinfect Ribes spp. the following season. Infected tissue is removed from white pines and strict quarantines of Ribes spp. are maintained in high risk areas.Cornell University. (2005). White Pine Blister Rust: Cronartium ribicola [Fact sheet]. Retrieved from http://plantclinic.cornell.edu Puccinia graminis is a macrocyclic heteroecious fungus that causes wheat stem rust disease. The repeating stage in this fungus occurs on wheat and not the alternate host, barberry. The repeating stage allows the disease to persist in wheat even though the alternate host may be removed. Planting resistant crops is the ideal form of disease prevention, however, mutations can give rise to new strains of fungi that can overcome plant resistance. Although the disease cannot be stopped by removal of the alternate host, the life cycle is disrupted and the rate of mutation is decreased because of reduced genetic recombination. This allows resistance bred crops to remain effective for a longer period of time.Marsalis, M. & Goldberg, N. (2006). Leaf, Stem, And Stripe Rust Diseases of Wheat. [Fact sheet]. New Mexico State University Demicyclic Disease: Because there is no repeating stage in the life cycle of demicyclic fungi, removal of the primary or the alternate host will disrupt the disease cycle. This method, however, is not highly effective in managing all demicyclic diseases. Cedar-apple rust disease, for example, can persist despite removal of one of the hosts since spores can be disseminated from long distances. The severity of Cedar-apple rust disease can be managed by removal of basidiospore producing galls from junipers or the application of protective fungicides to junipers.Wallis, C. & Lewandowski, D. (2008). Cedar Rust Diseases of Ornamental Plants. [Fact Sheet]. Ohio State University Home control Rust diseases are very hard to treat. Fungicides such as Mancozeb or Triforine may help but may never eradicate the disease. Some organic preventative solutions are available and sulphur powder is known to stop spore germination. High standards of hygiene, good soil drainage, and careful watering may minimize problems. Any appearance of rust must be immediately dealt with by removing and burning all affected leaves. Composting, or leaving infected vegetation on the ground will spread the disease. Commercial control In some large acreage crops, fungicides are applied by air. The process is expensive and fungicide application is best reserved for seasons when foliar diseases are severe. Research indicates, the higher the foliar disease severity, the greater the return from the use of fungicides. Southern corn rust disease, can be confused with common rust. Southern rust's distinguishing characteristic is that pustules form mostly on the upper leaf surface and spores are more orange in color. Southern rust spreads more quickly and has a higher economic impact when hot, humid weather conditions persist. Timely fungicide applications to control southern rust are more crucial than with common rust. A variety of preventative methods can be employed for rust diseases: * High moisture levels may exacerbate rust disease symptoms. The avoidance of overhead watering at night, using drip irrigation, reducing crop density, and using fans to circulate air flow may decrease disease severity. * The use of rust resistant plant varieties * Crop rotation can break the disease cycle because many rusts are host specific and do not persist long without their host. * Inspection of imported plants and cuttings for symptoms. It is important to continuously observe the plants because rust diseases have a latent period (plant has the disease but shows no symptoms). * Use of disease-free seed can reduce incidence for some rusts Host plants affected It is probable that most plant species are affected by some species of rust. Rusts are often named after a host species that they infect. For example; Puccinia xanthii infects the flowering plant cocklebur (Xanthium). Recently, a total of 95 rust fungi belonging to 25 genera associated with 117 forest plant species belonging to 80 host genera under 43 host families were reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India. Rust fungi include: Rust infected host genera include: Some of the better known hosts include: Hyperparasites of rusts In the family Sphaeropsidaceae of Sphaeropsidales fungi, species of the genus Darluca are hyperparasites on rusts.faculty.ucr.edu (retrieved December 2015) Gallery Image:Rust fungus (Uredinales) Pengo.jpgRust fungus on a leaf, under low magnification.

The dual notion is that of a terminal object (also called terminal element): is terminal if for every object in there exists exactly one morphism . Initial objects are also called coterminal or universal, and terminal objects are also called final. If an object is both initial and terminal, it is called a zero object or null object. A pointed category is one with a zero object. A strict initial object is one for which every morphism into is an isomorphism. Examples * The empty set is the unique initial object in Set, the category of sets. Every one-element set (singleton) is a terminal object in this category; there are no zero objects. Similarly, the empty space is the unique initial object in Top, the category of topological spaces and every one-point space is a terminal object in this category. * In the category Rel of sets and relations, the empty set is the unique initial object, the unique terminal object, and hence the unique zero object.

Likewise, a colimit of F may be characterised as an initial object in the category of co-cones from F. Properties Existence and uniqueness Initial and terminal objects are not required to exist in a given category. However, if they do exist, they are essentially unique. Specifically, if and are two different initial objects, then there is a unique isomorphism between them. Moreover, if is an initial object then any object isomorphic to is also an initial object. The same is true for terminal objects. For complete categories there is an existence theorem for initial objects. Specifically, a (locally small) complete category has an initial object if and only if there exist a set ( a proper class) and an -indexed family of objects of such that for any object of , there is at least one morphism for some . Equivalent formulations Terminal objects in a category may also be defined as limits of the unique empty diagram . Since the empty category is vacuously a discrete category, a terminal object can be thought of as an empty product (a product is indeed the limit of the discrete diagram , in general). Dually, an initial object is a colimit of the empty diagram and can be thought of as an empty coproduct or categorical sum. It follows that any functor which preserves limits will take terminal objects to terminal objects, and any functor which preserves colimits will take initial objects to initial objects. For example, the initial object in any concrete category with free objects will be the free object generated by the empty set (since the free functor, being left adjoint to the forgetful functor to Set, preserves colimits). Initial and terminal objects may also be characterized in terms of universal properties and adjoint functors. Let 1 be the discrete category with a single object (denoted by ‚Ä¢), and let be the unique (constant) functor to 1. Then *An initial object in is a universal morphism from ‚Ä¢ to .

Each pod contains several peas, which can be green or yellow. Botanically, pea pods are fruit,Rogers, Speed (2007). Man and the Biological World Read Books. pp. 169‚Äì170. . Retrieved on 2009-04-15. since they contain seeds and develop from the ovary of a (pea) flower. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus. P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 gram. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from a matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of early modern cuisine. The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the late Neolithic era of current Greece, Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from c. 4800‚Äì4400 BC in the Nile delta area, and from c. 3800‚Äì3600 BC in Upper Egypt. The pea was also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds are younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan c. 2000 BC; in Harappan civilization around modern-day Pakistan and western- and northwestern India in 2250‚Äì1750 BC. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, this legume crop appears in the Ganges Basin and southern India.Zohary, Daniel and Hopf, Maria (2000). Domestication of Plants in the Old World, third edition. Oxford: University Press. . pp. 105‚Äì107. Description A pea is a most commonly green, occasionally golden yellow, or infrequently purple pod-shaped vegetable, widely grown as a cool-season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches , with the plants growing best at temperatures of . They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler, high-altitude, tropical areas. Many cultivars reach maturity about 60 days after planting. Worldwide pea yield Peas have both low-growing and vining cultivars. The vining cultivars grow thin tendrils from leaves that coil around any available support and can climb to be 1‚Äì2 m high. A traditional approach to supporting climbing peas is to thrust branches pruned from trees or other woody plants upright into the soil, providing a lattice for the peas to climb. Branches used in this fashion are sometimes called pea brush. Metal fences, twine, or netting supported by a frame are used for the same purpose. In dense plantings, peas give each other some measure of mutual support. Pea plants can self-pollinate. History National Museum in Warsaw) In early times, peas were grown mostly for their dry seeds.Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, A History of Food, 2nd ed. 2009:38ff. From plants growing wild in the Mediterranean basin, constant selection since the Neolithic dawn of agriculturePeas have been found in the Neolithic site of Abeurador in the south of France (Toussaint-Samat). improved their yield. In the early 3rd century BC Theophrastus mentions peas among the legumes that are sown late in the winter because of their tenderness.Theophrastus, Historia Plantarum, VIII.i.4. In the first century AD, Columella mentions them in De re rustica, when Roman legionaries still gathered wild peas from the sandy soils of Numidia and Judea to supplement their rations. In the Middle Ages, field peas are constantly mentioned, as they were the staple that kept famine at bay, as Charles the Good, count of Flanders, noted explicitly in 1124.Edict quoted in Michel Pitrat and Claude Four, Histoires de l√©gumes: Des origines √† l'or√©e du XXIe si√®cle, \\"Le pois au cours des si√®cles\\" :353. Green \\"garden\\" peas, eaten immature and fresh, were an innovative luxury of Early Modern Europe. In England, the distinction between field peas and garden peas dates from the early 17th century: John Gerard and John Parkinson both mention garden peas. Sugar peas, which the French called mange-tout, for they were consumed pods and all, were introduced to France from the market gardens of Holland in the time of Henri IV, through the French ambassador. Green peas were introduced from Genoa to the court of Louis XIV of France in January 1660, with some staged fanfare; a hamper of them were presented before the King, and then were shelled by the Savoyan comte de Soissons, who had married a niece of Cardinal Mazarin; little dishes of peas were then presented to the King, the Queen, Cardinal Mazarin and Monsieur, the king's brother.An account is in Toussaint-Samat. Immediately established and grown for earliness warmed with manure and protected under glass, they were still a luxurious delicacy in 1696, when Mme de Maintenon and Mme de Sevign√© each reported that they were \\"a fashion, a fury\\".Quoted by Michel Pitrat and Claude Four. Modern split peas, with their indigestible skins rubbed off, are a development of the later 19th century. Modern culinary use Fresh peas for sale in their pods on a UK market stall Frozen green peas A basket of peas in pods In modern times peas are usually boiled or steamed, which breaks down the cell walls and makes the taste sweeter and the nutrients more bioavailable. Along with broad beans and lentils, these formed an important part of the diet of most people in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe during the Middle Ages. By the 17th and 18th centuries, it had become popular to eat peas \\"green\\", that is, while they are immature and right after they are picked. New cultivars of peas were developed by the English during this time, which became known as \\"garden\\" or \\"English\\" peas. The popularity of green peas spread to North America. Thomas Jefferson grew more than 30 cultivars of peas on his estate. With the invention of canning and freezing of foods, green peas became available year-round, and not just in the spring as before. Peas in fried rice Fresh peas are often eaten boiled and flavored with butter and/or spearmint as a side dish vegetable. Salt and pepper are also commonly added to peas when served. Fresh peas are also used in pot pies, salads and casseroles. Pod peas (snow peas and snap peas) are used in stir-fried dishes, particularly those in American Chinese cuisine. Pea pods do not keep well once picked, and if not used quickly, are best preserved by drying, canning or freezing within a few hours of harvest. In India, fresh peas are used in various dishes such as aloo matar (curried potatoes with peas) or matar paneer (paneer cheese with peas), though they can be substituted with frozen peas as well. Peas are also eaten raw, as they are sweet when fresh off the bush. Green Peas known as Hasiru Batani in Kannada are used to make curry and Gasi. Split peas are also used to make dal, particularly in Guyana, and Trinidad, where there is a significant population of Indians. Dried peas are often made into a soup or simply eaten on their own. In Japan, China, Taiwan and some Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia, peas are roasted and salted, and eaten as snacks. In the Philippines, peas, while still in their pods, are a common ingredient in viands and pansit. In the UK, dried yellow or green split peas are used to make pease pudding (or \\"pease porridge\\"), a traditional dish. In North America, a similarly traditional dish is split pea soup. Pea soup is eaten in many other parts of the world, including northern Europe, parts of middle Europe, Russia, Iran, Iraq and India. In Sweden it is called √§rtsoppa, and is eaten as a traditional Swedish food which predates the Viking Age. This food was made from a fast-growing pea that would mature in a short growing season. √Ñrtsoppa was especially popular among the poor, who traditionally only had one pot and everything was cooked together for a dinner using a tripod to hold the pot over the fire. In Chinese cuisine, the tender new growth [leaves and stem] dou miao (Ë±ÜËãó; d√≤u mi√°o) are commonly used in stir-fries. Much like picking the leaves for tea, the farmers pick the tips off of the pea plant. In Greece, Tunisia, Turkey, Cyprus, and other parts of the Mediterranean, peas are made into a stew with lamb and potatoes. In Hungary and Serbia, pea soup is often served with dumplings and spiced with hot paprika. In the United Kingdom, dried, rehydrated and mashed marrowfat peas, or cooked green split peas, known as mushy peas, are popular, originally in the north of England, but now ubiquitously, and especially as an accompaniment to fish and chips or meat pies, particularly in fish and chip shops. Sodium bicarbonate is sometimes added to soften the peas. In 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed the pea to be Britain's seventh favourite culinary vegetable. Processed peas are mature peas which have been dried, soaked and then heat treated (processed) to prevent spoilage‚Äîin the same manner as pasteurizing. Cooked peas are sometimes sold dried and coated with wasabi, salt, or other spices. In North America pea milk is produced and sold as an alternative to cow milk for a variety of reasons. Manufacturing frozen peas In order to freeze and preserve peas, they must first be grown, picked, and shelled. Usually, the more tender the peas are, the more likely that they will be used in the final product. The peas must be put through the process of freezing shortly after being picked so that they do not spoil too soon. Once the peas have been selected, they are placed in ice water and allowed to cool. After, they are sprayed with water to remove any residual dirt or dust that may remain on them. The next step is blanching. The peas are boiled for a few minutes to remove any enzymes that may shorten their shelf life. They are then cooled and removed from the water. The final step is the actual freezing to produce the final product. This step may vary considerably; some companies freeze their peas by air blast freezing, where the vegetables are put through a tunnel at high speeds and frozen by cold air. Finally, the peas are packaged and shipped out for retail sale. Grading Pea grading involves sorting peas by size, in which the smallest peas are graded as the highest quality for their tenderness.Sivasankar, B. (2002). Food Processing and Preservation. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. pp. 175-177. Brines may be used, in which peas are floated, from which their density can be determined. Nutritional value Peas are starchy, but high in fiber, protein, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin K, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc and lutein. Dry weight is about one-quarter protein and one-quarter sugar. Pea seed peptide fractions have less ability to scavenge free radicals than glutathione, but greater ability to chelate metals and inhibit linoleic acid oxidation. Varieties  Garden peas  There are many varieties (cultivars) of garden peas. Some of the most common varieties are listed here. PMR indicates some degree of powdery mildew resistance; afila types, also called semi-leafless, have clusters of tendrils instead of leaves. Unless otherwise noted these are so called dwarf varieties which grow to an average height of about 1m. Giving the vines support is recommended, but not required. Extra dwarf are suitable for container growing, reaching only about 25 cm. Tall varieties grow to about 2m with support required. * Alaska, 55 days (smooth seeded) * Tom Thumb / Half Pint, 55 days (heirloom, extra dwarf) * Thomas Laxton (heirloom) / Laxton's Progress / Progress #9, 60‚Äì65 days * Mr. Big, 60 days, 2000 AAS winner * Little Marvel, 63 days, 1934 AAS winner * Early Perfection, 65 days * Kelvedon Wonder, 65 days, 1997 RHS AGM winnerKelvedon Wonder is popular in the United Kingdom, but uncommon elsewhere. * Sabre, 65 days, PMR * Homesteader / Lincoln, 67 days (heirloom, known as Greenfeast in Australia and New Zealand) * Miragreen, 68 days (tall climber) * Serge, 68 days, PMR, afila * Wando, 68 days * Green Arrow, 70 days * Recruit, 70 days, PMR, afila * Tall Telephone / Alderman, 75 days (heirloom, tall climber)  Sugar peas  Sugar peas or edible-pod peas (, \\"eat-all pea\\"), lack the tough membrane inside the pod wall and have tender edible pods. There are two main types: *Snow peas have flat pods with thin pod walls. Pods and seeds are eaten when they are very young. *Snap peas or sugar snap peas have rounded pods with thick pod walls. Pods and seeds are eaten before maturity. The name \\"sugar pea\\" includes both types, and therefore it can be synonymous with either snow peas or snap peas in different dictionaries. Snow peas and snap peas both belong to Macrocarpon Group, a cultivar group based on the variety Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum Ser. named in 1825. It was described as having very compressed non-leathery edible pods in the original publication. The scientific name Pisum sativum var. saccharatum Ser. is often misused for snow peas. The variety under this name was described as having sub-leathery and compressed-terete pods and a French name of petit pois. The description is inconsistent with the appearance of snow peas, and therefore botanists have replace this name with Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum. Field peas Pod 'Blue Schokker' Field Pea Plant in Bloom The field pea is a type of pea sometimes called P. sativum subsp. arvense (L.) Asch. It is also known as dun (grey-brown) pea, Kapucijner pea, or Austrian winter pea, and is one of the oldest domesticated crops, cultivated for at least 7,000 years. Field peas are now grown in many countries for both human consumption and stockfeed. There are several cultivars and colors including blue, dun (brown), maple and white. This pea should not be confused with the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) which is sometimes called the \\"field pea\\" in warmer climates. It is a climbing annual legume with weak, viny, and relatively succulent stems. Vines often are 4 to 5 feet (120 to 150 cm) long, but when grown alone, field pea‚Äôs weak stems prevent it from growing more than 1.5 to 2 feet (45 to 60 cm) tall. Leaves have two leaflets and a tendril. Flowers are white, pink, or purple. Pods carry seeds that are large (4,000 seeds/lb), nearly spherical, and white, gray, green, or brown. The root system is relatively shallow and small, but well nodulated. The field pea is a cool-season legume crop that is grown on over 25 million acres worldwide. It has been an important grain legume crop for millennia, seeds showing domesticated characteristics dating from at least 7000 years ago have been found in archaeological sites around what is now Turkey. Field peas or \\"dry peas\\" are marketed as a dry, shelled product for either human or livestock food, unlike the garden pea, which is marketed as a fresh or canned vegetable. The major producing countries of field peas are Russia and China, followed by Canada, Europe, Australia and the United States. Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States raise over 4.5 million acres and are major exporters of peas. In 2002, there were approximately 300,000 acres of field peas grown in the United States. Pests and diseases A variety of diseases affect peas through a number of pathogens, including insects, viruses, bacteria and fungi. In particular, virus disease of peas has worldwide economic importance. Additionally, insects such as the pea leaf weevil (Sitona lineatus) can damage peas and other pod fruits. The pea leaf weevil is native to Europe, but has spread to other places such as Alberta, Canada. They are about ‚Äî long and are distinguishable by three light-coloured stripes running length-wise down the thorax. The weevil larvae feed on the root nodules of pea plants, which are essential to the plants' supply of nitrogen, and thus diminish leaf and stem growth. Adult weevils feed on the leaves and create a notched, \\"c-shaped\\" appearance on the outside of the leaves. Peas in science Pea flowers In the mid-19th century, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel's observations of pea pods led to the principles of Mendelian genetics, the foundation of modern genetics. He ended up growing and examining about 28,000 pea plants in the course of his experiments. Mendel chose peas for his experiments because he could grow them easily, develop pure-bred strains, protect them from cross-pollination, and control their pollination. Mendel cross-bred tall and dwarf pea plants, green and yellow peas, purple and white flowers, wrinkled and smooth peas, and a few other traits. He then observed the resulting offspring. In each of these cases, one trait is dominant and all the offspring, or Filial-1 (abbreviated F1) generation, showed the dominant trait. Then he crossed members of the F1 generation together and observed their offspring, the Filial-2 (abbreviated F2) generation. The F2 plants had the dominant trait in approximately a 3:1 ratio. Mendel reasoned that each parent had a 'vote' in the appearance of the offspring, and the non-dominant, or recessive, trait appeared only when it was inherited from both parents. He did further experiments that showed each trait is separately inherited. Unwittingly, Mendel had solved a major problem with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution: how new traits were preserved and not blended back into the population, a question Darwin himself did not answer. Mendel's work was published in an obscure Austrian journal and was not rediscovered until about 1900. Recently, extracts from garden pea have shown inhibitory activity on porcine pancreatic lipase in vitro. Genome The pea karyotype consists of seven chromosomes, five of which are acrocentric and two submetacentric. Despite its scientific popularity, its relatively large genome size (4.45Gb) made it challenging to sequence compared to other legumes such as Medicago truncatula and soybeans. The International Pea Genome Sequencing Consortium was formed to develop the first pea reference genome, and the draft assembly was officially announced in September 2019. It covers 88% of the genome (3.92Gb) and predicted 44,791 gene-coding sequences. The pea used for the assembly was the inbred French cultivar \\"Cam√©or\\". Peas in medicine Some people experience allergic reactions to peas, as well as lentils, with vicilin or convicilin as the usual allergens. Favism, or Fava- bean-ism, is a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that affects Jews, other Middle Eastern Semitic peoples and other descendants of the Mediterranean coastal regions. In this condition, the toxic reaction to eating most, if not all, beans is hemolytic anemia, and in severe cases the released circulating free hemoglobin causes acute kidney injury. Nitrogen-fixing ability Peas, like many legumes, contain symbiotic bacteria called Rhizobia within root nodules of their root systems. These bacteria have the special ability to fix nitrogen from atmospheric, molecular nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3). The chemical reaction is: :N_2 + 8H^+ + 8e^- \\\\to 2NH_3 + H_2 Ammonia is then converted to another form, ammonium (NH4+), usable by (some) plants by the following reaction: :NH_3 + H^+ \\\\to NH_4^+ The root nodules of peas and other legumes are sources of nitrogen that they can use to make amino acids, constituents of proteins. Hence, legumes are good sources of plant protein. When a pea plant dies in the field, for example following the harvest, all of its remaining nitrogen, incorporated into amino acids inside the remaining plant parts, is released back into the soil. In the soil, the amino acids are converted to nitrate (NO3‚àí), that is available to other plants, thereby serving as fertilizer for future crops.Postgate, J (1998). Nitrogen Fixation, 3rd Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK Etymology The term pea originates from the Latin word pisum, which is the latinisation of the Greek œÄŒØœÉŒøŒΩ (pison), neuter of œÄŒØœÉŒøœÇ (pisos) \\"pea\\".œÄŒØœÉŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library It was adopted into English as the noun pease (plural peasen), as in pease pudding. However, by analogy with other plurals ending in -s, speakers began construing pease as a plural and constructing the singular form by dropping the -s, giving the term pea. This process is known as back- formation. See also * Black-eyed pea * Black pea * Chickpea * Dixie lee pea * Sweet pea References Bibliography * European Association for Grain Legume Research (AEP).

Pedology is often seen as one of two main branches of soil inquiry, the other being edaphology which is traditionally more agronomically oriented and focuses on how soil properties influence plant communities (natural or cultivated). In studying the fundamental phenomenology of soils, e.g. soil formation (aka pedogenesis), pedologists pay particular attention to observing soil morphology and the geographic distributions of soils, and the placement of soil bodies into larger temporal and spatial contexts. In so doing, pedologists develop systems of soil classification, soil maps, and theories for characterizing temporal and spatial interrelations among soils . There are a few noteworthy sub- disciplines of pedology; namely pedometrics and soil geomorphology. Pedometrics focuses on the development of techniques for quantitative characterization of soils, especially for the purposes of mapping soil properties whereas soil geomorphology studies the interrelationships between geomorphic processes and soil formation. Overview Soil is not only a support for vegetation, but it is also the pedosphere, the locus of numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro- organisms, plants, animals) and its residues, the mineral material of the original and added rock, and its position in the landscape. During its formation and genesis, the soil profile slowly deepens and develops characteristic layers, called 'horizons', while a steady state balance is approached. Soil users (such as agronomists) showed initially little concern in the dynamics of soil. They saw it as medium whose chemical, physical and biological properties were useful for the services of agronomic productivity.Saltini Antonio, Storia delle scienze agrarie, 4 vols, Bologna 1984-89, , , , On the other hand, pedologists and geologists did not initially focus on the agronomic applications of the soil characteristics (edaphic properties) but upon its relation to the nature and history of landscapes. Today, there is an integration of the two disciplinary approaches as part of landscape and environmental sciences. Pedologists are now also interested in the practical applications of a good understanding of pedogenesis processes (the evolution and functioning of soils), like interpreting its environmental history and predicting consequences of changes in land use, while agronomists understand that the cultivated soil is a complex medium, often resulting from several thousands of years of evolution. They understand that the current balance is fragile and that only a thorough knowledge of its history makes it possible to ensure its sustainable use. Concepts Important pedological concepts include:Buol, Stanley W., F,D. Hole and R.W. McCracken. 1997. Soil Genesis and Classification, 4th ed. Iowa State Univ. Press, Ames Hole Francis D., J.B. Campbell. 1985. Soil landscape analysis. Totowa Rowman & Allanheld, 214 p. * Complexity in soil genesis is more common than simplicity. * Soils lie at the interface of Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soils requires some knowledge of meteorology, climatology, ecology, biology, hydrology, geomorphology, geology and many other earth sciences and natural sciences. * Contemporary soils carry imprints of pedogenic processes that were active in the past, although in many cases these imprints are difficult to observe or quantify. Thus, knowledge of paleoecology, palaeogeography, glacial geology and paleoclimatology is important for the recognition and understanding of soil genesis and constitute a basis for predicting future soil changes. * Five major, external factors of formation (climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time), and several smaller, less identifiable ones, drive pedogenic processes and create soil patterns. * Characteristics of soils and soil landscapes, e.g., the number, sizes, shapes and arrangements of soil bodies, each of which is characterized on the basis of soil horizons, degree of internal homogeneity, slope, aspect, landscape position, age and other properties and relationships, can be observed and measured. * Distinctive bioclimatic regimes or combinations of pedogenic processes produce distinctive soils. Thus, distinctive, observable morphological features, e.g., illuvial clay accumulation in B horizons, are produced by certain combinations of pedogenic processes operative over varying periods of time. * Pedogenic (soil-forming) processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils; these processes can proceed simultaneously. The resulting soil profile reflects the balance of these processes, present and past. * The geological Principle of Uniformitarianism applies to soils, i.e., pedogenic processes active in soils today have been operating for long periods of time, back to the time of appearance of organisms on the land surface. These processes do, however, have varying degrees of expression and intensity over space and time. * A succession of different soils may have developed, eroded and/or regressed at any particular site, as soil genetic factors and site factors, e.g., vegetation, sedimentation, geomorphology, change. * There are very few old soils (in a geological sense) because they can be destroyed or buried by geological events, or modified by shifts in climate by virtue of their vulnerable position at the surface of the earth. Little of the soil continuum dates back beyond the Tertiary period and most soils and land surfaces are no older than the Pleistocene Epoch. However, preserved/lithified soils (paleosols) are an almost ubiquitous feature in terrestrial (land-based) environments throughout most of geologic time. Since they record evidence of ancient climate change, they present immense utility in understanding climate evolution throughout geologic history. * Knowledge and understanding of the genesis of a soil is important in its classification and mapping. * Soil classification systems cannot be based entirely on perceptions of genesis, however, because genetic processes are seldom observed and because pedogenic processes change over time. * Knowledge of soil genesis is imperative and basic to soil use and management. Human influence on, or adjustment to, the factors and processes of soil formation can be best controlled and planned using knowledge about soil genesis. * Soils are natural clay factories (clay includes both clay mineral structures and particles less than 2 ¬µm in diameter). Shales worldwide are, to a considerable extent, simply soil clays that have been formed in the pedosphere and eroded and deposited in the ocean basins, to become lithified at a later date.

Originally published in the First Folio of 1623, where it was listed as a comedy, the play's first recorded performance occurred in 1604. The play's main themes include justice, \\"morality and mercy in Vienna\\", and the dichotomy between corruption and purity: \\"some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall\\". Mercy and virtue prevail, as the play does not end tragically, with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being exercised at the end of the production. While the play focuses on justice overall, the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral justice to temper strict civil justice: a number of the characters receive understanding and leniency, instead of the harsh punishment to which they, according to the law, could have been sentenced. Measure for Measure is often called one of Shakespeare's problem plays. It continues to be classified as a comedy, although its tone sometimes defies this classification. Characters * Isabella, a novice and sister to Claudio, * Mariana, betrothed to Angelo * Juliet, beloved of Claudio, pregnant with his child * Francisca, a nun. * Mistress Overdone, the manager of a thriving Viennese brothel * Vincentio, The Duke, who also appears disguised as Friar Lodowick * Angelo, the Deputy, who rules in the Duke's absence * Escalus, an ancient lord * Claudio, a young gentleman, brother to Isabella * Pompey Bum, a pimp who acquires customers for Mistress Overdone * Lucio, a \\"fantastic\\", a foppish young nobleman * Two gentlemen, friends to Lucio * The Provost, who runs the prison * Thomas and Peter, two friars * Elbow, a simple constable * Froth, a foolish gentleman of fourscore pound a year * Abhorson, an executioner * Barnardine, a dissolute prisoner * a Justice, friend of Escalus * Varrius (silent role), a friend of the Duke Synopsis Claudio and Isabella (1850) by William Holman Hunt Mariana (1851) by John Everett Millais Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. In the next scene, we find a group of soldiers on a Vienna street, expressing their hopes, in irreverent banter, that a war with Hungary is afoot, and that they will be able to take part. Mistress Overdone, the operator of a brothel frequented by these same soldiers, appears and tells them \\"there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all\\". She tells them that it is \\"Signor Claudio\\", and that \\"within these three days his head to be chopped off\\" as punishment for \\"getting Madam Julietta with child\\". Lucio, one of the soldiers who is later revealed to be Claudio's friend, is astonished at this news and rushes off. Then comes Pompey Bum, who works for Mistress Overdone as a pimp, but disguises his profession by describing himself as a mere 'tapster' (the equivalent of a modern bartender), avers to the imprisonment of Claudio and outrageously explains his crime as \\"Groping for trouts in a peculiar river\\". He then informs Mistress Overdone of Angelo's new proclamation, that \\"All houses [of prostitution] in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down\\". The brothels in the city \\"shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them\\". Mistress Overdone is distraught, as her business is in the suburbs. \\"What shall become of me?\\" she asks. Pompey replies with a characteristic mixture of bawdy humor and folk-wisdom, \\"fear you not: good counselors lack no clients: though you change your place, you need not change your trade... Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered\\". Pompey Bum, as he was portrayed by nineteenth-century actor John Liston Claudio is then led past Pompey and Overdone on his way to prison, and explains what has happened to him. Claudio married Juliet, but, as they have not completed all the strict legal technicalities, they were still considered to be unmarried when Juliet became pregnant. Angelo, as the interim ruler of the city, decides to enforce a law that fornication is punishable by death, so Claudio is sentenced to be executed. Claudio's friend, Lucio, visits Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novice nun, and asks her to intercede with Angelo on Claudio's behalf. Isabella obtains an audience with Angelo, and pleads for mercy for Claudio. Over the course of two scenes between Angelo and Isabella, it becomes clear that he lusts after her, and he eventually offers her a deal: Angelo will spare Claudio's life if Isabella yields him her virginity. Isabella refuses, but when she threatens to publicly expose his lechery, he tells her that no one will believe her because his reputation is too austere. She then visits her brother in prison and counsels him to prepare himself for death. Claudio desperately begs Isabella to save his life, but Isabella refuses. She believes that it would be wrong for her to sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio, if his entreaties were to convince her to lose her virtue) to save Claudio's transient earthly life. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to secretly view the city's affairs, especially the effects of Angelo's strict enforcement of the law. In his guise as a friar, he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions: Mariana (1888) by Valentine Cameron Prinsep # First, a \\"bed trick\\" is arranged. Angelo has previously refused to fulfill the betrothal binding him to Mariana, because her dowry had been lost at sea. Isabella sends word to Angelo that she has decided to submit to him, but making it a condition of their meeting that it occurs in perfect darkness and in silence. Mariana agrees to take Isabella's place, and she has sex with Angelo, although he continues to believe he has enjoyed Isabella. (In some interpretations of the law, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. This same interpretation would also make Claudio's and Juliet's marriage legal.) # After having sex with Mariana (whom he believes is Isabella), Angelo goes back on his word, sending a message to the prison that he wishes to see Claudio's head, necessitating the \\"head trick\\". The Duke first attempts to arrange the execution of another prisoner whose head can be sent instead of Claudio's. However, the villain Barnardine refuses to be executed in his drunken state. As luck would have it, a pirate named Ragozine, of similar appearance to Claudio, has recently died of a fever, so his head is sent to Angelo instead. This main plot concludes with the 'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself. Isabella and Mariana publicly petition him, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As the scene develops, it appears that Friar Lodowick will be blamed for the 'false' accusations leveled against Angelo. The Duke leaves Angelo to judge the cause against Lodowick, but returns in disguise moments later when Lodowick is summoned. Eventually, the friar is revealed to be the Duke, thereby exposing Angelo as a liar and Isabella and Mariana as truthful. He proposes that Angelo be executed but first compels him to marry Mariana‚Äîwith his estate going to Mariana as her new dowry, \\"to buy you a better husband\\". Mariana pleads for Angelo's life, even enlisting the aid of Isabella (who is not yet aware her brother Claudio is still living). The Duke pretends not to heed the women's petition, and‚Äîonly after revealing that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed‚Äîrelents. The Duke then proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her silent acceptance of his proposal is the most common in performance. This is one of the \\"open silences\\" of the play. A sub-plot concerns Claudio's friend Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, and in the last act slanders the friar to the duke, providing opportunities for comic consternation on Vincentio's part and landing Lucio in trouble when it is revealed that the duke and the friar are one and the same. Lucio's punishment is to be forced into marrying Kate Keepdown, a prostitute whom he had impregnated and abandoned. Sources William Hamilton of Isabella appealing to Angelo The play draws on two distinct sources. The original is \\"The Story of Epitia\\", a story from Cinthio's Gli Hecatommithi, first published in 1565.N. W. Bawcutt (ed.), Measure for Measure (Oxford, 1991), p. 17 Shakespeare was familiar with this book as it contains the original source for Shakespeare's Othello. Cinthio also published the same story in a play version with some small differences, of which Shakespeare may or may not have been aware. The original story is an unmitigated tragedy in that Isabella's counterpart is forced to sleep with Angelo's counterpart, and her brother is still killed. The other main source for the play is George Whetstone's 1578 lengthy two-part closet drama Promos and Cassandra, which itself is sourced from Cinthio. Whetstone adapted Cinthio's story by adding the comic elements and the bed and head tricks. The title of the play, which also appears as a line of dialogue, is commonly thought to be a biblical reference to the Sermon on the Mount : Peter Meilaender has argued that Measure for Measure is largely based on biblical references, focusing on the themes of sin, restraint, mercy, and rebirth. Date, text and authorship Measure for Measure is believed to have been written in 1603 or 1604. The play was first published in 1623 in the First Folio. In their book Shakespeare Reshaped, 1606‚Äì1623, Gary Taylor and John Jowett argue that part of the text of Measure that survives today is not in its original form, but rather the product of a revision after Shakespeare's death by Thomas Middleton. They present stylistic evidence that patches of writing are by Middleton, and argue that Middleton changed the setting to Vienna from the original Italy.Gary Taylor and John Jowett, Shakespeare Reshaped, 1606‚Äì1623 (Oxford University Press, 1993). See also \\"Shakespeare's Mediterranean Measure for Measure\\", in Shakespeare and the Mediterranean: The Selected Proceedings of the International Shakespeare Association World Congress, Valencia, 2001, ed. Tom Clayton, Susan Brock, and Vicente For√©s (Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2004), 243‚Äì269. Braunmuller and Watson summarize the case for Middleton, suggesting it should be seen as \\"an intriguing hypothesis rather than a fully proven attribution\\". David Bevington suggests an alternate theory that the text can be stylistically credited to the professional scrivener Ralph Crane, who is usually credited for some of the better and unchanged texts in the Folio like that of The Tempest. It is generally accepted that a garbled sentence during the Duke's opening speech (lines 8‚Äì9 in most editions) represents a place where a line has been lost, possibly due to a printer's error. Because the folio is the only source, there is no possibility of recovering it. Performance history Isabella (1888) by Francis William TophamThe earliest recorded performance of Measure for Measure took place on St. Stephen's night, 26 December 1604. During the Restoration, Measure was one of many Shakespearean plays adapted to the tastes of a new audience. Sir William Davenant inserted Benedick and Beatrice from Much Ado About Nothing into his adaptation, called The Law Against Lovers. Samuel Pepys saw the hybrid play on 18 February 1662; he describes it in his Diary as \\"a good play, and well performed\\"‚Äîhe was especially impressed by the singing and dancing of the young actress who played Viola, Beatrice's sister (Davenant's creation). Davenant rehabilitated Angelo, who is now only testing Isabella's chastity; the play ends with a triple marriage. This, among the earliest of Restoration adaptations, appears not to have succeeded on stage. Charles Gildon returned to Shakespeare's text in a 1699 production at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Gildon's adaptation, entitled Beauty the Best Advocate, removes all of the low-comic characters. Moreover, by making both Angelo and Mariana, and Claudio and Juliet, secretly married, he eliminates almost all of the illicit sexuality that is so central to Shakespeare's play. In addition, he integrates into the play scenes from Henry Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas, which Angelo watches sporadically throughout the play. Gildon also offers a partly facetious epilogue, spoken by Shakespeare's ghost, who complains of the constant revisions of his work. Like Davenant's, Gildon's version did not gain currency and was not revived. John Rich presented a version closer to Shakespeare's original in 1720.F. E. Halliday (1964). A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore: Penguin, pp. 273, 309‚Äì310. In late Victorian times the subject matter of the play was deemed controversial, and there was an outcry when Adelaide Neilson appeared as Isabella in the 1870s.Times review 23 February 1906 The Oxford University Dramatic Society found it necessary to edit it when staging it in February 1906, with Gervais Rentoul as Angelo and Maud Hoffman as Isabella, and the same text was used when Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton staged it at the Adelphi Theatre in the following month.Times review 21 March 1906 William Poel produced the play in 1893 at the Royalty and in 1908 at the Gaiety in Manchester, with himself as Angelo. In line with his other Elizabethan performances, these used the uncut text of Shakespeare's original with only minimal alterations. The use of an unlocalised stage lacking scenery, and the swift, musical delivery of dramatic speech set the standard for the rapidity and continuity shown in modern productions. Poel's work also marked the first determined attempt by a producer to give a modern psychological or theological reading of both the characters and the overall message of the play.S. Nagarajan (1998). Measure for Measure, New York, Penguin, pp. 181‚Äì183. Notable 20th century productions of Measure for Measure include Charles Laughton as Angelo at the Old Vic Theatre in 1933, and Peter Brook's 1950 staging at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre with John Gielgud as Angelo and Barbara Jefford as Isabella. In 1957 John Houseman and Jack Landau directed a production at the Phoenix Theatre in New York City that featured Jerry Stiller and Richard Waring. The play has only once been produced on Broadway, in a 1973 production also directed by Houseman that featured David Ogden Stiers as Vincentio, Kevin Kline in the small role of Friar Peter, and Patti Lupone in two small roles. In 1976, there was a New York Shakespeare Festival production featuring Sam Waterston as the Duke, Meryl Streep as Isabella, John Cazale as Angelo, Lenny Baker as Lucio, Jeffrey Tambor as Elbow, and Judith Light as Francisca.Foote, Timothy, \\"License in the Park\\", Time, 23 August 1976, p. 57 In April 1981 director Michael Rudman presented a version with an all-black cast at London's National Theatre. Rudman re-staged his concept at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1993, starring Kevin Kline as the Duke with Andr√© Braugher as Angelo and Lisa Gay Hamilton as Isabella. Between 2013 and 2017, theatre company Cheek by Jowl staged a Russian-language version of the play in association with the Pushkin Theatre, Moscow, and the Barbican Centre, London. The production was directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod.

A. (1997). Glossary of Geology (4. ed.). Alexandria, Virginia: American Geological Institute. p 604. Sometimes terms which refer to branches of soil science, such as pedology (formation, chemistry, morphology, and classification of soil) and edaphology (how soils interact with living things, especially plants), are used as if synonymous with soil science. The diversity of names associated with this discipline is related to the various associations concerned. Indeed, engineers, agronomists, chemists, geologists, physical geographers, ecologists, biologists, microbiologists, silviculturists, sanitarians, archaeologists, and specialists in regional planning, all contribute to further knowledge of soils and the advancement of the soil sciences. Soil scientists have raised concerns about how to preserve soil and arable land in a world with a growing population, possible future water crisis, increasing per capita food consumption, and land degradation. Fields of study Soil occupies the pedosphere, one of Earth's spheres that the geosciences use to organize the Earth conceptually. This is the conceptual perspective of pedology and edaphology, the two main branches of soil science. Pedology is the study of soil in its natural setting. Edaphology is the study of soil in relation to soil-dependent uses. Both branches apply a combination of soil physics, soil chemistry, and soil biology. Due to the numerous interactions between the biosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere that are hosted within the pedosphere, more integrated, less soil-centric concepts are also valuable. Many concepts essential to understanding soil come from individuals not identifiable strictly as soil scientists. This highlights the interdisciplinary nature of soil concepts. Research Dependence on and curiosity about soil, exploring the diversity and dynamics of this resource continues to yield fresh discoveries and insights. New avenues of soil research are compelled by a need to understand soil in the context of climate change, greenhouse gases, and carbon sequestration. Interest in maintaining the planet's biodiversity and in exploring past cultures has also stimulated renewed interest in achieving a more refined understanding of soil. Mapping Most empirical knowledge of soil in nature comes from soil survey efforts. Soil survey, or soil mapping, is the process of determining the soil types or other properties of the soil cover over a landscape, and mapping them for others to understand and use. It relies heavily on distinguishing the individual influences of the five classic soil forming factors. This effort draws upon geomorphology, physical geography, and analysis of vegetation and land-use patterns. Primary data for the soil survey are acquired by field sampling and supported by remote sensing. Classification Map of global soil regions from the USDA As of 2006, the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, via its Land & Water Development division, is the pre-eminent soil classification system. It replaces the previous FAO soil classification. The WRB borrows from modern soil classification concepts, including USDA soil taxonomy. The classification is based mainly on soil morphology as an expression pedogenesis. A major difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate is not part of the system, except insofar as climate influences soil profile characteristics. Many other classification schemes exist, including vernacular systems. The structure in vernacular systems are either nominal, giving unique names to soils or landscapes, or descriptive, naming soils by their characteristics such as red, hot, fat, or sandy. Soils are distinguished by obvious characteristics, such as physical appearance (e.g., color, texture, landscape position), performance (e.g., production capability, flooding), and accompanying vegetation. A vernacular distinction familiar to many is classifying texture as heavy or light. Light soil content and better structure, take less effort to turn and cultivate. Contrary to popular belief, light soils do not weigh less than heavy soils on an air dry basis nor do they have more porosity. History The earliest known soil classification system comes from China, appearing in the book Yu Gong (5th century BCE), where the soil was divided into three categories and nine classes, depending on its color, texture and hydrology.Arnold, R. et al. (2009) A Handbook of Soil Terminology, Correlation and Classification Earthscan, London, England. Contemporaries Friedrich Albert Fallou, the German founder of modern soil science, and Vasily Dokuchaev, the Russian founder of modern soil science, are both credited with being among the first to identify soil as a resource whose distinctness and complexity deserved to be separated conceptually from geology and crop production and treated as a whole. As a founding father of soil science Fallou has primacy in time. Fallou was working on the origins of soil before Dokuchaev was born, however Dokuchaev's work was more extensive and is considered to be the more significant to modern soil theory than Fallou's. > Previously, soil had been considered a product of chemical transformations > of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious elements. > Soil and bedrock were in fact equated.

According to him, soil should be called the > \\"daily\\" or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are > changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of > living and dead organisms.Krasilnikov, N.A. (1958) Soil Microorganisms and > Higher Plants A 1914 encyclopedic definition: \\"the different forms of earth on the surface of the rocks, formed by the breaking down or weathering of rocks\\".Wikisource:The New Student's Reference Work/4-0310 serves to illustrate the historic view of soil which persisted from the 19th century. Dokuchaev's late 19th century soil concept developed in the 20th century to one of soil as earthy material that has been altered by living processes.. A corollary concept is that soil without a living component is simply a part of earth's outer layer. Further refinement of the soil concept is occurring in view of an appreciation of energy transport and transformation within soil. The term is popularly applied to the material on the surface of the Earth's moon and Mars, a usage acceptable within a portion of the scientific community. Accurate to this modern understanding of soil is Nikiforoff's 1959 definition of soil as the \\"excited skin of the sub aerial part of the earth's crust\\". Areas of practice Academically, soil scientists tend to be drawn to one of five areas of specialization: microbiology, pedology, edaphology, physics, or chemistry. Yet the work specifics are very much dictated by the challenges facing our civilization's desire to sustain the land that supports it, and the distinctions between the sub-disciplines of soil science often blur in the process. Soil science professionals commonly stay current in soil chemistry, soil physics, soil microbiology, pedology, and applied soil science in related disciplines One interesting effort drawing in soil scientists in the USA is the Soil Quality Initiative. Central to the Soil Quality Initiative is developing indices of soil health and then monitoring them in a way that gives us long term (decade-to-decade) feedback on our performance as stewards of the planet. The effort includes understanding the functions of soil microbiotic crusts and exploring the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon in soil organic matter. The concept of soil quality, however, has not been without its share of controversy and criticism, including critiques by Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug and World Food Prize Winner Pedro Sanchez. A more traditional role for soil scientists has been to map soils. Most every area in the United States now has a published soil survey, which includes interpretive tables as to how soil properties support or limit activities and uses. An internationally accepted soil taxonomy allows uniform communication of soil characteristics and soil functions. National and international soil survey efforts have given the profession unique insights into landscape scale functions. The landscape functions that soil scientists are called upon to address in the field seem to fall roughly into six areas: * Land-based treatment of wastes Septic system Manure Municipal biosolids Food and fiber processing waste * Identification and protection of environmentally critical areas Sensitive and unstable soils Wetlands Unique soil situations that support valuable habitat, and ecosystem diversity * Management for optimum land productivity Silviculture Agronomy *Nutrient management *Water management Native vegetation Grazing * Management for optimum water quality Stormwater management Sediment and erosion control * Remediation and restoration of damaged lands Mine reclamation Flood and storm damage Contamination * Sustainability of desired uses Soil conservation There are also practical applications of soil science that might not be apparent from looking at a published soil survey. * Radiometric dating: specifically a knowledge of local pedology is used to date prior activity at the site Stratification (archeology) where soil formation processes and preservative qualities can inform the study of archaeological sites Geological phenomena *Landslides *Active faults * Altering soils to achieve new uses Vitrification to contain radioactive wastes Enhancing soil microbial capabilities in degrading contaminants (bioremediation).

Depression storage capacity, along with infiltration capacity, is one of the main factors involved in Horton overland flow, whereby water volume surpasses both infiltration and depression storage capacity and begins to flow horizontally across land, possibly leading to flooding and soil erosion. The study of land's depression storage capacity is important in the fields of geology, ecology, and especially hydrology.

The importance of bacteria in the cycle is immediately recognized as being a key element in the cycle, providing different forms of nitrogen compounds able to be assimilated by higher organisms The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is atmosphere nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle. Human modification of the global nitrogen cycle can negatively affect the natural environment system and also human health. A simple diagram of the nitrogen cycle. The blue boxes represent stores of nitrogen, the green writing is for processes that occur to move the nitrogen from one place to another and the red writing are all the bacteria involved Classical representation of the nitrogen cycle  Processes  Nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, ammonium (NH), nitrite (NO), nitrate (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used by plants. The diagram alongside shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.  Nitrogen fixation  The conversion of nitrogen gas (N2) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation. Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \\"fixed\\", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5 and 10 billion kg per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free- living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.  Assimilation  Plants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil by their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship. While many animals, fungi, and other heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources. Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.  Ammonification  When a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is organic. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into ammonium (NH), a process called ammonification or mineralization. Enzymes involved are: * GS: Gln Synthetase (Cytosolic & Plastic) * GOGAT: Glu 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (Ferredoxin & NADH-dependent) * GDH: Glu Dehydrogenase:  Minor Role in ammonium assimilation.  Important in amino acid catabolism. ANAMMOX is anaerobic ammonium oxidation, DNRA is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and COMMAMOX is complete ammonium oxidation.  Nitrification  The conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria such as the Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites () into nitrates (). It is important for the ammonia () to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants. Due to their very high solubility and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome. Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.  Denitrification  Denitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Paracoccus, under anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively (meaning optionally) anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.  Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium  Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an anaerobic respiration process. Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to nitrite, then ammonium (NO3‚àí‚ÜíNO2‚àí‚ÜíNH4+). Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.  Anaerobic ammonia oxidation  In this biological process, nitrite and ammonia are converted directly into molecular nitrogen (N2) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans. The balanced formula for this \\"anammox\\" chemical reaction is: NH + NO ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ 2H2O (ŒîG¬∞ = ).  Other processes  Though nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most ecosystems, in areas with nitrogen-rich bedrock, the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source. Nitrate reduction is also part of the iron cycle, under anoxic conditions Fe(II) can donate an electron to NO3‚àí and is oxidized to Fe(III) while NO3‚àí is reduced to NO2‚àí, N2O, N2, and NH4+ depending on the conditions and microbial species involved.  Marine nitrogen cycle  A schematic representing the Marine Nitrogen Cycle The nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification. Ammonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (nitrate reductase). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include most Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus that can only take up nitrogen as ammonium. The nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in oligotrophic waters year- round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production. The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well. Nitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and chlorophyll levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as HNLC (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean. Ammonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50‚Äì80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column. The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate. Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.  New vs. regenerated nitrogen  Nitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer. The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production. New production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest. Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.  Human influences on the nitrogen cycle  Nitrogen fertilizer application Nitrogen in manure production As a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber‚ÄìBosch process in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms. In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest. Generation of Nr, reactive nitrogen, has increased over 10 fold in the past century due to global industrialisation. This form of nitrogen follows a cascade through the biosphere via a variety of mechanisms, and is accumulating as the rate of its generation is greater than the rate of denitrification. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources. N2O has deleterious effects in the stratosphere, where it breaks down and acts as a catalyst in the destruction of atmospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas and is currently the third largest contributor to global warming, after carbon dioxide and methane. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet. Ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an aerosol, decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in nitric acid (HNO3) that produces acid rain. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems. The very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature combustion has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NOx. Ammonia and nitrous oxides actively alter atmospheric chemistry. They are precursors of tropospheric (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to smog and acid rain, damages plants and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems. Ecosystem processes can increase with nitrogen fertilization, but anthropogenic input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans. Decreases in biodiversity can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species- diverse heathlands.  Consequence of human modification of the nitrogen cycle   Impacts on natural systems  Increasing levels of nitrogen deposition are shown to have a number of negative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Nitrogen gases and aerosols can be directly toxic to certain plant species, affecting the aboveground physiology and growth of plants near large point sources of nitrogen pollution. Changes to plant species may also occur, as accumulation of nitrogen compounds increase its availability in a given ecosystem, eventually changing the species composition, plant diversity, and nitrogen cycling. Ammonia and ammonium - two reduced forms of nitrogen - can be detrimental over time due to an increased toxicity toward sensitive species of plants, particularly those that are accustomed to using nitrate as their source of nitrogen, causing poor development of their roots and shoots. Increased nitrogen deposition also leads to soil acidification, which increases base cation leaching in the soil and amounts of aluminum and other potentially toxic metals, along with decreasing the amount of nitrification occurring and increasing plant-derived litter. Due to the ongoing changes caused by high nitrogen deposition, an environment's susceptibility to ecological stress and disturbance - such as pests and pathogens - may increase, thus making it less resilient to situations that otherwise would have little impact to its long-term vitality. Additional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; eutrophication of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans. Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic dead zones near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced hypoxia. The New York Adirondack Lakes, Catskills, Hudson Highlands, Rensselaer Plateau and parts of Long Island display the impact of nitric acid rain deposition, resulting in the killing of fish and many other aquatic species. Ammonia (NH3) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via aeration prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.  Impacts on human health: nitrate accumulation in drinking water  Leakage of Nr (reactive nitrogen) from human activities can cause nitrate accumulation in the natural water environment, which can create harmful impacts on human health. Excessive use of N-fertilizer in agriculture has been one of the major sources of nitrate pollution in groundwater and surface water. Due to its high solubility and low retention by soil, nitrate can easily escape from the subsoil layer to the groundwater, causing nitrate pollution. Some other non-point sources for nitrate pollution in groundwater are originated from livestock feeding, animal and human contamination and municipal and industrial waste. Since groundwater often serves as the primary domestic water supply, nitrate pollution can be extended from groundwater to surface and drinking water in the process of potable water production, especially for small community water supplies, where poorly regulated and unsanitary waters are used. The WHO standard for drinking water is 50 mg NO3‚àí L‚àí1 for short-term exposure, and for 3 mg NO3‚àí L‚àí1chronic effects. Once it enters human body, nitrate can react with organic compounds through nitrosation reactions in the stomach to form nitrosamines and nitrosamides, which are involved in some types of cancers (e.g., oral cancer and gastric cancer).  Impacts on human health: air quality  Human activities have also dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle via production of nitrogenous gases, associated with the global atmospheric nitrogen pollution. There are multiple sources of atmospheric reactive nitrogen (Nr) fluxes. Agricultural sources of reactive nitrogen can produce atmospheric emission of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Combustion processes in energy production, transportation and industry can also result in the formation of new reactive nitrogen via the emission of NOx, an unintentional waste product. When those reactive nitrogens are released to the lower atmosphere, they can induce the formation of smog, particulate matter and aerosols, all of which are major contributors to adverse health effects on human health from air pollution. In the atmosphere, NO2 can be oxidized to nitric acid (HNO3), and it can further react with NH3 to form ammonium nitrate, which facilitates the formation of particular nitrate. Moreover, NH3 can react with other acid gases (sulfuric and hydrochloric acids) to form ammonium-containing particles, which are the precursors for the secondary organic aerosol particles in photochemical smog.

This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents, that is, water, ice (glaciers), snow, air (wind), plants, animals, and humans. In accordance with these agents, erosion is sometimes divided into water erosion, glacial erosion, snow erosion, wind (aeolean) erosion, zoogenic erosion and anthropogenic erosion. Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at an alarming rate causing a serious loss of topsoil. The loss of soil from farmland may be reflected in reduced crop production potential, lower surface water quality and damaged drainage networks.Soil erosion could also cause sinkholes. Human activities have increased by 10‚Äì50 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \\"on-site\\" and \\"off-site\\" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases, the eventual end result is desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide. Intensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However, there are many prevention and remediation practices that can curtail or limit erosion of vulnerable soils. Physical processes Rainfall and surface runoff Soil and water being splashed by the impact of a single raindrop. Rainfall, and the surface runoff which may result from rainfall, produces four main types of soil erosion: splash erosion, sheet erosion, rill erosion, and gully erosion. Splash erosion is generally seen as the first and least severe stage in the soil erosion process, which is followed by sheet erosion, then rill erosion and finally gully erosion (the most severe of the four). In splash erosion, the impact of a falling raindrop creates a small crater in the soil,See figure 4 in ejecting soil particles. The distance these soil particles travel can be as much as 0.6 m (two feet) vertically and 1.5 m (five feet) horizontally on level ground. If the soil is saturated, or if the rainfall rate is greater than the rate at which water can infiltrate into the soil, surface runoff occurs. If the runoff has sufficient flow energy, it will transport loosened soil particles (sediment) down the slope. Sheet erosion is the transport of loosened soil particles by overland flow. A spoil tip covered in rills and gullies due to erosion processes caused by rainfall: Rummu, Estonia Rill erosion refers to the development of small, ephemeral concentrated flow paths which function as both sediment source and sediment delivery systems for erosion on hillslopes. Generally, where water erosion rates on disturbed upland areas are greatest, rills are active. Flow depths in rills are typically of the order of a few centimeters (about an inch) or less and along- channel slopes may be quite steep. This means that rills exhibit hydraulic physics very different from water flowing through the deeper wider channels of streams and rivers. Gully erosion occurs when runoff water accumulates and rapidly flows in narrow channels during or immediately after heavy rains or melting snow, removing soil to a considerable depth. Rivers and streams Dobbingstone Burn, Scotland‚ÄîThis photo illustrates two different types of erosion affecting the same place. Valley erosion is occurring due to the flow of the stream, and the boulders and stones (and much of the soil) that are lying on the edges are glacial till that was left behind as ice age glaciers flowed over the terrain. Valley or stream erosion occurs with continued water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both downward, deepening the valley, and headward, extending the valley into the hillside, creating head cuts and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical V cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some base level is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood, when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, pebbles and boulders can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as traction.Ritter, Michael E. (2006) \\"Geologic Work of Streams\\" The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography University of Wisconsin, Bank erosion is the wearing away of the banks of a stream or river. This is distinguished from changes on the bed of the watercourse, which is referred to as scour. Erosion and changes in the form of river banks may be measured by inserting metal rods into the bank and marking the position of the bank surface along the rods at different times. Thermal erosion is the result of melting and weakening permafrost due to moving water. It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid river channel migration observed in the Lena River of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented non-cohesive materials. Much of this erosion occurs as the weakened banks fail in large slumps. Thermal erosion also affects the Arctic coast, where wave action and near-shore temperatures combine to undercut permafrost bluffs along the shoreline and cause them to fail. Annual erosion rates along a segment of the Beaufort Sea shoreline averaged per year from 1955 to 2002. Floods At extremely high flows, kolks, or vortices are formed by large volumes of rapidly rushing water. Kolks cause extreme local erosion, plucking bedrock and creating pothole-type geographical features called Rock-cut basins. Examples can be seen in the flood regions result from glacial Lake Missoula, which created the channeled scablands in the Columbia Basin region of eastern Washington.See, for example: Wind erosion √Årbol de Piedra, a rock formation in the Altiplano, Bolivia sculpted by wind erosion. Wind erosion is a major geomorphological force, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also a major source of land degradation, evaporation, desertification, harmful airborne dust, and crop damage‚Äîespecially after being increased far above natural rates by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture. Wind erosion is of two primary varieties: deflation, where the wind picks up and carries away loose particles; and abrasion, where surfaces are worn down as they are struck by airborne particles carried by wind. Deflation is divided into three categories: (1) surface creep, where larger, heavier particles slide or roll along the ground; (2) saltation, where particles are lifted a short height into the air, and bounce and saltate across the surface of the soil; and (3) suspension, where very small and light particles are lifted into the air by the wind, and are often carried for long distances. Saltation is responsible for the majority (50‚Äì70%) of wind erosion, followed by suspension (30‚Äì40%), and then surface creep (5‚Äì25%). Silty soils tend to be the most affected by wind erosion; silt particles are relatively easily detached and carried away.Jefferson,I.F.,Smalley>I.J. 1999. Saltating sand erodes metastable loess ground: events in the impact zone. https://infosys.ars.usda.gov/WindErosion/Symposium/proceedings/jefferso.pdf Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years. Mass movement Wadi in Makhtesh Ramon, Israel, showing gravity collapse erosion on its banks. Mass movement is the downward and outward movement of rock and sediments on a sloped surface, mainly due to the force of gravity. Mass movement is an important part of the erosional process, and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas. It moves material from higher elevations to lower elevations where other eroding agents such as streams and glaciers can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations. Mass-movement processes are always occurring continuously on all slopes; some mass-movement processes act very slowly; others occur very suddenly, often with disastrous results. Any perceptible down-slope movement of rock or sediment is often referred to in general terms as a landslide. However, landslides can be classified in a much more detailed way that reflects the mechanisms responsible for the movement and the velocity at which the movement occurs. One of the visible topographical manifestations of a very slow form of such activity is a scree slope. Slumping happens on steep hillsides, occurring along distinct fracture zones, often within materials like clay that, once released, may move quite rapidly downhill. They will often show a spoon-shaped isostatic depression, in which the material has begun to slide downhill. In some cases, the slump is caused by water beneath the slope weakening it. In many cases it is simply the result of poor engineering along highways where it is a regular occurrence. Surface creep is the slow movement of soil and rock debris by gravity which is usually not perceptible except through extended observation. However, the term can also describe the rolling of dislodged soil particles in diameter by wind along the soil surface. Factors affecting soil erosion Climate The amount and intensity of precipitation is the main climatic factor governing soil erosion by water. The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by vegetation. This might be during periods when agricultural activities leave the soil bare, or in semi- arid regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high- intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion. In some areas of the world (e.g. the mid-western USA), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity, with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of rain drops is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater kinetic energy, and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops. In other regions of the world (e.g. western Europe), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of stratiform rainfall falling onto previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water.Boardman, John & Poesen, Jean. Soil Erosion in Europe. John Wiley & Sons. Soil structure and composition Erosional gully in unconsolidated Dead Sea (Israel) sediments along the southwestern shore. This gully was excavated by floods from the Judean Mountains in less than a year. The composition, moisture, and compaction of soil are all major factors in determining the erosivity of rainfall. Sediments containing more clay tend to be more resistant to erosion than those with sand or silt, because the clay helps bind soil particles together. Soil containing high levels of organic materials are often more resistant to erosion, because the organic materials coagulate soil colloids and create a stronger, more stable soil structure. The amount of water present in the soil before the precipitation also plays an important role, because it sets limits on the amount of water that can be absorbed by the soil (and hence prevented from flowing on the surface as erosive runoff). Wet, saturated soils will not be able to absorb as much rain water, leading to higher levels of surface runoff and thus higher erosivity for a given volume of rainfall. Soil compaction also affects the permeability of the soil to water, and hence the amount of water that flows away as runoff. More compacted soils will have a larger amount of surface runoff than less compacted soils. Vegetative cover Vegetation acts as an interface between the atmosphere and the soil. It increases the permeability of the soil to rainwater, thus decreasing runoff. It shelters the soil from winds, which results in decreased wind erosion, as well as advantageous changes in microclimate. The roots of the plants bind the soil together, and interweave with other roots, forming a more solid mass that is less susceptible to both water and wind erosion. The removal of vegetation increases the rate of surface erosion. Topography The topography of the land determines the velocity at which surface runoff will flow, which in turn determines the erosivity of the runoff. Longer, steeper slopes (especially those without adequate vegetative cover) are more susceptible to very high rates of erosion during heavy rains than shorter, less steep slopes. Steeper terrain is also more prone to mudslides, landslides, and other forms of gravitational erosion processes. Human activities that increase soil erosion Agricultural practices Tilled farmland such as this is very susceptible to erosion from rainfall, due to the destruction of vegetative cover and the loosening of the soil during plowing. Unsustainable agricultural practices increase rates of erosion by one to two orders of magnitude over the natural rate and far exceed replacement by soil production. The tillage of agricultural lands, which breaks up soil into finer particles, is one of the primary factors. The problem has been exacerbated in modern times, due to mechanized agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by water erosion. Others include mono-cropping, farming on steep slopes, pesticide and chemical fertilizer usage (which kill organisms that bind soil together), row-cropping, and the use of surface irrigation. A complex overall situation with respect to defining nutrient losses from soils, could arise as a result of the size selective nature of soil erosion events. Loss of total phosphorus, for instance, in the finer eroded fraction is greater relative to the whole soil. Extrapolating this evidence to predict subsequent behaviour within receiving aquatic systems, the reason is that this more easily transported material may support a lower solution P concentration compared to coarser sized fractions. Tillage also increases wind erosion rates, by dehydrating the soil and breaking it up into smaller particles that can be picked up by the wind. Exacerbating this is the fact that most of the trees are generally removed from agricultural fields, allowing winds to have long, open runs to travel over at higher speeds. Heavy grazing reduces vegetative cover and causes severe soil compaction, both of which increase erosion rates. Deforestation In this clearcut, almost all of the vegetation has been stripped from surface of steep slopes, in an area with very heavy rains. Severe erosion occurs in cases such as this, causing stream sedimentation and the loss of nutrient rich topsoil. In an undisturbed forest, the mineral soil is protected by a layer of leaf litter and an humus that cover the forest floor. These two layers form a protective mat over the soil that absorbs the impact of rain drops. They are porous and highly permeable to rainfall, and allow rainwater to slow percolate into the soil below, instead of flowing over the surface as runoff. The roots of the trees and plantsThe mycelia of forest fungi also play a major role in binding soil particles together. hold together soil particles, preventing them from being washed away. The vegetative cover acts to reduce the velocity of the raindrops that strike the foliage and stems before hitting the ground, reducing their kinetic energy. However it is the forest floor, more than the canopy, that prevents surface erosion. The terminal velocity of rain drops is reached in about . Because forest canopies are usually higher than this, rain drops can often regain terminal velocity even after striking the canopy. However, the intact forest floor, with its layers of leaf litter and organic matter, is still able to absorb the impact of the rainfall. Deforestation causes increased erosion rates due to exposure of mineral soil by removing the humus and litter layers from the soil surface, removing the vegetative cover that binds soil together, and causing heavy soil compaction from logging equipment. Once trees have been removed by fire or logging, infiltration rates become high and erosion low to the degree the forest floor remains intact. Severe fires can lead to significant further erosion if followed by heavy rainfall. Globally one of the largest contributors to erosive soil loss in the year 2006 is the slash and burn treatment of tropical forests. In a number of regions of the earth, entire sectors of a country have been rendered unproductive. For example, on the Madagascar high central plateau, comprising approximately ten percent of that country's land area, virtually the entire landscape is sterile of vegetation, with gully erosive furrows typically in excess of deep and wide. Shifting cultivation is a farming system which sometimes incorporates the slash and burn method in some regions of the world. This degrades the soil and causes the soil to become less and less fertile. Roads and urbanization Urbanization has major effects on erosion processes‚Äîfirst by denuding the land of vegetative cover, altering drainage patterns, and compacting the soil during construction; and next by covering the land in an impermeable layer of asphalt or concrete that increases the amount of surface runoff and increases surface wind speeds. Much of the sediment carried in runoff from urban areas (especially roads) is highly contaminated with fuel, oil, and other chemicals. This increased runoff, in addition to eroding and degrading the land that it flows over, also causes major disruption to surrounding watersheds by altering the volume and rate of water that flows through them, and filling them with chemically polluted sedimentation. The increased flow of water through local waterways also causes a large increase in the rate of bank erosion. Climate change The warmer atmospheric temperatures observed over the past decades are expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events. The rise in sea levels that has occurred as a result of climate change has also greatly increased coastal erosion rates.For an overview of other human activities that have increased coastal erosion rates, see: Studies on soil erosion suggest that increased rainfall amounts and intensities will lead to greater rates of soil erosion. Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase in many parts of the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; d) soil erodibility changes due to decrease in soil organic matter concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil surface sealing and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously non-erodible one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes. Studies by Pruski and Nearing indicated that, other factors such as land use unconsidered, it is reasonable to expect approximately a 1.7% change in soil erosion for each 1% change in total precipitation under climate change. In recent studies, there are predicted increases of rainfall erosivity by 17% in the United States, by 18% in Europe, and globally 30 to 66% Global environmental effects run-off and filter soxx World map indicating areas that are vulnerable to high rates of water erosion. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Easter Island experienced severe erosion due to deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices. The resulting loss of topsoil ultimately led to ecological collapse, causing mass starvation and the complete disintegration of the Easter Island civilization. Due to the severity of its ecological effects, and the scale on which it is occurring, erosion constitutes one of the most significant global environmental problems we face today. Land degradation Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for 84% of degraded acreage. Each year, about 75 billion tons of soil is eroded from the land‚Äîa rate that is about 13‚Äì40 times as fast as the natural rate of erosion. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. According to the United Nations, an area of fertile soil the size of Ukraine is lost every year because of drought, deforestation and climate change. In Africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to UNU's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.Africa may be able to feed only 25% of its population by 2025 Recent modeling developments have quantified rainfall erosivity at global scale using high temporal resolution(<30 min) and high fidelity rainfall recordings. The results is an extensive global data collection effort produced the Global Rainfall Erosivity Database (GloREDa) which includes rainfall erosivity for 3,625 stations and covers 63 countries. This first ever Global Rainfall Erosivity Database was used to develop a global erosivity map at 30 arc-seconds(~1 km) based on sophisticated geostatistical process. According to a new study published in Nature Communications, almost 36 billion tons of soil is lost every year due to water, and deforestation and other changes in land use make the problem worse. The study investigates global soil erosion dynamics by means of high- resolution spatially distributed modelling (ca. 250 √ó 250 m cell size). The geo-statistical approach allows, for the first time, the thorough incorporation into a global soil erosion model of land use and changes in land use, the extent, types, spatial distribution of global croplands and the effects of different regional cropping systems. The loss of soil fertility due to erosion is further problematic because the response is often to apply chemical fertilizers, which leads to further water and soil pollution, rather than to allow the land to regenerate. Sedimentation of aquatic ecosystems Soil erosion (especially from agricultural activity) is considered to be the leading global cause of diffuse water pollution, due to the effects of the excess sediments flowing into the world's waterways. The sediments themselves act as pollutants, as well as being carriers for other pollutants, such as attached pesticide molecules or heavy metals. The effect of increased sediments loads on aquatic ecosystems can be catastrophic. Silt can smother the spawning beds of fish, by filling in the space between gravel on the stream bed. It also reduces their food supply, and causes major respiratory issues for them as sediment enters their gills. The biodiversity of aquatic plant and algal life is reduced, and invertebrates are also unable to survive and reproduce. While the sedimentation event itself might be relatively short-lived, the ecological disruption caused by the mass die off often persists long into the future. One of the most serious and long-running water erosion problems worldwide is in the People's Republic of China, on the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From the Yellow River, over 1.6 billion tons of sediment flows into the ocean each year. The sediment originates primarily from water erosion in the Loess Plateau region of the northwest. Airborne dust pollution Soil particles picked up during wind erosion of soil are a major source of air pollution, in the form of airborne particulates‚Äî\\"dust\\". These airborne soil particles are often contaminated with toxic chemicals such as pesticides or petroleum fuels, posing ecological and public health hazards when they later land, or are inhaled/ingested. Dust from erosion acts to suppress rainfall and changes the sky color from blue to white, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America. Monitoring, measuring and modeling soil erosion Terracing is an ancient technique that can significantly slow the rate of water erosion on cultivated slopes. Monitoring and modeling of erosion processes can help people better understand the causes of soil erosion, make predictions of erosion under a range of possible conditions, and plan the implementation of preventative and restorative strategies for erosion. However, the complexity of erosion processes and the number of scientific disciplines that must be considered to understand and model them (e.g. climatology, hydrology, geology, soil science, agriculture, chemistry, physics, etc.) makes accurate modelling challenging.See also: and Erosion models are also non-linear, which makes them difficult to work with numerically, and makes it difficult or impossible to scale up to making predictions about large areas from data collected by sampling smaller plots. The most commonly used model for predicting soil loss from water erosion is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). This was developed in the 1960s and 1970s. It estimates the average annual soil loss A on a plot-sized area as: : A = RKLSCP where R is the rainfall erosivity factor,rainfall erosivity factor K is the soil erodibility factor, L and S are topographic factorstopographic factors representing length and slope, C is the cover and management factor and P is the support practices factor. Despite the USLE's plot-scale spatial basis, the model has often been used to estimate soil erosion on much larger areas, such as watersheds, continents, and globally. One major problem is that the USLE cannot simulate gully erosion, and so erosion from gullies is ignored in any USLE-based assessment of erosion. Yet erosion from gullies can be a substantial proportion (10‚Äì80%) of total erosion on cultivated and grazed land. During the 50 years since the introduction of the USLE, many other soil erosion models have been developed. But because of the complexity of soil erosion and its constituent processes, all erosion models can only roughly approximate actual erosion rates when validated i.e. when model predictions are compared with real-world measurements of erosion. Thus new soil erosion models continue to be developed. Some of these remain USLE-based, e.g. the G2 model.G2 model Other soil erosion models have largely (e.g. the Water Erosion Prediction Project model) or wholly (e.g. the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model) abandoned usage of USLE elements. Global studies continue to be based on the USLE Prevention and remediation A windbreak (the row of trees) planted next to an agricultural field, acting as a shield against strong winds. This reduces the effects of wind erosion, and provides many other benefits. The most effective known method for erosion prevention is to increase vegetative cover on the land, which helps prevent both wind and water erosion. Terracing is an extremely effective means of erosion control, which has been practiced for thousands of years by people all over the world.For an interesting archaeological/historical survey of terracing systems, see Windbreaks (also called shelterbelts) are rows of trees and shrubs that are planted along the edges of agricultural fields, to shield the fields against winds. In addition to significantly reducing wind erosion, windbreaks provide many other benefits such as improved microclimates for crops (which are sheltered from the dehydrating and otherwise damaging effects of wind), habitat for beneficial bird species, carbon sequestration, and aesthetic improvements to the agricultural landscape. Traditional planting methods, such as mixed-cropping (instead of monocropping) and crop rotation have also been shown to significantly reduce erosion rates.See also: and Crop residues play a role in the mitigation of erosion, because they reduce the impact of raindrops breaking up the soil particles. There is a higher potential for erosion when producing potatoes than when growing cereals, or oilseed crops. Forages have a fibrous root system, which helps combat erosion by anchoring the plants to the top layer of the soil, and covering the entirety of the field, as it is a non-row crop. In tropical coastal systems, properties of mangroves have been examined as a potential means to reduce soil erosion. Their complex root structures are known to help reduce wave damage from storms and flood impacts while binding and building soils. These roots can slow down water flow, leading to the deposition of sediments and reduced erosion rates. However, in order to maintain sediment balance, adequate mangrove forest width needs to be present.Spalding M, McIvor A, Tonneijck FH, Tol S and van Eijk P (2014) Mangroves for coastal defence.

Originally part of the Standard Oil Trust, it focused on gasoline for the new automobile market. In 1911, during the breakup of the trust, it became an independent corporation. Incorporated in Indiana, it was headquartered in Chicago. Amoco merged operations with BP in 1998. In the 1930s, Standard Oil of Indiana absorbed the American Oil Company, founded in Baltimore in 1910, and incorporated in 1922, by Louis Blaustein and his son Jacob. The combined corporation operated or licensed gas stations under both the Standard name and the Amoco name (the latter from American oil company) and its logo using either name became a red, white and blue oval with a torch in the center. By the mid-twentieth century it was ranked the largest oil company in the United States. In 1985, it changed its corporate name to Amoco. Amoco merged with British Petroleum in December 1998 to form BP Amoco, renamed BP in 2001. The firm's innovations included two essential parts of the modern industry, the gasoline tanker truck and the drive-through filling station. Its \\"Amoco Super-Premium\\" lead-free gasoline was marketed decades before environmental concerns led to the eventual phase out of leaded gasoline throughout the United States. Amoco's headquarters were located in the Amoco Building (also called the Standard Oil Building, and nicknamed \\"Big Stan\\", now the Aon Center) in Chicago, Illinois.\\"Contacts.\\" Amoco. February 12, 1998. Retrieved on March 31, 2010. In October 2017, BP revealed that it would be reintroducing the Amoco name to select US markets. As of August 2018, there are currently over 100 new Amoco locations in the states of Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois, with more locations opening soon. Overview The Amoco Building (now the Aon Center) housed the Amoco headquarters in Chicago Standard Oil (Indiana) was formed in 1889, by John D. Rockefeller as part of the Standard Oil Trust. In 1910, with the rise in popularity of the automobile, Indiana Standard decided to specialize in providing gasoline to consumers. In 1911, the year it became independent from the Standard Oil trust, the company sold 88% of the gasoline and kerosene sold in the Midwest. In 1912, it opened its first gas service station in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When the Standard Oil Trust was broken up in 1911, Indiana Standard was assigned marketing territory covering most of the Midwestern United States, including Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. It had the exclusive rights to use the Standard name in the region. It purchased the Dixie Oil Company of Louisiana in 1919, and began investing in other oil companies outside its Standard marketing territory. Blaustein incorporated his business as the American Oil Co. in 1922. In 1923, the Blausteins sold a half interest in American Oil to the Pan American Petroleum & Transport company in exchange for a guaranteed supply of oil. Before this deal, Amoco was forced to depend on Standard Oil of New Jersey, a competitor, for its supplies. Standard Oil of Indiana acquired Pan American in 1925, beginning John D. Rockefeller's association with the Amoco name. In the 1920s and 1930s, Indiana Standard opened up dozens more refining and oil-drilling facilities. Combined with a new oil-refining process, Indiana Standard created its exploration and production business, Stanolind, in 1931. In the following years, a period of intense exploration and search for oil-rich fields ensued; the company drilled over 1000 wells in 1937, alone. Pipelines and oil transport In 1921, Indiana Standard bought a half interest in the Sinclair Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of Sinclair Oil Corporation, Retrieved October 19, 2007. which owned a network of crude oil pipelines in the midwestern United States. In 1925, it bought a stake in the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company (PAT). The acquired company had previously bought a half interest in the American Oil Company, which marketed half of PAT's oil in the United States. Indiana Standard raised its stake in PAT to 81 percent by 1929. In 1931, Stanolind completed its acquisition of Sinclair Pipeline and also acquired the Sinclair Crude Oil Purchasing Company. All of the pipeline companies were consolidated into the newly formed Stanolind Pipeline Company. The crude oil purchasing operations became Stanolind Crude Oil Purchasing Company.Ask.com \\"Amoco Corporation.\\" The pipeline company headquarters were located in the Philcade building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1957, all of the corporation's pipeline activities were merged into a single entity, which was named Service Pipeline Company. Lead-free gasoline While most oil companies were switching to leaded gasolines en masse during the mid-to-late 1920s, American Oil chose to continue marketing its premium-grade \\"Amoco-Gas\\" (later Amoco Super-Premium) as a lead-free gasoline by using aromatics rather than tetraethyllead to increase octane levels, decades before the environmental movement of the early 1970s, led to more stringent auto-emission controls which ultimately mandated the universal phase out of leaded gasoline. The \\"Amoco\\" lead-free gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded fuel. Lead-free Amoco was introduced in the Indiana Standard marketing area in 1970. The Red Crown Regular and White Crown Premium (later Gold Crown Super Premium) gasolines marketed by parent company Standard Oil (Indiana) in its prime marketing area in the Midwest before 1961, also contained lead.Gas Pump Collector's Guide - Google Books World War II World War II followed this period of exploration; Indiana Standard participated in the war effort, discovering new means of refinement and even a way of producing TNT more quickly and easily. In addition, Indiana Standard significantly contributed to the aviation and land gasoline needed for the Allied armies. Also, during the war Indiana Standard created its chemical division, formed from the merger of the Pan American Chemicals Company and the Indoil Chemical Company. Post- war In the late 1940s, after World War II, Indiana Standard returned to focusing on domestic oil refinement and advancement. In 1947, Indiana Standard was the first company to drill off-shore, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in 1948, Stanolind Oil invented Hydrafrac, a hydraulic well fracturing process that increased oil production worldwide. Initially the Hydrafrac process was licensed exclusively to Halliburton. By 1952, Standard Oil of Indiana was ranked as the largest domestic oil company. It had 12 refineries in the United States, marketed its products in 41 states, owned of crude oil pipelines, of trunk lines, and of product pipelines. In 1956, the Pan-Am stations in the southeastern U.S. were rebranded as Amoco stations. In 1961, Indiana Standard reorganized its marketing giving its American Oil Company unit responsibility for its retail operations nationwide under the Standard name inside the Indiana Standard marketing area (Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and under the American name outside that region. Both brands shared the same redesigned torch and oval logo for easy identification nationwide. The Utoco name used in Indiana Standard's southwestern region was replaced by the American name. The Amoco name continued to be used outside the U.S. and as a brand on certain American Oil products. Soon after, the company began to expand. With an exploration office in Canada, Indiana Standard was now an international gas company. Indiana Standard created several new plants and claimed various new oil fields in this time period, as the company prospered in the post-war boom. By 1971, all the divisions of Indiana Standard bore the Amoco name including American Oil which was renamed Amoco Oil with American stations renamed Amoco stations. By 1975, Amoco began phasing in the Amoco name in the old Indiana Standard sales territory. Standard Oil Company (Indiana) was officially renamed Amoco Corporation in 1985. Phillips Petroleum's assets in the General American Oil Company, acquired in 1983, were later taken over by Amoco. Carlin's Amoco Station was built at Roanoke, Virginia, around 1947; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. and Accompanying six photo Chemical production In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Indiana Standard again led the way with scientific and technological discoveries. Indiana Standard discovered PTA, a chemical for polyester fiber production. In 1968, following that discovery, Indiana Standard acquired the Avisun Corporation and Patchogue-Plymouth, forming the Amoco Fabrics and Fibers Company. Global expansion In the following decades, Amoco expanded globally, creating plants, oil wells, or markets in over 30 countries, including Italy, Australia, Britain, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Norway, Venezuela, Russia, China, Trinidad and Tobago, and Egypt. In addition, the company also acquired a division of Tenneco Oil Company and Dome Petroleum Limited, becoming one of the world's largest oil companies. Sponsorship In 1968‚Äì72, (as American Oil Company) the company sponsored the American Freeway Patrol (AFP) in the metropolitan San Diego area as part of an expansion of service stations into Southern California. The American Freeway Patrol cruised the freeways and assisted disabled motorists free of charge, and provided helicopter traffic reports for local radio stations which was groundbreaking at the time. Don Langford, with KFWB (AM) Los Angeles, joined the American Freeway Patrol, San Diego, as traffic reporter on KOGO-AM-FM, KSON (AM), KITT (FM) San Diego, and KMLO (AM) Vista. In 1976, Amoco (under the \\"Standard\\" name) sponsored the Barney Oldfield Speedway attraction at Marriott's Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois. Although the sponsorship deal ended when Marriott sold the park to Six Flags in 1985, the Standard logo can still be seen on all of the Barney Oldfield Speedway (now Great America Raceway) cars. In 1988, legendary racer Mario Andretti drove the Amoco Ultimate Lola/Chevrolet for Newman/Haas Racing in the Indianapolis 500 and throughout the season in the CART IndyCar World Series. Andretti provided great publicity for Amoco by winning races at Phoenix and Cleveland that year, part of his 52 career IndyCar wins. Andretti also appeared in Amoco television commercials that aired in local race markets as part of the IndyCar sponsorship campaign. Dave Blaney drove a #93 Pontiac Grand Prix/Dodge Intrepid under Amoco sponsorship in the NASCAR Cup Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series from 1997 until the brand's demise in 2001. Incidents August 27, 1955, saw an explosion at the oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana, that caused catastrophic damage, and continued to burn for eight days. On March 16, 1978, the very large crude carrier Amoco Cadiz ran ashore just north of Landunvez, Finist√®re, Brittany, France, causing one of the largest oil spills in history. Amoco was ordered by a federal judge Charles Norgle in a 1990 ruling to pay $120 million in damages and restitution to France. On October 21, 1980, an explosion at an Amoco plant in New Castle, Delaware, killed six people, caused $46 million in property damage, and eventually led to the loss of 300 jobs. In the 1980s and 1990s, six former Amoco chemical engineers at the firm's Naperville, Illinois, research campus developed a deadly form of brain cancer. Researchers who conducted a three-year study of the cancer cluster determined that the cancer cases were workplace-related, but they could not identify the source of the workers' ailments. In June 2010, BP demolished Building 503, where the employees had worked. According to a company spokesperson, the building was \\"underused\\", and \\"required upgrades the company deemed too expensive.\\" Heirs of one of the cancer-stricken workers won a $2.75 million suit against BP Amoco in 2000.Smith, G.

Originally, the plan was for all US BP service stations to be converted to Amoco while all overseas Amoco service stations were to be converted to BP. But by 2004, BP announced that all Amoco service stations would either be closed or renamed to BP service stations, including the remaining stations still bearing the \\"Standard\\" name. BP also chose to rename its gasolines with the Amoco name, changing its midgrade and premium offerings to the Silver and Ultimate brandings that Amoco used. By 2008, the \\"Amoco Fuels\\" name had been mostly discontinued in favor of \\"BP Gasoline with Invigorate.\\" The Amoco name, however, lives on as BP continues to sell Silver and Ultimate under the BP name. In addition, a few BP stations continue operation under the Amoco name. Most were either converted to BP, demolished and replaced with BP-style stations, abandoned, or switched to competitor brands. On April 1, 2010, in Mississippi, Chevron purchased some BP gas stations, which had been Amoco, to convert them to the Texaco brand. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, there were reports in the press that BP was reconsidering rebranding itself as Amoco in the US. Some independently owned BP stations, including former Amoco stations, switched to a different brand due to the public relations fallout as a result of the oil spill. Relaunching It was announced on October 10, 2017, that BP will bring the Amoco name back, after an absence of almost a decade. BP had said the first station would relaunch in 2017. Their intention for relaunching the name is to capture more of the U.S. fuel industry. Several Gulf stations were rechristened as Amoco stations on Long Island, New York, starting in November 2017. A new Amoco station (previously a Gulf and before that, Exxon) in Bayside, New York Logo Original Standard Oil of Indiana \\"torch & oval\\" logo used 1947‚Äì1960.https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS897US897&sxsrf;=ALeKk01edR1u40J_OYuv5DTxegozJDLZgg:1588695140251&source;=univ&tbm;=isch&q;=%22standard+gasolines+with+m2pg%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiXpvbLjp3pAhWQZs0KHXI0BwUQ7Al6BAgEEAs&biw;=1305&bih;=586#imgrc=_samplKPtSi- xM The first Indiana Standard logo was unveiled in 1926, after a competition. The logo featured a circle, representing strength, stability, and dependability, with the words \\"Standard Oil Company (Indiana)\\" in red. The inner circle represents the cycle of service to customers. The word Service was written in the inside of the circles. In addition, the logo also had a torch with a flame, symbolizing progress. This logo appeared on gas station buildings. The roadside sign was a blue rectangle saying \\"STANDARD SERVICE\\" in white block letters. Concurrently, American Oil introduced in 1932, a logo which was the first to bear the name \\"Amoco\\". It featured an ellipse divided into three sections horizontally; the top and bottom were red, and the middle had a black background with white lettering. This logo was used in the northeastern U.S. A new logo was developed by Indiana Standard and introduced in 1946. It combined the Standard torch with the Amoco oval. The oval colors were, from top to bottom, red, white, and blue. The new logo was called the \\"Torch and Oval (T&O;)\\". In parts of the country where the company could not use the name \\"Standard\\", the logo read \\"Utoco\\" or \\"Pan-Am\\". When the \\"Pan-Am\\" name was replaced by \\"Amoco\\", it marked the first time the torch and oval was used with the Amoco name. The red and black logo continued to be used in the northeast and maps distributed by Amoco in the late 1950s through 1960 showed both logos. In 1961, the torch and oval was redesigned with a flatter oval and a more contemporary torch design with the logo bearing the Standard or American name in the U.S. and the Amoco name outside the U.S. 1961‚Äì1970 Standard logo. Logo bore the \\"AMERICAN\\" name outside the Indiana Standard marketing area. The next updated logo, in 1971, enhanced the previous one. It featured a blue bottom and a sleeker-looking torch. In addition, the word \\"Standard\\" became italicized and thicker. This was used by Midwestern station owners who had the option of using the Amoco name (more familiar in the East and South) or using the more familiar Standard name. Owners used it up until they were converted to BP or another franchise. The final Amoco logo of the 2002 company simply changed the name on the logo to \\"Amoco\\". The logo featured the familiar torch and divided ellipse. Currently, BP still employs the Amoco name, albeit under another logo. BP currently uses the logo under the main BP helios logo. The italicized word \\"Amoco\\" is shown after red, white, and blue horizontal stripes, taken from the divided ellipse of the former Amoco logo. This logo existed prior to the acquisition, and was used primarily on pumps and service station canopies. Since the merger, the black background has been replaced with green, to symbolize the new parent company. The final logo of the original Amoco, used until 2002 Although a few Amoco stations still use their former logo, most have since been converted to the BP livery. In St. Louis, Missouri, the largest Amoco sign in the world, both before and after the company's demise, still stands. It stands at the intersection of Clayton Road, Skinker Boulevard, McCausland Avenue, and Interstate 64 (near the southwest corner of Forest Park, home of the St. Louis Zoo, the Saint Louis Art Museum and other prominent attractions). It is visible up to two miles away on the interstate. Most surviving Amoco stations are kept so BP can continue holding the trademarks for Amoco and Standard. BP station with \\"torch and oval\\" Standard sign in Durand, Michigan In May 2008, United States BP stations mostly discontinued use of the \\"Amoco Fuels\\" logo as BP introduced its new brand of fuel, \\"BP Gasoline with Invigorate\\". BP still uses the Silver and Amoco Ultimate brands for its midgrade and premium gasolines. For the 2017 revival, the Amoco logo got a new, modernized refresh to its \\"torch and oval\\" image.

It has more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States, and recently () five gas stations in northwestern Mexico. ARCO was formed by the merger of East Coast‚Äìbased Atlantic Refining and California-based Richfield Oil Corporation in 1966; the company's name is an initialism of the two companies. A merger in 1969 brought in Sinclair Oil Corporation. In the 1970s and 80s, ARCO was one of the largest companies in the world, consistently a top 20 company of the Fortune 500. After its subsequent fracture in the late 1980s and early 90s, ARCO became a subsidiary of UK-based BP plc in 2000 through its BP West Coast Products LLC (BPWCP) affiliate.\\"Legal information \\". ARCO. Retrieved on July 7, 2010. On August 13, 2012, it was announced that Tesoro would purchase ARCO and its refinery for $2.5 billion. The deal came under fire because of increasing fuel prices. Many activists urged state and federal regulators to block the sale because of concerns that it would reduce competition and could lead to higher fuel prices at ARCO stations (ARCO stations make up more than half of all stations with the lowest fuel prices in California). On June 3, 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion. BP sold its Southern California terminals (Vinvale, Colton, San Diego, Hathaway, and Hynes) to Tesoro Logistics LP, including the Carson Storage Facility. BP sold the ampm brand to Tesoro for Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. BP exclusively licensed the ARCO rights from Tesoro for Northern California, Oregon, and Washington. ARCO is known for its low-priced gasoline compared to other national brands, mainly because of an early 1980s business decision to emphasize cost cutting (cash/debit-only policy) and alternative sources of income (ampm). ARCO is headquartered in La Palma, California. Tesoro was renamed Andeavor in 2017, and was acquired by Marathon Petroleum in 2018. Following the acquisition, Marathon hinted at keeping the ARCO brand name in Mexico as well as select US markets while rebranding the rest either as standard Marathon stations (for franchised locations) or Speedway locations (for company-owned locations); stations still owned by BP may either remain as ARCO or rebranded as Amoco, as BP does not own the rights to the name due to licensing-based reasons in the Western United States.  History  *The Atlantic Petroleum Storage Company's heritage dates back to 1866. It became part of the Standard Oil trust in 1874, but achieved independence again when Standard Oil was broken up in 1911. *In 1915, Atlantic opens its first gas station on Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. *In 1917, First Richfield Oil Company of California gas station at Slauson and Central Avenues in Los Angeles, California.

Sinclair gets into trouble with Teapot Dome scandal. *In 1966, Atlantic merges with the Richfield Oil Company of California. The first CEO was Robert Orville Anderson. The new company boasts a new trademark, a red diamond shape called the ARCO Spark designed by Bauhaus artist, designer, and architect Herbert Bayer. *Commercial oil exploration started in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in the 1960s and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, North America's largest oil field, was discovered on March 12, 1968, by Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) and Exxon with the well Prudhoe Bay State #1. Key employees with ARCO Alaska were Marvin Mangus John M. Sweet, and William D. Leake, chief project engineer for the Alaska pipeline. The Richfield Oil Company of California had purchased the drilling rights to the land where the discovery well was located. British Petroleum had drilling rights near the discovery well. *ARCO acquired Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1969, but later divested certain Sinclair assets during the mid-1970s, resulting in Sinclair returning as a private company. * In 1978, ARCO opened the first of its AMPM convenience stores in Southern California. *In 1987, ARCO Chemical Co. was taken public. Key figures included ARCO Chemical CEO Harold Sorgenti and ARCO Chemical CFO William Magee. At one time, ARCO had its headquarters in the City National Plaza complex in Downtown Los Angeles\\"Welcome to ARCO Online\\". ARCO. Retrieved on July 7, 2010. \\"ARCO, 515 South Flower Street, Los Angeles, California 90071-2256\\".  Presence in Southwest U.S.  ARCO has a presence in the Southwestern U.S. It once had a property fronting Texas Highway 225 east of Loop 610 in Houston, Texas, with an oil tank farm once painted with the ARCO logo. Lyondell-Citgo purchased the property and rebranded the oil tanks in the 1980s. ARCO's global corporate headquarters were in the ARCO Plaza in Los Angeles at the corner of 5th and Flower Streets, the site of Richfield's former headquarters. ARCO's Oil & Gas division headquarters were in downtown Dallas, Texas. The headquarters' building was a 46-story office building designed by architect I.M. Pei, the ARCO Tower. ARCO closed the Dallas office and sold the building in the mid-1980s. , ARCO operated about 1,100 stations in six Western states: Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Utah. Merger ARCO merged with Anaconda Copper Mining Company of Montana in 1977. Anaconda's holdings included the Berkeley Pit and the Anaconda, Montana Smelter. ARCO founder Robert Orville Anderson stated \\"he hoped Anaconda's resources and expertise would help him launch a major shale-oil venture, but that the world oil glut and the declining price of petroleum made shale oil moot\\". The purchase turned out to be a regrettable decision for ARCO. A lack of experience with hard-rock mining and a sudden drop in the price of copper to below seventy cents a pound, the lowest in years, caused ARCO to suspend all operations in Butte, Montana. By 1983, only six years after acquiring rights to the \\"Richest Hill on Earth\\", the Berkeley Pit was completely idle. By 1986, some ARCO properties were sold to billionaire industrialist Dennis Washington, whose company, Montana Resources, operates a much smaller open-pit mine east of the defunct Berkeley Pit.  Acquisition  In 1985, the Atlantic brand was spun off for ARCO's East Coast stations as Atlantic Petroleum. Atlantic was acquired by Dutch trader John Deuss, who later sold it in 1988 to Sunoco. The ARCO brand is now used on the West Coast. ARCO specializes in discount gas by removing many frills, among them forcing prepayment for fuel, not accepting credit cards at most locations, and charging 35 cents for the use of debit cards. In most locations, it is co-branded with ampm convenience stores, also a division of BP West Coast (ARCO introduced the AmPm concept in 1979). 1990s In the beginning of the 1990s, a subsidiary, ARCO Power Technologies, later Advanced Power Technologies (APTI), was the primary contractor for the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP Project). ARCO having hired Bernard Eastlund led to conspiracy theories about weather control and warfare. In March 1997, ARCO also leased almost all the gas stations of the (now) Santa Fe Springs, California based independent Thrifty OilThrifty Oil Co.: gasoline retailer goes pump-to-pump with industry giants - Top 400 Private Awards  Los Angeles Business Journal  Find Articles at BNET.com group of 250 stations found throughout California after a damaging price war which the independent Thrifty was unable to win. 2000s On April 18, 2000, ARCO was purchased by BP America and completely merged into BP operations. There were two exceptions due to FTC requirements: ARCO Alaska was sold by BP to Phillips Petroleum, and ARCO Pipe Line Company was acquired by TEPPCO, a subsidiary of Enterprise Products. ARCO as a subsidiary no longer exists. Over the course of 2004 and 2005, ARCO signs were replaced with signs that still had the ARCO spark, but BP's Helios (BP's new white, yellow, and green \\"sunburst\\" mark named after the Greek Sun god, replacing the old British Petroleum shield mark)SignResource Delivers Its 30,000th BP Helios is also located on the sign. A new tagline \\"ARCO‚Äîpart of BP\\" also appeared on some signs and advertisements. ARCO was known for sponsoring the ARCO Arena (now Sleep Train Arena) in Sacramento, California, with a license fee of $750,000/year through 2007. Research Laboratory From the 1960s until the turn of the century, ARCO operated a highly significant research and development center in Plano, Texas, on land purchased in 1964 by the Atlantic Refinery Company.https://www.plano.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1201/Plano-Time- Line?bidId= Its golden age was arguably in the early to mid 1980s, when it was led by Robert L. Hirsch. A standout example of ARCO's research at that time was the pioneering study on 4D seismic surveying by Robert Greaves and Terry Fulp. This consisted of repeated 3D seismic surveys which successfully mapped the effects of enhanced oil recovery processes as a function of time.Greaves, Robert, and Terrance J. Fulp (1987). Three-dimensional seismic monitoring of an enhanced oil recovery process. Geophysics Vol. 52, No. 9, 1175-1187. This work was recognized for its seminal importance over 20 years later by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Virgil_Kauffman_Gold_Medal Besides Greaves and Fulp, the laboratory produced a number of other distinguished alumni during this golden age, including scientists John Castagna, Michael Batzle, Geoffrey Dorn, and Marius Vassiliou. In later years the laboratory experienced significant contraction. It finally closed shortly after the 2000 acquisition of ARCO by BP. Superfund site ARCO is the responsible party (by its ownership of Anaconda Copper at the time operations were terminated) for the largest U.S. Superfund site‚Äîa site that takes in the towns of Butte and Anaconda, and of the Clark Fork River including Milltown Dam. The region's water and soil were polluted by a century of mining and smelting. Chemicals of concern include many heavy metals and arsenic. On 7 February 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced that prolonged litigation with ARCO ended when ARCO agreed to pay $187 million to finance natural resource restoration activities. Anaconda Copper still nominally exists, but only as a massive environmental liability for ARCO. In the media George Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead features a zombie wearing a red baseball jersey that read \\"Bach's Arco Pitcairn\\". The song \\"Storm\\", in Godspeed You Black Emperor's 2000 album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven uses a field recording done at the Los Angeles Airport ARCO gas station. Sacramento band CAKE recorded the song \\"Arco Arena\\", which was about the stadium in Sacramento to which Arco had purchased naming rights. One of ARCO's former diesel-hydraulic switcher engines, numbered 6920, was briefly shown in There Goes A Train, and one of their tanker ships, the ARCO Sag River, was featured in There Goes A Boat.  Legal issues  Atlantic Richfield Co and its parent BP America agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by about 700 current and former residents of Yerington, Nevada, who lived near the Anaconda mine built in 1941. The company paid in Nevada up to $19.5M for settlement. EPA tested in 2009 wells and found that 79% of the wells north of mine had dangerous levels of uranium and/or arsenic.Nevada residents win $19.5m settlement in toxic waste leak lawsuit The Guardian 7 November 2013 In September 2010, the staff of KCST-FM in Florence, Oregon noticed that the station's Emergency Alert System (EAS) equipment would repeatedly unmute as if receiving an incoming EAS message several times a week. During each event, which was relayed from KKNU in Springfield, the same commercial advertisement for ARCO/BP gasoline could be heard, along with the words \\"This test has been brought to you by ARCO\\". Further investigation by the primary station transmitting the commercial revealed that the spot had been produced using an audio clip of an actual EAS header which had been modified to lower the header's volume and presumably prevent it from triggering false positive alert reactions in EAS equipment. The spot was distributed nationally, and after it had once been identified as the source of the false EAS equipment trips, various stations around the country reported having had similar experiences. After a widespread notification by the Society of Broadcast Engineers was issued, ARCO's ad agency withdrew the commercial from airplay.

Rockefeller. Sohio was acquired by British Petroleum, now called BP. Sohio continued as a separate entity after the antitrust breakup of Standard Oil in 1911. It operated service stations under the \\"Sohio\\" brand name in Ohio. In other states, it used the \\"Boron\\" brand name instead, but with an otherwise-similar logo. Wallace Trevor Holliday was President of the company from 1928 to 1949 and Chairman of the Board from 1949 until his death on November 7, 1950. In 1968, Sohio's CEO, Charlie Spahr, arranged a merger with BP. It was announced as Sohio's acquisition of BP's North American interests. However, the contract included a stipulation that BP would assume majority interest when Sohio's share of production from the Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska reached . That occurred in 1978, and BP then took control of Sohio. By 1991, BP had rebranded all Sohio-owned stations as BP, except for some marine fuel outlets.  Stations  By 1980, Sohio and Boron had 3,400 gas stations in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia. Sohio acquired 5,660 former Gulf stations as a result of FTC anti-trust limitations in Chevron's 1985 takeover of Gulf. These stations, bought for $1 billion, were in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. Sohio was allowed to use the \\"Gulf\\" name for five years after the acquisition. In 1987, after all other Standard Oil descendants had minimized use of the name Standard, Standard of Ohio, proud to be the original corporate component of Standard Oil, sought to corporately rebrand itself under the Standard name, while continuing to use the Sohio brand in Ohio. However, later that year BP bought the 45% of Sohio it did not already own and assumed control. Among the first changes was the rebranding of all Sohio and Boron stations to 'BP' in 1991. The Boron name was used outside of Ohio in neighboring states, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. Boron was also the branding of its premium grade gasoline along with its regular grade fuel \\"Extron\\" (formerly \\"Ex-tane\\" later \\"Octron\\") and its unleaded version \\"Cetron\\" introduced in 1970. Sohio's credit cards, like other oil company cards at the time, could be used at competitors' stations outside the issuing company's competitive territory, which in Sohio's case was Ohio. The benefit died with the Sohio brand. Exxon had a similar arrangement as well. In 1916, Sohio introduced a prefabricated canopy prototype for its stations.The History of Gasoline Retailing Although Sohio gas stations have ceased to exist, a few marina gas stations on Lake Erie and the Ohio River still bear the Sohio name. When BP merged with Amoco, its American headquarters moved from the former BP America Building on Public Square in Cleveland to Chicago.

It is also sung on Maundy Thursday during the procession from the church to the place where the Blessed Sacrament is kept until Good Friday. The last two stanzas (called, separately, Tantum ergo) are sung at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. The hymn expresses the doctrine that the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ during the celebration of the Eucharist. It is often sung in English as the hymn \\"Of the Glorious Body Telling\\" to the same tune as the Latin. The opening words recall another famous Latin sequence from which this hymn is derived: Pange lingua gloriosi proelium certaminis by Venantius Fortunatus. Text There are many English translations, of varying rhyme scheme and metre. The following has the Latin text with a doxology in the first column, and an English translation by Edward Caswall in the second.H. T. Henry, \\"Pange Lingua Gloriosi\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. XI The third column is a more literal rendering.

Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory, Of His Flesh, the mystery sing; Of the Blood, all price exceeding, Shed by our Immortal King, Destined, for the world's redemption, From a noble Womb to spring. Of a pure and spotless Virgin Born for us on earth below, He, as Man, with man conversing, Stayed, the seeds of truth to sow; Then He closed in solemn order Wondrously His Life of woe. On the night of that Last Supper, Seated with His chosen band, He, the Paschal Victim eating, First fulfils the Law's command; Then as Food to all his brethren Gives Himself with His own Hand. Word-made-Flesh, the bread of nature By His Word to Flesh He turns; Wine into His Blood He changes: What though sense no change discerns. Only be the heart in earnest, Faith her lesson quickly learns. Down in adoration falling, Lo, the sacred Host we hail, Lo, o'er ancient forms departing Newer rites of grace prevail: Faith for all defects supplying, When the feeble senses fail. To the Everlasting Father And the Son who comes on high With the Holy Ghost proceeding Forth from each eternally, Be salvation, honor, blessing, Might and endless majesty. Amen. Alleluia. Tell, tongue, the mystery of the glorious Body and of the precious Blood, which, for the price of the world, the fruit of a noble Womb, the King of the Nations poured forth. Given to us, born for us, from the untouched Virgin, and dwelt in the world after the seed of the Word had been scattered. His inhabiting ended the delays with wonderful order. On the night of the Last Supper, reclining with His brethren, once the Law had been fully observed with the prescribed foods, as food to the crowd of Twelve He gives Himself with His hands. The Word as Flesh makes true bread into flesh by a word and the wine becomes the Blood of Christ. And if sense is deficient to strengthen a sincere heart Faith alone suffices. Therefore, the great Sacrament let us reverence, prostrate: and let the old Covenant give way to a new rite. Let faith stand forth as substitute for defect of the senses. To the Begetter and the Begotten be praise and jubilation, greeting, honour, strength also and blessing. To the One who proceeds from Both be equal praise. Amen, Alleluia. Music history There are two plainchant settings of the Pange lingua hymn. The better known is a Phrygian mode (Mode III) tune from the Roman liturgy, and the other is from the Mozarabic liturgy from Spain. The Roman tune was originally part of the Gallican Rite. The Roman version of the Pange lingua hymn was the basis for a famous composition by Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez, the Missa Pange lingua. An elaborate fantasy on the hymn, the mass is one of the composer's last works and has been dated to the period from 1515 to 1521, since it was not included by Petrucci in his 1514 collection of Josquin's masses, and was published posthumously. In its simplification, motivic unity, and close attention to the text it has been compared to the late works of Beethoven, and many commentators consider it one of the high points of Renaissance polyphony. Juan de Urrede, a Flemish composer active in Spain in the late fifteenth century, composed numerous settings of the Pange lingua, most of them based on the original Mozarabic melody. One of his versions for four voices is among the most popular pieces of the sixteenth century, and was the basis for dozens of keyboard works in addition to masses, many by Spanish composers.

Anton Bruckner's first composition was a setting of the first strophe of the hymn: Pange lingua, WAB 31. Gustav Holst used both the words and the plainchant melody of Pange lingua along with Vexilla regis in Hymn of Jesus (1917). The last two verses of Pange lingua (Tantum ergo) are often separated out. They mark the end of the procession of the monstrance in Holy Thursday liturgy. Various separate musical settings have been written for this, including one by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, one by Franz Schubert, eight by Anton Bruckner, one by Maurice Durufl√©, and one by Charles-Marie Widor. Franz Liszt's \\"Night Procession\\" from Two Episodes from Lenau's Faust is largely a fantasy on the Pange lingua melody.Ben Arnold, ed.: The Liszt Companion. Greenwood Press: 2002, p. 270. A setting of Pange lingua, written by Ciaran McLoughlin, appears on the Solas 1995 album Solas An Domhain. Pange lingua has been translated into many different languages for worship throughout the world. However, the Latin version remains the most popular. The Syriac translation of \\"Pange lingua\\" was used as part of the rite of benediction in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church of Kerala, India, until the 1970s.

DLL Hell can manifest itself in many different ways wherein applications neither launch nor work correctly. DLL Hell is the Windows ecosystem-specific form of the general concept dependency hell.  Problems  DLLs are Microsoft's implementation of shared libraries. Shared libraries allow common code to be bundled into a wrapper, the DLL, and used by any application software on the system without loading multiple copies into memory. A simple example might be the GUI text editor, which is widely used by many programs. By placing this code in a DLL, all the applications on the system can use it without using more memory. This contrasts with static libraries, which are functionally similar but copy the code directly into the application. In this case, every application grows by the size of all the libraries it uses, and this can be quite large for modern programs. The problem arises when the version of the DLL on the computer is different than the version that was used when the program was being created. DLLs have no built-in mechanism for backward compatibility, and even minor changes to the DLL render its internal structure so different from previous versions that attempting to use them will generally cause the application to crash. Static libraries avoid this problem because the version that was used to build the application is included inside it, so even if a newer version exists elsewhere on the system, this does not affect the application. A key reason for the version incompatibility is the structure of the DLL file. The file contains a directory of the individual methods (procedures, routines, etc.) contained within the DLL and the types of data they take and return. Even minor changes to the DLL code can cause this directory to be re-arranged, in which case an application that calls a particular method believing it to be the 4th item in the directory might end up calling an entirely different and incompatible routine, which would normally cause the application to crash. There are several problems commonly encountered with DLLs, especially after numerous applications have been installed and uninstalled on a system. The difficulties include conflicts between DLL versions, difficulty in obtaining required DLLs, and having many unnecessary DLL copies. Solutions to these problems were known even while Microsoft was writing the DLL system. These have been incorporated into the .NET replacement, \\"Assemblies\\". Incompatible versions A particular version of a library can be compatible with some programs that use it and incompatible with others. Windows has been particularly vulnerable to this because of its emphasis on dynamic linking of C++ libraries and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects. C++ classes export many methods, and a single change to the class, such as a new virtual method, can make it incompatible with programs that were built against an earlier version. Object Linking and Embedding has very strict rules to prevent this: interfaces are required to be stable, and memory managers are not shared. This is insufficient, however, because the semantics of a class can change. A bug fix for one application may result in the removal of a feature from another. Before Windows 2000, Windows was vulnerable to this because the COM class table was shared across all users and processes. Only one COM object in one DLL/EXE could be declared as having a specific global COM Class ID on a system. If any program needed to create an instance of that class, it got whatever was the current centrally registered implementation. As a result, an installation of a program that installed a new version of a common object might inadvertently break other programs that were previously installed. DLL stomping A common and troublesome problem occurs when a newly installed program overwrites a working system DLL with an earlier, incompatible version. Early examples of this were the \`ctl3d.dll\` and \`ctl3dv2.dll\` libraries for Windows 3.1: Microsoft-created libraries that third-party publishers would distribute with their software, but each distributing the version they developed with rather than the most recent version. DLL stomping occurs because: * Microsoft in the past distributed runtime DLLs as shared system componentsRedistribution of the shared C runtime component in Visual C++ 2005 and in Visual C++ .NET. (originally C:\\\\WINDOWS and C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM), as a way of efficiently sharing code in a shared- memory OS with limited RAM and disk space. Consequently, third-party developers also distributed these in such a manner. * Application installers are typically executed in a privileged security context that has access to install DLLs into the system directories and to edit the system registry to register new DLLs as COM objects. A poorly written or misconfigured installer can therefore downgrade a system library on legacy versions of Windows, on which Windows File Protection or Windows Resource Protection does not roll back the change. On Windows Vista and later, only the \\"trusted installer\\" account can make changes to core operating-system libraries. * Windows applications were permitted to include OS updates in their own installation programs. That is, many Microsoft DLLs are redistributable, meaning that the applications get to include them if they need the services of the particular libraries. * Before Windows Installer, Windows installers historically were commercial products; many people attempted to write their own installers, overlooking or mishandling versioning problems in the process. * Some development environments did not automatically add a version resource in their compiled libraries, so many developers overlooked this aspect. Checking file dates, overwriting existing files or skipping the copy operation if the DLL was already installed were the only options available instead of correct versioning. * Sometimes, the OS itself removed or replaced DLLs with older or obsolete versions. For example, Windows 2000 would install black-and-white printer DLLs on top of color-aware DLLs, if a black-and-white printer was installed after the color printer.KB 830490: HP Color LaserJet printer prints only in grayscale or in black-and-white on your Windows 2000 SP4-based computer. Incorrect COM registration In COM and other parts of Windows, prior to the introduction of side-by-side registry-free assemblies, the Registry was used for determining which underlying DLL to use. If a different version of a module was registered, this DLL would be loaded instead of the expected one. This scenario could be caused by conflicting installations that register different versions of the same libraries, in which case the last installation would prevail. Shared in-memory modules 16-bit versions of Windows (and Windows on Windows) load only one instance of any given DLL; all applications reference the same in-memory copy, until no applications are using it and it is unloaded from memory. (For 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, inter-process sharing occurs only where different executables load a module from exactly the same directory; the code but not the stack is shared between processes through a process called \\"memory mapping\\".) Thus, even when the desired DLL is located in a directory where it can be expected to be found, such as in the system directory or the application directory, neither of these instances will be used if another application has started with an incompatible version from a third directory. This issue can manifest itself as a 16-bit application error that occurs only when applications are started in a specific order. Lack of serviceability In direct conflict with the DLL stomping problem: If updates to a DLL do not affect all applications that use it, then it becomes much harder to \\"service\\" the DLL ‚Äì that is, to eliminate problems that exist in the current versions of the DLL. (Security fixes are a particularly compelling and painful case.) Instead of fixing just the latest version of the DLL, the implementor must ideally make their fixes and test them for compatibility on every released version of the DLL. Causes DLL incompatibility has been caused by: * Memory constraints, combined with lack of separation of process memory space in 16-bit versions of Windows; * Lack of enforced standard versioning, naming, and file-system location schemata for DLLs; * Lack of an enforced standard method for software installation and removing (package management); * Lack of centralized authoritative support for DLL application binary interface management and safeguards, allowing incompatible DLLs with the same file name and internal version numbers to be released; * Oversimplified management tools, preventing the identification of changed or problematic DLLs by users and administrators; * Developers breaking backward compatibility of functions in shared modules; * Microsoft releasing out-of-band updates to operating-system runtime components; * Inability of earlier versions of Windows to run side-by-side conflicting versions of the same library; * Reliance on the current directory or \`%PATH%\` environment variable, both of which vary over time and from system to system, to find dependent DLLs (instead of loading them from an explicitly configured directory); * Developers re-using the ClassIDs from sample applications for the COM interfaces of their applications, rather than generating their own new GUIDs. DLL Hell was a very common phenomenon on pre-Windows NT versions of Microsoft operating systems, the primary cause being that the 16-bit operating systems did not restrict processes to their own memory space, thereby not allowing them to load their own version of a shared module that they were compatible with. Application installers were expected to be good citizens and verify DLL version information before overwriting the existing system DLLs. Standard tools to simplify application deployment (which always involves shipping the dependent operating-system DLLs) were provided by Microsoft and other 3rd-party tools vendors. Microsoft even required application vendors to use a standard installer and have their installation program certified to work correctly, before being granted use of the Microsoft logo. The good-citizen installer approach did not mitigate the problem, as the rise in popularity of the Internet provided more opportunities to obtain non-conforming applications. Use by malware The ambiguity with which DLLs that are not fully qualified can be loaded in the Windows operating system has been exploited by malware in recent years, opening a new class of vulnerability that affects applications from many different software vendors, as well as Windows itself. Solutions Various forms of DLL hell have been solved or mitigated over the years. Static linking A simple solution to DLL Hell in an application is to statically link all the libraries, i.e. to include the library version required in the program, instead of picking up a system library with a specified name. This is common in C/C++ applications, where, instead of having to worry about which version of \`MFC42.DLL\` is installed, the application is compiled to be statically linked against the same libraries. This eliminates the DLLs entirely and is possible in standalone applications using only libraries that offer a static option, as Microsoft Foundation Class Library does. However, the main purpose of DLLs ‚Äì runtime library sharing between programs to reduce memory overhead ‚Äì is sacrificed; duplicating library code in several programs creates software bloat and complicates the deployment of security fixes or newer versions of dependent software. Windows File Protection The DLL overwriting problem (referred to as DLL Stomping by Microsoft) was somewhat reduced with Windows File Protection (WFP),Windows File Protection and Windows. which was introduced in Windows 2000. This prevents unauthorized applications from overwriting system DLLs, unless they use the specific Windows APIs that permit this. There may still be a risk that updates from Microsoft are incompatible with existing applications, but this risk is typically reduced in current versions of Windows through the use of side-by-side assemblies. Third-party applications cannot stomp on OS files unless they bundle legitimate Windows updates with their installer, or if they disable the Windows File Protection service during installation, and on Windows Vista or later also take ownership of system files and grant themselves access. The SFC utility could revert these changes at any time. Running conflicting DLLs simultaneously The solutions here consist of having different copies of the same DLLs for each application, both on disk and in memory. An easy manual solution to conflicts was placing the different versions of the problem DLL into the applications' folders, rather than a common system-wide folder. This works in general as long as the application is 32-bit or 64-bit, and that the DLL does not use shared memory. In the case of 16-bit applications, the two applications cannot be executed simultaneously on a 16-bit platform, or in the same 16-bit virtual machine under a 32-bit operating system. OLE prevented this before Windows 98 SE/2000, because earlier versions of Windows had a single registry of COM objects for all applications. Windows 98 SE/2000 introduced a solution called side-by-side assembly, which loads separate copies of DLLs for each application that requires them (and thus allows applications that require conflicting DLLs to run simultaneously). This approach eliminates conflicts by allowing applications to load unique versions of a module into their address space, while preserving the primary benefit of sharing DLLs between applications (i.e. reducing memory use) by using memory mapping techniques to share common code between different processes that do still use the same module. Yet DLLs using shared data between multiple processes cannot take this approach. One negative side effect is that orphaned instances of DLLs may not be updated during automated processes. Portable applications Depending on the application architecture and runtime environment, portable applications may be an effective way to reduce some DLL problems, since every program bundles its own private copies of any DLLs it requires. The mechanism relies on applications not fully qualifying the paths to dependent DLLs when loading them, and the operating system searching the executable directory before any shared location. However this technique can also be exploited by malware, and the increased flexibility may also come at the expense of security if the private DLLs are not kept up to date with security patches in the same way that the shared ones are. Application virtualization can also allow applications to run in a \\"bubble\\", which avoids installing DLL files directly into the operating system.  Other countermeasures  There are other countermeasures to avoid DLL Hell, some of which may have to be used simultaneously; some other features that help to mitigate the problem are: * Installation tools are now bundled into Microsoft Visual Studio, one of the main environments for Windows development. These tools perform version checking before DLL installation, and can include predefined installation packages in a .MSI installation. This allows third party applications to integrate OS component updates without having to write their own installers for these components. * System Restore can recover a system from a bad installation, including registry damage. While this does not prevent the problem, it makes it easier to recover from. * WinSxS (Windows Side-by-Side) directory, which allows multiple versions of the same libraries to co-exist. * Run 16-bit applications in a separate memory space under a 32-bit version of Windows to allow two applications to use conflicting versions of the same DLL at the same time. * Use a version of Windows that includes Windows File Protection. Windows Me and Windows 2000, both released in 2000, support this form of system file protection, as do Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Its replacement, Windows Resource Protection, was introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and uses a different method of protecting system files from being changed. * Registration-free COM: Windows XP introduced a new mode of COM object registration called \\"Registration-free COM\\". This feature makes it possible for applications that need to install COM objects to store all the required COM registry information in the application's own directory, instead of in the global system registry. Thus, it provides a mechanism for multiple versions of the same DLL to be registered at the same time by multiple applications (Microsoft calls this \\"Side-by-Side Assembly\\"Side-by-side Assemblies (Windows)). DLL hell can be substantially avoided using Registration-free COM, the only limitation being it requires at least Windows XP or later Windows versions and that it must not be used for EXE COM servers or system-wide components such as MDAC, MSXML, DirectX or Internet Explorer. * Shipping the operating system with a capable package management system that is able to track the DLL dependencies, encouraging the use of the package manager and discouraging manual installation of DLLs. Windows Installer, included with Windows Me, Windows 2000 and all later versions provides this functionality. * Having a central database or authority for DLL conflict resolution and software distribution. Changes to a library can be submitted to this authority; thus, it can make sure compatibility is preserved in the developed branches. If some older software is incompatible with the current library, the authority can provide a compatibility interface for it, or bundle the old version as a distinct package. * If software developers need to customize a library, and if the main library release is unlikely to incorporate the changes that they need, they can ship the customized DLL for the program's private use (commonly by placing it in the program's private directory) or statically link the program against the customized library. * While DLLs are best for modularizing applications and the system's components and as third- party libraries, their usage is not imperative in all cases on modern systems where memory is no longer a constraint. For example, if an application needs a library that will not be used anywhere else, it can be linked statically, with no space penalty and with a speed gain. * Windows Vista and later use a special TrustedInstaller service to install operating system files. Other user accounts, including the SYSTEM, have no access to overwrite core system binaries. Windows 7 expands this functionality to some critical parts of the Registry. * Web-based applications avoid many side-by-side problems by running the bulk of the code on a server and using a browser interface on the client.

Baryte is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of the element barium. The baryte group consists of baryte, celestine (strontium sulfate), anglesite (lead sulfate), and anhydrite (calcium sulfate). Baryte and celestine form a solid solution (Ba,Sr)SO4. Names and history The unit cell of baryte The radiating form, sometimes referred to as Bologna Stone, attained some notoriety among alchemists for the phosphorescent specimens found in the 17th century near Bologna by Vincenzo Casciarolo.History of the Bologna stone The American Petroleum Institute specification API 13/ISO 13500, which governs baryte for drilling purposes, does not refer to any specific mineral, but rather a material that meets that specification. In practice, however, this is usually the mineral baryte. The term \\"primary barytes\\" refers to the first marketable product, which includes crude baryte (run of mine) and the products of simple beneficiation methods, such as washing, jigging, heavy media separation, tabling, flotation. Most crude baryte requires some upgrading to minimum purity or density. Baryte that is used as an aggregate in a \\"heavy\\" cement is crushed and screened to a uniform size. Most baryte is ground to a small, uniform size before it is used as a filler or extender, an addition to industrial products, in the production of barium chemicals or a weighting agent in petroleum well drilling mud. Name The name baryte is derived from the , 'heavy'. The American spelling is barite.M. Michael Miller Barite, 2009 Minerals Yearbook The International Mineralogical Association initially adopted \\"barite\\" as the official spelling, but recommended adopting the older \\"baryte\\" spelling later. This move was controversial and was notably ignored by American mineralogists. Other names have been used for baryte, including barytine, barytite, barytes, heavy spar, tiff, and blanc fixe. Mineral associations and locations Baryte with galena and hematite from Poland Baryte (top) and dolomite from Cumbria, England Abandoned baryte mine shaft near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, Scotland Baryte occurs in many depositional environments, and is deposited through many processes including biogenic, hydrothermal, and evaporation, among others. Baryte commonly occurs in lead-zinc veins in limestones, in hot spring deposits, and with hematite ore. It is often associated with the minerals anglesite and celestine. It has also been identified in meteorites. Baryte has been found at locations in Australia, Brazil, Nigeria, Canada, Chile, China, India, Pakistan, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Iran, Ireland (where it was mined on BenbulbenBen Bulben. Mhti.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-05.), Liberia, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Romania (Baia Sprie), Turkey, South Africa (Barberton Mountain Land), Thailand, United Kingdom (Cornwall, Cumbria, Dartmoor/Devon, Derbyshire, Durham,Muirshiel Mine Perthshire, Argyllshire, and Surrey) and in the US from Cheshire, Connecticut, De Kalb, New York, and Fort Wallace, New Mexico. It is mined in Arkansas, Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Nevada, and Missouri. The global production of baryte in 2019 was estimated to be around 9.5 million metric tons, down from 9.8 million metric tons in 2012. The major barytes producers (in thousand tonnes, data for 2017) are as follows: China (3,600), India (1,600), Morocco (1,000), Mexico (400), United States (330), Iran (280), Turkey (250), Russia (210), Kazakhstan (160), Thailand (130) and Laos (120). The main users of barytes in 2017 were (in million tonnes) US (2.35), China (1.60), Middle East (1.55), the European Union and Norway (0.60), Russia and CIS (0.5), South America (0.35), Africa (0.25), and Canada (0.20). 70% of barytes was destined for oil and gas well drilling muds. 15% for barium chemicals, 14% for filler applications in automotive, construction, and paint industries, and 1% other applications. Uses In oil and gas drilling Worldwide, 69‚Äì77% of baryte is used as a weighting agent for drilling fluids in oil and gas exploration to suppress high formation pressures and prevent blowouts. As a well is drilled, the bit passes through various formations, each with different characteristics. The deeper the hole, the more baryte is needed as a percentage of the total mud mix. An additional benefit of baryte is that it is non-magnetic and thus does not interfere with magnetic measurements taken in the borehole, either during logging-while-drilling or in separate drill hole logging. Baryte used for drilling petroleum wells can be black, blue, brown or gray depending on the ore body. The baryte is finely ground so that at least 97% of the material, by weight, can pass through a 200-mesh (75 Œºm) screen, and no more than 30%, by weight, can be less than 6 Œºm diameter. The ground baryte also must be dense enough so that its specific gravity is 4.2 or greater, soft enough to not damage the bearings of a tricone drill bit, chemically inert, and containing no more than 250 milligrams per kilogram of soluble alkaline salts. In August 2010, the American Petroleum Institute published specifications to modify the 4.2 drilling grade standards for baryte to include 4.1 SG materials. In oxygen and sulfur isotopic analysis salmon-colored) with cerussite from Morocco In the deep ocean, away from continental sources of sediment, pelagic baryte precipitates and forms a significant amount of the sediments. Since baryte has oxygen, systematics in the Œ¥18O of these sediments have been used to help constrain paleotemperatures for oceanic crust. The variations in sulfur isotopes (34S/32S) are being examined in evaporite minerals containing sulfur (e.g. baryte) and carbonate associated sulfates (CAS) to determine past seawater sulfur concentrations which can help identify specific depositional periods such as anoxic or oxic conditions. The use of sulfur isotope reconstruction is often paired with oxygen when a molecule contains both elements. Other uses Baryte is used in added-value applications which include filler in paint and plastics, sound reduction in engine compartments, coat of automobile finishes for smoothness and corrosion resistance, friction products for automobiles and trucks, radiation-shielding cement, glass ceramics, and medical applications (for example, a barium meal before a contrast CT scan). Baryte is supplied in a variety of forms and the price depends on the amount of processing; filler applications commanding higher prices following intense physical processing by grinding and micronising, and there are further premiums for whiteness and brightness and color. It is also used to produce other barium chemicals, notably barium carbonate which is used for the manufacture of LED glass for television and computer screens (historically in cathode ray tubes); and for dielectrics. Historically, baryte was used for the production of barium hydroxide for sugar refining, and as a white pigment for textiles, paper, and paint. Although baryte contains the toxic heavy metal barium, it is not toxic because barium sulfate is extremely insoluble in water. It is also sometimes used as a gemstone.Gemstones: Properties, Identification and Use By Arthur Thomas p.138  Industrial uses  Automotive * Paint layers * Plastics forming bumpers * Brake Pads * Carpets * Hood coating Various * Agricultural and Industrial machinery * Large metal structures * Pipelines * Factory interiors Maritime (coating) * High performance anticorrosive paints * Vessels * Containers * Oil rigs Decorative * Paints * Varnishes Appliances * Gadgets * Appliances Construction * High- density concrete * X-ray rooms * Concrete piers * Marine blocks of vessels Polymers * Masterbatch production * Drainage pipes * Toys * PVC enclosure Oil & Gas Industry * Oil, Gas & Geothermal drilling fluids (Drilling Mud) * Weighing agent * Offshore & Onshore drilling Main Producers Worldwide Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing Corporation, Deutsche Baryt Industrie, Baser Mining, New Riverside Ochre Company, Albar Industrial Minerals Ltd., Excalibar Minerals LLC, Anglo Pacific Minerals, SCR-Sibelco N.V., Ado Mining, Barium & Chemicals, Inc, CIMBAR Performance Minerals, Milwhite, Inc, Mil-Spec Industries Corp., International Earth Products LLC See also *Hokutolite *Rose rock References Barium minerals Sulfate minerals Evaporite Gemstones Industrial minerals Luminescent minerals Orthorhombic minerals ","title":"Baryte"},{"id":"59444","text":"Energy levels for an electron in an atom: ground state and excited states. After absorbing energy, an electron may \\"jump\\" from the ground state to a higher energy excited state. A quantum mechanical system or particle that is bound‚Äîthat is, confined spatially‚Äîcan only take on certain discrete values of energy, called energy levels. This contrasts with classical particles, which can have any amount of energy. The term is commonly used for the energy levels of the electrons in atoms, ions, or molecules, which are bound by the electric field of the nucleus, but can also refer to energy levels of nuclei or vibrational or rotational energy levels in molecules. The energy spectrum of a system with such discrete energy levels is said to be quantized.(And the energy levels don‚Äôt have to be equal ) In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell, or principal energy level, may be thought of as the orbit of one or more electrons around an atom's nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \\" shell\\" (also called \\"K shell\\"), followed by the \\" shell\\" (or \\"L shell\\"), then the \\" shell\\" (or \\"M shell\\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond with the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) or are labeled alphabetically with letters used in the X-ray notation (K, L, M, N‚Ä¶). Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on. The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2(n2) electrons.Re: Why do electron shells have set limits ? madsci.org, 17 March 1999, Dan Berger, Faculty Chemistry/Science, Bluffton College Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, this is not a strict requirement: atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells. (See Madelung rule for more details.) For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration.Electron Subshells. Corrosion Source. Retrieved on 1 December 2011. If the potential energy is set to zero at infinite distance from the atomic nucleus or molecule, the usual convention, then bound electron states have negative potential energy. If an atom, ion, or molecule is at the lowest possible energy level, it and its electrons are said to be in the ground state. If it is at a higher energy level, it is said to be excited, or any electrons that have higher energy than the ground state are excited. If more than one quantum mechanical state is at the same energy, the energy levels are \\"degenerate\\". They are then called degenerate energy levels. Explanation Wavefunctions of a hydrogen atom, showing the probability of finding the electron in the space around the nucleus. Each stationary state defines a specific energy level of the atom. Quantized energy levels result from the relation between a particle's energy and its wavelength. For a confined particle such as an electron in an atom, the wave function has the form of standing waves. Only stationary states with energies corresponding to integral numbers of wavelengths can exist; for other states the waves interfere destructively, resulting in zero probability density. Elementary examples that show mathematically how energy levels come about are the particle in a box and the quantum harmonic oscillator. History The first evidence of quantization in atoms was the observation of spectral lines in light from the sun in the early 1800s by Joseph von Fraunhofer and William Hyde Wollaston. The notion of energy levels was proposed in 1913 by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in the Bohr theory of the atom. The modern quantum mechanical theory giving an explanation of these energy levels in terms of the Schr√∂dinger equation was advanced by Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Werner Heisenberg in 1926. Atoms Intrinsic energy levels In the formulas for energy of electrons at various levels given below in an atom, the zero point for energy is set when the electron in question has completely left the atom, i.e. when the electron's principal quantum number . When the electron is bound to the atom in any closer value of , the electron's energy is lower and is considered negative. =Orbital state energy level: atom/ion with nucleus + one electron= Assume there is one electron in a given atomic orbital in a hydrogen-like atom (ion). The energy of its state is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction of the (negative) electron with the (positive) nucleus. The energy levels of an electron around a nucleus are given by : : E_n = - h c R_{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{Z^2}{n^2} (typically between 1 eV and 103 eV), where is the Rydberg constant, is the atomic number, is the principal quantum number, is Planck's constant, and is the speed of light. For hydrogen-like atoms (ions) only, the Rydberg levels depend only on the principal quantum number . This equation is obtained from combining the Rydberg formula for any hydrogen-like element (shown below) with assuming that the principal quantum number above = in the Rydberg formula and (principal quantum number of the energy level the electron descends from, when emitting a photon). The Rydberg formula was derived from empirical spectroscopic emission data. :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} = RZ^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n_1^2}-\\\\frac{1}{n_2^2}\\\\right) An equivalent formula can be derived quantum mechanically from the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation with a kinetic energy Hamiltonian operator using a wave function as an eigenfunction to obtain the energy levels as eigenvalues, but the Rydberg constant would be replaced by other fundamental physics constants. =Electron-electron interactions in atoms= If there is more than one electron around the atom, electron-electron-interactions raise the energy level. These interactions are often neglected if the spatial overlap of the electron wavefunctions is low. For multi-electron atoms, interactions between electrons cause the preceding equation to be no longer accurate as stated simply with as the atomic number. A simple (though not complete) way to understand this is as a shielding effect, where the outer electrons see an effective nucleus of reduced charge, since the inner electrons are bound tightly to the nucleus and partially cancel its charge. This leads to an approximate correction where is substituted with an effective nuclear charge symbolized as that depends strongly on the principal quantum number. : E_{n,l} = - h c R_{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{{Z_{\\\\rm eff}}^2}{n^2} \\\\ In such cases, the orbital types (determined by the azimuthal quantum number ) as well as their levels within the molecule affect and therefore also affect the various atomic electron energy levels. The Aufbau principle of filling an atom with electrons for an electron configuration takes these differing energy levels into account. For filling an atom with electrons in the ground state, the lowest energy levels are filled first and consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle, the Aufbau principle, and Hund's rule. =Fine structure splitting= Fine structure arises from relativistic kinetic energy corrections, spin‚Äìorbit coupling (an electrodynamic interaction between the electron's spin and motion and the nucleus's electric field) and the Darwin term (contact term interaction of shell electrons inside the nucleus). These affect the levels by a typical order of magnitude of 10‚àí3 eV. =Hyperfine structure= This even finer structure is due to electron‚Äìnucleus spin‚Äìspin interaction, resulting in a typical change in the energy levels by a typical order of magnitude of 10‚àí4 eV. Energy levels due to external fields =Zeeman effect= There is an interaction energy associated with the magnetic dipole moment, , arising from the electronic orbital angular momentum, , given by :U = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_L\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B} with :-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_L = \\\\dfrac{e\\\\hbar}{2m}\\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\mu_B\\\\mathbf{L}. Additionally taking into account the magnetic momentum arising from the electron spin. Due to relativistic effects (Dirac equation), there is a magnetic momentum, , arising from the electron spin :-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_S = -\\\\mu_B g_S \\\\mathbf{S}, with the electron-spin g-factor (about 2), resulting in a total magnetic moment, , :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_L + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_S. The interaction energy therefore becomes :U_B = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu_B B (M_L + g_S M_S). =Stark effect= Molecules Chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule form because they make the situation more stable for the involved atoms, which generally means the sum energy level for the involved atoms in the molecule is lower than if the atoms were not so bonded. As separate atoms approach each other to covalently bond, their orbitals affect each other's energy levels to form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The energy level of the bonding orbitals is lower, and the energy level of the antibonding orbitals is higher. For the bond in the molecule to be stable, the covalent bonding electrons occupy the lower energy bonding orbital, which may be signified by such symbols as œÉ or œÄ depending on the situation. Corresponding anti-bonding orbitals can be signified by adding an asterisk to get œÉ* or œÄ* orbitals. A non-bonding orbital in a molecule is an orbital with electrons in outer shells which do not participate in bonding and its energy level is the same as that of the constituent atom. Such orbitals can be designated as n orbitals. The electrons in an n orbital are typically lone pairs. UV-Visible Absorption Spectra In polyatomic molecules, different vibrational and rotational energy levels are also involved. Roughly speaking, a molecular energy state, i.e. an eigenstate of the molecular Hamiltonian, is the sum of the electronic, vibrational, rotational, nuclear, and translational components, such that: :E = E_{\\\\rm{electronic}}+E_{\\\\rm{vibrational}}+E_{\\\\rm{rotational}}+E_{\\\\rm{nuclear}}+E_{\\\\rm{translational}}\\\\, where is an eigenvalue of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian (the value of the potential energy surface) at the equilibrium geometry of the molecule. The molecular energy levels are labelled by the molecular term symbols. The specific energies of these components vary with the specific energy state and the substance. Energy level diagrams There are various types of energy level diagrams for bonds between atoms in a molecule. ;Examples :Molecular orbital diagrams, Jablonski diagrams, and Franck‚ÄìCondon diagrams. Energy level transitions An increase in energy level from to resulting from absorption of a photon represented by the red squiggly arrow, and whose energy is A decrease in energy level from to resulting in emission of a photon represented by the red squiggly arrow, and whose energy is Electrons in atoms and molecules can change (make transitions in) energy levels by emitting or absorbing a photon (of electromagnetic radiation), whose energy must be exactly equal to the energy difference between the two levels. Electrons can also be completely removed from a chemical species such as an atom, molecule, or ion. Complete removal of an electron from an atom can be a form of ionization, which is effectively moving the electron out to an orbital with an infinite principal quantum number, in effect so far away so as to have practically no more effect on the remaining atom (ion). For various types of atoms, there are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. ionization energies for removing the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, etc. of the highest energy electrons, respectively, from the atom originally in the ground state. Energy in corresponding opposite quantities can also be released, sometimes in the form of photon energy, when electrons are added to positively charged ions or sometimes atoms. Molecules can also undergo transitions in their vibrational or rotational energy levels. Energy level transitions can also be nonradiative, meaning emission or absorption of a photon is not involved. If an atom, ion, or molecule is at the lowest possible energy level, it and its electrons are said to be in the ground state. If it is at a higher energy level, it is said to be excited, or any electrons that have higher energy than the ground state are excited. Such a species can be excited to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the levels. Conversely, an excited species can go to a lower energy level by spontaneously emitting a photon equal to the energy difference. A photon's energy is equal to Planck's constant () times its frequency () and thus is proportional to its frequency, or inversely to its wavelength (). :, since , the speed of light, equals to Correspondingly, many kinds of spectroscopy are based on detecting the frequency or wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photons to provide information on the material analyzed, including information on the energy levels and electronic structure of materials obtained by analyzing the spectrum. An asterisk is commonly used to designate an excited state. An electron transition in a molecule's bond from a ground state to an excited state may have a designation such as œÉ ‚Üí œÉ*, œÄ ‚Üí œÄ*, or n ‚Üí œÄ* meaning excitation of an electron from a œÉ bonding to a œÉ antibonding orbital, from a œÄ bonding to a œÄ antibonding orbital, or from an n non-bonding to a œÄ antibonding orbital. Theory of Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy Reverse electron transitions for all these types of excited molecules are also possible to return to their ground states, which can be designated as œÉ* ‚Üí œÉ, œÄ* ‚Üí œÄ, or œÄ* ‚Üí n. A transition in an energy level of an electron in a molecule may be combined with a vibrational transition and called a vibronic transition. A vibrational and rotational transition may be combined by rovibrational coupling. In rovibronic coupling, electron transitions are simultaneously combined with both vibrational and rotational transitions. Photons involved in transitions may have energy of various ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum, such as X-ray, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, or microwave radiation, depending on the type of transition. In a very general way, energy level differences between electronic states are larger, differences between vibrational levels are intermediate, and differences between rotational levels are smaller, although there can be overlap. Translational energy levels are practically continuous and can be calculated as kinetic energy using classical mechanics. Higher temperature causes fluid atoms and molecules to move faster increasing their translational energy, and thermally excites molecules to higher average amplitudes of vibrational and rotational modes (excites the molecules to higher internal energy levels). This means that as temperature rises, translational, vibrational, and rotational contributions to molecular heat capacity let molecules absorb heat and hold more internal energy. Conduction of heat typically occurs as molecules or atoms collide transferring the heat between each other. At even higher temperatures, electrons can be thermally excited to higher energy orbitals in atoms or molecules. A subsequent drop of an electron to a lower energy level can release a photon, causing a possibly colored glow. An electron farther from the nucleus has higher potential energy than an electron closer to the nucleus, thus it becomes less bound to the nucleus, since its potential energy is negative and inversely dependent on its distance from the nucleus. Crystalline materials Crystalline solids are found to have energy bands, instead of or in addition to energy levels. Electrons can take on any energy within an unfilled band. At first this appears to be an exception to the requirement for energy levels. However, as shown in band theory, energy bands are actually made up of many discrete energy levels which are too close together to resolve. Within a band the number of levels is of the order of the number of atoms in the crystal, so although electrons are actually restricted to these energies, they appear to be able to take on a continuum of values. The important energy levels in a crystal are the top of the valence band, the bottom of the conduction band, the Fermi level, the vacuum level, and the energy levels of any defect states in the crystal.

Although celestite finds frequent usage in some mineralogical texts, the name has been discredited as a valid mineral name by this organization. is a mineral consisting of strontium sulfate (SrSO4). The mineral is named for its occasional delicate blue color. Celestine and the carbonate mineral strontianite are the principal sources of the element strontium, commonly used in fireworks and in various metal alloys. Etymology Celestine derives its name from the Latin word caelestis meaning celestial,https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/celestine which in turn is derived from the Latin word caelum meaning sky or heaven.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/celestial Occurrence Celestine from the Machow Mine, Poland. Celestine mineral on display at Yale's Peabody Museum Celestine occurs as crystals, and also in compact massive and fibrous forms. It is mostly found in sedimentary rocks, often associated with the minerals gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. The mineral is found worldwide, usually in small quantities. Pale blue crystal specimens are found in Madagascar. White and orange variants also occurred at Yate, Bristol, UK, where it was extracted for commercial purposes until the mid-20thC.http://www.yateheritage.co.uk/history-of-yate/beneath-our-feet.htm The skeletons of the protozoan Acantharea are made of celestine, unlike those of other radiolarians which are made of silica. In carbonate marine sediments, burial dissolution is a recognised mechanism of celestine precipitation. It is sometimes used as a gemstone.Tables of Gemstone Identification By Roger Dedeyne, Ivo Quintens p.174 Geodes Celestine geode section Inside the Crystal Cave geode in Ohio Celestine crystals are found in some geodes. The world's largest known geode, a celestine geode in diameter at its widest point, is located near the village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, on South Bass Island in Lake Erie. The geode has been converted into a viewing cave, Crystal Cave, with the crystals which once composed the floor of the geode removed. The geode has celestine crystals as wide as across, estimated to weigh up to each. Celestine geodes are understood to form by replacement of alabaster nodules consisting of the calcium sulfates gypsum or anhydrite. Calcium sulfate is sparingly soluble, but strontium sulfate is mostly insoluble. Strontium- bearing solutions that come into contact with calcium sulfate nodules dissolve the calcium away, leaving a cavity. The strontium is immediately precipitated as celestine, with the crystals growing into the newly-formed cavity.

It is a rare carbonate mineral and one of only a few strontium minerals. It is a member of the aragonite group. Aragonite group members: aragonite (CaCO3), witherite (BaCO3), strontianite (SrCO3), cerussite (PbCO3) The ideal formula of strontianite is SrCO3, with molar mass 147.63 g, but calcium (Ca) can substitute for up to 27% of the strontium (Sr) cations, and barium (Ba) up to 3.3%. The mineral was named in 1791 for the locality, Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland, where the element strontium had been discovered the previous year. Although good mineral specimens of strontianite are rare, strontium is a fairly common element, with abundance in the Earth's crust of 370 parts per million by weight, 87 parts per million by moles, much more common than copper with only 60 parts per million by weight, 19 by moles. Strontium is never found free in nature. The principal strontium ores are celestine SrSO4 and strontianite SrCO3. The main commercial process for strontium metal production is reduction of strontium oxide with aluminium.  Unit cell  Strontianite is an orthorhombic mineral, belonging to the most symmetrical class in this system, 2/m 2/m 2/m, whose general form is a rhombic dipyramid. The space group is Pmcn. There are four formula units per unit cell (Z = 4) and the unit cell parameters are a = 5.1 √Ö, b = 8.4 √Ö, c = 6.0 √Ö.  Structure  Strontianite is isostructural with aragonite.Klein and Hurlbut (1993) Manual of Mineralogy 21st Edition. Wiley When the CO3 group is combined with large divalent cations with ionic radii greater than 1.0 √Ö, the radius ratios generally do not permit stable 6-fold coordination. For small cations the structure is rhombohedral, but for large cations it is orthorhombic. This is the aragonite structure type with space group Pmcn. In this structure the CO3 groups lie perpendicular to the c axis, in two structural planes, with the CO3 triangular groups of one plane pointing in opposite directions to those of the other. These layers are separated by layers of cations. The CO3 group is slightly non-planar; the carbon atom lies 0.007 √Ö out of the plane of the oxygen atoms. The groups are tilted such that the angle between a plane drawn through the oxygen atoms and a plane parallel to the a-b unit cell plane is 2¬∞40‚Äô.De Villiers, Johan P R (1971) Crystal Structures of Aragonite, Strontianite and Witherite. The American Mineralogist 56:758  Crystal form  Strontianite occurs in several different habits. Crystals are short prismatic parallel to the c axis and often acicular. Calcium-rich varieties often show steep pyramidal forms. Crystals may be pseudo hexagonal due to equal development of different forms. Prism faces are striated horizontally. The mineral also occurs as columnar to fibrous, granular or rounded masses.  Optical properties  Strontianite is colourless, white, gray, light yellow, green or brown, colourless in transmitted light. It may be longitudinally zoned. It is transparent to translucent, with a vitreous (glassy) lustre, resinous on broken surfaces, and a white streak. It is a biaxial(-) mineral. The direction perpendicular to the plane containing the two optic axes is called the optical direction Y. In strontianite Y is parallel to the b crystal axis. The optical direction Z lies in the plane containing the two optic axes and bisects the acute angle between them. In strontianite Z is parallel to the a crystal axis. The third direction X, perpendicular both to Y and to Z, is parallel to the c crystal axis. The refractive indices are close to nŒ± = 1.52, nŒ≤ = 1.66, nŒ≥ = 1.67, with different sources quoting slightly different values: *nŒ± = 1.520, nŒ≤ = 1.667, nŒ≥ = 1.669 *nŒ± = 1.516 ‚Äì 1.520, nŒ≤ = 1.664 ‚Äì 1.667, nŒ≥ = 1.666 ‚Äì 1.668 *nŒ± = 1.517, nŒ≤ = 1.663, nŒ≥ = 1.667 (synthetic material)Speer, J A and Hensley-Dunn, M L (1976) Strontianite composition and physical properties. American Mineralogist 61:1001‚Äì1004 The maximum birefringence Œ¥ is 0.15 and the measured value of 2V is 7¬∞, calculated 12¬∞ to 8¬∞. If the colour of the incident light is changed, then the refractive indices are modified, and the value of 2V changes. This is known as dispersion of the optic axes. For strontianite the effect is weak, with 2V larger for violet light than for red light r < v.  Luminescence  Strontianite is almost always fluorescent. It fluoresces bright yellowish white under shortwave, mediumwave and longwave ultraviolet radiation. If the luminescence persists after the ultraviolet source is switched off the sample is said to be phosphorescent. Most strontianite phosphoresces a strong, medium duration, yellowish white after exposure to all three wavelengths.The Mineralogical Record (2006) 37-1:44 It is also fluorescent and phosphorescent in X-rays and electron beams. All materials will glow red hot if they are heated to a high enough temperature (provided they do not decompose first); some materials become luminescent at much lower temperatures, and this is known as thermoluminescence. Strontianite is sometimes thermoluminescent.  Physical properties  Cleavage is nearly perfect parallel to one set of prism faces, {110}, and poor on {021}. Traces of cleavage have been observed on {010}. Twinning is very common, with twin plane {110}. The twins are usually contact twins; in a contact twin the two individuals appear to be reflections of each other in the twin plane. Penetration twins of strontainite are rarer; penetration twins are made up of interpenetrating individuals that are related to each other by rotation about a twin axis. Repeated twins are made up of three or more individuals twinned according to the same law. If all the twin planes are parallel then the twin is polysynthetic, otherwise it is cyclic. In strontianite repeated twinning forms cyclic twins with three or four individuals, or polysynthetic twins. The mineral is brittle, and breaks with a subconchoidal to uneven fracture. It is quite soft, with a Mohs hardness of , between calcite and fluorite. The specific gravity of the pure end member with no calcium substituting for strontium is 3.78, but most samples contain some calcium, which is lighter than strontium, giving a lower specific gravity, in the range 3.74 to 3.78. Substitutions of the heavier ions barium and/or lead increase the specific gravity, although such substitutions are never very abundant. Strontianite is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid HCl and it is not radioactive.  Environment and associations  Strontianite is an uncommon low-temperature hydrothermal mineral formed in veins in limestone, marl, and chalk, and in geodes and concretions. It occurs rarely in hydrothermal metallic veins but is common in carbonatites. It most likely crystallises at or near 100 ¬∞C. Its occurrence in open vugs and veins suggests crystallisation at very low pressures, probably at most equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the ground water. Under appropriate conditions it alters to celestine SrSO4, and it is itself found as an alteration from celestine. These two minerals are often found in association, together with baryte, calcite, harmotome and sulfur.  Occurrences  Strontianite from Strontian, Scotland  Type locality  The type locality is Strontian, North West Highlands (Argyllshire), Scotland, UK. The type material occurred in veins in gneiss. Other UK localities include Brownley Hill Mine (Bloomsberry Horse Level), Nenthead, Alston Moor District, North Pennines, North and Western Region (Cumberland), Cumbria, England, associated with a suite of primary minerals (bournonite, millerite and ullmannite) which are not common in other Mississippi Valley-type deposits.The Mineralogical Record (2010) 41-1:62 supplement Dresserite and Strontianite from the Francon quarry, Canada  Canada  The Francon quarry, Montr√©al, Qu√©bec. Strontianite is very common at the Francon Quarry, in a great variety of habits. It is a late stage mineral, sometimes found as multiple generations. It is found as translucent to opaque, white to pale yellow or beige generally smooth surfaced spheroids, hemispheres and compact spherical and botryoidal aggregates to 10 cm in diameter, and as spheres consisting of numerous radiating acicular crystals, up to 1 cm across. Also as tufts, parallel bundles, and sheaf-like clusters of fibrous to acicular crystals, and as white, finely granular porcelaneous and waxy globular aggregates. Transparent, pale pink, columnar to tabular sixling twins up to 1 cm in diameter have been found, and aggregates of stacked stellate sixling twins consisting of transparent, pale yellow tabular crystals. Another Canadian occurrence is at Nepean, Ontario, in vein deposits in limestone. Strontianite from the Dreislar Mine, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany  Germany  Commercially important deposits occur in marls in Westphalia, and it is also found with zeolites at Oberschaffhausen, B√∂tzingen, Kaiserstuhl, Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  India  In Trichy (Tiruchirappalli; Tiruchi), Tiruchirapalli District, Tamil Nadu, it occurs with celestine SrSO4, gypsum and phosphate nodules in clay.  Mexico  It occurs in the Sierra Mojada District, with celestine in a lead-silver deposit.  Russia  It occurs in the Kirovskii apatite mine, Kukisvumchorr Mt, Khibiny Massif, Kola Peninsula, Murmanskaja Oblast', Northern Region, in late hydrothermal assemblages in cavities in pegmatites, associated with kukharenkoite-(La), microcline, albite, calcite, nenadkevichite, hilairite, catapleiite, donnayite-(Y), synchysite-(Ce), pyrite and others.The Mineralogical Record (2004) 35-4:355 It also occurs at Yukspor Mountain, Khibiny Massif, Kola Peninsula, Murmanskaja Oblast', Northern Region, in an aegerine-natrolite-microcline vein in foyaite, associated with aegirine, anatase, ancylite-(Ce), barylite, catapleiite, cerite-(Ce), cerite-(La), chabazite-(Ca), edingtonite, fluorapatite, galena, ilmenite, microcline, natrolite, sphalerite and vanadinite.The Mineralogical Record (2004) 35-2:176 At the same locality it was found in alkaline pegmatite veins associated with clinobarylite, natrolite, aegirine, microcline, catapleiite, fluorapatite, titanite, fluorite, galena, sphalerite, annite, astrophyllite, lorenzenite, labuntsovite-Mn, kuzmenkoite-Mn, cerite-(Ce), edingtonite, ilmenite and calcite.The Mineralogical Record 35-4:347 (2004)  US  In the Gulf coast of Louisiana and Texas, strontianite occurs with celestine in calcite cap rock of salt domes. At the Minerva Number 1 Mine (Ozark-Mahoning Number 1 Mine) Ozark-Mahoning Group, Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, in the Kentucky Fluorspar District, Hardin County strontanite occurs as white, brown or rarely pink tufts and bowties of acicular crystals with slightly curved terminations.Rocks & Minerals (2010) 85-3:212 In the Silurian Lockport Group, Central and Western New York strontianite is observed in cavities in eastern Lockport, where it occurs as small white radiating sprays of acicular crystals.Rocks & Minerals (2009) 84-4:332 In Schoharie County, New York, it occurs in geodes and veins with celestine and calcite in limestone, and in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, it occurs with aragonite, again in limestone.

The chemical state of the water varies widely between different classes of hydrates, some of which were so labeled before their chemical structure was understood. Chemical nature Organic chemistry In organic chemistry, a hydrate is a compound formed by the hydration, i.e. \\"Addition of water or of the elements of water (i.e. H and OH) to a molecular entity\\". For example: ethanol, CH3‚àíCH2‚àíOH, is the product of the hydration reaction of ethene, CH2=CH2, formed by the addition of H to one C and OH to the other C, and so can be considered as the hydrate of ethene. A molecule of water may be eliminated, for example, by the action of sulfuric acid. Another example is chloral hydrate, CCl3‚àíCH(OH)2, which can be formed by reaction of water with chloral, CCl3‚àíCH=O. Many organic molecules, as well as inorganic molecules, form crystals that incorporate water into the crystalline structure without chemical alteration of the organic molecule (water of crystallization). The sugar trehalose, for example, exists in both an anhydrous form (melting point 203 ¬∞C) and as a dihydrate (melting point 97 ¬∞C). Protein crystals commonly have as much as 50% water content. Molecules are also labeled as hydrates for historical reasons not covered above. Glucose, C6H12O6, was originally thought of as C6(H2O)6 and described as a carbohydrate. Methanol is often sold as \\"methyl hydrate\\", implying the incorrect formula CH3OH2, while the correct formula is CH3‚àíOH. Hydrate formation is common for active ingredient. Many manufacturing processes provide an opportunity for hydrates to form and the state of hydration can be changed with environmental humidity and time. The state of hydration of an active pharmaceutical ingredient can significantly affect the solubility and dissolution rate and therefore its bioavailability.Surov, Artem O., Nikita A.

Crystal Growth & Design (2019). . Inorganic chemistry Hydrates are inorganic salts \\"containing water molecules combined in a definite ratio as an integral part of the crystal\\" that are either bound to a metal center or that have crystallized with the metal complex. Such hydrates are also said to contain water of crystallization or water of hydration. If the water is heavy water, where the hydrogen involved is the isotope deuterium, then the term deuterate may be used in place of hydrate. {style=\\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border:1px solid black;\\"  190px  190px - align=\\"center\\"  Anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride CoCl2 Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate CoCl2¬∑6H2O } A colorful example is cobalt(II) chloride, which turns from blue to red upon hydration, and can therefore be used as a water indicator. The notation \\"hydrated compound‚ãÖnH2O\\", where n is the number of water molecules per formula unit of the salt, is commonly used to show that a salt is hydrated. The n is usually a low integer, though it is possible for fractional values to occur. For example, in a monohydrate n = 1, and in a hexahydrate n = 6. Numerical prefixes of Greek origin are:Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry. IUPAC Recommendations 2005. Table IV Multiplicative Prefixes, p. 258. A hydrate that has lost water is referred to as an anhydride; the remaining water, if any exists, can only be removed with very strong heating. A substance that does not contain any water is referred to as anhydrous. Some anhydrous compounds are hydrated so easily that they are said to be hygroscopic and are used as drying agents or desiccants. Clathrate hydrates Clathrate hydrates (also known as gas hydrates, gas clathrates, etc.) are water ice with gas molecules trapped within; they are a form of clathrate. An important example is methane hydrate (also known as gas hydrate, methane clathrate, etc.). Nonpolar molecules such as methane can form clathrate hydrates with water, especially under high pressure. Although there is no hydrogen bonding between water and guest molecules when methane is the guest molecule of the clathrate, guest‚Äìhost hydrogen bonding often forms when the guest is a larger organic molecule such as tetrahydrofuran. In such cases the guest‚Äìhost hydrogen bonds result in the formation of L-type Bjerrum defects in the clathrate lattice. Stability The stability of hydrates is generally determined by the nature of the compounds, their temperature, and the relative humidity (if they are exposed to air).

The algorithm  ElGamal encryption consists of three components: the key generator, the encryption algorithm, and the decryption algorithm.  Key generation  The first party, Alice, generates a key pair as follows: * Generate an efficient description of a cyclic group G\\\\, of order q\\\\, with generator g. Let e represent the unit element of G. * Choose an integer x randomly from \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, q-1\\\\\\\\}. * Compute h := g^x. * The public key consists of the values (G,q,g,h). Alice publishes this public key and retains x as her private key, which must be kept secret.  Encryption  A second party, Bob, encrypts a message M to Alice under her public key (G,q,g,h) as follows: * Map the message M to an element m of G using a reversible mapping function. * Choose an integer y randomly from \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, q-1\\\\\\\\}. * Compute s := h^y. This is called the shared secret. * Compute c_1 := g^y. * Compute c_2 := m \\\\cdot s. * Bob sends the ciphertext (c_1,c_2) to Alice. Note that if one knows both the ciphertext (c_1,c_2) and the plaintext m one can easily find the shared secret s, since c_2 \\\\cdot m^{-1} = s. Therefore, a new y and hence a new s is generated for every message to improve security. For this reason, y is also called an ephemeral key.  Decryption  Alice decrypts a ciphertext (c_1,c_2) with her private key x as follows: * Compute s := c_1^x. Since c_1 = g^y, c_1^x = g^{xy} = h^y and thus it is the same shared secret that was used by Bob in encryption. * Compute s^{-1}, the inverse of s in the group G. This can be computed in one of several ways. If G is a subgroup of a multiplicative group of integers modulo n, the modular multiplicative inverse can be computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. An alternative is to compute s^{-1} as c_1^{q-x}. This is the inverse of s because of Lagrange's theorem, since s \\\\cdot c_1^{q-x} = g^{xy} \\\\cdot g^{(q-x)y} = (g^{q})^y = e^y = e. * Compute m := c_2 \\\\cdot s^{-1}. This calculation produces the original message m, because c_2 = m \\\\cdot s; hence c_2 \\\\cdot s^{-1} = (m \\\\cdot s) \\\\cdot s^{-1} = m \\\\cdot e = m. * Map m back to the plaintext message M.  Practical use  Like most public key systems, the ElGamal cryptosystem is usually used as part of a hybrid cryptosystem where the message itself is encrypted using a symmetric cryptosystem and ElGamal is then used to encrypt only the symmetric key. This is because asymmetric cryptosystems like ElGamal are usually slower than symmetric ones for the same level of security, so it is faster to encrypt the message, which can be arbitrarily large, with a symmetric cipher, and then use ElGamal only to encrypt the symmetric key, which usually is quite small compared to the size of the message.  Security  The security of the ElGamal scheme depends on the properties of the underlying group G as well as any padding scheme used on the messages. If the computational Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption (CDH) holds in the underlying cyclic group G, then the encryption function is one-way. If the decisional Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption (DDH) holds in G, then ElGamal achieves semantic security; . Semantic security is not implied by the computational Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption alone. See decisional Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption for a discussion of groups where the assumption is believed to hold. ElGamal encryption is unconditionally malleable, and therefore is not secure under chosen ciphertext attack. For example, given an encryption (c_1, c_2) of some (possibly unknown) message m, one can easily construct a valid encryption (c_1, 2 c_2) of the message 2m. To achieve chosen-ciphertext security, the scheme must be further modified, or an appropriate padding scheme must be used. Depending on the modification, the DDH assumption may or may not be necessary. Other schemes related to ElGamal which achieve security against chosen ciphertext attacks have also been proposed. The Cramer‚ÄìShoup cryptosystem is secure under chosen ciphertext attack assuming DDH holds for G. Its proof does not use the random oracle model. Another proposed scheme is DHAES, whose proof requires an assumption that is weaker than the DDH assumption.  Efficiency  ElGamal encryption is probabilistic, meaning that a single plaintext can be encrypted to many possible ciphertexts, with the consequence that a general ElGamal encryption produces a 2:1 expansion in size from plaintext to ciphertext. Encryption under ElGamal requires two exponentiations; however, these exponentiations are independent of the message and can be computed ahead of time if need be. Decryption requires one exponentiation and one computation of a group inverse which can however be easily combined into just one exponentiation.

Amherst is best known as the architect of Britain's successful campaign to conquer the territory of New France during the Seven Years' War. Under his command, British forces captured the cities of Louisbourg, Quebec City and Montreal, as well as several major fortresses. He was also the first British Governor General in the territories that eventually became Canada. Numerous places and streets are named for him, in both Canada and the United States. Amherst's legacy is controversial due to his expressed desire to exterminate the race of indigenous people during Pontiac's War, and his advocacy of biological warfare in the form of gifting blankets infected with smallpox as a weapon, notably at the Siege of Fort Pitt. This has led to a reconsideration of his legacy. In 2019, the City of Montreal removed his name from a street in the city, renaming it Rue Atateken, from the Kanien'k√©ha Mohawk language.\\"Amherst Street becomes 'Atateken,' symbolizing fraternity and peace\\" The town of Amherst, Nova Scotia is also considering renaming in light of recent movements to reconsider the naming of \\"towns, streets and monuments that celebrate past war heroes whom, seen through today's ethical lens are not people who behaved in ways that we respect today,\\" as is the town of Amherstburg, Ontario. Life Early life Born the son of Jeffrey Amherst (d. 1750), a Kentish lawyer,Chartrand p. 24 and Elizabeth Amherst (n√©e Kerrill), Jeffery Amherst was born in Sevenoaks, England, on 29 January 1717.Heathcote p. 23 At an early age, he became a page to the Duke of Dorset. Amherst became an ensign in the Grenadier Guards in 1735.Mayo p. 8 Amherst served in the War of the Austrian Succession becoming an aide to General John Ligonier and participating in the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743 and the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745.Mayo pp. 11‚Äì15 Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 25 December 1745, he also saw action at the Battle of Rocoux in October 1746.Heathcote p. 24 He then became an aide to the Duke of Cumberland, the commander of the British forces, and saw further action at the Battle of Lauffeld in July 1747. Seven Years' War =Germany= In February 1756, Amherst was appointed commissar to the Hessian forces that had been assembled to defend Hanover as part of the Army of Observation: as it appeared likely a French invasion attempt against Britain itself was imminent, Amherst was ordered in April to arrange the transportation of thousands of the Germans to southern England to bolster Britain's defences.Mayo pp. 34‚Äì37 He was made colonel of the 15th Regiment of Foot on 12 June 1756. By 1757 as the immediate danger to Britain had passed the troops were moved back to Hanover to join a growing army under the Duke of Cumberland and Amherst fought with the Hessians under Cumberland's command at the Battle of Hastenbeck in July 1757: the Allied defeat there forced the army into a steady retreat northwards to Stade on the North Sea coast.Mayo pp. 37‚Äì38 Amherst was left dispirited by the retreat and by the Convention of Klosterzeven by which Hanover agreed to withdraw from the war: he began to prepare to disband the Hessian troops under his command, only to receive word that the Convention had been repudiated and the Allied force was being reformed.Mayo pp. 40‚Äì42 =Louisbourg= Amherst gained fame during the Seven Years' War, particularly in the North American campaign known in the United States as the French and Indian War when he led the British attack on Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island in June 1758. In the wake of this action, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the British army in North America and colonel-in-chief of the 60th (Royal American) Regiment in September 1758. Amherst then led an army against French troops on Lake Champlain, where he captured Fort Ticonderoga in July 1759, while another army under William Johnson took Niagara also in July 1759 and James Wolfe besieged and eventually captured Quebec with a third army in September 1759. Amherst served as the nominal Crown Governor of Virginia from 12 September 1759. =Montreal= Grateful Reflexions on the Signal Appearances of Divine Providence for Great Britain and its Colonies in America. 1760 From July 1760, Amherst led an army down the Saint Lawrence River from Fort Oswego, joined with Brigadier Murray from Quebec and Brigadier Haviland from Ile-aux-Noix in a three-way pincer, and captured Montreal, ending French rule in North America on 8 September. He infuriated the French commanders by refusing them the honours of war; the Chevalier de L√©vis burned the colours rather than surrendering them,Hayes, p. 77 to highlight his differences with Vaudreuil for later political advantage back in France. Half the continent changed hands \\"at the scratch of a pen.\\" The British settlers were relieved and proclaimed a day of thanksgiving. Boston newspapers recount how the occasion was celebrated with a parade, a grand dinner in Faneuil Hall, music, bonfires, and firing of cannon. Rev. Thomas Foxcroft of the First Church in Boston offered thus:Parkman, Francis: \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" In recognition of this victory, Amherst was appointed Governor-General of British North America in September 1760 and promoted to major-general on 29 November 1760. He was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath on 11 April 1761. =Caribbean= From his base at New York, Amherst oversaw the dispatch of troops under Monckton and Haviland to take part in British expeditions in the West Indies that led to the British capture of Dominica in 1761 and Martinique and Cuba in 1762. Pontiac's War The uprising of many Native American tribes in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region, commonly referred to as Pontiac's War after one of its most notable leaders, began in early 1763. From 1753, when the French first invaded the territory, to February 1763, when peace was formally declared between the English and French, the Six Nations and tenant tribes always maintained that both the French and the British must remain east of the Allegheny Mountains. After the British failed to keep their word to withdraw from the Ohio and Allegheny valleys, a loose confederation of Native American tribes including the Delawares, the Shawnees, the Senecas, the Mingoes, the Mohicans, the Miamis, the Ottawas and the Wyandots, who were enraged with British post-war occupation of the region, banded together in an effort to drive the British out of their territory.The Indian wars of Pennsylvania; C. Hale Sipe; The Telegraph Press; 1921; pp. 407‚Äì438Richard Middleton, Pontiac's War, pp. 1‚Äì128. =Biological warfare involving smallpox= One of the most infamous and well documented issues during Pontiac's War was the use of biological warfare against the Native Americans. The British Army attempted use of smallpox against Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763. During a parley in midst of the siege on 24 June 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief enclosed in small metal boxes that had been exposed to smallpox, in an attempt to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege.Anderson, Crucible of War, 541‚Äì42; Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447n26. William Trent, the trader turned militia commander who had come up with the plan, sent a bill to the British Army indicating that the purpose of giving the blankets was \\"to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.\\" The invoice's approval confirms that the British command endorsed Trent's actions. Reporting on parleys with Delaware chiefs on 24 June, Trent wrote: '[We] gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.' The military hospital records confirm that two blankets and handkerchiefs were 'taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.' The fort commander paid for these items, which he certified 'were had for the uses above mentioned.'Kiernan, p. 245 A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and they seemingly had not contracted smallpox. A month later the use of smallpox blankets was discussed by Amherst himself in letters to Colonel Henry Bouquet. Amherst, having learned that smallpox had broken out among the garrison at Fort Pitt, and after learning of the loss of his forts at Venango, Le Boeuf and Presqu'Isle, wrote to Colonel Bouquet:Fenn, Elizabeth A. Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst ; The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March 2000 :\\"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\\" Bouquet, who was already marching to relieve Fort Pitt, agreed with this suggestion in a postscript when he responded to Amherst just days later on 13 July 1763: :\\"P.S. I will try to inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is pity to oppose good men against them, I wish we could make use of the Spaniard's Method, and hunt them with English Dogs. Supported by Rangers, and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that Vermine.\\" In response, also in a postscript, Amherst replied: :\\"P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too great a Distance to think of that at present.\\" Amherst was summoned home, ostensibly so that he could be consulted on future military plans in North America, and was replaced pro tem as Commander-in-Chief, North America by Thomas Gage. Amherst expected to be praised for his conquest of Canada, however, once in London, he was instead asked to account for the recent Native American rebellion.Anderson pp. 552‚Äì553 He was forced to defend his conduct, and faced complaints made by William Johnson and George Croghan, who lobbied the Board of Trade for his removal and permanent replacement by Gage. He was also severely criticised by military subordinates on both sides of the Atlantic.Middleton, Pontiac's War, 127‚Äì28. O'Toole p. 249 Nevertheless, Amherst was promoted to lieutenant-general on 26 March 1765, and became colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Foot in November 1768.Heathcote p. 25 On 26 March 1767 Jeffrey Amherst married Elizabeth, daughter of General George Cary (portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1767). Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. On 22 October 1772, Amherst was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and he soon gained the confidence of George III, who had initially hoped the position would go to a member of the Royal Family.Patterson p. 93 On 6 November 1772, he became a member of the Privy Council. American Revolutionary War Amherst was raised to the peerage on 14 May 1776, as Baron Amherst, of Holmesdale in the County of Kent. On 24 March 1778 he was promoted to full general and, in April 1778, he became Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, which gave him a seat in the Cabinet. In 1778, when the British commander in North America, William Howe, requested to be relieved, Amherst was considered as a replacement by the government: however, his insistence that it would require 75,000 troops to fully defeat the rebellion was not acceptable to the government, and Henry Clinton was instead chosen to take over from Howe in America.Hibbert. Redcoats and Rebels p. 211 Following the British setback at Saratoga, Amherst successfully argued for a limited war in North America, keeping footholds along the coast, defending Canada, East and West Florida, and the West Indies while putting more effort into the war at sea.Hibbert. Redcoats and Rebels. p209 On 7 November 1778 the King and Queen visited Amherst at his home, Montreal Park, in Kent and on 24 April 1779 he became colonel of the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. Invasion scare A long-standing plan of the French had been the concept of an invasion of Great Britain which they hoped would lead to a swift end to the war if it was successful: in 1779 Spain entered the war on the side of France, and the increasingly depleted state of British home forces made an invasion more appealing and Amherst organised Britain's land defences in anticipation of the invasion which never materialised. Gordon Riots In June 1780, Amherst oversaw the British army as they suppressed the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots in London: after the outbreak of rioting Amherst deployed the small London garrison of Horse and Foot Guards as best as he could but was hindered by the reluctance of the civil magistrates to authorise decisive action against the rioters.Mansel, page 126 Line troops and militia were brought in from surrounding counties, swelling the forces at Amherst's disposal to over 15,000 many of whom were quartered in tents in Hyde Park and a form of Martial Law was declared, giving the troops the authority to fire on crowds if the Riot Act had first been read; although order was eventually restored, Amherst was personally alarmed by the failure of the authorities to suppress the riots.Hibbert King Mob. p. 102 In the wake of the Gordon Riots, Amherst was forced to resign as Commander-in-Chief in February 1782 and was replaced by Henry Conway. On 23 March 1782 he became captain and colonel of the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards. French Revolutionary Wars On 8 July 1788, he became colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards and on 30 August 1788 he was created Baron Amherst (this time with the territorial designation of Montreal in the County of Kent) with a special provision that would allow this title to pass to his nephew (as Amherst was childless, the Holmesdale title became extinct upon his death). With the advent of the French Revolutionary Wars, Amherst was recalled as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in January 1793: however is generally criticised for allowing the armed forces to slide into acute decline, a direct cause of the failure of the early campaigns in the Low Countries: Pitt the Younger said of him \\"his age, and perhaps his natural temper, are little suited to the activity and the energy which the present moment calls for\\".Burne p. 209 Horace Walpole called him \\"that log of wood whose stupidity and incapacity are past belief\\".Burne p. 227 \\"He allowed innumerable abuses to grow up in the army‚Ä¶ He kept his command, though almost in his dotage, with a tenacity that cannot be too much censured\\".Burne p. 228 He retired from that post in February 1795, to be replaced by the Duke of York, and was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 30 July 1796. He retired to his home at Montreal Park and died on 3 August 1797. He was buried in the Parish Church at Sevenoaks. Family In 1753 he married Jane Dalison (1723‚Äì1765). Following her death he married Elizabeth Cary (1740‚Äì1830), daughter of Lieutenant General George Cary (1712‚Äì1792),G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

Mi'kmaq historian Daniel N. Paul, who referred to Amherst as motivated by white supremacist beliefs, also supports a name change, saying: \\"in the future I don't think there should ever be anything named after people who committed what can be described as crimes against humanity.\\" In February 2016, a spokesperson for Parks Canada said it would review the matter after a proper complaint is filed; \\"Should there be a formal request from the public to change the name of the National Historic Site, Parks Canada would engage with the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada for its recommendation.\\" An online petition was launched by Sark to satisfy this formal request requirement on 20 February 2016.Removal of General Amherst's name from Parks Canada; Change.Org; 20 February 2016 The park is known as Port-la-Joye‚ÄìFort Amherst National Historic SitePort-la-Joye‚ÄìFort Amherst and one of Parks Canada's partners for the site is the Mi'kmaq Confederacy of PEI.Partners ‚Äì Partenaires In 2009, Montreal City Councillor Nicolas Montmorency officially asked that Rue Amherst be renamed: \\"it is totally unacceptable that a man who made comments supporting the extermination of Native Americans to be honoured in this way\\". On 13 September 2017, the city of Montreal decided that the street bearing his name would be renamed. On 21 June 2019, the street was officially renamed Rue Atateken, atateken being a Kanien'keh√° word describing \\"those with whom one shares values,\\" according to Kanehsatake historian Hilda Nicholas. In 2016, Amherst College dropped its \\"Lord Jeffery\\" mascot at the instigation of the students. It also renamed the Lord Jeffery Inn, a campus hotel owned by the college, to the Inn on Boltwood in early 2019.

It is mainly distinguished by the performance venue, which might be a pub, a casino, a hotel, a restaurant, or a nightclub with a stage for performances. The audience, often dining or drinking, does not typically dance but usually sits at tables. Performances are usually introduced by a master of ceremonies or MC. The entertainment, as done by an ensemble of actors and according to its European origins, is often (but not always) oriented towards adult audiences and of a clearly underground nature. In the United States striptease, burlesque, drag shows, or a solo vocalist with a pianist, as well as the venues which offer this entertainment, are often advertised as cabarets. Etymology The term originally came from Picard language or Walloon language words camberete or cambret for a small room (12th century). The first printed use of the word kaberet is found in a document from 1275 in Tournai. The term was used since the 13th century in Middle Dutch to mean an inexpensive inn or restaurant (caberet, cabret). The word cambret, itself probably derived from an earlier form of chambrette, little room, or from the Norman French chamber meaning tavern, itself derived from the Late Latin word camera meaning an arched roof. National history French taverns Cabarets had appeared in Paris by at least the late fifteenth century. They were distinguished from taverns because they served food as well as wine, the table was covered with a cloth, and the price was charged by the plate, not the mug., page 737 They were not particularly associated with entertainment even if musicians sometimes performed in both.Jim Chevallier, A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites, 2018, , pp. 67-80 Early on, cabarets were considered better than taverns; by the end of the sixteenth century, they were the preferred place to dine out. In the seventeenth century, a clearer distinction emerged when taverns were limited to selling wine, and later to serving roast meats. Cabarets were frequently used as meeting places for writers, actors, friends and artists. Writers such as La Fontaine, Moliere and Jean Racine were known to frequent a cabaret called the Mouton Blanc on rue du Vieux-Colombier, and later the Croix de Lorraine on the modern rue Bourg-Tibourg. In 1773 French poets, painters, musicians and writers began to meet in a cabaret called Le Caveau on rue de Buci, where they composed and sang songs. The Caveau continued until 1816, when it was forced to close because its clients wrote songs mocking the royal government. French music venues The Caf√© des Aveugles in the cellars of the Palais-Royal (beginning of the 19th century) In the 18th century the caf√©-concert or caf√©-chantant appeared, which offered food along with music, singers, or magicians. The most famous was the Cafe des Aveugles in the cellars of the Palais-Royal, which had a small orchestra of blind musicians. In the early 19th century many caf√©s-chantants appeared around the city; the most famous were the Caf√© des Ambassadeurs (1843) on the Champs-√âlys√©es and the Eldorado (1858) on boulevard Strasbourg. By 1900, there were more than 150 caf√©s-chantants in Paris.Fierro (1996), page 744 The first cabaret in the modern sense was Le Chat Noir in the Bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre, created in 1881 by Rodolphe Salis, a theatrical agent and entrepreneur. It combined music and other entertainment with political commentary and satire.(Haine 8). The Chat Noir brought together the wealthy and famous of Paris with the Bohemians and artists of Montmartre and the Pigalle. Its clientele a mixture of writers and painters, of journalists and students, of employees and high-livers, as well as models, prostitutes and true grand dames searching for exotic experiences.\\"Cited in Fierro, Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris, pg. 738 The host was Salis himself, calling himself a gentleman-cabaretier; he began each show with a monologue mocking the wealthy, ridiculing the deputies of the National Assembly, and making jokes about the events of the day. The cabaret was too small for the crowds trying to get in; at midnight on June 10, 1885 Salis and his customers moved down the street to a larger new club at 12 rue de Laval, which had a decor described as \\"A sort of Beirut with Chinese influences.\\" The composer Eric Satie, after finishing his studies at the Conservatory, earned his living playing the piano at the Chat Noir. The composer Eric Satie playing the piano at Le Chat Noir (1880s) By 1896 there were fifty-six cabarets and cafes with music in Paris, along with a dozen music halls. The cabarets did not have a high reputation; one critic wrote in 1897 that \\"they sell drinks which are worth fifteen centimes along with verses which, for the most part, are worth nothing.\\"cited in Fierro (1996), page 738) The traditional cabarets, with monologues and songs and little decor, were replaced by more specialized venues; some, like the Boite a Fursy (1899), specialized in current events, politics and satire. Some were purely theatrical, producing short scenes of plays. Some focused on the macabre or erotic. The Caberet de la fin du Monde had servers dressed as Greek and Roman gods and presented living tableaus that were between erotic and pornographic.Fierro (1996) page 738 By the end of the century there were only a few cabarets of the old style remaining where artists and bohemians gathered. They included the Cabaret des noctambules on Rue Champollion on the Left Bank; the Lapin Agile at Montmartre; and Le Soleil d'or at the corner of the quai Saint-Michel and boulevard Saint-Michel, where poets including Guillaume Apollinaire and Andr√© Salmon met to share their work. The music hall, first invented in London, appeared in Paris in 1862. It offered more lavish musical and theatrical productions, with elaborate costumes, singing and dancing. The theaters of Paris, fearing competition from the music halls, had a law passed by the National Assembly forbidding music hall performers to wear costumes, dance, wear wigs, or recite dialogue. The law was challenged by the owner of the music hall Eldorado in 1867, who put a former famous actress from the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on stage to recite verse from Corneille and Racine. The public took the side of the music halls, and the law was repealed.Fierro (1996), page 1006 The Moulin Rouge in 1893 1896 advertisement for a tour of the first French cabaret show, Le Chat Noir. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889 by the Catalan Joseph Oller. It was greatly prominent because of the large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and √âdith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. The Olympia, also run by Oller, was the first to be called a music hall; it opened in 1893, followed by the Alhambra Music Hall in 1902, and the Printania in 1903. The Printania, open only in summer, had a large music garden which seated twelve thousand spectators, and produced dinner shows which presented twenty-three different acts, including singers, acrobats, horses, mimes, jugglers, lions, bears and elephants, with two shows a day.Fierro (1996), page=1006 In the 20th century, the competition from motion pictures forced the dance halls to put on shows that were more spectacular and more complex. In 1911, the producer Jacques Charles of the Olympia Paris created the grand staircase as a setting for his shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Berg√®re which had been founded in 1869. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris, directed by Leon Volterra and then Henri Varna, presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Le Lido on the Champs-√âlys√©es opened in 1946, presenting √âdith Piaf, Laurel & Hardy, Shirley MacLaine, Marlene Dietrich, Maurice Chevalier and No√´l Coward. The Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. The Olympia Paris went through a number of years as a movie theater before being revived as a music hall and concert stage in 1954. Performers there included Piaf, Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. A handful of music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city; and a number of more traditional cabarets, with music and satire, can be found. Dutch (from 1885) In the Netherlands, cabaret or kleinkunst (literally: \\"small art\\") is a popular form of entertainment, usually performed in theatres. The birth date of Dutch cabaret is usually set at August 19, 1895.Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies (2004) Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1900, the age of bourgeois culture , p.507 In Amsterdam, there is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). It is often a mixture of (stand-up) comedy, theatre, and music and often includes social themes and political satire. In the twentieth century, \\"the big three\\" were Wim Sonneveld, Wim Kan, and Toon Hermans. Nowadays, many cabaret shows of popular \\"cabaretiers\\" (performers of cabaret) are being broadcast on national television, especially on New Year's Eve, when you can choose from several special cabaret shows in which the cabaretier usually reflects on large events of the past year.:nl:Oudejaarsconference German (from 1901) German Kabarett developed from 1901, with the creation of the √úberbrettl (Superstage) venue, and by the Weimar era in the mid-1920s, the Kabarett performances were characterized by political satire and gallows humor. It shared the characteristic atmosphere of intimacy with the French cabaret from which it was imported, but the gallows humor was a distinct German aspect.(1997) The new encyclopaedia Britannica , Volume 2, p.702 quote: Polish (from 1905) The Polish kabaret is a popular form of live (often televised) entertainment involving a comedy troupe, and consisting mostly of comedy sketches, monologues, stand up comedy, songs and political satire (often hidden behind double entendre to fool censors). It traces its origins to Zielony Balonik, a famous literary cabaret founded in Krak√≥w by local poets, writers and artists during the final years of the Partitions of Poland.The Little Green Balloon (Zielony Balonik). Akademia Pe≈Çni ≈ªycia, Krak√≥w. Zielony Balonik. 2011 Instytut KsiƒÖ≈ºki, Poland. In post-war Poland it is almost always associated with the troupe (often on tour), not the venue; pre-war revue shows (with female dancers) were long gone. American (from 1911) A long-established cabaret venue in Manhattan, New York American cabaret was imported from French cabaret by Jesse Louis Lasky in 1911.Vogel, Shane (2009) The scene of Harlem cabaret: race, sexuality, performance , ch.1, p.39Erenberg, Lewis A. (1984) Steppin' out: New York nightlife and the transformation of American culture, 1890-1930 pp.75-76Malnig, Julie (1992) Dancing till dawn: a century of exhibition ballroom dance , p.95 In the United States, cabaret diverged into several different styles of performance mostly due to the influence of jazz music. Chicago cabaret focused intensely on the larger band ensembles and reached its peak during Roaring Twenties, under the Prohibition Era, where it was featured in the speakeasies and steakhouses. New York cabaret never developed to feature a great deal of social commentary. When New York cabarets featured jazz, they tended to focus on famous vocalists like Nina Simone, Bette Midler, Eartha Kitt, Peggy Lee, and Hildegarde rather than instrumental musicians. Julius Monk's annual revues established the standard for New York cabaret during the late 1950s and '60s. Cabaret in the United States began to decline in the 1960s, due to the rising popularity of rock concert shows, television variety shows, and general comedy theaters. However, it remained in some Las Vegas-style dinner shows, such as the Tropicana, with fewer comedy segments. The art form still survives in various musical formats, as well as in the stand-up comedy format, and in popular drag show performances. The late 20th and early 21st century saw a revival of American cabaret, particularly in New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Philadelphia, Orlando, Tulsa, Asheville, North Carolina, and Kansas City, Missouri, as new generations of performers reinterpret the old forms in both music and theater. Many contemporary cabaret groups in the United States and elsewhere feature a combination of original music, burlesque and political satire. In New York City, since 1985, successful, enduring or innovative cabaret acts have been honored by the annual Bistro Awards.Hall, Kevin Scott. \\"@ the 2010 Bistro Awards\\" . Edge magazine, April 15, 2010 The Ani Mru Mru Polish cabaret group performing in Edinburgh in 2007 British (from 1912) The Cabaret Theatre Club, later known as The Cave of the Golden Calf, was opened by Frida Strindberg (modelled on the Kaberett Fledermaus in Strindberg's native Vienna) in a basement at 9 Heddon Street, London, in 1912. She intended her club to be an avant-garde meeting place for bohemian writers and artists, with decorations by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Wyndham Lewis, but it rapidly came to be seen as an amusing place for high society and went bankrupt in 1914. The Cave was nevertheless an influential venture, which introduced the concept of cabaret to London. It provided a model for the generation of nightclubs that came after it. \\"The clubs that started the present vogue for dance clubs were the Cabaret Club in Heddon Street . . . .

Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis. The discovery is attributed to Mitsuru Matsui, who first applied the technique to the FEAL cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992). Subsequently, Matsui published an attack on the Data Encryption Standard (DES), eventually leading to the first experimental cryptanalysis of the cipher reported in the open community (Matsui, 1993; 1994). The attack on DES is not generally practical, requiring 247 known plaintexts. A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple linear approximations or incorporating non-linear expressions, leading to a generalized partitioning cryptanalysis. Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs. Overview There are two parts to linear cryptanalysis. The first is to construct linear equations relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits that have a high bias; that is, whose probabilities of holding (over the space of all possible values of their variables) are as close as possible to 0 or 1. The second is to use these linear equations in conjunction with known plaintext-ciphertext pairs to derive key bits. Constructing linear equations For the purposes of linear cryptanalysis, a linear equation expresses the equality of two expressions which consist of binary variables combined with the exclusive-or (XOR) operation. For example, the following equation, from a hypothetical cipher, states the XOR sum of the first and third plaintext bits (as in a block cipher's block) and the first ciphertext bit is equal to the second bit of the key: P_1 \\\\oplus P_3 \\\\oplus C_1 = K_2. In an ideal cipher, any linear equation relating plaintext, ciphertext and key bits would hold with probability 1/2. Since the equations dealt with in linear cryptanalysis will vary in probability, they are more accurately referred to as linear approximations. The procedure for constructing approximations is different for each cipher. In the most basic type of block cipher, a substitution‚Äìpermutation network, analysis is concentrated primarily on the S-boxes, the only nonlinear part of the cipher (i.e. the operation of an S-box cannot be encoded in a linear equation). For small enough S-boxes, it is possible to enumerate every possible linear equation relating the S-box's input and output bits, calculate their biases and choose the best ones. Linear approximations for S-boxes then must be combined with the cipher's other actions, such as permutation and key mixing, to arrive at linear approximations for the entire cipher. The piling-up lemma is a useful tool for this combination step. There are also techniques for iteratively improving linear approximations (Matsui 1994). Deriving key bits Having obtained a linear approximation of the form: P_{i_1} \\\\oplus P_{i_2} \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus C_{j_1} \\\\oplus C_{j_2} \\\\oplus \\\\cdots = K_{k_1} \\\\oplus K_{k_2} \\\\oplus \\\\cdots we can then apply a straightforward algorithm (Matsui's Algorithm 2), using known plaintext-ciphertext pairs, to guess at the values of the key bits involved in the approximation. For each set of values of the key bits on the right-hand side (referred to as a partial key), count how many times the approximation holds true over all the known plaintext-ciphertext pairs; call this count T. The partial key whose T has the greatest absolute difference from half the number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs is designated as the most likely set of values for those key bits. This is because it is assumed that the correct partial key will cause the approximation to hold with a high bias. The magnitude of the bias is significant here, as opposed to the magnitude of the probability itself. This procedure can be repeated with other linear approximations, obtaining guesses at values of key bits, until the number of unknown key bits is low enough that they can be attacked with brute force.

DSA is a variant of the Schnorr and ElGamal signature schemes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS) in 1991, and adopted it as FIPS 186 in 1994. Four revisions to the initial specification have been released. The newest specification is FIPS 186-4 from July 2013. DSA is patented but NIST has made this patent available worldwide royalty-free. A draft version of the specification FIPS 186-5 indicates DSA will no longer be approved for digital signature generation, but may be used to verify signatures generated prior to the implementation date of that standard. Overview The DSA algorithm works in the framework of public-key cryptosystems and is based on the algebraic properties of modular exponentiation, together with the discrete logarithm problem, which is considered to be computationally intractable. The algorithm uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to generate a digital signature for a message, and such a signature can be verified by using the signer's corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message authentication (the receiver can verify the origin of the message), integrity (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified since it was signed) and non-repudiation (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed the message). History In 1982 the U.S government solicited proposals for a public key signature standard. In August 1991 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Initially there was significant criticism, especially from software companies that had already invested effort in developing digital signature software based on the RSA cryptosystem. Nevertheless, NIST adopted DSA as a Federal standard (FIPS 186) in 1994. Four revisions to the initial specification have been released: FIPS 186‚Äì1 in 1998, FIPS 186‚Äì2 in 2000, FIPS 186‚Äì3 in 2009, and FIPS 186‚Äì4 in 2013. A draft version of standard FIPS 186-5 forbids signing with DSA, while allowing verification of signatures generated prior to the implementation date of the standard as a document. It is to be replaced by newer signature schemes such as EdDSA. DSA is covered by , filed July 26, 1991 and now expired, and attributed to David W. Kravitz,Dr. David W. Kravitz a former NSA employee. This patent was given to \\"The United States of America as represented by the Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C.\\", and NIST has made this patent available worldwide royalty-free.Werner Koch. \\"DSA and patents\\" Claus P. Schnorr claims that his (also now expired) covered DSA; this claim is disputed. Operation The DSA algorithm involves four operations: key generation (which creates the key pair), key distribution, signing and signature verification. Key generation Key generation has two phases. The first phase is a choice of algorithm parameters which may be shared between different users of the system, while the second phase computes a single key pair for one user. =Parameter generation= * Choose an approved cryptographic hash function H with output length H bits. In the original DSS, H was always SHA-1, but the stronger SHA-2 hash functions are approved for use in the current DSS. If H is greater than the modulus length N, only the leftmost N bits of the hash output are used. * Choose a key length L. The original DSS constrained L to be a multiple of 64 between 512 and 1024 inclusive. NIST 800-57 recommends lengths of 2048 (or 3072) for keys with security lifetimes extending beyond 2010 (or 2030). * Choose the modulus length N such that N < L and N \\\\leq H. FIPS 186-4 specifies L and N to have one of the values: (1024, 160), (2048, 224), (2048, 256), or (3072, 256). * Choose an N-bit prime q. * Choose an L-bit prime p such that p ‚àí 1 is a multiple of q. * Choose an integer h randomly from \\\\\\\\{ 2 \\\\ldots p-2 \\\\\\\\}. * Compute g := h^{(p - 1)/q} \\\\mod p. In the rare case that g=1 try again with a different h. Commonly h=2 is used. This modular exponentiation can be computed efficiently even if the values are large. The algorithm parameters are (p, q, g). These may be shared between different users of the system. =Per-user keys= Given a set of parameters, the second phase computes the key pair for a single user: * Choose an integer x randomly from \\\\\\\\{ 1 \\\\ldots q-1 \\\\\\\\}. * Compute y := g^x \\\\mod p. x is the private key and y is the public key. Key distribution The signer should publish the public key y. That is, they should send the key to the receiver via a reliable, but not necessarily secret, mechanism. The signer should keep the private key x secret. Signing A message m is signed as follows: * Choose an integer k randomly from \\\\\\\\{ 1 \\\\ldots q-1 \\\\\\\\} * Compute r := \\\\left(g^{k}\\\\bmod\\\\,p\\\\right)\\\\bmod\\\\,q. In the unlikely case that r=0, start again with a different random k. * Compute s := \\\\left(k^{-1}\\\\left(H(m)+xr\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\bmod\\\\,q. In the unlikely case that s=0, start again with a different random k. The signature is \\\\left(r,s\\\\right) The calculation of k and r amount to creating a new per- message key. The modular exponentiation in computing r is the most computationally expensive part of the signing operation, but it may be computed before the message is known. Calculating the modular inverse k^{-1}\\\\bmod\\\\,q is the second most expensive part, and it may also be computed before the message is known. It may be computed using the extended Euclidean algorithm or using Fermat's little theorem as k^{q-2}\\\\bmod\\\\,q. Verifying a signature One can verify that a signature \\\\left(r,s\\\\right) is a valid signature for a message m as follows: * Verify that 0 < r < q and 0 < s < q. * Compute w := s^{-1} \\\\bmod\\\\,q. * Compute u_1 := H(m) \\\\cdot w\\\\, \\\\bmod\\\\,q. * Compute u_2 := r \\\\cdot w\\\\, \\\\bmod\\\\,q. * Compute v := \\\\left(g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\\\bmod\\\\,p\\\\right) \\\\bmod\\\\,q. * The signature is valid if and only if v = r. Correctness of the algorithm The signature scheme is correct in the sense that the verifier will always accept genuine signatures. This can be shown as follows: First, since g=h^{(p-1)/q}~\\\\text{mod}~p, it follows that g^q \\\\equiv h^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p by Fermat's little theorem. Since g>0 and q is prime, g must have order q. The signer computes :s=k^{-1}(H(m)+xr)\\\\bmod\\\\,q Thus : \\\\begin{align} k & \\\\equiv H(m)s^{-1}+xrs^{-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\equiv H(m)w + xrw \\\\pmod{q} \\\\end{align} Since g has order q~(\\\\text{mod}~p) we have : \\\\begin{align} g^k & \\\\equiv g^{H(m)w}g^{xrw}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\equiv g^{H(m)w}y^{rw}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\equiv g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\\\pmod{p} \\\\end{align} Finally, the correctness of DSA follows from :\\\\begin{align} r &= (g^k \\\\bmod\\\\,p) \\\\bmod\\\\,q\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\\\bmod\\\\,p) \\\\bmod\\\\,q\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= v \\\\end{align} Sensitivity With DSA, the entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness of the random signature value k are critical. It is so critical that violating any one of those three requirements can reveal the entire private key to an attacker. Using the same value twice (even while keeping k secret), using a predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of k in each of several signatures, is enough to reveal the private key x.DSA k-value Requirements This issue affects both DSA and ECDSA ‚Äì in December 2010, a group calling itself fail0verflow announced recovery of the ECDSA private key used by Sony to sign software for the PlayStation 3 game console. The attack was made possible because Sony failed to generate a new random k for each signature. This issue can be prevented by deriving k deterministically from the private key and the message hash, as described by . This ensures that k is different for each H(m) and unpredictable for attackers who do not know the private key x. In addition, malicious implementations of DSA and ECDSA can be created where k is chosen in order to subliminally leak information via signatures. For example, an offline private key could be leaked from a perfect offline device that only released innocent-looking signatures.

The Bay is located in the Mid-Atlantic region and is primarily separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Delmarva Peninsula (including the parts: the Eastern Shore of Maryland / Eastern Shore of Virginia and the state of Delaware) with its mouth of the Bay at the south end located between Cape Henry and Cape Charles. With its northern portion in Maryland and the southern part in Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others surrounding within its watershed. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the Bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) and all of Washington, D.C. / District of Columbia. The Bay is approximately long from its northern headwaters in the Susquehanna River to its outlet in the Atlantic Ocean. It is wide at its narrowest (between Kent County's Plum Point near Newtown in the east and the Harford County western shore near Romney Creek) and at its widest (just south of the mouth of the Potomac River which divides Maryland from Virginia). Total shoreline including tributaries is , circumnavigating a surface area of . Average depth is , reaching a maximum of . The Bay is spanned twice, in Maryland by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Sandy Point (near Annapolis) to Kent Island and in Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel connecting Virginia Beach to Cape Charles. Known for both its beauty and bounty, the Bay has become \\"emptier\\", with fewer crabs, oysters and watermen (fishermen) since the mid-20th century. Nutrient pollution and urban runoff have been identified as major components of impaired water quality in the bay. The decline of shellfish populations has also been linked to overharvesting. Restoration efforts that began in the 1990s have continued into the 21st century and show potential for growth of the native oyster population. The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved in 2015, marking three years of gains over a four year period, according to a 2016 report by the University of Maryland. Etymology The word is an Algonquian word referring to a village 'at a big river'. It is the seventh oldest surviving English place-name in the United States, first applied as Chesepiook by explorers heading north from the Roanoke Colony into a Chesapeake tributary in 1585 or 1586. The name may also refer to the Chesapeake people or the Chesepian, a Native American tribe who inhabited the area now known as South Hampton Roads in the U.S. state of Virginia. They occupied an area that is now the Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach areas.Also shown as Chisupioc (by John Smith) and Chisapeack, in Algonquian means 'big' or 'great', means river, and the or ending indicated something (a village, in this case) 'at' that feature. is also found in another placename of Algonquian origin, Mississippi. The name was soon transferred by the English from the big river and the village at that site to the entire bay. In 2005, Algonquian linguist Blair Rudes \\"helped to dispel one of the area's most widely held beliefs: that 'Chesapeake' means something like 'great shellfish bay'. It does not, Rudes said. The name might have actually meant something like 'great water', or it might have just referred to a village location at the Bay's mouth.\\" Physical geography Geology and formation The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary to the North Atlantic, lying between the Delmarva Peninsula to the east and the North American mainland to the west. It is the ria, or drowned valley, of the Susquehanna River, meaning that it was the alluvial plain where the river flowed when the sea level was lower. It is not a fjord, because the Laurentide Ice Sheet never reached as far south as the northernmost point on the Bay. North of Baltimore, the western shore borders the hilly Piedmont region of Maryland; south of the city the Bay lies within the state's low-lying coastal plain, with sedimentary cliffs to the west, and flat islands, winding creeks and marshes to the east. The large rivers entering the Bay from the west have broad mouths and are extensions of the main ria for miles up the course of each river. The Bay's geology, its present form, and its very location were created by a bolide impact event at the end of the Eocene (about 35.5 million years ago), forming the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and much later the Susquehanna River valley. The Bay was formed starting about 10,000 years ago when rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age flooded the Susquehanna River valley. Parts of the Bay, especially the Calvert County, Maryland, coastline, are lined by cliffs composed of deposits from receding waters millions of years ago. These cliffs, generally known as Calvert Cliffs, are famous for their fossils, especially fossilized shark teeth, which are commonly found washed up on the beaches next to the cliffs. Scientists' Cliffs is a beach community in Calvert County named for the desire to create a retreat for scientists when the community was founded in 1935. Hydrology View of the Eastern Bay in Maryland at sunset The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, near Annapolis, Maryland Much of the Bay is shallow. At the point where the Susquehanna River flows into the Bay, the average depth is , although this soon diminishes to an average of southeast of the city of Havre de Grace, Maryland, to about just north of Annapolis. On average, the depth of the Bay is , including tributaries; Other sources give values of 25 feet (e.g. ) or deep () over 24 percent of the Bay is less than deep. Because the Bay is an estuary, it has fresh water, salt water and brackish water. Brackish water has three salinity zones: oligohaline, mesohaline, and polyhaline. The freshwater zone runs from the mouth of the Susquehanna River to north Baltimore. The oligohaline zone has very little salt. Salinity varies from 0.5 ppt (parts per thousand) to 10 ppt, and freshwater species can survive there. The north end of the oligohaline zone is north Baltimore and the south end is the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The mesohaline zone has a medium amount of salt and runs from the Bay Bridge to the mouth of the Rappahannock River. Salinity there ranges from 1.07% to 1.8%. The polyhaline zone is the saltiest zone, and some of the water can be as salty as sea water. It runs from the mouth of the Rappahannock River to the mouth of the Bay. The salinity ranges from 1.87% to 3.6%. (3.6% is as salty as the ocean.) The climate of the area surrounding the Bay is primarily humid subtropical, with hot, very humid summers and cold to mild winters. Only the area around the mouth of the Susquehanna River is continental in nature, and the mouth of the Susquehanna River and the Susquehanna flats often freeze in winter. It is rare for the surface of the Bay to freeze in winter, something that happened most recently in the winter of 1976‚Äì77. The largest rivers flowing directly into the Bay, from north to south, are: * Susquehanna River * Patapsco River * Chester River * Miles River * Choptank River * Patuxent River * Nanticoke River * Potomac River * Pocomoke River * Rappahannock River * York River * James River The Bay viewed from a plane Flora and fauna Food chain diagram for waterbirds of the Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay is home to numerous fauna that either migrate to the Bay at some point during the year or live there year-round. There are over 300 species of fish and numerous shellfish and crab species. Some of these include the Atlantic menhaden, striped bass, American eel, eastern oyster, Atlantic horseshoe crab, and the blue crab. Birds include ospreys, great blue herons, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons, the last two of which were threatened by DDT; their numbers plummeted but have risen in recent years. The piping plover is a near threatened species that inhabits the wetlands. Larger fish such as Atlantic sturgeon, varieties of sharks,The Chesapeake Bay News. 2010.

Although the Bay is farther north than its typical habitat range, a male manatee visited the Bay several times between 1994 and 2011. The manatee, recognizable due to distinct markings on its body, was nicknamed \\"Chessie\\" after a legendary sea monster that was allegedly sighted in the Bay during the 20th century. The same manatee has been spotted as far north as Rhode Island, and was the first manatee known to travel so far north. Other manatees are occasionally seen in the Bay and its tributaries, which contain sea grasses that are part of the manatee's diet. Loggerhead turtles are known to visit the Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is also home to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common submerged aquatic vegetation includes eelgrass and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because \\"submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity.\\" Other vegetation that makes its home in other parts of the Bay are wild rice, various trees like the red maple, loblolly pine and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites.Domes S., Lewis M., Moran R., Nyman D.. ‚ÄúChesapeake Bay Wetlands‚Äù. Emporia State University. May 2009. Retrieved 2010-03-14. Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the Bay; plants such as Brazilian waterweed, native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It is highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian waterweed can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and plant them in the Bay. History European exploration and settlement John White's original by Theodore DeBry. In this 1590 version, the Chesapeake Bay appears named for the first time. Later (1630) version of the 1612 map by Captain John Smith during his exploration of the Chesapeake. The map is oriented with west at top. In 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, (1485‚Äì1528), in service of the French crown, (famous for sailing through and thereafter naming the entrance to New York Bay as the \\"Verrazzano Narrows\\", including now in the 20th century, a suspension bridge also named for him) sailed past the Chesapeake, but did not enter the Bay. Spanish explorer Lucas V√°squez de Ayll√≥n sent an expedition out from Hispaniola in 1525 that reached the mouths of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. It may have been the first European expedition to explore parts of the Chesapeake Bay, which the Spaniards called \\"Bah√≠a de Santa Mar√≠a\\" (\\"Bay of St. Mary\\") or \\"Bah√≠a de Madre de Dios.\\"(\\"Bay of the Mother of God\\") De Ayll√≥n established a short-lived Spanish mission settlement, San Miguel de Gualdape, in 1526 along the Atlantic coast. Many scholars doubt the assertion that it was as far north as the Chesapeake; most place it in present-day Georgia's Sapelo Island. In 1573, Pedro Men√©ndez de M√°rquez, the governor of Spanish Florida, conducted further exploration of the Chesapeake. In 1570, Spanish Jesuits established the short-lived Ajacan Mission on one of the Chesapeake tributaries in present-day Virginia. The arrival of English colonists under Sir Walter Raleigh and Humphrey Gilbert in the late 16th century to found a colony, later settled at Roanoke Island (off the present-day coast of North Carolina) for the Virginia Company, marked the first time that the English approached the gates to the Chesapeake Bay between the capes of Cape Charles and Cape Henry. Three decades later, in 1607, Europeans again entered the Bay. Captain John Smith of England explored and mapped the Bay between 1607 and 1609, resulting in the publication in 1612 back in the British Isles of \\"A Map of Virginia\\". Smith wrote in his journal: \\"Heaven and earth have never agreed better to frame a place for man's habitation.\\" The new laying out of the \\"Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail\\", the United States' first designated \\"all-water\\" National Historic Trail, was created in July 2006, by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior following the route of Smith's historic 17th-century voyage. Because of economic hardships and civil strife in the \\"Mother Land\\", there was a mass migration of southern English Cavaliers and their servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675, to both of the new colonies of the Province of Virginia and the Province of Maryland. American Revolution to the present Oyster boats at war off the Maryland shore (1886 wood engraving). Regulation of the oyster beds in Virginia and Maryland has existed since the 19th century. The Chesapeake Bay was the site of the Battle of the Chesapeake (also known as the \\"Battle of the Capes\\", Cape Charles and Cape Henry) in 1781, during which the French fleet defeated the Royal Navy in the decisive naval battle of the American Revolutionary War. The British defeat enabled General George Washington and his French allied armies under Comte de Rochambeau to march down from New York and bottle up the rampaging southern British Army of Lord Cornwallis from the North and South Carolinas at the siege of Battle of Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia. Their marching route from Newport, Rhode Island through Connecticut, New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware to the \\"Head of Elk\\" by the Susquehanna River along the shores and also partially sailing down the Bay to Virginia. It is also the subject of a designated National Historic Trail under the National Park Service as the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route. The Bay would again see conflict during War of 1812. During the year of 1813, from their base on Tangier Island, British naval forces under the command of Admiral George Cockburn raided and plundered several towns on the shores of the Chesapeake, treating the Bay as if it were a \\"British Lake\\". The Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, a fleet of shallow-draft armed barges under the command of U.S. Navy Commodore Joshua Barney, was assembled to stall British shore raids and attacks. After months of harassment by Barney, the British landed on the west side of the Patuxent at Benedict, Maryland, the Chesapeake Flotilla was scuttled, and the British trekked overland to burn the U.S. Capitol in August 1814. A few days later in a \\"pincer attack\\", they also sailed up the Potomac River to attack Fort Washington below the National Capital and demanded a ransom from the nearby port town of Alexandria, Virginia. There were so-called \\"Oyster Wars\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Until the mid-20th century, oyster harvesting rivaled the crab industry among Chesapeake watermen, a dwindling breed whose skipjacks and other workboats were supplanted by recreational craft in the latter part of the century. In the 1960s, the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant on the historic Calvert Cliffs in Calvert County on the Western Shore of Maryland began using water from the Bay to cool its reactor. Navigation lightships such as Chesapeake have helped guide ships into the Bay. The Chesapeake Bay forms a link in the Intracoastal Waterway, of the bays, sounds and inlets between the off-shore barrier islands and the coastal mainland along the Atlantic coast connecting the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (linking the Bay to the north and the Delaware River) with the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal (linking the Bay, to the south, via the Elizabeth River, by the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth to the Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound in North Carolina and further to the Sea Islands of Georgia). A busy shipping channel (dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since the 1850s) runs the length of the Bay, is an important transit route for large vessels entering or leaving the Port of Baltimore, and further north through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to the ports of Wilmington and Philadelphia on the Delaware River. During the later half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, the Bay was plied by passenger steamships and packet boat lines connecting the various cities on it, notably the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (\\"Old Bay Line\\"). In the later 20th century, a series of road crossings were built. One, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (also known as the Governor William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge) between the state capital of Annapolis, Maryland and Matapeake on the Eastern Shore, crossing Kent Island, was constructed 1949‚Äì1952. A second, parallel, span was added in 1973. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, connecting Virginia's Eastern Shore with its mainland (at the metropolitan areas of Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Chesapeake), is approximately long; it has trestle bridges as well as two stretches of tunnels that allow unimpeded shipping; the bridge is supported by four man-made islands. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel was opened for two lanes in 1964 and four lanes in 1999. Tides Example Chesapeake Bay tides from Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel for quarter and full moons during June 2013 Tides in the Chesapeake Bay exhibit an interesting and unique behavior due to the nature of the topography (both horizontal and vertical shape), wind driven circulation, and how the Bay interacts with oceanic tides. Research into the peculiar behavior of tides both at the northern and southern extents of the Bay began in the late 1970s. One study noted sea level fluctuations at periods of 5 days, driven by sea level changes at the Bay's mouth on the Atlantic coast and local lateral winds, and 2.5 days, caused by resonant oscillations driven by local longitudinal winds,Wang, D.-P. 1979. Subtidal Sea Level Variations in the Chesapeake Bay and Relations to Atmospheric Forcing. Journal of Physical Oceanography. Vol. 9. pp. 413‚Äì421. while another study later found that the geometry of the Bay permits for a resonant period of 1.46 days.Wang, D-P. and A.J. Elliott. Non-Tidal Variability in the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River: Evidence for Non-Local Forcing. Journal of Physical Oceanography. Vol. 8. pp. 225‚Äì232. A good example of how the different Chesapeake Bay sites experience different tides can be seen in the tidal predictions published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (see figure at right). At the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel (CBBT) site, which lies at the southernmost point of the Bay where it meets the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk, Virginia, and the capes of Charles and Henry, there is a distinct semi-diurnal tide throughout the lunar month, with small amplitude modulations during spring (new/full moon) vs. neap (one/three quarter moon) tidal periods. The main forcing of the CBBT tides are typical, semi-diurnal ocean tides that the East Coast of the United States experiences. Baltimore, in the northern portion of the Bay, experiences a noticeable modulation to form its mixed tidal nature during spring vs. neap tides. Spring tides, when the sun-earth-moon system forms a line, cause the largest tidal amplitudes during lunar monthly tidal variations. In contrast, neap tides, when the sun-earth-moon system forms a right angle, are muted, and in a semi-diurnal tidal system (such as that seen at the CBBT site) this can be seen as a lowest intertidal range. Two interesting points that arise from comparing these two sites at opposite ends of the Bay are their tidal characteristics - semi-diurnal tide for CBBT and mixed tide for Baltimore (due to resonance in the Bay) - and the differences in amplitude (due to dissipation in the Bay). Economy Fishing industry skipjack, part of the oystering fleet in Maryland The Bay is mostly known for its seafood production, especially blue crabs, clams and oysters. In the middle of the 20th century, the Bay supported 9,000 full-time watermen, according to one account. Today, the body of water is less productive than it used to be because of runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species. The plentiful oyster harvests led to the development of the skipjack, the state boat of Maryland, which is the only remaining working boat type in the United States still under sail power. Other characteristic bay-area workboats include sail-powered boats such as the log canoe, the pungy, the bugeye, and the motorized Chesapeake Bay deadrise, the state boat of Virginia. In contrast to harvesting wild oysters, oyster farming is a growing industry for the Bay to help maintain the estuary's productivity as well as a natural effort for filtering impurities such as excess nutrients from the water in an effort to reduce the effects of man-made pollution. The Chesapeake Bay Program is using oysters to reduce the amount of nitrogen compounds entering the Chesapeake Bay. Oysters are hermaphroditic and will change gender at least once during their lifetime, often starting as male and ending as female; there are numerous ways to cook and eat them, as well as recipes and sauces to accompany oyster dishes. One account: The Bay is famous for its rockfish, a regional name for striped bass. Once on the verge of extinction, rockfish have made a significant comeback because of legislative action that put a moratorium on rockfishing, which allowed the species to re-populate. Rockfish can now be fished in strictly controlled and limited quantities. Tourism and recreation The Thomas Point Shoal Light in Maryland Tidal wetlands of the Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay is a main feature for tourists who visit Maryland and Virginia each year. Fishing, crabbing, swimming, boating, kayaking, and sailing are extremely popular activities enjoyed on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. As a result, tourism has a notable impact on Maryland's economy. One report suggested that Annapolis was an appealing spot for families, water sports and boating. Commentator Terry Smith spoke about the Bay's beauty: One account suggested how the Chesapeake attracts people: Cuisine In colonial times, simple cooking techniques were used to create one pot meals like ham and potato casserole, clam chowder, or stews with common ingredients like oysters, chicken or venison. When John Smith landed in Chesapeake in 1608 he wrote: \\"The fish were so thick, we attempted to catch them with frying pans\\". Common regional ingredients in the local cuisine of Chesapeake included terrapins, smoked hams, blue crab, shellfish, local fish, game meats and various species of waterfowl. Blue crab continues to be an especially popular regional specialty. Pollution Dead menhaden floating in the bay in 1973 Dissolved oxygen levels required by various species Sediment sources in the Chesapeake Bay In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was found to contain one of the planet's first identified marine dead zones, where waters were so depleted of oxygen that they were unable to support life, resulting in massive fish kills. Today the Bay's dead zones are estimated to kill 75,000 tons of bottom-dwelling clams and worms each year, weakening the base of the estuary's food chain and robbing the blue crab in particular of a primary food source. Crabs are sometimes observed to amass on shore to escape pockets of oxygen-poor water, a behavior known as a \\"crab jubilee\\". Hypoxia results in part from large algal blooms, which are nourished by the runoff of residential, farm and industrial waste throughout the watershed. One report in 2010 criticized Amish farmers for having cows that \\"generate heaps of manure that easily washes into streams and flows onward into the Chesapeake Bay\\". The pollution entering the bay has multiple components that contribute to the algal bloom, principally the nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen.Dennen, R. (2009-10-30). \\"Is it time we put the ailing Bay on diet?\\". The Free Lance Star. Retrieved 2010-02-17 The algae prevents sunlight from reaching the bottom of the Bay while alive and deoxygenates the Bay's water when it dies and rots. Soil erosion and runoff of sediment into the Bay, exacerbated by devegetation, construction and the prevalence of pavement in urban and suburban areas, also blocks vital sunlight. The resulting loss of aquatic vegetation has depleted the habitat for much of the Bay's animal life. Beds of eelgrass, the dominant variety in the southern Chesapeake Bay, have shrunk by more than half there since the early 1970s. Overharvesting, pollution, sedimentation and disease have turned much of the Bay's bottom into a muddy wasteland. One particularly harmful source of toxicity is Pfiesteria piscicida, which can affect both fish and humans. Pfiesteria caused a small regional panic in the late 1990s when a series of large blooms started killing large numbers of fish while giving swimmers mysterious rashes; nutrient runoff from chicken farms was blamed for the growth. The Bay has improved slightly in terms of the overall health of its ecosystem, earning a rating of 31 out of 100 in 2010, up from 28 in 2008. An estimate in 2006 from a \\"blue ribbon panel\\" said cleanup costs would be $15 billion. Compounding the problem is that 100,000 new residents move to the area each year. A report in 2008 in The Washington Post suggested that government administrators had overstated progress on cleanup efforts as a way to \\"preserve the flow of federal and state money to the project.\\" In January 2011, there were reports that millions of fish had died, but officials suggested it was probably the result of extremely cold weather. Depletion of oysters While the Bay's salinity is ideal for oysters and the oyster fishery was at one time the Bay's most commercially viable,Oysters: Gem of the Ocean, The Economist, December 8, 2008; accessed September 2, 2009. the population has in the last fifty years been devastated. Maryland once had roughly of oyster reefs. Today it has about 36,000. It has been estimated that in pre-colonial times, oysters could filter the entirety of the Bay in about 3.3 days; by 1988 this time had increased to 325 days. The harvest's gross value decreased 88% from 1982 to 2007. One report suggested the Bay had fewer oysters in 2008 than 25 years earlier. A cluster of oysters grown in a sanctuary The primary problem is overharvesting. Lax government regulations allow anyone with a license to remove oysters from state-owned beds, and although limits are set, they are not strongly enforced. The overharvesting of oysters has made it difficult for them to reproduce, which requires close proximity to one another. A second cause for the oyster depletion is that the drastic increase in human population caused a sharp increase in pollution flowing into the Bay. The Bay's oyster industry has also suffered from two diseases: MSX and Dermo. The depletion of oysters has had a particularly harmful effect on the quality of the Bay. Oysters serve as natural water filters, and their decline has further reduced the water quality of the Bay. Water that was once clear for meters is now so turbid that a wader may lose sight of his feet while his knees are still dry. Restoration efforts Efforts of federal, state and local governments, working in partnership through the Chesapeake Bay Program, an intergovernmental coalition, along with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and other nonprofit environmental groups, to restore or at least maintain the current water quality, have had mixed results. One particular obstacle to cleaning up the Bay is that much of the polluting substances are discharged far upstream in tributaries lying within states far removed from the Bay: New York and Pennsylvania. Despite the State of Maryland spending over $100 million to restore the Bay, conditions have continued to grow worse. In the mid-20th century, the Bay supported over 6,000 oystermen. As of 2008 there were fewer than 500. In June 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Program adopted Chesapeake 2000, an agreement adopted by the member jurisdictions, intended to guide restoration activities throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed through 2010.CBP (2000). \\"Chesapeake 2000.\\" One component of this agreement was a series of upgrades to sewage treatment plants throughout the watershed. In 2016 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that the upgrades \\"have resulted in steep reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus pollution... despite increases in human population and wastewater volume.\\" Restoration efforts that began in the 1990s have continued into the 21st century and show potential for growth of the native oyster population. Efforts to repopulate the Bay using oyster hatcheries have been carried out by a group called the Oyster Recovery Partnership, with some success. In 2011 the group placed 6 million oysters on of the Trent Hall sanctuary.Program turns pork into oysters , Jesse Yeatman, South Maryland Newspapers Online, August 12, 2009. Scientists from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at the College of William & Mary claim that experimental reefs created in 2004 now house 180 million native oysters, Crassostrea virginica, which is far fewer than the billions that once existed.Oysters Are on the Rebound in the Chesapeake Bay, Henry Fountain, The New York Times, August 3, 2009; accessed September 8, 2009. The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved in 2015, marking three years of gains over a four year period, according to a 2016 report by the University of Maryland.

It is defined as \\"a doctrine that in the person of the incarnated Word (that is, in Jesus Christ) there was only one nature‚Äîthe divine\\".  Background  The First Council of Nicaea (325) declared that Christ was divine (homoousios, consubstantial, of one being or essence, with the Father) and human (was incarnate and became man). In the fifth century a heated controversy arose between the sees and theological schools of Antioch and Alexandria about how divinity and humanity existed in Christ, the former stressing the humanity, the latter the divinity of Christ. Cyril of Alexandria succeeded in having Nestorius, a prominent exponent of the Antiochian school, condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and insisted on the formula \\"one physis of the incarnate Word\\", claiming that any formula that spoke of two physeis represented Nestorianism. Some taught that in Christ the human nature was completely absorbed by the divine, leaving only a divine nature. In 451, the Council of Chalcedon, on the basis of Pope Leo the Great's 449 declaration, defined that in Christ there were two natures united in one person. Those who insisted on the \\"one physis\\" formula were referred to as Monophysites, those who accepted the Chalcedonian \\"two natures\\" definition were called Dyophysites a term applied also to followers of Nestorianism.  Groups called Monophysite  The forms of Monophysism were numerous, and included the following: Acephali were Monophysites who in 482 broke away from Peter III of Alexandria who made an agreement with Acacius of Constantinople, sanctioned by Emperor Zeno with his Henotikon edict that condemned both Nestorius and Eutyches, as the Council of Chalcedon had done, but ignored that council's decree on the two natures of Christ. They saw this as a betrayal of the Eutychian form of Monophysitism and refused to be subject to the Patriarch of Alexandria, preferring to be instead ecclesiastically \\"without a head\\" (the meaning of acephali).John Joseph A'Becket, \\"Acephali\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York \`1907) Agnoetae, Themistians or Agnosticists, founded by Themistius Calonymus around 534, held that the nature of Jesus Christ, though divine, was like other men's in all respects, including limited knowledge. They must be distinguished from a fourth-century group called by the same name, who denied that God knew the past and the future. Aphthartodocetae, Phantasiasts or, after their leader Julian of Halicarnassus, Julianists believed \\"that the body of Christ, from the very moment of his conception, was incorruptible, immortal and impassible, as it was after the resurrection, and held that the suffering and death on the cross was a miracle contrary to the normal conditions of Christ's humanity\\". Emperor Justinian I wished to have this teaching adopted as orthodox, but died before he could put his plans into effect. Apollinarians or Apollinarists, named after Apollinaris of Laodicea (who died in 390) proposed that Jesus had a normal human body but had a divine mind instead of a regular human soul. This teaching was condemned by the First Council of Constantinople (381) and died out within a few decades.Sollier, Joseph. \\"Apollinarianism.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 8 February 2019 Cyril of Alexandria declared it a mad proposal. Docetists, not all of whom were Monophysites, held that Jesus had no human nature: his humanity was only a phantasm, which, united with the impassible, immaterial divine nature, could not really suffer and die. Eutychians taught that Jesus had only one nature, a union of the divine and human that is not an even compound, since what is divine is infinitely larger than what is human: the humanity is absorbed by and transmuted into the divinity, as a drop of honey, mixing with the water of the sea, vanishes. The body of Christ, thus transmuted, is not consubstantial homoousios with humankind: In contrast to Severians, who are called verbal Monophysites, Eutychianists are called real or ontological Monophysites, and their teaching has been called \\"an extreme form of the Monophysite heresy that emphasizes the exclusive prevalence of the divinity in Christ\\". Miaphysites are often labelled monophysites, a label that they reject, basing their theology on the formula of Cyril of Alexandria that spoke of mia (one) physis, not of a mone (lone) physis. and they distance themselves from and denounce the Eutychian interpretation of monophysitism. Miaphysitism is the official doctrine of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, who hold that the one hypostasis of Christ is fully divine and fully human,Wiktionary so that Christ became a real and perfect Man in body, mind, and soul without ever ceasing to be God,Tiran Nersoyan, \\"The Armenian Church: A Brief History Severians accepted the reality of Christ's human nature to the extent of insisting that his body was capable of corruption, but argued that, since a single person has a single nature and Christ was one person, not two, he had only a single nature. Agreeing in substance, though not in words, with the Definition of Chalcedon, Severians are known also as verbal Monophysites. Tritheists, a group of sixth- century Monophysites said to have been founded by a Monophysite named John Ascunages of Antioch. Their principal writer was John Philoponus, who taught that the common nature of Father, Son and Holy Spirit is an abstraction of their distinct individual natures.John Chapman, \\"Tritheists\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1912 Verbal Monophysitism Concerning verbal declarations of monophysitism, Justo L. Gonz√°lez stated, \\"in order not to give an erroneous idea of the theology of the so-called monophysite churches, that have subsisted until the twentieth century, one should point out that all the extreme sects of monophysism disappeared within a brief span, and that the Christology of the present so-called monophysite churches is closer to a verbal than to a real monophysism\\".  Political situation of Monophysitism after Chalcedon  Under Emperor Basiliscus, who ousted Emperor Zeno in 475, \\"the Monophysites reached the pinnacle of their power\\". In his Encyclion, which he issued in the same year, he revoked the Council of Chalcedon and recognized the Second Council of Ephesus of 449 except for its approval of Eutyches, whom Basiliscus condemned. He required his edict to be signed by each bishop. Among the signatures he obtained were those of three of the four Eastern Patriarchs, but the Patriarch and the populace of the capital protested so resolutely that in 476, seeing that his overthrow was imminent, he issued his Anti-Encyclion revoking his former edict. In the same year, Zeno returned victoriously. Events had made it clear that there was a split between the population, staunchly Chalcedonian in sympathies, of Constantinople and the Balkans and the largely anti-Chalcedonian population of Egypt and Syria. In an attempt to reconcile both sides, Zeno, with the support of Acacius of Constantinople and Peter III of Alexandria, tried to enforce the compromise Henoticon (Formula of Union) decree of 482, which condemned Eutyches but ignored Chalcedon. Schisms followed on both sides. Rome excommunicated Acacius (leading to the 35-year Acacian schism), while in Egypt the Acephali broke away from Peter III. The Acacian schism continued under Zeno's successor, the Monophysite Anastasius I Dicorus and ended only with the accession of the Chalcedonian Justin I in 518. Justin I was succeeded by the Chalcedonian Justinian I (527‚Äì565), whose wife, however, the Empress Theodora, protected and assisted the Monophysites. Ghassanid patronage of the Miaphysite Syrian Church during this time, under phylarch Al-Harith ibn Jabalah, was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread.Rome in the East, Warwick Ball, Routledge, 2000, p. 105 Justinian I were followed by Justin II, who, after being, perhaps because of Theodora's influence, a Monophysite, converted to the Chalcedonian faith before obtaining the imperial throne. Some time later, he adopted a policy of persecuting the Monophysites. From Justinian I on, no emperor was a declared Monophysite, although they continued their efforts to find compromise formulas such as monoenergism and monothelitism.

The doctrine is contrary to dyothelitism, the christological doctrine that Jesus Christ has two wills (human and divine), which correspond to his two natures. Monothelitism is a development of the Neo-Chalcedonian position in the christological debates. The doctrine formally emerged in Armenia and Syria in 629.Bury, pg 251 Formulated in 638, it enjoyed considerable popularity and even garnered patriarchal support before it was rejected and denounced as heretical in 681, at the Third Council of Constantinople. Background The ongoing debates about the nature of Christ caused controversy within the Church for centuries. During the 5th century, some regions of the Church were thrown into confusion because of the debates that erupted over the nature of Jesus Christ. Although the Church had already determined that Christ is the son of God, his exact nature remained open to debate. The Church had declared heretical the notion that Jesus is not fully divine in the 4th century (see First Council of Nicaea), during the debates over Arianism and had declared that he is God the Son who became human. However, in arguing that he is both God and man, there now emerged a dispute over exactly how the human and divine natures of Christ actually exist within the person of Christ. The Christological definition of Chalcedon, as accepted by the Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Reformed churches, is that Christ remains in two distinct natures, yet these two natures come together within his one hypostasis. More simply, Christ is known as \\"both fully human and fully Divine, one in being with the Father\\". This position was opposed by the Monophysites who held that Christ possesses one nature only. The term Monophysitism of which Eutychianism is one type, held that the human and divine natures of Christ were fused into one new single (mono) nature. As described by Eutyches, his human nature was \\"dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea\\", and therefore his nature is really divine.Norwich, pg 155 This is distinct from Miaphysitism, which holds that, after the union, Christ is in one theanthropic (human-divine) nature and is generated from the union of two natures. The two are thus united without separation, without confusion, and without alteration, and with each having a particularity. Miaphysitism is the christological doctrine of the Oriental Orthodox churches.Matt Stefon (editor), Christianity (The Rosen Publishing Group 2011 ), p. 275 Nevertheless, the resultant debates led the Chalcedonians to accuse the non- Chalcedonians of teaching Christ's humanity to be of a different kind from our own. Meanwhile, the non-Chalcedonians accused the Chalcedonians of espousing a form of Nestorianism, a rejected doctrine that held that Jesus Christ was two distinct subsistences. This internal division was dangerous for the Byzantine Empire, which was under constant threat from external enemies, especially as many of the areas most likely to be lost to the empire were the regions that were in favour of Monophysitism, and who considered the religious hierarchy at Constantinople to be heretics only interested in crushing their faith.Norwich, pg 156 In these provinces, the non-Chalcedonians were far more numerous than the Chalcedonians. In Egypt for instance, some 30,000 Greeks of Chalcedonian persuasion were ranged against some five million Coptic non- Chalcedonians.Bury, pg 249 Meanwhile, Syria and Mesopotamia were divided between Nestorianism and Jacobitism, while the religion of Armenia was wholly Cyrilline Non-Chalcedonian. Consequently, the Monothelite teaching emerged as a compromise position. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius tried to unite all of the various factions within the empire with this new formula that was more inclusive and more elastic. Thay approach was needed to win over the non- Chalcedonians since they already believed that Christ has a single nature and so necessarily believed that he holds a single will. However, it was unclear whether the Chalcedonians should believe in Christ's human and divine energy and/or will as well as his human and divine nature because the ecumenical councils had made no ruling on that subject. A ruling for the new doctrine would provide common ground for the non-Chalcedonians and the Chalcedonians to come together, as the non-Chalcedonians could agree that Jesus has two natures if he has only one will, and some Chalcedonians could agree that Jesus has one will if he has two natures.Bury, pg 250 First attempt: Doctrine of one energy Emperor Heraclius, who defeated Persian King Khosrau II in this allegory, had a desire to secure internal harmony within his empire that made him adopt the doctrine of Monothelitism. Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople was the driving force behind this doctrine, with the full blessing of Emperor Heraclius.Westminster Dictionary of Church History. ed, J. C. Brauer. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971. pgs. 568‚Äì569 Coming to the imperial throne in 610, the patriarch had long since converted the emperor to the new doctrine as by 622, Heraclius had communicated with Bishop Paul of Armenia where the emperor asserted that the energy, or the active force, of Christ was single. That doctrine of Monoenergism was the precursor of Monotheletism. Heraclius's interest then focused on Armenia, and it was probably then that the emperor decided to use Monoenergism as a political weapon to reconcile the Non-Chalcedonian Church of Armenia with the Imperial Church. To help bring that about, a synod was held in 622 at Theodosiopolis, called the Synod of Garin, where Monoenergism was discussed. Over the next few years Heraclius was preoccupied with his prosecution of the war against the Sassanids, but by 626, he had issued a decree to Arcadius, Bishop of Cyprus, requesting him to teach the doctrine of \\"one hegumenic energy\\". By all accounts, that was met with notable success, particularly as there was then a large colony of Armenians on the island, which encouraged Heraclius to attempt to seek a wider approval of his compromise. In 626, he asked Patriarch Sergius to approach Cyrus, Bishop of Phasis, to secure his cooperation. With the successful conclusion to the Persian War, Heraclius could devote more time to promoting his compromise, which was now more urgent because of the administration of the recovered Monophysite (also referred to as \\"non-Chalcedonian\\" for rejecting of that particular council) provinces of Syria and Egypt. In 629, a meeting took place between the emperor and Athanasius the Jacobite at Hierapolis. An agreement was struck in which the Jacobites were to return to the Imperial Church on the basis of the single energy doctrine, and Athanasius was to be made Patriarch of Antioch. In 630, Bishop Cyrus was made Patriarch of Alexandria, who soon won over another Non-Chalcedonian group. Very soon, three of the five patriarchates (Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria) were teaching Christ's \\"one theandric energy\\". Not everyone was convinced, particularly a monk of Palestine named Sophronius, who believed that there was something unsound in the doctrine and so became the champion of Dyothelitism, the doctrine of the two wills of Christ. He was concerned that for the sake of ecclesiastical unity, doctrinal expressions were being compromised.Bury, pg 252 For the first few years, Patriarch Sergius of Constantinople managed to keep him silent, but when Sophronius was appointed as Patriarch of Jerusalem in 634, he used his newfound position of authority to challenge the validity of the doctrine of Monoenergism. Determined to prevent that formidable challenge to his Christological compromise, Sergius wrote to Pope Honorius I (625‚Äì638) at Rome to ask him to endorse a position that Church unity should not be endangered by having any discussions or disputes over whether Christ haf one energy or two. Sergius added that the doctrine of two energies could lead to the erroneous belief that Jesus has two conflicting wills.Hefele, pg 25 Honorius's reply in 635 endorsed that view that all discussions should cease and agreed that Jesus has only one will, not two conflicting wills, since Jesus assumed not the vitiated human nature, tainted by Adam's fall, but human nature as it existed prior to Adam's fall.Hefele, pg 29-30 In the meantime the epistola synodica of Sophronius appeared, the outcome of the Synod of Cyprus. It attempted to show that the new doctrine was inconsistent with orthodoxy. Sophronius declared that it was nothing more than a bastardised form of Monophysitism, which went against the hard-fought achievements at Chalcedon. Suddenly, support for the doctrine began to subside, and soon, former supporters were busy finding flaws and inconsistencies in the proposal.Norwich, pg 306 Soon, Sergius and Heraclius abandoned it as a doctrine. Second attempt: Doctrine of one will However, Sergius and the emperor refused to give up. Three years later, the patriarch came up with a slightly-modified formula, which Heraclius released as the Ecthesis in 638. The edict was considered to be the official response to Sophronius's letter.Bury, p. 253 It forbade all mention of Christ possessing one or two energies; instead, it now proclaimed that Christ has two natures but a single will. That approach seemed to be a more acceptable compromise, and once again, it secured widespread support throughout the East. Sophronius had died before the release of the new doctrine, and his replacement, Bishop Sergius of Jaffa, as Patriarch Abraham I of Jerusalem, approved the modified formula. Sergius died by the end of 638, and his replacement, Pyrrhus, was also a devoted Monothelite and a close friend of Heraclius. The two remaining patriarchs in the East also gave their approval to the doctrine now referred to as Monothelitism and so it looked as if Heraclius would finally heal the divisions in the imperial church.Norwich, pg 309 Unfortunately, he had not counted on the popes at Rome. During the same year, 638, Pope Honorius I had died as well. His successor Pope Severinus (640) condemned the Ecthesis outright and so was forbidden his seat until 640. His successor, Pope John IV (640‚Äì42), also rejected the doctrine completely, leading to a major schism between the eastern and western halves of the Chalcedonian Church. When news reached Heraclius of the Pope's condemnation, he was already old and ill, and the news only hastened his death. He declared with his dying breath that the controversy was all due to Sergius and that the patriarch had pressured him to give his unwilling approval to the Ecthesis.Norwich, p. 310 Conflict with Rome This state of schism remained for the next few years. The death of Heraclius in 641 had thrown the political situation in Constantinople into chaos, and his young grandson Constans II (641‚Äì668) succeeded him. Meanwhile, in Africa, a monk, Maximus the Confessor, carried on a furious campaign against Monothelitism, and in 646, he convinced the African councils to draw up a manifesto against the doctrine, which they forwarded to the new pope, Theodore I (642‚Äì649), who, in turn, wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople to outline the heretical nature of Monothelitism. Paul, another devoted Monothelite, replied in a letter directing the pope to adhere to the doctrine of one will. Theodore, in turn, excommunicated the patriarch in 649 and declared Paul a heretic.Bury, pg 292 Constans II was only 17 and was supremely indifferent to the religious debates convulsing the Church.Bury, pg 293 However, he was certainly concerned about the effect that all of the arcane debates had on the Roman Empire and so he issued an imperial edict, the Type of Constans. The edict made it illegal to discuss in any manner Christ possessing either one or two wills or one or two energies. He declared that the whole controversy was to be forgotten: \\"the scheme which existed before the strife arose shall be maintained, as it would have been if no such disputation had arisen\\". He would soon discover he could no longer turn the clock back. In Rome and the West, opposition to Monothelitism was reaching fever pitch, and the Type of Constans did nothing to defuse the situation but indeed made it worse by implying that either doctrine was as good as the other. Theodore planned the Lateran Council of 649 to condemn the Ecthesis but died before he could convene it, which his successor, Pope Martin I (649‚Äì653), did. The council condemned the Ecthesis but also the Type. After the synod, Pope Martin wrote to Constans to inform him of its conclusions and to require him to condemn both the Monothelite doctrine and his own Type. Unfortunately, Constans was not the sort of emperor to take such a rebuke of imperial authority lightly.Norwich, pg 318 Even while the Lateran Synod was sitting, Olympius arrived as the new exarch of Ravenna, with instructions to ensure that the Type was followed in Italy and to use whatever means necessary to ensure that the Pope adhered to it.Bury, p 294 He was unable to complete his mission and soon died, but his successor, Theodore I Calliopas, seized Pope Martin and abducted him to Constantinople, where he was imprisoned and tortured before he was condemned for breaking the imperial commands and banished before he died from his treatment at the hands of the emperor.Bury, pg 296 The emperor continued to persecute any who spoke out against Monothelitism, including Maximus the Confessor and a number of his disciples. Maximus lost his tongue and his right hand in an effort to have him recant.Norwich, pg 319 Nevertheless, his brutality had an effect, with the patriarchs, including the popes, remaining silent throughout the remainder of his reign. Condemnation Emperor Constantine IV, who convened the Sixth Ecumenical Council in 678. After Constans's death in 668, the throne passed to his son Constantine IV. Pope Vitalian (657‚Äì672), who had hosted the visit of Constans II to Rome in 663, almost immediately declared himself for the doctrine of the two wills of Christ. In response, Patriarch Theodore I of Constantinople and Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch, both pressed Constantine to take some measures against the pope. Constantine, however, decided to let the Monothelite question be decided entirely by a church council.Bury, pg 314 He asked if the pope (now Pope Agatho, 678‚Äì681) would be willing to send delegates to an ecumenical council to be held at Constantinople so that the question could be firmly ended. Pope Agatho agreed but first held a preliminary synod at Rome 680 to obtain the opinion of the western theologians. Other synods were also held at Milan and at the Council of Hatfield in 680, convoked by Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury.Bury, p. 315: see Venerable Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, Book IV, Chapter XVII (XV), B. Colgrave & R. Mynors (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969), pp. 384-387.Council of H√¶thfeld All of the western synods condemned Monothelitism, and a report of the Roman synod's acts was sent to Constantinople, along with the western delegates to the council. The council met from 680 to 681. Apart from the Roman representatives, it also hosted representatives from the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem, and the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch were present in person. With the exception of two individuals, it condemned the Monothelite doctrine as one that diminished the fullness of Christ's humanity and asserted Dyothelitism to be the true doctrine, with Christ possessing \\"two natural wills and two natural energies, without division, alteration, separation or confusion\\".Bury, pg 317 It also anathematised the chief representatives of the discredited doctrine, including Pope Honorius. The churches condemned at Constantinople included the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Maronite Church, but the Oriental Orthodox have denied that they ever held the Monothelite view and describe their own Christology as Miaphysite), and the Maronites accept the Chalcedonian formula since they are in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. That brought to an end the controversy over Monothelitism. Controversy over Honorius I Pope Honorius I A side issue over the statements of Pope Honorius I and his condemnation by the council arose in discussions concerning papal infallibility. In the view of historians such as John Bagnell Bury, Honorius, with a traditional Latin dislike for dialectics, did not fully comprehend the issues. The question of Monoenergism, as presented by Patriarch Sergius, seemed to Honorius to be a matter of grammar, rather than theology. Though he used the expression \\"one will\\", he was no Monothelite, for he placed \\"one energy\\" and \\"two energies\\" on exactly the same footing. Further, his second letter to Sergius was by and large orthodox. Maximus the Confessor, in his Disputation with Pyrrhus, interprets the statement \\"one will\\" as referring the integrity of Christ's human will, in contrast to the fallen human will, which seeks diverse and contradictory goods. The Third Council of Constantinople posthumously anathematised Honorius as a heretic: \\"And with these we define that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius who was some time Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to Sergius, that in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines\\" (13th session) and \\"To Honorius, the heretic, anathema!\\" (16th session). However, Pope Leo II's letter of confirmation of the Council interprets the council as intending to criticise Honorius not for error of belief but for \\"imprudent economy of silence\\". Leo's letter stated: \\"We anathematize the inventors of the new error, that is, Theodore, Sergius,... and also Honorius, who did not attempt to sanctify this Apostolic Church with the teaching of Apostolic tradition, but by profane treachery permitted its purity to be polluted.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Honorius I See also *Apollinarism *Chalcedonian Christianity *Impeccability *Monergism *Monoenergism *Papal profession of faith (late 7th century) References Sources * Allen, Pauline: \\"Sophronius of Jerusalem and Seventh Century Heresy\\" Oxford University Press 2009 * Bury, John B., A history of the later Roman empire from Arcadius to Irene, Volume 2 1889 * Chadwick, Henry, ‚ÄòThe Penguin History of the Church 1: The Early Church‚Äô (Penguin, 1993)  Norwich, John J., Byzantium: The Early Centuries (Penguin, 1988) Suermann, Harald: Die Gr√ºndungsgeschichte der Maronitischen Kirche.

Chalcedonian Christians follow the Definition of Chalcedon, a religious doctrine concerning the divine and human natures of Jesus Christ. The great majority of Christian communions and confessions in the 21st century are Chalcedonian, but from the 5th to the 8th centuries the ascendancy of Chalcedonian Christology (detailed below) was not always certain. Doctrinally, Chalcedonianism may be regarded as a subset of Nicene Christianity. It is the opposite of Non-Chalcedonianism.  History  The dogmatic disputes raised during the Council of Chalcedon led to the Chalcedonian Schism thus to the formation of the Non-Chalcedonian body of churches known as Oriental Orthodoxy. The Chalcedonian churches remained united with the Holy See of Rome, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (or \\"New Rome\\") and the Eastern Orthodox patriarchates of the Middle East (namely Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem). Together, these five patriarchates were considered the pillars of orthodox catholic Christendom and of the Chalcedonian confession of faith. During the 6th-century reign of Emperor Justinian I, the five patriarchates were recognised as the Pentarchy, the official ecclesiastical authority of the Imperial Christian Church. Pre- Chalcedonian Christianity was mainly based on Paul. John of Tella described the foundations of pre-Chalcedeonian Christianity: > And [the council of Nicaea] considered and saw widely where it set up its > building; and the divine Paul, wise among spiritual master-builders, invoked > them, and showed them the true foundation, a rock that can not be shaken; on > it they will place and build their building; and those he spoke before them > when he was saying: Another foundation except for you this you should not > constitute, this is Jesus Christ; it was on this that Simeon built and John; > on it that Thomas completed [his mission] in Cush. And in Egypt Mark built > upon it, and Addai the house of the Medians, Persians and Parthians. And it > was on this that the apostle Matthew built in Palestine, and Jacob, the > brother of our Lord. He believed this foundation was abandoned at Chalcedon: \\"the council of Chalcedon builds not at all on the foundation that the divine master-builder Paul has set up, but on the sand that Nestorius, the confused and dethroned builder, put to it.\\" Today, the great majority of Christian denominations can be considered descended from the Pentarchy, subscribing to Chalcedonian Christianity, broadly divided into the Roman Catholic Church in the predominantly Latin-speaking West, the Eastern Orthodox Church in the predominantly Greek-speaking East, and the Protestant denominations created in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. The groups that rejected Chalcedon's Christological definition were the majority of the Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian Christians, together with a part of the Indian and Syriac Christians (the latter of which came to be identified as Jacobites). Today, such groups are known collectively as the Non-Chalcedonian, Miaphysite, or Oriental Orthodox churches. Some Armenian Christians, especially in the region of Cappadocia and Trebizond inside the Byzantine Empire, accepted the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon and engaged in polemics against the Armenian Apostolic Church. After the conclusion of Byzantine-Sasanian War of 572-591, direct rule of the Byzantine Empire was extended to all western parts of Armenia, and soon after that emperor Maurice (582-602) decided to strengthen his political control over the entire region by supporting the local pro- Chalcedonian faction of the Armenian Church. In 593, a regional council of western Armenian bishops was convened in the city of Theodosiopolis, and proclaimed allegiance to the Chalcedonian Definition. The council also elected John (Yohannes, or Hovhannes) of Bagaran as the new Catholicos of the Chalcedonian Armenians. Chalcedonian Christological definition Those present at the Council of Chalcedon accepted Trinitarianism and the concept of hypostatic union, and rejected Arianism, Modalism, and Ebionism as heresies (which had also been rejected at the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325). Those present at the council also rejected the Christological doctrines of the Nestorians, Eutychians, and monophysites (these doctrines had also been rejected at the First Council of Ephesus in 431). The Chalcedonian understanding of how the divine and human relate in Jesus Christ is that the humanity and divinity are exemplified as two natures and that the one hypostasis of the Logos perfectly subsists in these two natures. The Non- Chalcedonians hold the position of miaphysitism (sometimes called monophysitism by their opponents). Miaphysitism holds that in the one person of Jesus Christ, divinity and humanity are united in one nature, the two being united without separation, without confusion and without alteration. That led many members of the two churches to condemn each other: the Chalcedonians condemning the Non-Chalcedonians as Eutychian Monophysites, and the Non- Chalcedonians condemning the Chalcedonians as Nestorians. Later interpreters of the council held that Chalcedonian Christology also rejected monothelitism and monoenergism (rejected at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680). Those who did not accept the Chalcedonian Christology now call themselves non- Chalcedonian. Historically, they called themselves Miaphysites or Cyrillians (after St Cyril of Alexandria, whose writing On the Unity of Christ was adopted by them and taken as their standard) and were called by Orthodox Christians monophysites. Those who held to the non-Chalcedonian Christologies called the doctrine of Chalcedon dyophysitism.

Welcome sign It had been a fortified location since September 17, 1776, when New Spain established the presidio to gain a foothold in Alta California and the San Francisco Bay. It passed to Mexico, which in turn passed it to the United States in 1848. As part of a 1989 military reduction program under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, Congress voted to end the Presidio's status as an active military installation of the U.S. Army. On October 1, 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service, ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed commercial and public use. In 1996, the United States Congress created the Presidio Trust to oversee and manage the interior 80% of the park's lands, with the National Park Service managing the coastal 20%. In a first-of-its-kind structure, Congress mandated that the Presidio Trust make the Presidio financially self- sufficient by 2013. The Presidio achieved the goal in 2005, eight years ahead of the scheduled deadline. The park is characterized by many wooded areas, hills, and scenic vistas overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. It was recognized as a California Historical Landmark in 1933 and as a National Historic Landmark in 1962. Presidio visitor centers The visitor centers are operated by the National Park Service: * Presidio Visitor Center: offers changing exhibits about the Presidio, information about sights and activities in the park, and a bookstore. The Presidio Transit Center is located adjacent to this visitor center and is served by the PresidiGo Shuttle and Muni bus routes. * Battery Chamberlin: seacoast defense museum and artillery display at Baker Beach built in 1904. * Fort Point: 1861 brick and granite fortification located under the Golden Gate Bridge. The visitor center, open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, offers video orientations, guided tours, self-guiding materials, exhibits, and a bookstore. * Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Visitor Center: This center offers hands-on marine-life exhibits, and is located in a historic Coast Guard Station at the west end of Crissy Field. The building was used by the Coast Guard from 1890 to 1990. * Golden Gate Bridge Pavilion: opened May 2012 for the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Pavilion is the first visitor center in the history of the Golden Gate Bridge. It is located just east of the southern end of the bridge. *Hidden Presidio Outdoor Track: begins at Julius Kahn Playground and encircles the valley just below it, of dirt trails, cutbacks, wooden stairs, and various altitudes. To view track course see Crissy Field Center Crissy Field Center (former Air Service/Air Corps/Army Air Forces airfield) is an urban environmental education center with programs for schools, public workshops, after-school programs, summer camps, and more. The center is operated by the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and overlooks a restored tidal marsh. The facilities include interactive environmental exhibits, a media lab, resource library, arts workshop, science lab, gathering room, teaching kitchen, caf√© and bookstore. The landscape of Crissy Field was designed by George Hargreaves. The project restored a naturally functioning and sustaining tidal wetland as a habitat for flora and fauna, which were previously not in evidence on the site. It also restored a historic grass airfield that functioned as a culturally significant military airfield between 1919 and 1936. The park at Crissy Field expanded and widened the recreational opportunities of the existing San Francisco shore to a broader number of Presidio residents and visitors. Tunnel Tops park A major planned component of the Presidio's park attractions is the Tunnel Tops project, which would construct a 14-acre park (about the same size as Mission Dolores Park) on top of the tunneled portions of Doyle Drive. The park would contain several meadows and walking trails, along with viewpoints for major landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge. Negotiations between Caltrans, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, and the Presidio Trust to finalize the land transfer for the park lasted from 2015 to 2018. The budget for the park is $100 million, funded with public funds from the Presidio Trust along with private contributions. Construction for the park is planned to start in October 2018 and the park is slated to be open for public use in 2021.  Timeline * Pre-1776: The area was Ohlone land. * 1776: Spanish Captain Juan Bautista de Anza led 193 soldiers, women, and children on a trek from present day Tubac, Arizona, to San Francisco Bay. * September 17, 1776: The Presidio began as a Spanish garrison to defend Spain's claim to San Francisco Bay and to support Mission Dolores; it was the northernmost outpost of New Spain in the declining Spanish Empire. * 1794: Castillo de San Joaquin, an artillery emplacement was built above present-day Fort Point, San Francisco, complete with iron or bronze cannon. Six cannons may be seen in the Presidio today. * 1776‚Äì1821: The Presidio was a simple fort made of adobe, brush and wood. It often was damaged by earthquakes or heavy rains. In 1783, its company was only 33 men. Presidio soldiers' duties were to support Mission Dolores by controlling Indian workers in the Mission, and also farming, ranching, and hunting in order to supply themselves and their families. Support from Spanish authorities in Mexico was very limited. * 1821: Mexico became independent of Spain. The Presidio received even less support from Mexico. Residents of Alta California, which included the Presidio, debated separating entirely from Mexico. * 1827, January: Minor earthquake in San Francisco, some buildings were damaged extensively. * 1835: The Presidio garrison, led by Mariano Vallejo, relocated to Sonoma. A small detachment remained at the Presidio, which was in decline. * 1846: American settlers and adventurers in Sonoma staged the Bear Flag Revolt against Mexican rule. Mariano Vallejo was imprisoned for a brief time. Lieutenant John C. Fremont, a U.S. Army officer, with a small detachment of soldiers and frontiersmen crossed the Golden Gate in a boat to \\"capture\\" the Presidio unresisted. A cannon that was spiked by Fremont remains on the Presidio today. The Presidio ca. 1850 * 1846‚Äì1848: The U.S. Army occupied the Presidio. The Presidio began a long era directing operations to control and protect Native Americans as headquarters for scattered Army units on the West Coast. * 1853: Work was begun on Fort Point, which became a fine example of coastal defenses of its time. Fort Point, located at the foot of the Golden Gate in the Presidio, was the keystone of an elaborate network of fortifications to defend San Francisco Bay. These fortifications now reflect 150 years of military concern for defense of the West Coast. * 1861‚Äì1865: The American Civil War involved the Presidio. Colonel Albert Sydney Johnston protected Union weapons from being taken by Southern sympathizers in San Francisco. Later, he resigned from the Union Army and became a general in the Confederate Army. He was killed at the Battle of Shiloh. The Presidio organized regiments of volunteers for the Civil War and to control Indians in California and Oregon during the absence of federal troops. * 1869‚Äì1870: Major General George Henry Thomas, who was an American Civil War hero, led the Division of the Pacific. General Thomas died in 1870 and was buried in Troy, New York. * 1872‚Äì1873: Modoc Indian Campaign involved some Presidio troops and command in this major battle, the last large scale U.S. Army operation against Native Americans in the Far West. * 1890‚Äì1914: Presidio soldiers became the nation's first \\"park rangers\\" by patrolling the new Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. * 1898‚Äì1906: The Presidio became the nation's center for assembling, training, and shipping out forces to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Philippine Islands and the subsequent Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (Philippine Insurrection). Letterman Army Hospital was modernized and expanded to care for the many wounded and seriously ill soldiers from these campaigns. The Philippine campaign was an early major U.S. military intervention in the Asia/Pacific region. Camp Merriam, located just north of the presidio, was established to train and house volunteers for service during the Spanish-American War. * 1903: President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Presidio. His honor guard was from the African American \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" 9th Cavalry Regiment, then at the Presidio. This regiment took a role in Roosevelt's famous charge of San Juan Hill in Cuba. A refugee camp at the Presidio after the San Francisco earthquake * 1906: The San Francisco earthquake of April 1906 led to an immediate Army response directed by General Frederick Funston, who had earned the Medal of Honor for his bravery in the Philippines. Army units provided security and fought fires at the direction of the city government. After the fire that resulted from the earthquake, Presidio soldiers gave aid, food, and shelter to refugees. Temporary camps for refugees were set up on the Presidio. * 1912: Fort Winfield Scott was established in the western part of the Presidio as a coast artillery post and the headquarters of the Artillery District of San Francisco. * 1914‚Äì1916: The Presidio Commander, General John J. Pershing commanded the Mexican Punitive Expedition to eliminate the threat of Pancho Villa, a Mexican rebel and bandit, who conducted raids across the U.S. border. General Pershing's family died in a tragic fire while he was away. As a result of the 1915 fire in General Pershing's quarters, the Presidio Fire Department was established as the first fire station staffed 24 hours per day on a military post. * 1915: Part of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition was located on the Presidio waterfront, which was expanded by landfill for the purpose. Soldiers supported the Exposition with parades, honor guards, and artillery demonstrations. The Exposition was to celebrate opening of the Panama Canal. * 1917‚Äì1918: The Presidio rapidly expanded with new cantonments and training areas for World War I. Recruiting, training, and deploying units again become the Presidio's role. An officer training camp was located here. The waterfront area was covered by quickly assembled buildings and the railroad track into the Presidio was busy with wartime traffic. During the war, the 30th Infantry Regiment, \\"San Francisco's Own,\\" whose motto, \\"OUR COUNTRY NOT OURSELVES,\\" fought with distinction in World War I as a key fighting element of the 3rd Infantry Division who earned the title \\"Rock of the Marne.\\" The 30th Infantry Regiment was frequently based at the Presidio. * 1918‚Äì1920: The Presidio was the center for forming and training the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. This was a little-remembered force that moved into Siberia during the Russian Civil War. The mission of this force changed often. It encountered hostility from another part of the Expeditionary Force, Japan, while fighting bandits, and protecting Allied civilians. * 1920‚Äì1932: The Presidio became home to Crissy Field, the major pioneering military aviation field located on the West Coast. Trailbreaking transpacific and transcontinental flights occurred here. At Crissy, future General \\"Hap\\" Arnold developed techniques for the new military aviation. Arnold later commanded the Army Air Corps and Army Air Forces in World War II. * 1941‚Äì1946: World War II saw intense activity at the Presidio. It continued as a coordinating headquarters, deployment center, and training site, as it was for most of its existence. The Western Defense Command was responsible for the defense of the West Coast. For a time this included supervising combat in the Aleutian Islands. The Presidio again was crowded with temporary barracks and training facilities. Letterman Army Hospital was filled with casualties. At one point, entire trains filled with war-wounded arrived at the Presidio from the battles of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. A Japanese Language School was set up to train Japanese-Americans to be interpreters in the war against Japan. Ironically, some of these soldiers' families were interned in camps for the rest of the war, while they performed bravely in the Pacific. * 1941‚Äì1945: The Commanding General of the Western Defense Command, General John L. DeWitt, responded to public hysteria directed against all Japanese on the West Coast. He recommended removing all Japanese, including citizens, from the Western Seaboard. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and some Western politicians also expressed alarm, although no incidents of sabotage occurred. President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, to direct removal of ethnic Japanese residents to internment camps. * 1946: After World War II, the Presidio command was redesignated the Sixth Army under the leadership of General Joseph Stilwell. It was responsible, again, for all U.S. Army forces in the Western U.S., to include training, supplies, and deployment. It also was the federal agency to coordinate disaster relief by the military. During this year, President Harry Truman had offered the Presidio as the site for the future United Nations Headquarters. A United Nations Committee visited the Presidio for the purpose of examining its suitability for the site, but the UN General Assembly ultimately voted in favor of its current New York City location instead. * 1950‚Äì1953: The Korean War tasked the Presidio's headquarters and support functions. Letterman Army Hospital was mobilized to care for casualties from the war. * 1951: The Presidio hosted ceremonies for signing the ANZUS Treaty, a security pact of Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. The Japan-US security treaty was signed at the Presidio, while the Japanese Peace Treaty was signed in downtown San Francisco. * 1961‚Äì1973: The Presidio filled a supporting role during the Vietnam War. Antiwar demonstrations took place at the Presidio's gates. * 1968: Richard Bunch shot, initiating the Presidio mutiny at the Presidio stockade prison. The XV Corps Deactivated. * 1969‚Äì1974: Letterman Army Hospital (LAMC) was modernized and Letterman Army Institute of Research (LAIR) was built. * 1991: The Presidio sent its few remaining units to war for the last time in Desert Storm, the First Gulf War. The role of Sixth Army was management of training and coordinating deployment of Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve units in the Western U.S. for Operation Desert Storm. * 1994: Sixth Army was inactivated and the Presidio closed as an active U.S. Army installation per BRAC. The Presidio was transferred to the National Park Service. * 1996: Park becomes privatized through congressional action. * 2001: Letterman Army Hospital was demolished. Later, the Letterman Digital Arts Center was constructed on the site. * 2005: The Bay School of San Francisco opens in Building 35. * 2009‚Äì2015: Doyle Drive Replacement Project ‚Äì Demolition of the Doyle Drive viaduct, to be replaced by an eight-lane boulevard, including two pairs of tunnels between Crissy Field and the Main Post and a pair of elevated viaducts, at a total project cost of approximately $1 billion. The original Doyle Drive was demolished April 27‚Äì30, 2012. Aerial view of the Presidio from outside the Golden Gate, with downtown and Bay Bridge in the background History Early history California Historical Landmark marker for the Presidio The Presidio in 1817 Battery Chamberlin The Presidio was originally a Spanish fort sited by Juan Bautista de Anza on March 28, 1776, built by a party led by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga later that year. In 1783, the Presidio's garrison numbered only 33 men. Upon Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, it was briefly operated as a Mexican fortification. The Presidio was seized by the U.S. military at the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846. It was officially re-opened by the Americans in 1848 and became home to several army headquarters and units, the last being the United States 6th Army. Several famous U.S. generals, such as William Sherman, George Henry Thomas, and John Pershing, made their homes here. During its long history, the Presidio was involved in most of America's military engagements in the Pacific Rim. Importantly, it was the assembly point for army forces that invaded the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, America's first major military engagement in the region. Beginning in the 1890s, the Presidio was home to the Letterman Army Medical Center (LAMC), named in 1911 for Jonathan Letterman, the medical director of the Civil War era Army of the Potomac. LAMC provided thousands of war-wounded with high quality medical care during every US foreign conflict of the 20th century. One of the last two remaining cemeteries within the city's limits is the San Francisco National Cemetery. Among the military personnel interred there are General Federick Funston, hero of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and commanding officer of the Presidio at the time of the 1906 earthquake; and General Irvin McDowell, a Union Army commander who was defeated by the Confederates in the First Battle of Bull Run. The Marine Hospital operated a cemetery for merchant seamen approximately from the hospital property. Based on city municipal records, historians estimate that the cemetery was in use from 1885 to 1912. As part of the \\"Trails Forever\\" initiative, the Parks Conservancy, the National Park Service, and the Presidio Trust partnered to build a walking trail along the south side of the site featuring interpretive signage about its history. Street map of 1937 of the Army Base The Presidio was the home of the Western Defense Command headquarters during World War II. It was here that Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt signed 108 Civilian Exclusion Orders and directives for the Internment of Japanese Americans under the authority of Executive Order 9066 signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. Preservation After a hard-fought battle, the Presidio averted being sold at auction and came under the management of the Presidio Trust, a U.S. government corporation established by an act of Congress in 1996. The Presidio Trust now manages most of the park in partnership with the National Park Service. The trust has jurisdiction over the interior 80 percent of the Presidio, including nearly all of its historic structures. The National Park Service manages coastal areas. Primary law enforcement throughout the Presidio is the jurisdiction of the United States Park Police. One of main objectives of the Presidio Trust's program was achieving financial self-sufficiency by fiscal year 2013, which was reached in 2006. Immediately after its inception, the Trust began preparing rehabilitation plans for the park. Many areas had to be decontaminated before they could be prepared for public use. The Presidio Trust Act calls for \\"preservation of the cultural and historic integrity of the Presidio for public use.\\" The Act also requires that the Presidio Trust be financially self-sufficient by 2013. These imperatives have resulted in numerous conflicts between the need to maximize income by leasing historic buildings, and permitting public use despite most structures being rented privately. Further differences have arisen from the divergent needs of preserving the integrity of the National Historic Landmark District in the face of new construction, competing pressures for natural habitat restoration, and requirements for commercial purposes that impede public access. As of 2007, there was only a rudimentary visitors' center to orient visitors to the Presidio's history. Crissy Field, a former airfield, has undergone extensive restoration and now serves as very popular recreational area. It borders on the San Francisco Marina in the east and on the Golden Gate Bridge in the west. The park has a large inventory of approximately 800 buildings, many of them historical. By 2004, about 50% of the buildings on park grounds had been restored and partially remodeled. The Presidio Trust has contracted commercial real estate management companies to help attract and retain residential and commercial tenants. The total capacity is estimated at 5,000 residents when all buildings have been rehabilitated. Among the Presidio's residents is The Bay School of San Francisco, a private coeducational college preparatory school located in the central Main Post area. Others include The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Tides Foundation, the Arion Press, Sports Basement Presidio, and The Walt Disney Family Museum, a museum in the memory of Walt Disney. Many various commercial enterprises also lease buildings on the Presidio, including Starbucks Coffee. Sections of the Letterman Army Hospital were preserved by the Thoreau Center for Sustainability. The Presidio of San Francisco is the only U.S. national recreation area with an extensive residential leasing program. The Presidio has four creeks that are currently being restored by park stewards and volunteers to expand the former extents of their riparian habitats. The creeks are Lobos and Dragonfly creeks, El Polin Spring, and Coyote Gulch. 1990s - present Presidio Parkway construction seen from Storey Avenue in October 2013 The Trust entered a major agreement with Lucasfilm to build a new facility called the Letterman Digital Arts Center (LDAC), which is now Lucasfilm's corporate headquarters. The site replaced portions of what was the Letterman Hospital. George Lucas won the development rights for of the Presidio, in June 1999, after beating out a number of rival plans including a leading proposal by the Shorenstein Company. LDAC replaced the former Lucasfilm headquarters in San Rafael. The $300 million development includes nearly of office space and a underground parking garage with a capacity of 2,500 employees. Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic, Lucas Licensing, and Lucas Online divisions reside at the site. George Lucas's proposal included plans for a high-tech Presidio museum and a \\"Great Lawn\\" that is now open to the public. In 2007, Donald Fisher, founder of the Gap clothing stores and former Board member of the Presidio Trust, announced a plan to build a museum tentatively named the Contemporary Art Museum of the Presidio, to house his art collection. Fisher's plan encountered widespread skepticism and even outright hostility amongst San Francisco preservationists, local residents, the National Park Service, the Presidio Trust, and city officials who saw the Presidio site as 'hallowed ground.' Due to such criticism, Fisher withdrew his plans to build the museum in the Presidio and instead donated the art to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art before his death in 2009. An aerial view of the Presidio As the Doyle Drive viaduct was deemed seismically unsafe and obsolete, construction started on the demolition of Doyle Drive in 2008 to replace the structure with a flat, broad-lane highway with a tunnel through the bluffs above Crissy Field, called the Presidio Parkway. The project costs $1 billion and was scheduled to be completed by 2016. The Trust plans to create a promenade that will link the Lombard gate and the new Lucasfilm campus to the Main Post and ultimately to the Golden Gate Bridge. The promenade is part of a trails expansion plan that will add of new pathways and eight scenic overlooks throughout the park. In October 2008, artist Andy Goldsworthy constructed a new sculpture \\"Spire\\" in the Presidio. It is tall and located near the Arguello Gate. It represents the tree replanting effort that has been underway at the Presidio. In 2010, a trampoline park called House of Air was built using an old Aircraft Hangar.

Isaac Asimov called him \\"hard-luck Scheele\\" because he made a number of chemical discoveries before others who are generally given the credit. For example, Scheele discovered oxygen (although Joseph Priestley published his findings first), and identified molybdenum, tungsten, barium, hydrogen, and chlorine before Humphry Davy, among others. Scheele discovered organic acids tartaric, oxalic, uric, lactic, and citric, as well as hydrofluoric, hydrocyanic, and arsenic acids.Richard Myers, The Basics of Chemistry (2003) He preferred speaking German to Swedish his whole life, as German was commonly spoken among Swedish pharmacists.Fors, Hjalmar 2008. Stepping through Science‚Äôs Door: C. W. Scheele, from Pharmacist's Apprentice to Man of Science. Ambix 55: 29-49 Biography Scheele was born in Stralsund, in western Pomerania, which at the time was a Swedish Dominion inside the Holy Roman Empire. Scheele's father Joachim (or Johann) Christian Scheele, was a grain dealer and brewer from a respected German family. His mother was Margaretha Eleanore Warnekros. Friends of Scheele's parents taught him the art of reading prescriptions and the meaning of chemical and pharmaceutical signs.Castle, Fred'k A. American Druggist Vol.15, August, 1886 \\"Carl Wilhelm Scheele\\" Then, in 1757, at age fourteen Carl was sent to Gothenburg as an apprentice pharmacist with another family friend and apothecary. (Martin Andreas Bauch). Scheele retained this position for eight years. During this time he ran experiments late into the night and read the works of Nicolas Lemery, Caspar Neumann, Johann von L√∂wenstern- Kunckel and Georg Ernst Stahl (the champion of the phlogiston theory). Much of Scheele's later theoretical speculations were based upon Stahl. In 1765 Scheele worked under the progressive and well informed apothecary, C. M. Kjellstr√∂m in Malm√∂, and became acquainted with Anders Jahan Retzius who was a lecturer at the University of Lund and later a professor of chemistry at Stockholm. Scheele arrived in Stockholm between 1767 and 1769 and worked as a pharmacist. During this period he discovered tartaric acid and with his friend, Retzius, studied the relation of quicklime to calcium carbonate. While in the capital, he also became acquainted with many luminaries, such as: Abraham B√§ck, Peter Jonas Bergius, Bengt Bergius and Carl Friedreich von Schultzenheim. In the fall of 1770 Scheele became director of the laboratory of the great pharmacy of Locke, at Uppsala which is about 40 miles north of Stockholm. The laboratory supplied chemicals to Professor of Chemistry Torbern Bergman. A friendship developed between Scheele and Bergman after Scheele analyzed a reaction which Bergman and his assistant Johan Gottlieb Gahn could not resolve. The reaction was between melted saltpetre and acetic acid which produced a red vapor. Further study of this reaction later led to Scheele's discovery of oxygen (see \\"The theory of phlogiston\\" below). Based upon this friendship and respect Scheele was given free use of Bergman's laboratory. Both men were profiting from their working relationship. In 1774 Scheele was nominated by Peter Jonas Bergius to be a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and was elected February 4, 1775. In 1775 Scheele also managed for a short time a pharmacy in K√∂ping. Between the end of 1776 and the beginning of 1777 Scheele established his own business there. On October 29, 1777, Scheele took his seat for the first, and only time, at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences and on November 11 passed the examination as apothecary before the Royal Medical College and did so with highest honours. After his return to K√∂ping he devoted himself, outside of his business, to scientific researches which resulted in a long series of important papers. Existing theories before Scheele By the time he was a teenager, Scheele had learned the dominant theory of gases which in the 1770s was the phlogiston theory. Phlogiston, classified as \\"matter of fire\\", was supposed to be released from any burning material, and when it was exhausted, combustion would stop. When Scheele discovered oxygen he called it \\"fire air\\" as it supported combustion. Scheele explained oxygen using phlogistical terms because he did not believe that his discovery disproved the phlogiston theory. Before Scheele made his discovery of oxygen, he studied air. Air was thought to be an element that made up the environment in which chemical reactions took place but did not interfere with the reactions. Scheele's investigation of air enabled him to conclude that air was a mixture of \\"fire air\\" and \\"foul air;\\" in other words, a mixture of two gases. Scheele performed numerous experiments in which he heated substances such as saltpetre (potassium nitrate), manganese dioxide, heavy metal nitrates, silver carbonate and mercuric oxide. In all of these experiments, he isolated the same gas: his \\"fire air,\\" which he believed combined with phlogiston in materials to be released during heat-releasing reactions. However, his first publication, Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer, was delivered to the printer Swederus in 1775, but not published until 1777, at which time both Joseph Priestley and Lavoisier had already published their experimental data and conclusions concerning oxygen and the phlogiston theory. Carl was credited for finding oxygen with two other people, Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier. The first English edition, Chemical Observation and Experiments on Air and Fire was published in 1780, with an introduction \\"Chemical Treatise on Air and Fire\\".p101, A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900, Henry Marshall Leicester, Herbert S. Klickstein - 1969 The theory of phlogiston Engraving on the title page of Scheele's Chemical Treatise on Air and Fire (1777) (d. K√∂nigl. Schwed. Acad. d. Wissenschaft Mitgliedes, Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer)Scheele achieved astonishingly prolific and important results without the expensive laboratory equipment to which his Parisian contemporary Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was accustomed. Through the studies of Lavoisier, Joseph Priestley, Scheele, and others, chemistry was made a standardized field with consistent procedures. Although Scheele was unable to grasp the significance of his discovery of the substance that Lavoisier later named oxygen, his work was essential for the abandonment of the long-held theory of phlogiston. Scheele's study of the gas not yet named oxygen was prompted by a complaint by Torbern Olof Bergman, a professor at Uppsala University who would eventually become Scheele's friend. Bergman informed Scheele that the saltpeter he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it came into contact with acetic acid. Scheele's quick explanation was that the saltpeter had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and gave off a new phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid). Bergman next suggested that Scheele analyze the properties of manganese (IV) oxide. It was through his studies of manganese (IV) oxide that Scheele developed his concept of \\"fire air\\" (his name for oxygen). He ultimately obtained oxygen by heating mercuric oxide, silver carbonate, magnesium nitrate, and other nitrate salts. Scheele wrote about his findings to Lavoisier who was able to see the significance of the results. His discovery of oxygen (ca. 1771) was chronologically earlier than the corresponding work of Priestley and Lavoisier, but he did not publish this discovery until 1777, after both of his rivals had published. Although Scheele would always believe in some form of the phlogiston theory, his work reduced phlogiston to an unusually simple form, complicated only by the fact that chemists of Scheele's day still believed that light and heat were elements and were to be found in combination with them. Thus, Scheele assumed that hydrogen was composed of phlogiston (a reducing principle lost when objects were burned) plus heat. Scheele speculated that his fire air or oxygen (which he found the active part of air, estimating it to compose one quarter of air) combined with the phlogiston in objects to produce either light or heat (light and heat were presumed to be composed of differing proportions of phlogiston and oxygen). When other chemists later showed water is produced when burning hydrogen and that rusting of metals added weight to them and that passing water over hot iron gave hydrogen, Scheele modified his theory to suggest that oxygen was the salt (or \\"saline principle\\" of water), and that when added to iron, water was reproduced, which added weight to the iron as rust. Pyrolusite or MnO2. New elements and compounds In addition to his joint recognition for the discovery of oxygen, Scheele is argued to have been the first to discover other chemical elements such as barium (1772),Scheele (1774) \\"Om brunsten, eller magnesia, och dess egenskaper\\" (On brown-stone [i.e., manganese] or magnesia, and its properties), Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Handlingar (Proceedings of the Royal Scientific Academy [of Sweden]), 35 : 89-116.

In addition, he discovered a process similar to pasteurization, along with a means of mass-producing phosphorus (1769), leading Sweden to become one of the world's leading producers of matches. Chlorine gas. Scheele made one other very important scientific discovery in 1774, arguably more revolutionary than his isolation of oxygen. He identified lime, silica, and iron in a specimen of pyrolusite (impure manganese dioxide) given to him by his friend, Johann Gottlieb Gahn, but could not identify an additional component (this was the manganese, which Scheele recognized was present as a new element, but could not isolate). When he treated the pyrolusite with hydrochloric acid over a warm sand bath, a yellow-green gas with a strong odor was produced.See: * Scheele (1774) \\"Om brunsten, eller magnesia, och dess egenskaper\\" (On manganese or magnesia, and its properties), Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Handlingar (Proceedings of the Royal Scientific Academy [of Sweden]), 35 : 89-116. On pages 93-94 (paragraph 6), \\"Med den vanliga Salt-syran.\\" ([Reactions of manganese dioxide] with the standard salt-acid [i.e., hydrochloric acid]), Scheele describes a gas (chlorine) that was produced when he reacted manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid. Further experiments with chlorine appear in paragraphs 23-26, pages 105-110. * An English translation of the relevant passages about chlorine from Scheele's article appears in: Henry M. Leicester, A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900 (New York, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1952), pages 109-110. He found that the gas sank to the bottom of an open bottle and was denser than ordinary air. He also noted that the gas was not soluble in water. It turned corks a yellow color and removed all color from wet, blue litmus paper and some flowers. He called this gas with bleaching abilities, \\"dephlogisticated muriatic acid\\" (dephlogisticated hydrochloric acid, or oxidized hydrochloric acid). Eventually, Sir Humphry Davy named the gas chlorine, with reference to its pale green colour. Chlorine's bleaching properties were eventually turned into an industry by Berzelius, and became the foundation of a second industry of disinfection and deodorization of putrefied tissue and wounds (including wounds in living humans) in the hands of Labarraque, by 1824. Death Statue of Scheele in K√∂ping, Sweden. In the fall of 1785, Scheele began to suffer from symptoms described as kidney disease. In early 1786, he also contracted a disease of the skin, which, combined with kidney problems, so enfeebled him that he could foresee an early death. With this in mind, he married the widow of his predecessor, Pohl, two days before he died, so that he could pass undisputed title to his pharmacy and his possessions to her. While Scheele's experiments generated substances which have long since been found to be hazardous, the compounds and elements he used to start his experiments were dangerous to begin with, especially heavy metals. Like most of his contemporaries, in an age where there were few methods of chemical characterisation, Scheele would smell and taste any new substances he discovered. Asimov, Isaac (1966). The Noble Gases. Cumulative exposure to arsenic, mercury, lead, their compounds and perhaps hydrofluoric acid which he had discovered, as well as other substances took their toll on Scheele, who died at the early age of 43, on 21 May 1786, at his home in K√∂ping. Doctors said that he died of mercury poisoning. Published papers M√©moires de chymie, 1785, French translation by Mme. Claudine Picardet All of the following papers were published by Scheele within a span of fifteen years. Scheele's papers appeared first in the Transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in various periodicals such as Lorenz Florenz Friedrich von Crell's Chemische Annalen. Scheele's work was collected and published in four languages beginning with M√©moires de Chymie by Mme. Claudine Picardet in 1785 and Chemical Essays by Thomas Beddoes in 1786, followed by Latin and German.

Method acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by a number of different theatre practitioners. These techniques are built on Stanislavski's system, developed by the Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski and captured in his books An Actor Prepares, Building a Character, and Creating a Role. Among those who have contributed to the development of the Method, three teachers are associated with \\"having set the standard of its success\\", each emphasizing different aspects of the approach: Lee Strasberg (the psychological aspects), Stella Adler (the sociological aspects), and Sanford Meisner (the behavioral aspects).Krasner (2000b, 129). The approach was first developed when they worked together at the Group Theatre in New York.Krasner (2000b, 130).  From the \\"system\\" to the Method  \\"The Method\\" is an elaboration of the \\"system\\" of acting developed by the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski. In the first three decades of the 20th century, Stanislavski organized his training, preparation, and rehearsal techniques into a coherent, systematic methodology. The \\"method\\" brought together and built on: (1) the director-centred, unified aesthetic and disciplined, ensemble approach of the Meiningen company; (2) the actor-centred realism of the Maly; (3) and the naturalistic staging of Antoine and the independent theatre movement.Benedetti (1989, 5‚Äì11, 15, 18) and (1999b, 254), Braun (1982, 59), Carnicke (2000, 13, 16, 29), Counsell (1996, 24), Gordon (2006, 38, 40‚Äì41), and Innes (2000, 53‚Äì54). Stanislavski's \\"system\\", based on his \\"Plan of Experiencing\\" (1935) The \\"system\\" cultivates what Stanislavski calls the \\"art of experiencing\\" (to which he contrasts the \\"art of representation\\").Benedetti (1999a, 201), Carnicke (2000, 17), and Stanislavski (1938, 16‚Äì36). Stanislavski's \\"art of representation\\" corresponds to Mikhail Shchepkin's \\"actor of reason\\" and his \\"art of experiencing\\" corresponds to Shchepkin's \\"actor of feeling\\"; see Benedetti (1999a, 202). It mobilizes the actor's conscious thought and will in order to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes like emotional experience and subconscious behavior, sympathetically and indirectly.Benedetti (1999a, 170). In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a \\"task\\").Benedetti (1999a, 182‚Äì183). Later, Stanislavski further elaborated the \\"system\\" with a more physically grounded rehearsal process known as the \\"Method of Physical Action\\".Benedetti (1999a, 325, 360) and (2005, 121) and Roach (1985, 197‚Äì198, 205, 211‚Äì215). The term \\"Method of Physical Action\\" was applied to this rehearsal process after Stanislavski's death. Benedetti indicates that though Stanislavski had developed it since 1916, he first explored it practically in the early 1930s; see (1998, 104) and (1999a, 356, 358). Gordon argues the shift in working- method happened during the 1920s (2006, 49‚Äì55). Vasili Toporkov, an actor who trained under Stanislavski in this approach, provides in his Stanislavski in Rehearsal (2004) a detailed account of the Method of Physical Action at work in Stanislavski's rehearsals. Minimizing at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an \\"active analysis\\", in which the sequence of dramatic situations are improvised.Benedetti (1999a, 355‚Äì256), Carnicke (2000, 32‚Äì33), Leach (2004, 29), Magarshack (1950, 373‚Äì375), and Whyman (2008, 242). \\"The best analysis of a play\\", Stanislavski argued, \\"is to take action in the given circumstances.\\"Quoted by Carnicke (1998, 156). Stanislavski continues: \\"For in the process of action the actor gradually obtains the mastery over the inner incentives of the actions of the character he is representing, evoking in himself the emotions and thoughts which resulted in those actions. In such a case, an actor not only understands his part, but also feels it, and that is the most important thing in creative work on the stage\\"; quoted by Magarshack (1950, 375). As well as Stanislavski's early work, the ideas and techniques of Yevgeny Vakhtangov (a Russian-Armenian student who had died in 1922 at the age of 39) were also an important influence on the development of the Method. Vakhtangov's \\"object exercises\\" were developed further by Uta Hagen as a means for actor training and the maintenance of skills. Strasberg attributed to Vakhtangov the distinction between Stanislavski's process of \\"justifying\\" behavior with the inner motive forces that prompt that behavior in the character and \\"motivating\\" behavior with imagined or recalled experiences relating to the actor and substituted for those relating to the character. Following this distinction, actors ask themselves \\"What would motivate me, the actor, to behave in the way the character does?\\" rather than the more Stanislavskian question \\"Given the particular circumstances of the play, how would I behave, what would I do, how would I feel, how would I react?\\"Carnicke (2009, 221).  United States  In America, the transmission of the earliest phase of Stanislavski's work via the students of the First Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) revolutionized acting in the West.Carnicke (1998, 1, 167) and (2000, 14), Counsell (1996, 24‚Äì25), Golub (1998, 1032), Gordon (2006, 71‚Äì72), Leach (2004, 29), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1‚Äì2). When the MAT toured the US in the early 1920s, Richard Boleslawski, one of Stanislavski's students from the First Studio, presented a series of lectures on the \\"system\\" that were eventually published as Acting: The First Six Lessons (1933). The interest generated led to a decision by Boleslawski and Maria Ouspenskaya (another student at the First Studio) to emigrate to the US and to establish the American Laboratory Theatre.Benedetti (1999a, 283, 286) and Gordon (2006, 71‚Äì72). However, the version of Stanislavski's practice these students took to the US with them was that developed in the 1910s, rather than the more fully elaborated version of the \\"system\\" detailed in Stanislavski's acting manuals from the 1930s, An Actor's Work and An Actor's Work on a Role. The first half of An Actor's Work, which treated the psychological elements of training, was published in a heavily abridged and misleadingly translated version in the US as An Actor Prepares in 1936. English-language readers often confused the first volume on psychological processes with the \\"system\\" as a whole.Benedetti (1999a, 332). Many of the American practitioners who came to be identified with the Method were taught by Boleslawski and Ouspenskaya at the American Laboratory Theatre.Krasner (2000b, 129‚Äì130). The approaches to acting subsequently developed by their students‚Äîincluding Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner‚Äîare often confused with Stanislavski's \\"system\\".  Emotion and imagination  Among the concepts and techniques of method acting are substitution, \\"as if\\", sense memory, affective memory, and animal work (all of which were first developed by Stanislavski). Contemporary method actors sometimes seek help from psychologists in the development of their roles.Kase (2011, 125) and Hull (1985, 10). In Strasberg's approach, actors make use of experiences from their own lives to bring them closer to the experience of their characters. This technique, which Stanislavski came to call emotion memory (Strasberg tends to use the alternative formulation, \\"affective memory\\"), involves the recall of sensations involved in experiences that made a significant emotional impact on the actor. Without faking or forcing, actors allow those sensations to stimulate a response and try not to inhibit themselves. Stanislavski's approach rejected emotion memory except as a last resort and prioritized physical action as an indirect pathway to emotional expression. This can be seen in Stanislavki's notes for Leonidov in the production plan for Othello and in Benedetti's discussion of his training of actors at home and later abroad.Benedetti (1999a, 351‚Äì352). Stanislavski confirmed this emphasis in his discussions with Harold Clurman in late 1935. In training, as distinct from rehearsal process, the recall of sensations to provoke emotional experience and the development of a vividly imagined fictional experience remained a central part both of Stanislavski's and the various Method-based approaches that developed out of it. A widespread misconception about method acting‚Äîparticularly in the popular media‚Äîequates method actors with actors who choose to remain in character even offstage or off-camera for the duration of a project. In his book A Dream of Passion, Strasberg wrote that Stanislavski, early in his directing career, \\"require[d] his actors to live 'in character' off stage\\", but that \\"the results were never fully satisfactory\\".Strasberg (1988, 44). Stanislavski did experiment with this approach in his own acting before he became a professional actor and founded the Moscow Art Theatre, though he soon abandoned it.Benedetti (1999a, 18‚Äì19) and Magarshack (1950, 25, 33‚Äì34). He would disguise himself as a tramp or drunk and visit the railway station, or as a fortune-telling gypsy. As Benedetti explains, however, Stanislavski soon abandoned the technique of maintaining a characterisation in real life; it does not form a part of his \\"system\\". Some method actors employ this technique, such as Daniel Day-Lewis, but Strasberg did not include it as part of his teachings and it \\"is not part of the Method approach\\".Skog (2010, 16). Strasberg's students included many prominent American actors of the latter half of the 20th century, including Paul Newman, Al Pacino, George Peppard, Dustin Hoffman, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Mickey Rourke, among others.Gussow (1982).  Modification of Strasberg's techniques   United States  Stella Adler, an actress and acting teacher whose students included Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty, and Robert De Niro, also broke with Strasberg after she studied with Stanislavski. Her version of the method is based on the idea that actors should stimulate emotional experience by imagining the scene's \\"given circumstances\\", rather than recalling experiences from their own lives. Adler's approach also seeks to stimulate the actor's imagination through the use of \\"as ifs\\", which substitute more personally affecting imagined situations for the circumstances experienced by the character. Strasberg's Method & Criticism The charge that Strasberg's method distorted Stanislavski's system has been responsible for a considerable revivalist interest in Stanislavski's \\"pure\\" teachings. As the use of the Method has declined considerably from its peak in the mid-20th century, acting teachers claiming to teach Stanislavski's unadulterated system are becoming more numerous.  Critical reception of Stanislavski's method   America  Alfred Hitchcock described his work with Montgomery Clift in I Confess as difficult \\"because you know, he was a method actor\\". He recalled similar problems with Paul Newman in Torn Curtain.Abramson (2015, 135). Lillian Gish quipped: \\"It's ridiculous. How would you portray death if you had to experience it first?\\"Flom (2009, 241). Charles Laughton, who worked closely for a time with Bertolt Brecht, argued that \\"Method actors give you a photograph\\", while \\"real actors give you an oil painting.\\"French (2008). During the filming of Marathon Man (1976), Laurence Olivier, who had lost patience with method acting two decades earlier while filming The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), was said to have quipped to Dustin Hoffman, after Hoffman stayed up all night to match his character's situation, that Hoffman should \\"try acting... It's so much easier.\\"  Indian cinema  There are claims in Indian media that in Indian cinema, a form of method acting was developed independently from American cinema. Dilip Kumar, a Hindi cinema actor who debuted in the 1940s and eventually became one of the biggest Indian movie stars of the 1950s and 1960s, was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. Kumar inspired many future Indian actors, from Amitabh Bachchan to Naseeruddin Shah and Shah Rukh Khan to Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Mammootty and Jayasurya are method actors predominantly in Malayalam films. Before Brando, There Was Dilip Kumar, The Quint, December 11, 2015 Kumar, who pioneered his own form of method acting without any acting school experience, was described as \\"the ultimate method actor\\" (natural actor) by the famous filmmaker Satyajit Ray., and in Telugu cinema senior actor S. V. Ranga Rao is also considered as one of the finest method actors ever the industry made, in Tamil cinema. Sivaji Ganesan and Kamal Hassan are also method actors.  Psychological effects  When the felt emotions of a played character are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor's psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.Hamden, Raymond. ‚ÄúClinical and Forensic Psychology.\\" The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, come when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are dredged up to add to the character,Grandey, Alicia A. ‚ÄúWhen ‚ÄòThe Show Must Go On‚Äô: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.\\" not just from employing personal emotions in performance. Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors \\"create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings\\". A mode of acting referred to as \\"surface acting\\" involves only changing one's actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically \\"positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion\\".Judge, Timothy A. \\"Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.\\" This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation. Raw emotion (unresolved emotions conjured up for acting) may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. Sleep deprivation alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to have \\"acute episodes of psychosis\\". Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals. These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.Konin, Elly A. ‚ÄúActing Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.\\"  List of method actors  *Hari Bansha Acharyahttps://www.pageantnepal.com/2018/02/05/hari-bansa-acharya/ *Manoj Bajpayee *Christian Bale *Anne Bancroft *Warren Beatty *Paula Beer *Jon Bernthal *Halle Berry *Cate Blanchett *Chadwick Boseman *Marlon Brando *Adrien Brody *Nicolas Cage *Michael Caine *Antonia Campbell-Hughes *Jim Carrey *Montgomery Clift *Sacha Baron Cohen *Bradley Cooper *Bryan Cranston *Tom Cruise *Benedict Cumberbatch *Matt Damon *Bette Davis *Daniel Day-Lewis *James Dean *Robert De Niro *Benicio del Toro *Johnny Depp *Leonardo DiCaprio *Robert Downey Jr. *Adam Driver *Faye Dunaway *Michael Fassbender *Sally Field *Ralph Fiennes *Jane Fonda *Jamie Foxx *James Franco *Lady Gaga *James Gandolfini *Andrew Garfield *Ryan Gosling *Jake Gyllenhaal *Kamal Haasan *Tom Hanks *Tom Hardy *Ed Harris *Julie Harris *Anne Hathaway *Sally Hawkins *Dustin Hoffman *Philip Seymour Hoffman *Dennis Hopper *Michael Ironside *Jeremy Irvine *Angelina Jolie *Harvey Keitel *Irrfan Khan *Val Kilmer *Nicole Kidman *Dilip Kumar *Shia LaBeouf *Heath Ledger *Melissa Leo *Jared Leto *Andie MacDowell *Karl Malden *Mammootty *Rooney Mara *Matthew McConaughey *Choi Min-sik *Marilyn Monroe *Judd Nelson *Paul Newman *Jack Nicholson *Leonard Nimoy *Edward Norton *Lupita Nyong'o *Bob Odenkirk *Gary Oldman *David Oyelowo *Al Pacino *Andr√©s Parra *Estelle Parsons *Robert Pattinson *Sean Penn *George Peppard *Joaquin Phoenix *Brad Pitt *Sidney Poitier *Natalie Portman *Charlotte Rampling *Christopher Reeve *Krysten Ritter *Margot Robbie *Mickey Rourke *Peter Sellers *Andy Serkis *Chlo√´ Sevigny *Martin Sheen *Madan Krishna Shrestha *Nawazuddin Siddiqui *Will Smith *Wesley Snipes *Kevin Spacey *Sylvester Stallone *Rod Steiger *Eric Stoltz *Meryl Streep *Jeremy Strong *Hilary Swank *Indira Varma *Eli Wallach *Denzel Washington *Forest Whitaker *Michelle Williams *Robin Williams *Kate Winslet *Shelley Winters  See also  * List of acting techniques  Notes   Sources   Primary sources  * Adler, Stella. 2000.

Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost or eliminated by catabolism and excretion. Thus, the longer the biological half-life of a toxic substance, the greater the risk of chronic poisoning, even if environmental levels of the toxin are not very high.\\"Bioaccumulation of Marine Pollutants [and Discussion]\\", by G. W. Bryan, M. Waldichuk, R. J. Pentreath and Ann Darracott. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences.

Bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.), while bioconcentration refers to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone.  Examples   Terrestrial Examples  An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved mercury, which forms organic species such as methylmercury, which is lipid- soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in mercury poisoning. Other lipid-soluble (fat-soluble) poisons include tetraethyllead compounds (the lead in leaded petrol), and DDT. These compounds are stored in the body's fat, and when the fatty tissues are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning. Strontium-90, part of the fallout from atomic bombs, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in osteogenesis, where its radiation can cause damage for a long time. Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the tobacco hornworm, which concentrates nicotine to a toxic level in its body as it consumes tobacco plants. Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on. Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of vitamin A, which becomes concentrated in carnivore livers of e.g. polar bears: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic explorers have suffered Hypervitaminosis A from eating the livers of bears (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of Antarctic explorers eating husky dog livers). One notable example of this is the expedition of Sir Douglas Mawson, where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.  Aquatic Examples  Coastal fish (such as the smooth toadfish) and seabirds (such as the Atlantic puffin) are often monitored for heavy metal bioaccumulation. Methylmercury gets into freshwater systems through industrial emissions and rain. As its concentration increases up the food web, it can reach dangerous levels for both fish and the humans who rely on fish as a food source. Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine algal blooms known as \\"red tides\\" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as mussels and oysters becoming toxic; coral reef fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as ciguatera when they accumulate a toxin called ciguatoxin from reef algae. In some eutrophic aquatic systems, biodilution can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to \\"dilute\\" the concentration of the pollutant.

After the Mishnah was published by Judah the Prince (c. 200 CE), the work was studied exhaustively by generation after generation of rabbis in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their discussions were written down in a series of books that became the Gemara, which when combined with the Mishnah constituted the Talmud. There are two versions of the Gemara. The Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi) or Palestinian Talmud was compiled by Jewish scholars of the Land of Israel, primarily of the academies of Tiberias and Caesarea, and was published between about 350‚Äì400 CE. The Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud) was published about 500 CE by scholars of Babylonia, primarily of the academies of Sura, Pumbedita, and Nehardea. By convention, a reference to the \\"Gemara\\" or \\"Talmud,\\" without further qualification, refers to the Babylonian version. The main compilers were Ravina and Rav Ashi. Gemara and Mishnah Kvutzat Rodges studying the gemara (June 1, 1935) The Gemara and the Mishnah together make up the Talmud. The Talmud thus comprises two components: the Mishnah ‚Äì the core text; and the Gemara ‚Äì analysis and commentary which \\"completes\\" the Talmud (see Structure of the Talmud). The rabbis of the Mishnah are known as Tannaim (sing. Tanna ). The rabbis of the Gemara are referred to as Amoraim (sing. Amora ◊ê◊û◊ï◊®◊ê). Because there are two Gemaras, there are in fact two Talmuds: the Jerusalem Talmud (Hebrew: , \\"Talmud Yerushalmi\\"), and the Babylonian Talmud (Hebrew: , \\"Talmud Bavli\\"), corresponding to the Jerusalem Gemara and the Babylonian Gemara; both share the same Mishnah. The Gemara is mostly written in Aramaic, the Jerusalem Gemara in Western Aramaic and the Babylonian in Eastern Aramaic, but both contain portions in Hebrew. Sometimes the language changes in the middle of a story. Origins of the word In a narrow sense, the word Gemara refers to the mastery and transmission of existing tradition, as opposed to sevara, which means the deriving of new results by logic. Both activities are represented in the \\"Gemara\\" as a literary work. The term \\"gemara\\" for the activity of study is far older than its use as a description of any text: thus Pirke Avot (Ch.5), a work long preceding the recording of the Talmud, recommends starting \\"Mishnah\\" at the age of 10 and \\"Gemara\\" at the age of 15. Homiletically, the word gemara (◊í◊û◊®◊ê) spells out the first letters of the words Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and Uriel - the names of the angels that man is protected with when delving into Torah study. The Sugya The analysis of the Amoraim is generally focused on clarifying the positions, words and views of the Tannaim. These debates and exchanges form the \\"building-blocks\\" of the gemara; the name for such a passage of gemara is a sugya (; plural sugyot). A sugya will typically comprise a detailed proof-based elaboration of the Mishna. Every aspect of the Mishnaic text is treated as a subject of close investigation. This analysis is aimed at an exhaustive understanding of the Mishna's full meaning. In the Talmud, a sugya is presented as a series of responsive hypotheses and questions ‚Äì with the Talmudic text as a record of each step in the process of reasoning and derivation. The Gemara thus takes the form of a dialectical exchange (by contrast, the Mishnah states concluded legal opinions ‚Äì and often differences in opinion between the Tannaim. There is little dialogue). The disputants here are termed the makshan (questioner, \\"one who raises a difficulty\\") and tartzan (answerer, \\"one who puts straight\\"). The gemara records the semantic disagreements between Tannaim and Amoraim. Some of these debates were actually conducted by the Amoraim, though many of them are hypothetically reconstructed by the Talmud's redactors. (Often imputing a view to an earlier authority as to how he may have answered a question: \\"This is what Rabbi X could have argued ...\\") Rarely are debates formally closed. Argumentation and debate \\"Theologisch debat\\" (Eduard Frankfort, c.1900), depicting chavrusas debating a sugya The distinctive character of the gemara derives largely from the intricate use of argumentation and debate, described above. In each sugya, either participant may cite scriptural, Mishnaic and Amoraic proof to build a logical support for their respective opinions. The process of deduction required to derive a conclusion from a prooftext is often logically complex and indirect. \\"Confronted with a statement on any subject, the Talmudic student will proceed to raise a series of questions before he satisfies himself of having understood its full meaning.\\" This analysis is often described as \\"mathematical\\" in approach; Adin Steinsaltz makes the analogy of the Amoraim as scientists investigating the Halakha, where the Tanakh, Mishnah, Tosefta and midrash are the phenomena studied. Prooftexts Prooftexts quoted to corroborate or disprove the respective opinions and theories will include: * verses from the Tanakh: the exact language employed is regarded as significant; * other mishnayot: cross-references to analogous cases, or to parallel reasoning by the Tanna in question; * Beraitot (◊ë◊®◊ô◊ô◊™◊ï◊™) ‚Äì uncodified mishnayot which are also sources of halakha (lit. outside material; sing. beraita ◊ë◊®◊ô◊ô◊™◊ê);  references to opinions and cases in the Tosefta (◊™◊ï◊°◊§◊™◊ê);  references to the Halakhic Midrash (Mekhilta, Sifra and Sifre); * cross- references to other sugyot: again to analogous cases or logic. Questions addressed The actual debate will usually centre on the following categories: =Language= Why does the Mishna use one word rather than another? If a statement is not clear enough, the Gemara seeks to clarify the Mishna's intention. =Logic= :See: List of Talmudic principles and :Talmud concepts and terminology Exploring the logical principles underlying the Mishnah's statements, and showing how different understandings of the Mishnah's reasons could lead to differences in their practical application. What underlying principle is entailed in a statement of fact or in a specific instance brought as an illustration? If a statement appears obvious, the Gemara seeks the logical reason for its necessity. It seeks to answer under which circumstances a statement is true, and what qualifications are permissible. All statements are examined for internal consistency. =Legal= Resolving contradictions, perceived or actual, between different statements in the Mishnah, or between the Mishnah and other traditions; e.g., by stating that: two conflicting sources are dealing with differing circumstances; or that they represent the views of different Rabbis. Do certain authorities differ or not? If they do, why do they differ? If a principle is presented as a generalization, the gemara clarifies how much is included; if an exception, how much is excluded. =Biblical exposition= Demonstrating how the Mishnah's rulings or disputes derive from interpretations of Biblical texts, the Gemara will often ask where in the Torah the Mishnah derives a particular law.

Congress has enacted approximately 200‚Äì600 statutes during each of its 115 biennial terms so that more than 30,000 statutes have been enacted since 1789. At the federal level in the United States, legislation (i.e., \\"statutes\\" or \\"statutory law\\") consists exclusively of Acts passed by the Congress of the United States and its predecessor, the Continental Congress, that were either signed into law by the President or passed by Congress after a presidential veto. Legislation is not the only source of regulations with the force of law. However, most executive branch and judicial branch regulations must originate in a congressional grant of power. See also: Executive orders of the President; regulations of Executive branch departments and administrative agencies; and the procedural rules of the federal courts. Publication of the law Statutes at Large (Stat.) Acts of Congress are published in the United States Statutes at Large. Volumes 1 through 18, which have all the statutes passed from 1789 to 1875, are available on-line at the Library of Congress, here. In the list below, statutes are listed by X Stat. Y, where X is the volume of the Statutes at Large and Y is the page number, as well as either the chapter or Public Law number. See examples below. Sessions (Sess.) and Chapters (ch.) Each Congress has two to four sessions. Under the numbering system used from 1789 until 1957, the Acts in each session are numbered sequentially as Chapters.

The Parliament of the United KingdomSection 2 of The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 (17 Geo. V c. 4) is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom and the British overseas territories with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each having their own devolved legislatures. Each of the three major jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) has its own laws and legal system. United Kingdom legislature The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The UK Parliament meets at the Palace of Westminster in London. 120px 120px The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Westminster Parliament or \\"Westminster\\") is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom and also for English Law. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London. The United Kingdom Legislation may take the form of Acts (passed directly by Parliament) or Statutory Instruments, made under the authority of an Act of Parliament by either a government minister or by the Queen-in-Council. The latter are generally subject either to parliamentary approval (affirmative procedure) or parliamentary disallowance (negative procedure). The majority of Acts considered in the UK are defined as public general acts, or 'Acts of Parliament' as they will have progressed and gained approval as a Bill through both House of Commons and House of Lords, and also have gained Royal Assent from the Monarch. Local and Personal Acts of Parliament are also presented to Parliament as a result of sponsored petitions. These, however, are processed through committees to enable relevant or affected parties to challenge or change the proposed Act. Prerogative instruments, made by the Sovereign under the royal prerogative are another source of UK-wide legislation.. The UK Parliament is responsible for all matters relating to defence and all foreign affairs and relations with international organisations, particularly the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the European Union. With there being no devolved legislature in England the UK Parliament is also the supreme body for its governance, legislation, public bodies and local government. =House of Commons= The House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is an elected chamber consisting currently of 650 members known as Members of Parliament (MPs) which are elected using First past the post in single-member constituencies with 533 elected from England, 59 from Scotland, 40 from Wales and 18 from Northern Ireland. The House of Commons is now considered to be the supreme chamber of Parliament. =House of Lords= The House of Lords is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom however it is an unelected chamber with all members to the House of Lords being appointed. As of August 2018, there are currently 793 members known as \\"Peers\\". The House of Lords no longer has the same powers as the House of Commons under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 especially when it comes to blocking general legislation and the passing of financial legislation. Devolved legislatures The Scottish Parliament Holyrood in Edinburgh. 120px The Scottish Parliament is the national, unicameral legislature of Scotland, located in the Holyrood area of the capital, Edinburgh. The Parliament, informally referred to as \\"Holyrood\\", is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Of these 73 MSPs are elected using First past the post in single member constituencies and a further 56 MSPs are elected using the D'Hondt method, a form of party-list proportional representation in eight additional member regions with each region electing 7 MSPs. The Scottish Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliamentthe areas in which it can make lawsby explicitly specifying powers that are \\"reserved\\" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom: all matters that are not explicitly reserved are automatically the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.Murkens, Jones & Keating (2002) pp11 The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999. The Scottish Statutory Instruments made by the Scottish Government are another source of legislation. As with Statutory Instruments made by the British government, these are generally subject to either approval or disallowance by the Scottish Parliament  Senedd Cymru  The Welsh Parliament meets in Cardiff 120px The Welsh Parliament or Senedd Cymru (Senedd) has the power to make legislation in Wales. The parliament was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. It is a democratically elected body with 60 members known as Members of the Senedd (MSs). Of these 40 MSs are elected using First past the post in single member constituencies and a further 20 MSs are elected using the D'Hondt method, a form of party-list proportional representation in five additional member regions with each region electing 4 MSs. The Welsh Parliament had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate in the 20 areas that are devolved without having to consult the UK Parliament, nor the Secretary of State for Wales. The Welsh Parliament may also delegate authority to enact legislation through Welsh Statutory Instruments. Under the Wales Act 2017 the Welsh Parliament came into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland and moved to a resevered powers model. The Northern Ireland Assembly Stormont in Belfast. 120px The Northern Ireland Assembly is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland which is a democratically elected body comprising 90After the March 2017 elections, previously 108. members known as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The 90 MLAs are elected using the single transferable vote across the 18 Westminster Parliamentary constituencies with each constituency electing 5 MLAs. It was established in 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement which was approved by the public in referendums which were held in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast. Legislation of the Assembly empowers the Northern Ireland Executive to issue Statutory Rules in a variety of areas. The Assembly was dissolved on 26 January 2017 owing to a breakdown of trust which brought down both the Assembly and Executive. In January 2020, Arlene Foster resumed her post as First Minister. European Union The United Kingdom is a former member state of the European Union (EU) with the European Communities Act 1972 (the Act which incorporated our former European Union membership into UK law) formally repealed at 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020 and is in a transition period. The United Kingdom became a member when it joined what was originally known as the European Communities on 1 January 1973. Currently the United Kingdom has concluded negotiating its exit from the organisation and its institutions following a referendum in 2016 which resulted in a narrow majority vote in favour of leaving and was expected to officially leave on 29 March 2019 but had sought an extension until 12 April ( If it couldn‚Äôt pass the Withdrawal Agreement) and was extended until 31 October before a third extension was granted by the EU in October 2019 to 31 January 2020. Following a decisive victory by the Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson who won an 80-seat majority over all other parties in the snap 2019 General Election the United Kingdom successfully left the bloc on Friday 31 January 2020 at 23:00 GMT although the effects of the European Communities Act 1972 meaning the decisions, directives and regulations of the EU are still directly applicable with full legal force in the United Kingdom and is also supreme to all domestic legislation, in effect another source of UK legislation until the end of the implementation period (a period which the UK will continue to follow most EU laws and regulations) which is currently expected to be 31 December 2020. The European Parliament The European Parliament (EP) is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union. Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).

The majority of Serbs live in their nation state of Serbia, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo. They also form significant minorities in North Macedonia and Slovenia. There is a large Serb diaspora in Western Europe, and outside Europe and there are significant communities in North America and Australia. The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of Southeast Europe. They are predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians by religion. The Serbian language is official in Serbia, co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro. Ethnology The identity of Serbs is rooted in Eastern Orthodoxy and traditions. In the 19th century, the Serbian national identity was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires. Three elements, together with the legacy of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian language, and the Kosovo Myth. When the Principality of Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining the national identity, instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs (Croats and Bosniaks). The tradition of slava, the family saint feast day, is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity, and is usually regarded their most significant and most solemn feast day. The origin of the ethnonym is unclear (See: Names of the Serbs and Serbia). Genetic origins According to a triple analysis ‚Äì autosomal, mitochondrial and paternal ‚Äî of available data from large-scale studies on Balto-Slavs and their proximal populations, the whole genome SNP data situates Serbs with Montenegrins in between two Balkan clusters. The first of them is formed by Bulgarians, Romanians, and Macedonians and the second: by Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks and Hungarians. Y-DNA results show that haplogroups I2a and R1a together stand for the majority of the makeup, with more than 53 percent. According to several recent studies Serbia's people are among the tallest in the world, after Montenegro and the Netherlands, with an average male height of . History Arrival of the Slavs Early Slavs, especially Sclaveni and Antae, including the White Serbs, invaded and settled the Southeastern Europe in the 6th and 7th centuries. Up until the late 560s their activity was raiding, crossing from the Danube, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine foederati colonies. The Danube and Sava frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century. What is today central Serbia was an important geo-strategical province, through which the Via Militaris crossed. This area was frequently intruded by barbarians in the 5th and 6th centuries. The numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population (Illyrians, Thracians, Dacians, Romans, Celts).; White Serbs from White Serbia coming to an area near Thessaloniki and then they settled area between Dinaric Alps and Adriatic coast.Sima M. ƒÜirkoviƒá, SRBI MEƒêU EUROPSKIM NARODIMA,(Serbs) 2008. http://www.mo-vrebac- pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/451/Sima%20%C4%86irkovi%C4%87%20SRBI%20ME%C4%90U%20EVROPSKIM%20NARODIMA.pdf #page=26-27 According to the Royal Frankish Annals, by 822, Serbs were controlling a great part of Dalmatia (\\"ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur\\"). Middle Ages Nemanjiƒá dynasty members, the most important dynasty of Serbia in the Middle Ages The history of the early medieval Serbian Principality is recorded in the 10th-century work De Administrando Imperio, which describes the Serbs as a people living in Roman Dalmatia, subordinate to the Byzantine Empire. Numerous small Serbian states were created, chiefly under Vlastimoroviƒá and Vojislavjeviƒá dynasties, located in modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia, but the population's Serbian ethnic identity remains unclear and a matter of dispute. With the decline of the Serbian state of Duklja in the late 11th century, \\"Ra≈°ka\\" separated from it and replaced it as the most powerful Serbian state. Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1169‚Äì96) conquered the neighbouring territories of Kosovo, Duklja and Zachlumia. The Nemanjiƒá dynasty ruled over Serbia until the 14th century. Nemanja's older son, Stefan Nemanjiƒá, became Serbia's first recognized king, while his younger son, Rastko, founded the Serbian Orthodox Church in the year 1219, and became known as Saint Sava after his death. Over the next 140 years, Serbia expanded its borders, from numerous smaller principalities, reaching to a unified Serbian Empire. Its cultural model remained Byzantine, despite political ambitions directed against the empire. The medieval power and influence of Serbia culminated in the reign of Stefan Du≈°an, who ruled the state from 1331 until his death in 1355. Ruling as Emperor from 1346, his territory included Macedonia, northern Greece, Montenegro, and almost all of modern Albania. When Du≈°an died, his son Stephen Uro≈° V became Emperor. With Turkish invaders beginning their conquest of the Balkans in the 1350s, a major conflict ensued between them and the Serbs, the first major battle was the Battle of Maritsa (1371), in which the Serbs were defeated. With the death of two important Serb leaders in the battle, and with the death of Stephen Uro≈° that same year, the Serbian Empire broke up into several small Serbian domains. These states were ruled by feudal lords, with Zeta controlled by the Bal≈°iƒá family, Ra≈°ka, Kosovo and northern Macedonia held by the Brankoviƒá family and Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá holding today's Central Serbia and a portion of Kosovo. Hrebeljanoviƒá was subsequently accepted as the titular leader of the Serbs because he was married to a member of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. In 1389, the Serbs faced the Ottomans at the Battle of Kosovo on the plain of Kosovo Polje, near the town of Pri≈°tina. Both Lazar and Sultan Murad I were killed in the fighting. The battle most likely ended in a stalemate, and afterwards Serbia enjoyed a short period of prosperity under despot Stefan Lazareviƒá and resisted falling to the Turks until 1459. Early modern period The Serbs had taken an active part in the wars fought in the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire, and also organized uprisings; because of this, they suffered persecution and their territories were devastated ‚Äì major migrations from Serbia into Habsburg territory ensued. After allied Christian forces had captured Buda from the Ottoman Empire in 1686 during the Great Turkish War, Serbs from Pannonian Plain (present-day Hungary, Slavonia region in present-day Croatia, Baƒçka and Banat regions in present-day Serbia) joined the troops of the Habsburg Monarchy as separate units known as Serbian Militia. Serbs, as volunteers, massively joined the Austrian side. Many Serbs were recruited during the devshirme system, a form of slavery in the Ottoman Empire, in which boys from Balkan Christian families were forcibly converted to Islam and trained for infantry units of the Ottoman army known as the Janissaries. A number of Serbs who converted to Islam occupied high-ranking positions within the Ottoman Empire, such as Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha and Minister of War field marshal Omar Pasha Latas. Migration of the Serbs (1896), a painting by Paja Jovanoviƒá, depicting the Great Serb Migrations led by Patriarch Arsenije III Carnojevic, 17th century. In 1688, the Habsburg army took Belgrade and entered the territory of present-day Central Serbia. Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden called Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá to raise arms against the Turks; the Patriarch accepted and returned to the liberated Peƒá. As Serbia fell under Habsburg control, Leopold I granted Arsenije nobility and the title of duke. In early November, Arsenije III met with Habsburg commander-in-chief, General Enea Silvio Piccolomini in Prizren; after this talk he sent a note to all Serb bishops to come to him and collaborate only with Habsburg forces. A Great Migration of the Serbs (1690) to Habsburg lands was undertaken by Patriarch Arsenije III. The large community of Serbs concentrated in Banat, southern Hungary and the Military Frontier included merchants and craftsmen in the cities, but mainly refugees that were peasants. The Serbian Revolution for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815. The revolution comprised two separate uprisings which gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire that eventually evolved towards full independence (1835‚Äì1867). During the First Serbian Uprising, led by Duke Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá, Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country. Shortly after this, the Second Serbian Uprising began. Led by Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, it ended in 1815 with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities. Likewise, Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish feudalism. Modern period In the early 1830s Serbia gained autonomy and its borders were recognized, with Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá being recognized as its ruler. Serbia is the fourth modern-day European country, after France, Austria and the Netherlands, to have a codified legal system, as of 1844. The last Ottoman troops withdrew from Serbia in 1867, although Serbia's and Montenegro's independence was not recognized internationally until the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated Franz Ferdinand, which triggered the start of World War I. Serbia fought in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13, which forced the Ottomans out of the Balkans and doubled the territory and population of the Kingdom of Serbia. In 1914, a young Bosnian Serb student named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which directly contributed to the outbreak of World War I. In the fighting that ensued, Serbia was invaded by Austria-Hungary. Despite being outnumbered, the Serbs defeated the Austro-Hungarians at the Battle of Cer, which marked the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the war. Further victories at the battles of Kolubara and the Drina meant that Serbia remained unconquered as the war entered its second year. However, an invasion by the forces of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria overwhelmed the Serbs in the winter of 1915, and a subsequent withdrawal by the Serbian Army through Albania took the lives of more than 240,000 Serbs. Serb forces spent the remaining years of the war fighting on the Salonika Front in Greece, before liberating Serbia from Austro-Hungarian occupation in November 1918. Serbia suffered the biggest casualty rate in World War I. Stone Flower, a monument dedicated to the victims of Jasenovac death camp, which was part of the Genocide of Serbs committed by Usta≈°e Following the victory in WWI Serbs subsequently formed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with other South Slavic peoples. The country was later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and was led from 1921 to 1934 by King Alexander I of the Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. During World War II, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers in April 1941. The country was subsequently divided into many pieces, with Serbia being directly occupied by the Germans. Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) were targeted for extermination as part of genocide by the Croatian ultra-nationalist, fascist Usta≈°e. The Usta≈°e view of national and racial identity, as well as the theory of Serbs as an inferior race, was under the influence of Croatian nationalists and intellectuals from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Jasenovac camp was notorious for the barbaric practices which occurred in it. Sisak and Jastrebarsko concentration camp were specially formed for children.Marija Vuselica: Regionen Kroatien in Der Ort des Terrors: Arbeitserziehungslager, Ghettos, Jugendschutzlager, Polizeihaftlager, Sonderlager, Zigeunerlager, Zwangsarbeiterlager, Volume 9 of Der Ort des Terrors, Publisher C.H.Beck, 2009, pages 321‚Äì323Anna Maria Gr√ºnfelder: Arbeitseinsatz f√ºr die Neuordnung Europas: Zivil- und ZwangsarbeiterInnen aus Jugoslawien in der \\"Ostmark\\" 1938/41-1945, Publisher B√∂hlau Verlag Wien, 2010 pages 101‚Äì106 Serbs in the NDH suffered among the highest casualty rates in Europe during the World War II, while the NDH was one of the most lethal regimes in the 20th century. Diana Budisavljeviƒá, a humanitarian of Austrian descent, carried out rescue operations from Usta≈°e camps and saved more than 15,000 children, mostly Serbs. More than half a million Serbs were killed in the territory of Yugoslavia during World War II. Serbs in occupied Yugoslavia subsequently formed a resistance movement known as the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, or the Chetniks. The Chetniks had the official support of the Allies until 1943, when Allied support shifted to the Communist Yugoslav Partisans, a multi- ethnic force, formed in 1941, which also had a large majority of Serbs in its ranks in the first two years of war. Over the entirety of the war, the ethnic composition of the Partisans was 53 percent Serb. Later, after the fall of Italy in September 1943, other ethnic groups joined Partisans in larger numbers. At the end of the war, the Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, emerged victorious. Yugoslavia subsequently became a Communist state. Tito died in 1980, and his death saw Yugoslavia plunge into economic turmoil. Yugoslavia disintegrated in the early 1990s, and a series of wars resulted in the creation of five new states. The heaviest fighting occurred in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose Serb populations rebelled and declared independence. The war in Croatia ended in August 1995, with a Croatian military offensive known as Operation Storm crushing the Croatian Serb rebellion and causing as many as 200,000 Serbs to flee the country. The Bosnian War ended that same year, with the Dayton Agreement dividing the country along ethnic lines. In 1998‚Äì99, a conflict in Kosovo between the Yugoslav Army and Albanians seeking independence erupted into full-out war, resulting in a 78-day-long NATO bombing campaign which effectively drove Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo. Subsequently, more than 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians fled the province. On 5 October 2000, Yugoslav President Slobodan Miloseviƒá was overthrown in a bloodless revolt after he refused to admit defeat in the 2000 Yugoslav general election. Demographics There are nearly 8 million Serbs living in the Western Balkans. In Serbia (the nation state), around 6 million people identify themselves as Serbs, and constitute about 83% of the population. More than a million live in Bosnia and Herzegovina (predominantly in Republika Srpska), where they are one of the three constituent ethnic groups. The ethnic communities in Croatia and Montenegro number some 186,000 and 178,000 people, respectively, while another estimated 146,000 still inhabit the disputed area of Kosovo. Smaller minorities exist in Slovenia and North Macedonia, some 36,000 and 39,000 people, respectively. Outside of the Western Balkans, Serbs are an officially recognized minority in Romania (18,000), Hungary (7,000), Albania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There is a large diaspora in Western Europe, particularly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and Sweden. Outside Europe, there are significant Serb communities in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Southern Africa. Diaspora thumbupright=1.25Geographical distribution of the diaspora. There are over 2 million Serbs in diaspora throughout the world, although some sources put that figure as high as 4 million. The existence of a large diaspora is mainly a consequence of either economic or political (coercion or expulsions) reasons. There were several waves of Serb emigration: * The first wave took place since the end of the 19th century and lasted until World War II and was caused by economic reasons; particularly large numbers of Serbs (mainly from peripheral ethnic areas such as Herzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia, and Lika) emigrated to the United States. * The second wave took place after the end of World War II. At this time, members of royalist Chetniks and other political opponents of communist regime fled the country mainly going overseas (United States and Australia) and, to a lesser degree, United Kingdom. * The third wave, and by far the largest wave, was economic emigration started in the 1960s when several Western European countries signed bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia allowing the recruitment of industrial workers to those countries, and lasted until the end of the 1980s. Main destinations were West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and to a lesser extent France and Sweden. That generation of diaspora is collectively known as gastarbajteri, after German gastarbeiter (\\"guest-worker\\"), since most of the emigrants headed for German-speaking countries. * Recent emigration took place during the 1990s, and was caused by both political and economic reasons. The Yugoslav wars caused many Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to leave their countries in the first half of the 1990s. The economic sanctions imposed on Serbia caused an economic collapse with an estimated 300,000 people leaving Serbia during that period, 20% of which had a higher education. Language Linguistic map of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Croatia; Serbian language in yellow Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, reformer of modern Serbian language Serbs speak Serbian, a member of the South Slavic group of languages, specifically the Southwestern group. Standard Serbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, and therefore mutually intelligible with Standard Croatian and Standard Bosnian (see Differences in standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), which are all based on the Shtokavian dialect. Serbian is an official language in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and is a recognized minority language in Montenegro (although spoken by a plurality of population), Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Older forms of literary Serbian are Church Slavonic of the Serbian recension, which is still used for ecclesiastical purposes, and Slavonic-Serbian‚Äîa mixture of Serbian, Church Slavonic and Russian used from the mid-18th century to the first decades of the 19th century. Serbian has active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Serbian Cyrillic was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles. Serbian Latin was created by Ljudevit Gaj and published in 1830. His alphabet mapped completely on Serbian Cyrillic which had been standardized by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá a few years before. Loanwords in the Serbian language besides common internationalisms are mostly from Greek,–à–∞—Å–Ω–∞ –í–ª–∞—ò–∏—õ-–ü–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—õ, ‚Äû–ì—Ä–µ—Ü–∏–∑–º–∏ —É —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ–º —ò–µ–∑–∏–∫—É: –æ—Å–≤—Ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –¥–æ—Å–∞–¥–∞—à—ö–∞ –∏ –ø–æ–≥–ª–µ–¥ –Ω–∞ –±—É–¥—É—õ–∞ –∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∏–≤–∞—ö–∞‚Äú, –à—É–∂–Ω–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —Ñ–∏–ª–æ–ª–æ–≥, –∫—ö. 65 (2009), –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, —Å—Ç—Ä. 375‚Äì403 German–õ–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–Ω —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ö —Ä–µ—á–∏ –∏ –∏–∑—Ä–∞–∑–∞ / –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω –í—É—ò–∞–∫–ª–∏—ò–∞, –ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ (1954) and Italian, while words of Hungarian origin are present mostly in the north. There are some Turkish loanwords used (but mostly in rural areas) and they are mostly related to food. A considerable number of those words are actually Persian in origin but entered Serbian through Ottomans and are therefore considered Turkisms.–ê–±–¥—É–ª–∞—Ö –®–∫–∞—ô–∏—õ ‚Äì –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏–∑–º–∏ —É —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ—Ö—Ä–≤–∞—Ç—Å–∫–æ–º —ò–µ–∑–∏–∫—É There is considerable usage of French words as well, especially in military related terms. One Serbian word that is used in many of the world's languages is \\"vampire\\" (vampir). Culture Literature, icon painting, music, dance and medieval architecture are the artistic forms for which Serbia is best known. Traditional Serbian visual art (specifically frescoes, and to some extent icons), as well as ecclesiastical architecture, are highly reflective of Byzantine traditions, with some Mediterranean and Western influence.–î–∏–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–µ –û–±–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ ‚Äû–í–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—ò—Å–∫–∏ –∫–æ–º–æ–Ω–≤–µ–ª—Ç‚Äú, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥. 1991 Many Serbian monuments and works of art have been lost forever due to various wars and peacetime marginalizations. In modern times (since the 19th century) Serbs also have a noteworthy classical music and works of philosophy. Notable philosophers include Branislav Petronijeviƒá, Radomir Konstantinoviƒá, Ksenija Atanasijeviƒá, Nikola Milo≈°eviƒá, Mihailo Markoviƒá, Svetozar Markoviƒá, Mihailo ƒêuriƒá.  Art, music, theatre and cinema  Kosovo Maiden (1919) by Uro≈° Prediƒá. Emir Kusturica, film director who won the Palme d'Or twice During the 12th and 13th centuries, many icons, wall paintings and manuscript miniatures came into existence, as many Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches such as Hilandar, ≈Ωiƒça, Studenica, Sopoƒáani, Mile≈°eva, Graƒçanica and Visoki Deƒçani were built. The architecture of some of these monasteries is world-famous. Prominent architectural styles in the Middle Ages were Ra≈°ka architectural school, Morava architectural school and Serbo-Byzantin architectural style. During the same period UNESCO protected Steƒáak monumental medieval tombstones were built. The Independence of Serbia in the 19th century was soon followed with Serbo-Byzantine Revival in architecture. Baroque and rococo trends in Serbian art emerged in the 18th century and are mostly represented in icon painting and portraits. Most of the Baroque authors were from the territory of Austrian Empire, such as Nikola Ne≈°koviƒá, Teodor Kraƒçun, Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar, Zaharije Orfelin and Jakov Orfelin. Serbian painting showed the influence of Biedermeier and Neoclassicism as seen in works by Konstantin Danil and Pavel ƒêurkoviƒá. Many painters followed the artistic trends set in the 19th century Romanticism, notably ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, Stevan Todoroviƒá, Katarina Ivanoviƒá and Novak Radoniƒá. Since the mid-1800s, Serbia has produced a number of famous painters who are representative of general European artistic trends. One of the most prominent of these was Paja Jovanoviƒá, who painted massive canvases on historical themes such as the Migration of the Serbs (1896). Painter Uro≈° Prediƒá was also prominent in the field of Serbian art, painting the Kosovo Maiden and Happy Brothers. While Jovanoviƒá and Prediƒá were both realist painters, artist Nade≈æda Petroviƒá was an impressionist and fauvist and Sava ≈†umanoviƒá was an accomplished Cubist. Painters Petar Lubarda, Vladimir Veliƒçkoviƒá and Ljubomir Popoviƒá were famous for their surrealism. Marina Abramoviƒá is a world-renowned performance artist, writer, and art filmmaker. Traditional Serbian music includes various kinds of bagpipes, flutes, horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals. The kolo is the traditional collective folk dance, which has a number of varieties throughout the regions. Composer and musicologist Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac is considered one of the most important founders of modern Serbian music. Other noted classical composers include Kornelije Stankoviƒá, Stanislav Biniƒçki, Petar Konjoviƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá, Stevan Hristiƒá, Josif Marinkoviƒá, Luigi von Kunits and Vasilije Mokranjac. Well-known musicians include Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, Arsen Dediƒá, Predrag Gojkoviƒá-Cune, Toma Zdravkoviƒá, Milan Mladenoviƒá, Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Momƒçilo Bajagiƒá Bajaga, ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá, Ceca and others. Serbia has produced many talented filmmakers, the most famous of whom are Slavko Vorkapiƒá, Du≈°an Makavejev, ≈Ωivojin Pavloviƒá, Goran Paskaljeviƒá, Emir Kusturica, ≈Ωelimir ≈Ωilnik, Srdan Goluboviƒá and Mila Turajliƒá. ≈Ωilnik and Stefan Arsenijeviƒá won the Golden Bear award at Berlinale, while Mila Turajliƒá won the main award at IDFA. Kusturica became world-renowned after winning the Palme d'Or twice at the Cannes Film Festival, numerous other prizes, and is a UNICEF National Ambassador for Serbia. Several Americans of Serb origin have been featured prominently in Hollywood. The most notable of these are Academy-award winners Karl Malden, Steve Tesich, Peter Bogdanovich, Tony-winning theatre director Darko Tresnjak, Emmy-winning director Marina Zenovich and actors Iv√°n Petrovich, Brad Dexter, Lolita Davidovich, Milla Jovovich and Stana Katic.

File:Vojin Bakiƒá.jpgVojin Bakiƒá, a prominent sculptor Literature Most literature written by early Serbs was about religious themes. Various gospels, psalters, menologies, hagiographies, and essays and sermons of the founders of the Serbian Orthodox Church were written. At the end of the 12th century, two of the most important pieces of Serbian medieval literature were created‚Äì the Miroslav Gospels and the Vukan Gospels, which combined handwritten Biblical texts with painted initials and small pictures. Notable Baroque-influenced authors were Andrija Zmajeviƒá, Gavril Stefanoviƒá Vencloviƒá, Jovan Rajiƒá, Zaharije Orfelin and others. Dositej Obradoviƒá was the most prominent figure of the Age of Enlightenment, while the most notable Classicist writer was Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, although his works also contained elements of Romanticism. Modern Serbian literature began with Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's collections of folk songs in the 19th century, and the writings of Njego≈° and Branko Radiƒçeviƒá. The first prominent representative of Serbian literature in the 20th century was Jovan Skerliƒá, who wrote in pre‚ÄìWorld War I Belgrade and helped introduce Serbian writers to literary modernism. The most important Serbian writer in the inter-war period was Milo≈° Crnjanski. The first Serb authors who appeared after World War II were Mihailo Laliƒá and Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá. Other notable post-war Yugoslav authors such as Ivo Andriƒá and Me≈°a Selimoviƒá were assimilated to Serbian culture, and both identified as Serbs. Andriƒá went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. Danilo Ki≈°, another popular Serbian writer, was known for writing A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, as well as several acclaimed novels. Amongst contemporary Serbian writers, Milorad Paviƒá stands out as being the most critically acclaimed, with his novels Dictionary of the Khazars, Landscape Painted with Tea and The Inner Side of the Wind bringing him international recognition. Highly revered in Europe and in South America, Paviƒá is considered one of the most intriguing writers from the beginning of the 21st century.

Education and science Many Serbs have contributed to the field of science and technology. Serbian American scientist, inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla is regarded as one of the most important inventors in history. He is renowned for his contributions to the discipline of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Seven Serbian American engineers and scientists known as Serbo 7 took part in construction of the Apollo spaceship. Physicist and physical chemist Mihajlo Pupin is best known for his landmark theory of modern electrical filters as well as for his numerous patents, while Milutin Milankoviƒá is best known for his theory of long-term climate change caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun, now known as Milankovitch cycles. Mihailo Petroviƒá is known for having contributed significantly to differential equations and phenomenology, as well as inventing one of the first prototypes of an analog computer. Roger Joseph Boscovich was a Ragusan physicist, astronomer, mathematician and polymath of paternal Serbian origin (although there are competing claims for Bo≈°koviƒá's nationality) who produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy and also discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. Jovan Cvijiƒá founded modern geography in Serbia and made pioneering research on the geography of the Balkan Peninsula, Dinaric race and karst. Josif Panƒçiƒá made contributions to botany and discovered a number of new floral species including the Serbian spruce.

Serbian given names largely originate from Slavic roots: e.g., Vuk, Bojan, Goran, Zoran, Dragan, Milan, Miroslav, Vladimir, Slobodan, Du≈°an, Milica, Nevena, Vesna, Radmila. Other names are of Christian origin, originating from the bible (Hebrew, through Greek), such as Lazar, Mihailo, Ivan, Jovan, Ilija, Marija, Ana, Ivana. Along similar lines of non-Slavic Christian names are Greek ones such as: Stefan, Nikola, Aleksandar, Filip, ƒêorƒëe, Andrej, Jelena, Katarina, Vasilije, Todor, while those of Latin origin include: Marko, Antonije, Srƒëan, Marina, Petar, Pavle, Natalija, Igor (through Russian). Most Serbian surnames are paternal, maternal, occupational or derived from personal traits. It is estimated that over two thirds of all Serbian surnames have the suffix -iƒá (-–∏—õ) (), a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname Petroviƒá means the \\"son of Petar\\" (from a male progenitor, the root is extended with possessive -ov or -ev). Due to limited use of international typewriters and unicode computer encoding, the suffix may be simplified to -ic, historically transcribed with a phonetic ending, -ich or -itch in foreign languages. Other common surname suffixes found among Serbian surnames are - _ov_ , - _ev_ , - _in_ and - _ski_ (without -iƒá) which is the Slavic possessive case suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. Other, less common suffices are -alj/olj/elj, -ija, -ica, -ar/ac/an. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are Jovanoviƒá, Petroviƒá, Nikoliƒá, Markoviƒá, ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Stojanoviƒá, Iliƒá, Stankoviƒá, Pavloviƒá and Milo≈°eviƒá. Religion Serbs are predominantly Orthodox Christians. The autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church, was established in 1219, as an Archbishopric, and raised to the Patriarchate in 1346. It is led by the Serbian Patriarch, and consists of three archbishoprics, six metropolitanates and thirty-one eparchies, having around 10 million adherents. Followers of the church form the largest religious group in Serbia and Montenegro, and the second-largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The church has an archbishopric in North Macedonia and dioceses in Western Europe, North America, South America and Australia. The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically largely based on Orthodox Christianity and on the Serbian Church in particular. The conversion of the South Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the Great Schism. After the Schism, those who lived under the Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. With the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, some Serbs converted to Islam. This was particularly, but not wholly, the case in Bosnia. Since the second half of the 19th century, a small number of Serbs converted to Protestantism, while historically some Serbs were Catholics (especially in Bay of Kotor and Dalmatia; e.g. Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik). In a personal correspondence with author and critic dr. Milan ≈†eviƒá in 1932, Marko Murat complained that Orthodox Serbs are not acknowledging the Catholic Serb community on the basis of their faith. The remainder of Serbs remain predominantly Serbian Orthodox Christians. Symbols Among the most notable national and ethnic symbols are the flag of Serbia and the coat of arms of Serbia. The flag consists of a red-blue-white tricolour, rooted in Pan-Slavism, and has been used since the 19th century. Apart from being the national flag, it is also used officially in Republika Srpska (by Bosnian Serbs) and as the official ethnic Flag of Serbs of Croatia. The coat of arms, which includes both the Serbian eagle and Serbian cross, has also been officially used since the 19th century, its elements dating back to the Middle Ages, showing Byzantine and Christian heritage. These symbols are used by various Serb organisations, political parties and institutions. The Three- finger salute, also called the \\"Serb salute\\", is a popular expression for ethnic Serbs and Serbia, originally expressing Serbian Orthodoxy and today simply being a symbol for ethnic Serbs and the Serbian nation, made by extending the thumb, index, and middle fingers of one or both hands. File:Civil Flag of Serbia.svgSerbian national colours, in use since 1835 File:Serbian_Cross.svgSerbian cross File:Tri prsta3.jpgThree-finger salute Traditions and customs ;Folklore Traditional clothing varies due to diverse geography and climate of the territory inhabited by the Serbs. The traditional footwear, opanci, is worn throughout the Balkans. The most common folk costume of Serbia is that of ≈†umadija, a region in central Serbia, which includes the national hat, the ≈†ajkaƒça. Older villagers still wear their traditional costumes. The traditional dance is the circle dance, called kolo. Zmijanje embroidery is a specific technique of embroidery practised by the women of villages in area Zmijanje on mountain Manjaƒça and as such is a part of the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Pirot carpet is a variety of flat tapestry woven rug traditionally produced in Pirot, a town in southeastern Serbia. ;Traditions Slava is the family's annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint, a social event in which the family is together at the house of the patriarch. The tradition is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity. Serbs usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn feast day. Serbs have their own customs regarding Christmas, which includes the sacral tree, the badnjak, a young oak. On Orthodox Easter, Serbs have the tradition of Slavic Egg decorating. ƒåuvari Hristovog groba is a religious/cultural practice of guarding a representation of Christ's grave on Good Friday in the Church of St. Nicholas by the Serbian Orthodox inhabitants in the town of Vrlika.

Despite this, it has evolved and achieved its own culinary identity. Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, Turkish coffee is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and salt to guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to clotted cream), proja (cornbread), kaƒçamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie). ƒÜevapƒçiƒái, caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the national dish of Serbia. ≈†ljivovica (Slivovitz) is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is the national fruit. The international name Slivovitz is derived from Serbian. Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and part of numerous customs. A Serbian meal usually starts or ends with plum products and ≈†ljivovica is served as an aperitif. A saying goes that the best place to build a house is where a plum tree grows best. Traditionally, ≈†ljivovica (commonly referred to as \\"rakija\\") is connected to Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.), and in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration (slava). It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of ≈†umadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and ≈†ljivovica. Serbia is the largest exporter of Slivovitz in the world, and second largest plum producer in the world. Sport Serbs are known for their sporting achievements, and have produced a number of talented athletes. The Hungarian citizen Momƒçilo Tapavica was the first Slav and Serb to win an Olympic medal, in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Over the years Serbia has been home to many internationally successful football players such as Dragan D≈æajiƒá (officially recognized as \\"the best Serbian footballer of all times\\" by Football Association of Serbia; 1968 Ballon d'Or third place) and more recent likes of Dejan Stankoviƒá (Serbia's most capped player), Nemanja Vidiƒá (Premier League Player of the Season and member of FIFPro World XI, Branislav Ivanoviƒá and Nemanja Matiƒá. Radomir Antiƒá is a notable football coach, best known for his work with the national team, Real Madrid C.F. and FC Barcelona. Serbia has developed a reputation as one of the world's biggest exporters of expat footballers. Novak Djokovic is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A total of 22 Serbian players have played in the NBA in the last two decades, including three-time NBA All-Star Predrag \\"Peja\\" Stojakoviƒá and NBA All-Star and FIBA Hall of Fame inductee Vlade Divac. Serbian players that made a great impact in Europe include four members of the FIBA Hall of Fame from the 1960s and 1970s ‚Äì Dragan Kiƒáanoviƒá, Dra≈æen Dalipagiƒá, Radivoj Koraƒá, and Zoran Slavniƒá ‚Äì as well as recent stars such as Dejan Bodiroga (2002 All-Europe Player of the Year), Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá (1994 and 1995 Mr. Europa) and currently active Milo≈° Teodosiƒá (2009‚Äì2010 Euroleague MVP) and NBA All-Star Nikola Jokiƒá. \\"Serbian coaching school\\" produced many of the most successful European coaches of all times, such as ≈Ωeljko Obradoviƒá (a record nine Euroleague titles), Bo≈æidar Maljkoviƒá (four Euroleague titles), Aleksandar Nikoliƒá (three Euroleague titles), Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá (two Euroleague titles), and Svetislav Pe≈°iƒá (one Euroleague title). Novak Djokovic, seventeen-time Grand Slam champion and 2011, 2014 and 2015 Laureus Sportsman of the Year, finished 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015 as the No. 1 ranked player in the world. Ana Ivanovic (champion of 2008 French Open) and Jelena Jankoviƒá were both ranked No. 1 in the WTA Rankings, while Nenad Zimonjiƒá and Slobodan ≈Ωivojinoviƒá were ranked No. 1 in doubles. Notable water polo players are Vladimir Vujasinoviƒá, Aleksandar ≈†apiƒá, Vanja Udoviƒçiƒá, Andrija Prlainoviƒá and Filip Filipoviƒá. Other noted Serbian athletes, including Olympic and world champions and medalists, are: swimmer Milorad ƒåaviƒá, volleyball player Nikola Grbiƒá, handball player Svetlana Kitiƒá, long-jumper Ivana ≈†panoviƒá, shooter Jasna ≈†ekariƒá, sprint canoer Marko Tomiƒáeviƒá, judoka Nemanja Majdov and taekwondoist Milica Mandiƒá. A number of sportspeople of Serb origin represented other nations, such as tennis players Daniel Nestor, Jelena Dokic, Milos Raonic and Kristina Mladenovic, NHL player Milan Lucic, NBA All-star Pete Maravich, wrestler Jim Trifunov, racquetball player Rhonda Rajsich and racing driver Bill Vukovich.

The Act also incorporated of Community Law and its , its Treaties, Regulations and Directives, together with judgments of the European Court of Justice, the Community Customs Union, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (FCP), into the domestic law of the United Kingdom. The Treaty of Accession was signed by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath and the President of the European Commission Franco Maria Malfatti in Brussels on 22 January 1972; the UK's accession into the Communities was subsequently ratified via the Act to have full legal force from 1 January 1973. By the Act, Community Law (subsequently European Union Law) became binding on all legislation passed by the UK Parliament (and also upon the UK's devolved administrations‚Äîthe Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Parliament (Senedd Cymru) although none of these institutions existed at the time of the passing of the Act). Arguably it was the most significant statute to be passed by the Heath government of 1970‚Äì1974, the Act was also one of the most significant UK constitutional statutes to ever be passed by the UK Parliament. The Act was at the time of its repeal significantly amended from its original form, incorporating the changes wrought by the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty, the Nice Treaty, and the Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 July 2017, the then Brexit Secretary, David Davis, introduced what became the European Union (Withdrawal) Act to Parliament which makes provision for repealing the 1972 Act on \\"exit day\\", when enacted defined as 29 March 2019 at 11 p.m.(London time, GMT), but later postponed by EU decision first to either 22 May 2019 or 12 April 2019, later to 31 October 2019, and then again to 31 January 2020. The Act was repealed on 31 January 2020 by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, although its effect was 'saved' under the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. This provision is in effect from 31 January 2020 (when the United Kingdom formally left the European Union) until the end of the Brexit implementation period, on 31 December 2020. Origin and background When the European Communities (EC) came into being in 1958, the UK chose to remain aloof and instead join the alternative bloc, EFTA. Almost immediately the British government regretted its decision, and in 1961, along with Denmark, Ireland and Norway, the UK applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a Trojan horse for US influence, and vetoed it; all four applications were suspended. The four countries resubmitted their applications in 1967, and the French veto was lifted upon Georges Pompidou succeeding de Gaulle in 1969. In 1970, accession negotiations took place between the UK Government, led by Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, the European Communities and various European leaders. Despite disagreements over the CAP and the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth, terms were agreed. In October 1971, after a lengthy Commons debate on a white paper motion on the principle of accession, MPs voted 356-244 in favour of joining the EC. For the Treaty to take effect upon entry into the Communities on 1 January 1973, and for the UK to embrace the EEC Institutions and Community law, an Act of Parliament was required. Only three days after the signing of the Treaty, a European Communities Bill of just 12 clauses, was presented to the House of Commons by Geoffrey Rippon. The European Communities Act came into being, and Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in Brussels on 22 January 1972. Denmark and Ireland also joined the Community on the same day, 1 January 1973, as the UK; the Norwegian people had rejected membership in a referendum in 1972. First Reading (House of Commons) The European Communities Bill was introduced the House of Commons for its first reading by Geoffrey Rippon, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 26 January 1972. Second Reading (House of Commons) On 17 February 1972, the House of Commons voted narrowly by 309-301 in favour of the Bill at its second reading, after three days of intense debate. Just before the vote the Prime Minister Edward Heath argued his case in the debate with the following words. The Bill then passed on to Committee Stage before its third reading. Third Reading (House of Commons) During this discussion in the House of Commons, MPs pointed out that the Government had structured the European Communities Bill so that Parliament could debate the technical issues about how the treaty enactment would occur (how the UK would join the European Communities) but could not debate the treaty of accession itself and decried this sacrifice of Parliament's sovereignty to the Government's desire to join the European project. On 13 July 1972, the House of Commons voted 301-284 in favour of the Bill in its third and final reading before passing on to the House of Lords. Before the vote took place, Geoffrey Rippon (who had drafted the Bill) argued in the House of Commons immediately before the vote: The Bill then passed to the House of Lords. Royal assent, Ratification, and Taking Effect The Act received Royal Assent on 17 October, and the UK's instrument of ratification of the Treaty of Accession was deposited the next day with the Italian government (the traditional European Communities treaty records holder) as required by the Treaty. Since the Treaty specified its effective date as 1 January 1973 (in Article 2) and the Act specified only \\"entry date\\" for its actions, the Act and the Treaty took effect 1 January 1973, when the United Kingdom officially became a member state of the European Communities (subsequently the European Union) along with Denmark and the Republic of Ireland. The Act Heath Government of 1970-74 Geoffrey Rippon was responsible for drafting the 1972 legislation that took the UK into the then European Communities (which would later become the European Union) The European Communities Act was the instrument whereby the UK Parliament effected the changes required by the Treaty of Accession by which the UK joined the European Union (then known as the European Communities). The Act in its original form had just twelve clauses. Section 2(1) says \\"the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect\\" in the UK. It enables, under section 2(2), UK government ministers to make regulations to transpose EU Directives (then Community law) and rulings of the European Court of Justice into UK law. The Treaty itself says the member states will conform themselves to the European Communities existing and future decisions. The Act and the Treaty of Accession have been interpreted by UK courts as granting EU law primacy over domestic UK legislation. European Economic Community (EEC) The Act legislated for the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community (EEC), which was at the time the main international organisation of the three Communities (more commonly known at the time as the Common Market) and incorporated its rules and regulations into the domestic law of the United Kingdom. European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) The Act legislated for the United Kingdom's accession to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and incorporated its rules and regulations into the domestic law of the United Kingdom. European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom)  The Act legislated for the United Kingdom's accession to the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) and incorporated its rules and regulations into the domestic law of the United Kingdom. European Treaties The Act incorporated the following treaties into the domestic law of the United Kingdom. *Treaty of Paris (1951) *Treaty of Rome *Euratom Treaty *Merger Treaty *Budgetary Treaty of 1970 *Treaty of Accession 1972 The following treaties were added to the act though subsequent amendments. *Single European Act (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986) *EEA Agreement (through the European Economic Area Act 1993) *Maastricht Treaty (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993) *Amsterdam Treaty (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1998) *Treaty of Nice (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 2002) *Treaty of Lisbon (through the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008) Common Agricultural Policy The Act legislated for the full participation of the United Kingdom in the Common Agricultural Policy and fully incorporated the policy into UK domestic law. It established the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce. It repealed previous pieces of UK domestic legislation to allow for this. Common Fisheries Policy The Act legislated for the full participation of the United Kingdom in the Common Fisheries Policy and fully incorporates the policy into UK domestic law. Customs Union The Act legislated for the incorporation and full participation of the United Kingdom within the European Union Customs Union (then European Communities Customs Union) into domestic law, as well as the application of the European common external tariff to all goods which come into the UK from outside the European Communities. The Act repealed large sections of previous UK domestic legislation to allow for this.  Effect  The primacy and direct effect of EU law has no formal basis in the founding treaties of the union, but was developed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), long before UK accession, on the grounds that the purpose of the treaties would be thwarted if EU law were subordinate to national law. The view of the ECJ is that any norm of EU law takes precedence over national law, including national constitutions. Most national courts, including the United Kingdom's, do not accept this monist perspective. The British constitution is based on Parliamentary sovereignty and has a dualist view of international law: international treaties do not become part of UK domestic law unless they are incorporated into UK law by an Act of Parliament. The primacy of EU law in the United Kingdom derives from the European Communities Act. This means that if the Act were repealed, any EU law (unless it has been transposed into British legislation) would, in practice, become unenforceable in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, and the powers delegated by the Act to the EU institutions would return to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. This was made clear to be the law in the United Kingdom by the inclusion of the \\"sovereignty clause\\" in the EU Act 2011 passed by the British Parliament. Factortame In the House of Lords Factortame case, Lord Bridge confirmed that section 2(4) of the ECA effectively automatically inserts a virtual (implied) clause into all UK statutes, that they are to be automatically disapplied wherever they come into conflict with European law. This is seen by some as a departure from the English constitutional doctrine of Westminster parliamentary sovereignty as it was and had been traditionally understood. Repeal The United Kingdom voted for withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum held on 23 June 2016, and afterwards there was speculation that the act would be either repealed or amended. In October 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May promised a \\"Great Repeal Bill\\" which would repeal the 1972 Act and import its regulations into UK law, with effect from the date of British withdrawal; the regulations could then be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis. The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 13 July 2017. It was passed by Parliament on 20 June 2018, and received royal assent on 26 June 2018. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 provides for the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972 at the time the United Kingdom exits the EU, on 29 March 2019 at 11:00 pm. However, in a July 2018 white paper, the government announced its intention to amend the Withdrawal Act to provide for the continued effect of the ECA until the end of the \\"transition period\\" (31 December 2020, as of July 2018), therefore allowing EU law to continue to apply in that period.

That is, an Ab-category C is a category such that every hom-set Hom(A,B) in C has the structure of an abelian group, and composition of morphisms is bilinear, in the sense that composition of morphisms distributes over the group operation. In formulas: f\\\\circ (g + h) = (f\\\\circ g) + (f\\\\circ h) and (f + g)\\\\circ h = (f\\\\circ h) + (g\\\\circ h), where + is the group operation. Some authors have used the term additive category for preadditive categories, but here we follow the current trend of reserving this word for certain special preadditive categories (see below).  Examples  The most obvious example of a preadditive category is the category Ab itself. More precisely, Ab is a closed monoidal category. Note that commutativity is crucial here; it ensures that the sum of two group homomorphisms is again a homomorphism. In contrast, the category of all groups is not closed. See Medial category. Other common examples: * The category of (left) modules over a ring R, in particular:  the category of vector spaces over a field K. * The algebra of matrices over a ring, thought of as a category as described in the article Additive category. * Any ring, thought of as a category with only one object, is a preadditive category. Here composition of morphisms is just ring multiplication and the unique hom-set is the underlying abelian group. These will give you an idea of what to think of; for more examples, follow the links to below.  Elementary properties  Because every hom-set Hom(A,B) is an abelian group, it has a zero element 0. This is the zero morphism from A to B. Because composition of morphisms is bilinear, the composition of a zero morphism and any other morphism (on either side) must be another zero morphism. If you think of composition as analogous to multiplication, then this says that multiplication by zero always results in a product of zero, which is a familiar intuition. Extending this analogy, the fact that composition is bilinear in general becomes the distributivity of multiplication over addition. Focusing on a single object A in a preadditive category, these facts say that the endomorphism hom-set Hom(A,A) is a ring, if we define multiplication in the ring to be composition. This ring is the endomorphism ring of A. Conversely, every ring (with identity) is the endomorphism ring of some object in some preadditive category. Indeed, given a ring R, we can define a preadditive category R to have a single object A, let Hom(A,A) be R, and let composition be ring multiplication. Since R is an abelian group and multiplication in a ring is bilinear (distributive), this makes R a preadditive category. Category theorists will often think of the ring R and the category R as two different representations of the same thing, so that a particularly perverse category theorist might define a ring as a preadditive category with exactly one object (in the same way that a monoid can be viewed as a category with only one object‚Äîand forgetting the additive structure of the ring gives us a monoid). In this way, preadditive categories can be seen as a generalisation of rings. Many concepts from ring theory, such as ideals, Jacobson radicals, and factor rings can be generalized in a straightforward manner to this setting. When attempting to write down these generalizations, one should think of the morphisms in the preadditive category as the \\"elements\\" of the \\"generalized ring\\".  Additive functors  If C and D are preadditive categories, then a functor F: C ‚Üí D is additive if it too is enriched over the category Ab. That is, F is additive if and only if, given any objects A and B of C, the function f: Hom(A,B) ‚Üí Hom(F(A),F(B)) is a group homomorphism. Most functors studied between preadditive categories are additive. For a simple example, if the rings R and S are represented by the one-object preadditive categories R and S, then a ring homomorphism from R to S is represented by an additive functor from R to S, and conversely. If C and D are categories and D is preadditive, then the functor category DC is also preadditive, because natural transformations can be added in a natural way. If C is preadditive too, then the category Add(C,D) of additive functors and all natural transformations between them is also preadditive. The latter example leads to a generalization of modules over rings: If C is a preadditive category, then Mod(C) := Add(C,Ab) is called the module category over C. When C is the one-object preadditive category corresponding to the ring R, this reduces to the ordinary category of (left) R-modules. Again, virtually all concepts from the theory of modules can be generalised to this setting.  -linear categories  More generally, one can consider a category C enriched over the monoidal category of modules over a commutative ring , called an -linear category. In other words, each hom-set Hom(A,B) in C has the structure of an -module, and composition of morphisms is -bilinear. When considering functors between two -linear categories, one often restricts to those that are -linear, so those that induce -linear maps on each hom-set.  Biproducts  Any finite product in a preadditive category must also be a coproduct, and conversely. In fact, finite products and coproducts in preadditive categories can be characterised by the following biproduct condition: :The object B is a biproduct of the objects A1, ..., An if and only if there are projection morphisms pj: B ‚Üí Aj and injection morphisms ij: Aj ‚Üí B, such that (i1‚àòp1) \\\\+ ¬∑¬∑¬∑ \\\\+ (in‚àòpn) is the identity morphism of B, pj‚àòij is the identity morphism of Aj, and pj‚àòik is the zero morphism from Ak to Aj whenever j and k are distinct. This biproduct is often written A1 ‚äï ¬∑¬∑¬∑ ‚äï An, borrowing the notation for the direct sum. This is because the biproduct in well known preadditive categories like Ab is the direct sum. However, although infinite direct sums make sense in some categories, like Ab, infinite biproducts do not make sense. The biproduct condition in the case n = 0 simplifies drastically; B is a nullary biproduct if and only if the identity morphism of B is the zero morphism from B to itself, or equivalently if the hom-set Hom(B,B) is the trivial ring. Note that because a nullary biproduct will be both terminal (a nullary product) and initial (a nullary coproduct), it will in fact be a zero object. Indeed, the term \\"zero object\\" originated in the study of preadditive categories like Ab, where the zero object is the zero group. A preadditive category in which every biproduct exists (including a zero object) is called additive. Further facts about biproducts that are mainly useful in the context of additive categories may be found under that subject.  Kernels and cokernels  Because the hom-sets in a preadditive category have zero morphisms, the notion of kernel and cokernel make sense. That is, if f: A ‚Üí B is a morphism in a preadditive category, then the kernel of f is the equaliser of f and the zero morphism from A to B, while the cokernel of f is the coequaliser of f and this zero morphism. Unlike with products and coproducts, the kernel and cokernel of f are generally not equal in a preadditive category. When specializing to the preadditive categories of abelian groups or modules over a ring, this notion of kernel coincides with the ordinary notion of a kernel of a homomorphism, if one identifies the ordinary kernel K of f: A ‚Üí B with its embedding K ‚Üí A. However, in a general preadditive category there may exist morphisms without kernels and/or cokernels. There is a convenient relationship between the kernel and cokernel and the abelian group structure on the hom-sets. Given parallel morphisms f and g, the equaliser of f and g is just the kernel of g ‚àí f, if either exists, and the analogous fact is true for coequalisers. The alternative term \\"difference kernel\\" for binary equalisers derives from this fact. A preadditive category in which all biproducts, kernels, and cokernels exist is called pre-abelian. Further facts about kernels and cokernels in preadditive categories that are mainly useful in the context of pre-abelian categories may be found under that subject.  Special cases  Most of these special cases of preadditive categories have all been mentioned above, but they're gathered here for reference. * A ring is a preadditive category with exactly one object. * An additive category is a preadditive category with all finite biproducts. * A pre-abelian category is an additive category with all kernels and cokernels. * An abelian category is a pre-abelian category such that every monomorphism and epimorphism is normal. The preadditive categories most commonly studied are in fact abelian categories; for example, Ab is an abelian category.

Untrusted Mode consists of traditional applications, the Windows operating system, and its components. Trusted Mode is the environment introduced by NGSCB and consists of a new software component called the Nexus that provides NGSCB applications‚ÄîNexus Computing Agents‚Äîwith security-related features. The Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB; codenamed Palladium and also known as Trusted Windows') was a cancelled software architecture designed by Microsoft which aimed to provide users of the Windows operating system with better privacy, security, and system integrity. NGSCB was the result of years of research and development within Microsoft to create a secure computing solution that equaled the security of closed platforms such as set-top boxes while simultaneously preserving the backward compatibility, flexibility, and openness of the Windows operating system. The primary stated objective with NGSCB was to \\"protect software from software.\\" Part of the Trustworthy Computing initiative when unveiled in 2002, NGSCB was expected to be integrated with the Windows Vista operating system, then known by its codename \\"Longhorn.\\" NGSCB relied on hardware designed by members of the Trusted Computing Group to produce a parallel operation environment hosted by a new kernel called the \\"Nexus\\" that existed alongside Windows and provide new applications with features such as hardware-based process isolation, data encryption based on integrity measurements, authentication of a local or remote machine or software configuration, and encrypted paths for user authentication and graphics output. NGSCB would also facilitate the creation and distribution of digital rights management (DRM) policies pertaining the use of information. The technology was the subject of much controversy during its development, with critics contending that it could be used to impose restrictions on users, enforce vendor lock-in, and undermine fair use rights and open-source software. NGSCB was first demonstrated by Microsoft in 2003 at the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference before undergoing a revision in 2004 that would enable applications written prior to its development to benefit from its functionality. In 2005, reports stated that Microsoft would scale back its plans so that the company could ship its Windows Vista operating system by its target date of 2006. Development of NGSCB spanned almost a decade before its cancellation, one of the lengthiest development periods of a feature intended for the operating system. NGSCB differed from the technologies that Microsoft billed as pillars of Windows Vista during development of the operating system, including Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Communication Foundation, and WinFS, in that it was not built upon and did not prioritize .NET Framework managed code. While the technology has not fully materialized, aspects of NGSCB have emerged in Microsoft's BitLocker full disk encryption feature, which can optionally use the Trusted Platform Module to validate the integrity of boot and system files prior to operating system startup; the Measured Boot feature in Windows 8; the certificate attestation features in Windows 8.1; and the Device Guard feature of Windows 10. History Early development Peter Biddle speaks at the ETech conference in 2007. Development of NGSCB began in 1997 after Peter Biddle conceived of new ways to protect content on personal computers. Biddle would enlist the help of members from the Microsoft Research division during the development of the technology and other key contributors would eventually include Blair Dillaway, Brian LaMacchia, Bryan Willman, Butler Lampson, John DeTreville, John Manferdelli, Marcus Peinado, and Paul England. Adam Barr, a former Microsoft employee who worked to secure the remote boot feature during development of Windows 2000, claimed that he was approached by Biddle and colleagues during his tenure with an initiative tentatively known as \\"Trusted Windows,\\" which aimed to protect DVD content from being copied. To achieve this, Lampson proposed a hypervisor that would allow for the execution of a limited operating system dedicated to DVD playback alongside Windows 2000. Patents for a DRM operating system were later filed in 1999 by DeTreville, England, and Lampson. While Microsoft is not known to have officially confirmed a relationship between NGSCB and the DRM operating system patents, one of the technology's architects, Butler Lampson, has stated that they pertain to NGSCB. By 1999, the developers realized that the technology was far more applicable in the realms of privacy and security and the project was given the green-light in October 2001. During the 1999 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Microsoft discussed its intentions to create a new trusted architecture for Windows operating that leveraged new hardware components to promote trust and security while preserving backward compatibility with previous software. On October 11, 1999, the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance, a consortium of various technology companies including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, was formed in an effort to promote trust and security in the personal computing platform. The TCPA would release several detailed specifications for a trusted computing platform with focus on features such as code validation and encryption based on integrity measurements, hardware-based key storage, and machine authentication. These features required a new hardware component designed by the TCPA called the \\"Trusted Platform Module\\" (referred to as a \\"Security Support Component,\\" \\"Security CoProcessor\\" or \\"Security Support Processor\\" in early Microsoft NGSCB documentation). At WinHEC 2000, Microsoft released a technical presentation on the topics of protection of privacy, security, and intellectual property. This session, titled \\"Privacy, Security, and Content in Windows Platforms\\" focused mainly on turning Windows into a platform of trust designed to protect the privacy and security of individual users. A similar presentation would later be shown during WinHEC 2001. Unlike traditional rights management schemes which only protect certain types of data, NGSCB was designed to be egalitarian in that it regarded all data as being equally worthy of protection. As \\"Palladium\\" In April 2002, Microsoft held its first design review for the NGSCB with approximately 37 different companies under a non-disclosure agreement. In June, the technology was publicly unveiled under its codename \\"Palladium\\" in an article by Steven Levy for Newsweek that focused on its origin, design, and features. Levy outlined many of the main features offered by NGSCB, including user authentication, user identification, data encryption, and access control policies pertaining to the use of information. As examples of policies that could be enforced by the technology, users could send e-mail messages accessible only by the intended recipient, or create Microsoft Word documents that could be read only a week after their creation date. Around the time of this announcement, the company was not sure whether to \\"expose the feature in the Windows Control Panel or present it as a separate utility,\\" but regardless of its location, the NGSCB hardware and software features would be turned off by default, thus making the technology an opt-in solution. In July, Microsoft PressPass interviewed John Manferdelli, who restated and expanded on many of the key points discussed in the article by Newsweek. Manferdelli also characterized the technology as an evolutionary set of enhancements for the Windows operating system. In August, Microsoft posted a recruitment advertisement seeking a group program manager to provide vision and industry leadership in the development of several Microsoft technologies including NGSCB. At the Intel Developer Forum in 2002, Paul Otellini announced Intel's plan to support NGSCB with the company's set of processor, chipset, and platform extensions codenamed \\"LaGrande\\" which intended to provide a hardware foundation for all NGSCB components and capabilities and protect confidential user information from software-based attacks while preserving backward compatibility with previous software. As NGSCB The technology was known by its codename \\"Palladium\\" until January 24, 2003 when Microsoft announced that it had been renamed as the \\"Next- Generation Secure Computing Base.\\" According to NGSCB product manager Mario Juarez, the new name was chosen to avoid any legal conflict with an unnamed company that had already acquired the rights to the Palladium name, and to reflect Microsoft's commitment to the technology in the upcoming decade; the previous name had been marred by the controversy surrounding the technology, but Juarez denied that the name change was an attempt by Microsoft to dodge criticism. In April 2003, the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance was succeeded by the Trusted Computing Group. One principal goal of the TCG was to produce a Trusted Platform Module specification compatible with NGSCB, as the previous specification, TPM 1.1, did not meet its requirements. The new TPM 1.2 specification introduced many new features for trusted platforms and was designed to be compliant with Microsoft's NGSCB. The first specification for TPM 1.2, Revision 62, was released by the Trusted Computing Group in fall of 2003. In May 2003, Biddle emphasized that support from hardware vendors and software developers was vital to the technology's success. Microsoft released additional information and publicly demonstrated the technology for the first time at WinHEC 2003. During the demonstration, NGSCB protected information from an attacker who attempted to access information resident in memory, denied access to and alerted users of an application that had been modified, and also thwarted an attempt by a remote administration tool to capture information from an instant messaging session. Although Microsoft previously intended to demonstrate the technology on real hardware as opposed to using software emulation, the demonstration relied on emulators as only a few of the requisite hardware components were available. According to Biddle, Microsoft's primary purpose for emphasizing the NGSCB during WinHEC 2003 was so that the company could acquire feedback and insight from its partners in the hardware industry and to prepare them for the technology. Biddle reiterated that the NGSCB was a set of evolutionary enhancements to the Windows operating system, basing this assessment on the fact that it preserved backward compatibility with previous programs and employed concepts that had been in use prior to its development, but stated that the new capabilities and scenarios that it enabled would be revolutionary. At the conference, Microsoft also revealed its multi-year roadmap for NGSCB, with the next major development milestone scheduled for the company's Professional Developers Conference. The roadmap had also shown that subsequent versions would ship concurrently with pre- release builds of Windows Vista. However, reports suggested that the technology would not be integrated with the operating system upon its release, but would instead be made available as separate software. Details pertaining to adoption of the technology were also revealed, with officials stating that while NGSCB was intended to create a new value proposition for customers without significantly increasing the cost of personal computers, adoption during the year of its introductory release was not anticipated and immediate support for servers was not expected. On the last day of the conference, Biddle stated that the NGSCB needed to provide users with a way to differentiate between secure and unsecure windows, adding that a secure window should be \\"noticeably different\\" to help protect users from spoofing attacks; Nvidia was among the earliest to announce support for this feature. WinHEC 2003 would represent an important milestone during the development of NGSCB. Microsoft would release several technical whitepapers and dedicate many hours of technical sessions, and several companies including Atmel, Comodo Group, Fujitsu, and SafeNet would produce prototype hardware for the demonstration of the technology. In June 2003, Microsoft demonstrated the technology at U.S. campuses in California and in New York. Microsoft's roadmap for NGSCB as revealed during WinHEC 2003. NGSCB was among the topics discussed during Microsoft's PDC 2003 with a pre-beta software development kit, known as the Developer Preview, being distributed to attendees. The Developer Preview was the first time that Microsoft made NGSCB code available to the developer community and was offered by the company as an educational opportunity for NGSCB software development. With this release, Microsoft stated that it was primarily focused on supporting business and enterprise applications and scenarios with the first version of the NGSCB scheduled to ship with Windows Vista, adding that it intended to address consumers with a subsequent version of the technology, but did not provide an estimated time of delivery for this version. At the conference, Jim Allchin said that Microsoft was continuing to work with hardware vendors so that they would be able to support the technology, and Bill Gates expected a new generation of central processing units to offer full support. Following PDC 2003, NGSCB was demonstrated again on prototype hardware during the annual RSA Security conference in November. Microsoft announced at WinHEC 2004 that it would revise NSCB in response to feedback from customers and independent software vendors who did not desire to rewrite their existing programs in order to benefit from its functionality. The revised NGSCB would provide more direct support for Windows with compartmentalized environments for the operating system, its components, and applications; the NGSCB secure input feature would also undergo a significant revision based on cost assessments, hardware requirements, and usability issues that were results of the previous implementation. After this announcement, there were reports that Microsoft planned to cease development of NGSCB; the company denied these claims and reaffirmed its commitment to delivering the technology. Reports published later that year suggested that the company would make additional changes based on feedback from the industry. In 2005, Microsoft's lack of continual updates on its progress with the technology had led some in the industry to speculate that it had been cancelled. At the Microsoft Management Summit event, Steve Ballmer said that the company would build on the security foundation it had started with the NGSCB to create a new set of virtualization technologies for the Windows operating system. During WinHEC 2005, there were reports that Microsoft had scaled back its plans for NGSCB in order to ship the post-reset Windows Vista operating system within a reasonable timeframe. Instead of providing compartmentalization features, the NGSCB would offer a feature known as \\"Secure Startup\\" (later renamed as \\"BitLocker Drive Encryption\\") that would utilize version 1.2 of the Trusted Platform Module to provide validation of pre-boot and operating system components, and disk volume encryption. Microsoft planned to deliver other aspects of its NGSCB vision at a later date. At the time, Jim Allchin stated that the goal with NGSCB was \\"to marry hardware and software to gain better security,\\" a goal that was influential in the development of BitLocker. Allchin also stated that the next progression toward NGSCB would be to create a virtualization environment codnamed \\"Unity,\\" which would rely on specialized hardware and software for virtualization, though he also stated that Microsoft was \\"experimenting with ways to do virtualization without requiring the hardware to do it\\" and that it had not abandoned its previous efforts to ensure that other NGSCB features would eventually be made available. Architecture and technical details A complete Microsoft-based Trusted Computing-enabled system will consist not only of software components developed by Microsoft but also of hardware components developed by the Trusted Computing Group. The majority of features introduced by NGSCB are heavily reliant on specialized hardware and so will not operate on PCs predating 2004. In current Trusted Computing specifications, there are two hardware components: the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which will provide secure storage of cryptographic keys and a secure cryptographic co-processor, and a curtained memory feature in the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In NGSCB, there are two software components, the Nexus, a security kernel that is part of the Operating System which provides a secure environment (Nexus mode) for trusted code to run in, and Nexus Computing Agents (NCAs), trusted modules which run in Nexus mode within NGSCB-enabled applications. Secure storage and attestation At the time of manufacture, a cryptographic key is generated and stored within the TPM. This key is never transmitted to any other component, and the TPM is designed in such a way that it is extremely difficult to retrieve the stored key by reverse engineering or any other method, even to the owner. Applications can pass data encrypted with this key to be decrypted by the TPM, but the TPM will only do so under certain strict conditions. Specifically, decrypted data will only ever be passed to authenticated, trusted applications, and will only ever be stored in curtained memory, making it inaccessible to other applications and the Operating System. Although the TPM can only store a single cryptographic key securely, secure storage of arbitrary data is by extension possible by encrypting the data such that it may only be decrypted using the securely stored key. The TPM is also able to produce a cryptographic signature based on its hidden key. This signature may be verified by the user or by any third party, and so can therefore be used to provide remote attestation that the computer is in a secure state. Curtained memory NGSCB also relies on a curtained memory feature provided by the CPU. Data within curtained memory can only be accessed by the application to which it belongs, and not by any other application or the Operating System. The attestation features of the TPM(Trusted Platform Module) can be used to confirm to a trusted application that it is genuinely running in curtained memory; it is therefore very difficult for anyone, including the owner, to trick a trusted application into running outside of curtained memory. This in turn makes reverse engineering of a trusted application extremely difficult. Applications NGSCB-enabled applications are to be split into two distinct parts, the NCA, a trusted module with access to a limited Application Programming Interface (API), and an untrusted portion, which has access to the full Windows API. Any code which deals with NGSCB functions must be located within the NCA. The reason for this split is that the Windows API has developed over many years and is as a result extremely complex and difficult to audit for security bugs. To maximize security, trusted code is required to use a smaller, carefully audited API. Where security is not paramount, the full API is available. One immediately notices the irony in the \\"extreme complexity and difficulty of audit\\" championed above. Department of Defense-sponsored computer security initiatives that began in the late 1970s recognized very early that, the more trustworthy a system, the more transparently engineered its trusted components must be. Extreme complexity stands in direct opposition to these requirements, as does inability fully to audit. Truly, one must even wonder about Microsoft's commitment and expertise when internal criticisms arise over \\"difficult[y] to audit for security bugs,\\" since nowhere do any applicable criteria offer this raison d'etre to audit. Rather, audit is intended to capture all security-relevant operations transacted by the system; the very statement that concern arises because \\"security bugs will be difficult to audit,\\" or some such, reflects a very tortured understanding of the purpose of audit and of the stricture with which the descriptor \\"secure\\" (in actuality, the descriptor \\"trusted\\") is assigned. Read another way, this concern seems to say, \\"This system can't be called secure, since the audit isn't comprehensive enough to capture evidence of the known (viz., a priori) security bugs.\\" Uses and scenarios The Next-Generation Secure Computing Base enables new categories of applications and scenarios. Examples of uses cited by Microsoft include protected instant messaging conversations and online transactions; rights management services for consumers, content providers, and enterprises; decentralization of access control; and more secure forms of remote access, network authentication, and machine health compliance. A more secure form of virtual private network access was one of the earliest scenarios envisaged by Microsoft. NGSCB can also strengthen software update mechanisms such as those belonging to antivirus software or Windows Update. An early NGSCB privacy scenario conceived of by Microsoft is the \\"wine purchase scenario,\\" where a user can safely conduct a transaction with an online merchant without divulging personally identifiable information during the transaction. With the release of the NGSCB Developer Preview during PDC 2003, Microsoft had emphasized the following enterprise applications and scenarios: document signing, secure instant messaging, applications for viewing secured data, and secure e-mail plug-ins. WinHEC 2004 scenarios During WinHEC 2004, Microsoft revealed two features based on its revision of NGSCB, Cornerstone and Code Integrity Rooting: * Cornerstone would protect a user's login and authentication information by securely transmitting it to NGSCB-protected Windows components for validation, finalizing the user authentication process by releasing access to the SYSKEY if validation was successful. It was intended to protect data on laptops that had been lost or stolen to prevent hackers or thieves from accessing it even if they had performed a software- based attack or booted into an alternative operating system. * Code Integrity Rooting would validate boot and system files prior to the startup of Microsoft Windows. If validation of these components failed, the SYSKEY would not be released. Microsoft's BitLocker is the result of these features. \\"Cornerstone\\" was the codename for BitLocker, and BitLocker‚Äîlike \\"Code Integrity Rooting\\"‚Äîvalidates boot and system components prior to operating system startup and aims to protect SYSKEY from unauthorized access; unsuccessful validation prohibits access to a protected system. Reception Reaction to NGSCB after its unveiling by Newsweek was largely negative. While its security features were praised, critics contended that NGSCB could be used to impose restrictions on users; lock-out competing software vendors; and undermine fair use rights and open source software such as Linux. Microsoft's characterization of NGSCB as a security technology was subject to criticism as its origin focused on DRM. NGSCB's announcement occurred only a few years after Microsoft was accused of anticompetitive practices during the United States v. Microsoft Corporation antitrust case, a detail which called the company's intentions for the technology into question‚ÄîNGSCB was regarded as an effort by the company to maintain its dominance in the personal computing industry. The notion of a \\"Trusted Windows\\" architecture‚Äîone that implied Windows itself was untrustworthy‚Äîwould also be a source of contention within the company itself. After NGSCB's unveiling, Microsoft drew frequent comparisons to Big Brother, an oppressive dictator of a totalitarian state in George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The Electronic Privacy Information Center legislative counsel, Chris Hoofnagle, described Microsoft's characterization of the NGSCB as \\"Orwellian.\\" Big Brother Awards bestowed Microsoft with an award because of NGSCB. Bill Gates addressed these comments at a homeland security conference by stating that NGSCB \\"can make our country more secure and prevent the nightmare vision of George Orwell at the same time.\\" Steven Levy‚Äîthe author who unveiled the existence of the NGSCB‚Äîclaimed in a 2004 front-page article for Newsweek that NGSCB could eventually lead to an \\"information infrastructure that encourages censorship, surveillance, and suppression of the creative impulse where anonymity is outlawed and every penny spent is accounted for.\\" However, Microsoft outlined a scenario enabled by NGSCB that allows a user to conduct a transaction without divulging personally identifiable information. Ross Anderson of Cambridge University was among the most vocal critics of NGSCB and of Trusted Computing. Anderson alleged that the technologies were designed to satisfy federal agency requirements; enable content providers and other third-parties to remotely monitor or delete data in users' machines; use certificate revocation lists to ensure that only content deemed \\"legitimate\\" could be copied; and use unique identifiers to revoke or validate files; he compared this to the attempts by the Soviet Union to \\"register and control all typewriters and fax machines.\\" Anderson also claimed that the TPM could control the execution of applications on a user's machine and, because of this, bestowed to it a derisive \\"Fritz Chip\\" name in reference to United States Senator Ernest \\"Fritz\\" Hollings, who had recently proposed DRM legislation such as the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act for consumer electronic devices. Anderson's report was referenced extensively in the news media and appeared in publications such as BBC News, The New York Times, and The Register. David Safford of IBM Research stated that Anderson presented several technical errors within his report, namely that the proposed capabilities did not exist within any specification and that many were beyond the scope of trusted platform design. Anderson later alleged that BitLocker was designed to facilitate DRM and to lock out competing software on an encrypted system, and, in spite of his allegation that NGSCB was designed for federal agencies, advocated for Microsoft to add a backdoor to BitLocker. Similar sentiments were expressed by Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation, who alleged that Trusted Computing technologies were designed to enforce DRM and to prevent users from running unlicensed software. In 2015, Stallman stated that \\"the TPM has proved a total failure\\" for DRM and that \\"there are reasons to think that it will not be feasible to use them for DRM.\\" After the release of Anderson's report, Microsoft stated in an NGSCB FAQ that \\"enhancements to Windows under the NGSCB architecture have no mechanism for filtering content, nor do they provide a mechanism for proactively searching the Internet for 'illegal' content [...] Microsoft is firmly opposed to putting 'policing functions' into nexus-aware PCs and does not intend to do so\\" and that the idea was in direct opposition with the design goals set forth for NGSCB, which was \\"built on the premise that no policy will be imposed that is not approved by the user.\\" Concerns about the NGSCB TPM were also raised in that it would use what are essentially unique machine identifiers, which drew comparisons to the Intel Pentium III processor serial number, a unique hardware identification number of the 1990s viewed as a risk to end-user privacy. NGSCB, however, mandates that disclosure or use of the keys provided by the TPM be based solely on user discretion; in contrast, Intel's Pentium III included a unique serial number that could potentially be revealed to any application. NGSCB, also unlike Intel's Pentium III, would provide optional features to allow users to indirectly identify themselves to external requestors. In response to concerns that NGSCB would take control away from users for the sake of content providers, Bill Gates stated that the latter should \\"provide their content in easily accessible forms or else it ends up encouraging piracy.\\" Bryan Willman, Marcus Peinado, Paul England, and Peter Biddle‚Äîfour NGSCB engineers‚Äîrealized early during the development of NGSCB that DRM would ultimately fail in its efforts to prevent piracy. In 2002, the group released a paper titled \\"The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution\\" that outlined how content protection mechanisms are demonstrably futile. The paper's premise circulated within Microsoft during the late 1990s and was a source of controversy within Microsoft; Biddle stated that the company almost terminated his employment as a result of the paper's release. A 2003 report published by Harvard University researchers suggested that NGSCB and similar technologies could facilitate the secure distribution of copyrighted content across peer-to-peer networks. Not all assessments were negative. Paul Thurrott praised NGSCB, stating that it was \\"Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing initiative made real\\" and that it would \\"form the basis of next-generation computer systems.\\" Scott Bekker of Redmond Magazine stated that NGSCB was misunderstood because of its controversy and that it appeared to be a \\"promising, user-controlled defense against privacy intrusions and security violations.\\" In February 2004, In-Stat/MDR, publisher of the Microprocessor Report, bestowed NGSCB with its Best Technology award. Malcom Crompton, Australian Privacy Commissioner, stated that \\"NGSCB has great privacy enhancing potential [...] Microsoft has recognised there is a privacy issue [...] we should all work with them, give them the benefit of the doubt and urge them to do the right thing.\\" When Microsoft announced at WinHEC 2004 that it would be revising NGSCB so that previous applications would not have to be rewritten, Martin Reynolds of Gartner praised the company for this decision as it would create a \\"more sophisticated\\" version of NGSCB that would simplify development. David Wilson, writing for South China Morning Post, defended NGSCB by saying that \\"attacking the latest Microsoft monster is an international blood sport\\" and that \\"even if Microsoft had a new technology capable of ending Third World hunger and First World obesity, digital seers would still lambaste it because they view Bill Gates as a grey incarnation of Satan.\\" Microsoft noted that negative reaction to NGSCB gradually waned after events such as the USENIX Annual Technical Conference in 2003, and several Fortune 500 companies also expressed interest in it. When reports announced in 2005 that Microsoft would scale back its plans and incorporate only BitLocker with Windows Vista, concerns pertaining erosion of user rights, vendor lock- in, and other potential abuses remained. In 2008, Biddle stated that negative perception was the most significant contributing factor responsible for the cessation of NGSCB's development.Biddle, Peter. (July 16, 2008). \\"Perception (or, Linus gets away with being honest again)\\" Vulnerability In an article in 2003, D. Boneh and D. Brumley indicated that NGSCB was vulnerable to timing attack.

Situated at a height of above the sea level, the lake is long and wide and lies between the mountain ridges Korbu and Al-tyntu, on the junction of the Sailughem Mountains and the Western Sayans. Its surface area is ; however, due to its considerable depth (), the lake contains no less than 40 km¬≥ (9.6 cubic miles) of fresh water. Annual water level fluctuations are estimated at some 348 sm. The lake transparency is high, with the visibility of the lake water ranging from six to fourteen meters. About 70 rivers and 150 temporary streams flow into the lake, the largest of them, Chulyshman River, supplying more than half of the lake's water. The lake is drained through a single outlet, the Biya River, which, after its confluence with the Katun River, forms one of Siberia's largest rivers, the Ob River. The lake is surrounded by mountains of 600-1,300 m in the northern part and about in the southern part. Lake Teletskoe is included into Altaisky Nature Reserve. That reserve along with the Katun Nature Reserve and the Ukok Plateau Nature Refuge were listed as one of UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites under the name \\"Golden Mountains of Altai\\". The Altai people have a legend about the name of the lake in their language, which means Golden Lake. According to this story, once, a rich man had an ingot of gold, which he wanted to use to buy food. He travelled around Altai, but could not find anyone who would sell him any food. Eventually, he threw the gold into the lake. This legend is the origin of the name.  Research  The lake from space, 2003. There is a field base of Institute of Taxonomy and Ecology of Animals () by the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences () at the northwest part of the lake, about 6 km from head water of Biya River. Therein studies are performed of the insect-eaters and rodents of Altai Republic, helminthofauna of vertebrates in biocenoses of taiga, ichthyocenose and animal plankton of Lake Teletskoye. Near the base there is located the research-and-production sport-and-sanitary base of Gorno-Altaisk State University. Tomsk State University has been conducting scientific research in the area for more than 50 years. Ecologists, geologists, and archeologists from Institute of Water and Ecological Problems () the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences from the Institute of Water and Ecological Problems spend many years working here to study the lake and surrounding area. Geomorphologists and geologists scrutinize geological structure of Lake Teletskoye, its paleogeography, age, and origin. It has been known for a long time that there are gold in placers and bedrock deposits in the Altai. The Geomorphologists from Tomsk State University works in the Teletskoye geology- prospecting detachment searching for gold-placers. They managed to establish a new search criterion for a placer. The base for the discovery were the palaeoglaciological studies during the last few years and theoretical models of the diluvial morpholithogenesis. The content of the precious component is everywhere much higher than the lowest accepted industrial standard, sometimes it‚Äôs tremendous. The investigators carried out large-scale exploration routes on vast territories near watersheds of the upper reaches of all the rivers in the northern and western parts of the Teletskoye Lake basin. These explorations included studies of exposures, boring of prospect-holes, pits and hollow wells (up to 15 m deep). The results of these investigations let us speak about the regularity and reliability of the new criterion. The first 14C-method data for the layered clays on the flat watersheds showed the age of 15 thousand years and younger. This important fact leads to an unavoidable conclusion about the youth of the Teletskoje Lake depression ‚Äì the post- glacial age of ‚Äúthe last cutting‚Äù during the pre-glacial (Late Quaternary) peneplain.

They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont- Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio (which includes Rome), Marche, Umbria and Romagna, and portions of Emilia. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope, as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy. By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily. In 1929 the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the head of the Italian government, ended the \\"Prisoner in the Vatican\\" problem involving unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty, signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity, the Vatican City State, limited to a token territory. Name The Papal States were also known as the Papal State (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere personal union). The territories were also referred to variously as the State(s) of the Church, the Pontifical States, the Ecclesiastical States, or the Roman States (, also ', ', ', and '; , also ' \\"papal rule\\"). To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed. History Origins For its first 300 years, the Catholic Church was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.Schn√ºrer, Gustav. \\"States of the Church.\\" Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 July 2014 Early congregations met in rooms set aside for that purpose in the homes of well-to-do individuals, and a number of early churches, known as titular churches and located on the outskirts of Ancient Rome, were held as property by individuals, rather than by the Church itself. Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \\"heir\\" of that property, often its senior deacons, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as latifundias, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond. This system began to change during the reign of the Emperor Constantine I, who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them. The Lateran Palace was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself. Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of Odoacer and, later, the Ostrogoths, the Church organization in Italy, with the pope at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole Church. The seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Justinian I, launched a reconquest of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the Lombards entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from Ravenna, where the emperor's representative, or Exarch, was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \\"Rome-Ravenna corridor\\"), plus coastal exclaves. With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome. While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the Duchy of Rome, an area roughly equivalent to modern-day Latium, became an independent state ruled by the pope. The Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; Pope Gregory II even excommunicated Emperor Leo III during the Iconoclastic Controversy. Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through diplomacy. In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard aggrandizement on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the Lombard King Liutprand's Donation of Sutri (728) to Pope Gregory II. Donation of Pepin When the Exarchate of Ravenna finally fell to the Lombards in 751, the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the Franks. In 751, Pope Zachary had Pepin the Short crowned king in place of the powerless Merovingian figurehead king Childeric III. Zachary's successor, Pope Stephen II, later granted Pepin the title Patrician of the Romans. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards ‚Äì taking control of northern Italy ‚Äì and made a gift (called the Donation of Pepin) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope. In 781, Charlemagne codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the Duchy of the Pentapolis, parts of the Duchy of Benevento, Tuscany, Corsica, Lombardy, and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as 'Emperor of the Romans'. Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire The precise nature of the relationship between the popes and emperors ‚Äì and between the Papal States and the Empire ‚Äì is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the Frankish Empire over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma, or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties. Events in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among Charlemagne's grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the Theophylacti. This period was later dubbed the Saeculum obscurum (\\"dark age\\"), and sometimes as the \\"rule by harlots\\".√âmile Amann and Auguste Dumas, L'√©glise au pouvoir des la√Øques, in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. Histoire de l'√âglise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours, vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948) In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified rocca. Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler Otto I conquered northern Italy; Pope John XII crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the Diploma Ottonianum, by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States. Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the Gregorian Reform worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Treaty of Venice made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent. Avignon Papacy The domain of the Papal States From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of Avignon, surrounded by Provence and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \\"Avignonese\\" or \\"Babylonian Captivity\\". During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the French Revolution. During this Avignon Papacy, local despots took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the Pepoli in Bologna, the Ordelaffi in Forl√¨, the Manfredi in Faenza, the Malatesta in Rimini all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church. In Ferrara, the death of Azzo VIII d'Este without legitimate heirs (1308) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, King Robert of Naples, for only nine years before the citizens recalled the Este from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara. In Rome itself the Orsini and the Colonna struggled for supremacy, dividing the city's rioni between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of Cola di Rienzo, who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347, and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family. To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power. As Prof. Guido Ruggiero states, \\"even with the support of Petrarch, his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\\" The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of Cardinal Albornoz, who was appointed papal legate, and his condottieri heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and Giovanni Visconti, he defeated Giovanni di Vico, lord of Viterbo, moving against Galeotto Malatesta of Rimini and the Ordelaffi of Forl√¨, the Montefeltro of Urbino and the da Polenta of Ravenna, and against the cities of Senigallia and Ancona. The last holdouts against full papal control were Giovanni Manfredi of Faenza and Francesco II Ordelaffi of Forl√¨. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on 29 April 1357, promulgated the Constitutiones Sanct√¶ Matris Ecclesi√¶, which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These Constitutiones Egidiane mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. Pope Urban V ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death. The Quirinal Palace, papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the Renaissance until their annexation Renaissance During the Renaissance, the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes Alexander VI and Julius II. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories. Papal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades. Julius II, the \\"Warrior Pope\\", fought on their behalf. Reformation The Reformation began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to Emperor Charles V brutally sacked Rome and imprisoned Pope Clement VII, as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. Thus Clement VII was forced to give up Parma, Modena, and several smaller territories.https://www.themaparchive.com/papal- states-in-the-16th-century.html A generation later the armies of King Philip II of Spain defeated those of Pope Paul IV over the same issues. This period saw a gradual revival of the pope's temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of Pope Paul III. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the Duchy of Ferrara in 1598, and the Duchy of Urbino in 1631. At its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy ‚Äì Latium, Umbria, Marche and the Legations of Ravenna, Ferrara and Bologna extending north into the Romagna. It also included the small enclaves of Benevento and Pontecorvo in southern Italy and the larger Comtat Venaissin around Avignon in southern France. Napoleonic era Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the Napoleonic wars changed the face of the peninsula. The French Revolution affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the Comtat Venaissin and Avignon. Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories) were seized and became part of the Cisalpine Republic. Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General Louis-Alexandre Berthier declared a Roman Republic (February 1798). Pope Pius VI fled to Siena, and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799. The French Consulate restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected Pope Pius VII took up residency in Rome, but the French Empire under Napoleon invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809 the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France, forming the d√©partements of Tibre and Trasim√®ne. Following the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the Congress of Vienna officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control. From 1814 until the death of Pope Gregory XVI in 1846, the popes followed a reactionary policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last Jewish ghetto in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them castrati, who were in demand musically. There were hopes that this would change when Pope Pius IX (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms. Italian unification Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, Italian nationalism had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the Habsburgs and the Bourbons, with the House of Savoy in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the Austrian army. The nationalist and liberal revolutions of 1848 affected much of Europe. In February 1849 a Roman Republic was declared, and the hitherto liberally-inclined Pope Pius IX had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government. As a result of the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859, Sardinia- Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while Giuseppe Garibaldi overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmont government petitioned French Emperor Napoleon III for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the Latium and large areas northwest of Rome. The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870. A unified Kingdom of Italy was declared and in March 1861 the first Italian parliament, which met in Turin, the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the Second French Empire at the Battle of Sedan deprived Rome of its French protector. King Victor Emmanuel II at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on 10 September 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the Breach of Porta Pia, in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed. The city was captured on 20 September 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a plebiscite the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States. Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \\"Law of Guarantees\\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see Prisoner in the Vatican) to the Apostolic Palace and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the Leonine City, on Vatican Hill. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy ‚Äì then under Pius XI ‚Äì renounced the bulk of the Papal States. The Lateran Treaty with Italy (then ruled by the National Fascist Party under Benito Mussolini) was signed on 11 February 1929, creating the State of the Vatican City, forming the sovereign territory of the Holy See, which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory. Regional governors Papal Zouaves pose in 1869. As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \\"papal legate\\", as in the former principality of Benevento, or at Bologna, in Romagna, and the March of Ancona; and \\"papal delegate\\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the Campagne and Maritime Province. Other titles like \\"Papal Vicar\\", \\"Vicar General\\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \\"count\\" or even \\"prince\\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day. Papal military Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of volunteers and mercenaries. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (Esercito Pontificio in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of Irish volunteers, plus artillery and dragoons. In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called Papal Zouaves after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against Garibaldi's Redshirts, Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.Charles A. Coulombe, The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008 The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the Palatine Guard, which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by Pope Paul VI; the Noble Guard, which also disbanded in 1970; and the Swiss Guard, which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force. A small Papal Navy was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.

They live mainly in Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they form one of the principal ethnic groups alongside the Tutsi and the Great Lakes Twa. Demographics The Hutu is the largest of the four main population divisions in Burundi and Rwanda. Prior to 2017, the CIA World Factbook stated that 84% of Rwandans and 85% of Burundians are Hutu, with Tutsis the next largest ethnic group at 15% and 14% of residents in Rwanda and Burundi, respectively. However, these figures have since been removed. The Twa pygmies, the smallest of the two countries' principal populations, share language and culture with the Hutu and Tutsi. They are distinguished by a considerably shorter stature.  Origins  The Hutu are believed to have first emigrated to the Great Lake region from Central Africa in the great Bantu expansion. Various theories have emerged to explain the purported physical differences between them and their fellow Bantu-speaking neighbors, the Tutsi. The Tutsi were pastoralists and are believed to have established aristocratic control over the sedentary Hutu and Twa.

Others suggest that the two groups are related but not identical, and that differences between them were exacerbated by Europeans, or by a gradual, natural split, as those who owned cattle became known as Tutsi and those who did not became Hutu. Mahmood Mamdani states that the Belgian colonial power designated people as Tutsi or Hutu on the basis of cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records.Mahmood Mamdani (2001) When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism, and the Genocide in Rwanda, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press The debate over the ethnic origins of the Hutu and Tutsi within Rwandan politics predates the Rwandan genocide, and continues to the present day,Newbury, Catharine. ‚ÄúEthnicity and the Politics of History in Rwanda.‚Äù Africa Today, vol. 45, no. 1, 1998.

Genetics Y-DNA (paternal lineages) Modern-day genetic studies of the Y-chromosome suggest that the Hutu, like the Tutsi, are largely of Bantu extraction (83% E1b1a, 8% E2). Paternal genetic influences associated with the Horn of Africa and North Africa are few (3% E1b1b and 1% R1b), and are ascribed to much earlier inhabitants who were assimilated. However, the Hutu have considerably fewer Nilo-Saharan paternal lineages (4.3% B) than the Tutsi (14.9% B).  Autosomal DNA (Overall Ancestry)  In general, the Hutu appear to share a close genetic kinship with neighboring Bantu populations, particularly the Tutsi. However, it is unclear whether this similarity is primarily due to extensive genetic exchanges between these communities through intermarriage or whether it ultimately stems from common origins: > [...] generations of gene flow obliterated whatever clear-cut physical > distinctions may have once existed between these two Bantu peoples ‚Äì > renowned to be height, body build, and facial features.

Hutus speak Rwanda-Rundi as their native tongue, which is a member of the Bantu subgroup of the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family. Rwanda-Rundi is subdivided into the Kinyarwanda and Kirundi dialects, which have been standardized as official languages of Rwanda and Burundi respectively. It is also spoken as a mother tongue by the Tutsi and Twa. Additionally, a small portion of Hutu speak French, the other official language of Rwanda and Burundi, as a lingua franca, although the population is dwindling given the poor relations between Rwanda and France. Post-colonial history Hutu and other Rwandan children in Virunga National Park The Belgian-sponsored Tutsi monarchy survived until 1959, when Kigeli V was exiled from the colony (then called Ruanda-Urundi). In Burundi, Tutsis, who are the minority, maintained control of the government and military. In Rwanda, the political power was transferred from the minority Tutsi to the majority Hutu.Adekunle, Julius. 2007. Culture and Customs of Rwanda. P.17 In Rwanda, this led to the \\"Social revolution\\" and Hutu violence against Tutsis. Tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed and many others fled to neighboring countries, such as Burundi, Uganda and expanding the Banyamulenge Tutsi ethnic group in the South Kivu region of the Belgian Congo. Later, exiled Tutsis from Burundi invaded Rwanda, prompting Rwanda to close its border to Burundi. In Burundi, a campaign of genocide was conducted against the Hutu population in 1972,Michael Bowen, Passing by;: The United States and genocide in Burundi, 1972, (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1973), 49 ppRen√© Lemarchand, Selective genocide in Burundi (Report - Minority Rights Group; no. 20, 1974), 36 pp.Rene Lemarchand, Burundi: Ethnic Conflict and Genocide (New York: Woodrow Wilson Center and Cambridge University Press, 1996), 232 pp. *Edward L.

Part III: Investigation of the Assassination. Conclusions at USIP.org This sparked a genocide in Burundi between Hutu political structures and the Tutsi military, in which an estimated 500,000 Burundians died. There were many mass killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus; these events were deemed to be a genocide by the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi.International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi (2002) While Tutsi remained in control of Burundi, the conflict resulted in genocide in Rwanda as well. A Tutsi rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, invaded Rwanda from Uganda, which started a civil war against Rwanda's Hutu government in 1990. A peace agreement was signed, but violence erupted again, culminating in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when Hutu extremists killed an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis. About 30% of the Twa pygmy population of Rwanda were also killed by the Hutus. At the same time, the Rwandan Patriotic Front took control of the country and is still the ruling party . Burundi is also currently governed by a former rebel group, the Hutu CNDD-FDD. As of 2006, violence between the Hutu and Tutsi had subsided, but the situation in both Rwanda and Burundi was still tense, and tens of thousands of Rwandans were still living outside the country (see Great Lakes refugee crisis).

A monomorphism from to is often denoted with the notation . In the more general setting of category theory, a monomorphism (also called a monic morphism or a mono) is a left-cancellative morphism. That is, an arrow such that for all objects and all morphisms , : f \\\\circ g_1 = f \\\\circ g_2 \\\\implies g_1 = g_2. Monomorphisms are a categorical generalization of injective functions (also called \\"one-to-one functions\\"); in some categories the notions coincide, but monomorphisms are more general, as in the examples below. The categorical dual of a monomorphism is an epimorphism, that is, a monomorphism in a category C is an epimorphism in the dual category Cop. Every section is a monomorphism, and every retraction is an epimorphism. Relation to invertibility Left-invertible morphisms are necessarily monic: if l is a left inverse for f (meaning l is a morphism and l \\\\circ f = \\\\operatorname{id}_{X}), then f is monic, as : f \\\\circ g_1 = f \\\\circ g_2 \\\\Rightarrow l\\\\circ f\\\\circ g_1 = l\\\\circ f\\\\circ g_2 \\\\Rightarrow g_1 = g_2. A left-invertible morphism is called a split mono or a section. However, a monomorphism need not be left-invertible. For example, in the category Group of all groups and group homomorphisms among them, if H is a subgroup of G then the inclusion is always a monomorphism; but f has a left inverse in the category if and only if H has a normal complement in G. A morphism is monic if and only if the induced map , defined by for all morphisms , is injective for all objects Z. Examples Every morphism in a concrete category whose underlying function is injective is a monomorphism; in other words, if morphisms are actually functions between sets, then any morphism which is a one-to-one function will necessarily be a monomorphism in the categorical sense. In the category of sets the converse also holds, so the monomorphisms are exactly the injective morphisms. The converse also holds in most naturally occurring categories of algebras because of the existence of a free object on one generator. In particular, it is true in the categories of all groups, of all rings, and in any abelian category. It is not true in general, however, that all monomorphisms must be injective in other categories; that is, there are settings in which the morphisms are functions between sets, but one can have a function that is not injective and yet is a monomorphism in the categorical sense. For example, in the category Div of divisible (abelian) groups and group homomorphisms between them there are monomorphisms that are not injective: consider, for example, the quotient map , where Q is the rationals under addition, Z the integers (also considered a group under addition), and Q/Z is the corresponding quotient group. This is not an injective map, as for example every integer is mapped to 0. Nevertheless, it is a monomorphism in this category. This follows from the implication , which we will now prove. If , where G is some divisible group, and , then . Now fix some . Without loss of generality, we may assume that (otherwise, choose ‚àíx instead). Then, letting , since G is a divisible group, there exists some such that , so . From this, and , it follows that :0 \\\\leq \\\\frac{h(x)}{h(x) + 1} = h(y) < 1 Since , it follows that , and thus . This says that , as desired. To go from that implication to the fact that q is a monomorphism, assume that for some morphisms , where G is some divisible group. Then , where . (Since , and , it follows that ). From the implication just proved, . Hence q is a monomorphism, as claimed. Properties *In a topos, every mono is an equalizer, and any map that is both monic and epic is an isomorphism. *Every isomorphism is monic. Related concepts There are also useful concepts of regular monomorphism, extremal monomorphism, immediate monomorphism, strong monomorphism, and split monomorphism. * A monomorphism is said to be regular if it is an equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms. * A monomorphism \\\\mu is said to be extremal if in each representation \\\\mu=\\\\varphi\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon, where \\\\varepsilon is an epimorphism, the morphism \\\\varepsilon is automatically an isomorphism. * A monomorphism \\\\mu is said to be immediate if in each representation \\\\mu=\\\\mu'\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon, where \\\\mu' is a monomorphism and \\\\varepsilon is an epimorphism, the morphism \\\\varepsilon is automatically an isomorphism. * thumb A monomorphism \\\\mu:C\\\\to D is said to be strong if for any epimorphism \\\\varepsilon:A\\\\to B and any morphisms \\\\alpha:A\\\\to C and \\\\beta:B\\\\to D such that \\\\beta\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon=\\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\alpha, there exists a morphism \\\\delta:B\\\\to C such that \\\\delta\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon=\\\\alpha and \\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\delta=\\\\beta. * A monomorphism \\\\mu is said to be split if there exists a morphism \\\\varepsilon such that \\\\varepsilon\\\\circ\\\\mu=1 (in this case \\\\varepsilon is called a left-sided inverse for \\\\mu). Terminology The companion terms monomorphism and epimorphism were originally introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki; Bourbaki uses monomorphism as shorthand for an injective function. Early category theorists believed that the correct generalization of injectivity to the context of categories was the cancellation property given above. While this is not exactly true for monic maps, it is very close, so this has caused little trouble, unlike the case of epimorphisms. Saunders Mac Lane attempted to make a distinction between what he called monomorphisms, which were maps in a concrete category whose underlying maps of sets were injective, and monic maps, which are monomorphisms in the categorical sense of the word. This distinction never came into general use. Another name for monomorphism is extension, although this has other uses too.

Epimorphisms are categorical analogues of onto or surjective functions (and in the category of sets the concept corresponds exactly to the surjective functions), but it may not exactly coincide in all contexts; for example, the inclusion \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{Q} is a ring epimorphism. The dual of an epimorphism is a monomorphism (i.e. an epimorphism in a category C is a monomorphism in the dual category Cop). Many authors in abstract algebra and universal algebra define an epimorphism simply as an onto or surjective homomorphism. Every epimorphism in this algebraic sense is an epimorphism in the sense of category theory, but the converse is not true in all categories. In this article, the term \\"epimorphism\\" will be used in the sense of category theory given above. For more on this, see below. Examples Every morphism in a concrete category whose underlying function is surjective is an epimorphism. In many concrete categories of interest the converse is also true. For example, in the following categories, the epimorphisms are exactly those morphisms that are surjective on the underlying sets: *Set: sets and functions. To prove that every epimorphism f: X ‚Üí Y in Set is surjective, we compose it with both the characteristic function g1: Y ‚Üí {0,1} of the image f(X) and the map g2: Y ‚Üí {0,1} that is constant 1. *Rel: sets with binary relations and relation-preserving functions. Here we can use the same proof as for Set, equipping {0,1} with the full relation {0,1}√ó{0,1}. *Pos: partially ordered sets and monotone functions. If f : (X, ‚â§) ‚Üí (Y, ‚â§) is not surjective, pick y0 in Y \\\\ f(X) and let g1 : Y ‚Üí {0,1} be the characteristic function of {y  y0 ‚â§ y} and g2 : Y ‚Üí {0,1} the characteristic function of {y  y0 < y}. These maps are monotone if {0,1} is given the standard ordering 0 < 1\\\\. *Grp: groups and group homomorphisms. The result that every epimorphism in Grp is surjective is due to Otto Schreier (he actually proved more, showing that every subgroup is an equalizer using the free product with one amalgamated subgroup); an elementary proof can be found in (Linderholm 1970). *FinGrp: finite groups and group homomorphisms. Also due to Schreier; the proof given in (Linderholm 1970) establishes this case as well. *Ab: abelian groups and group homomorphisms. *K-Vect: vector spaces over a field K and K-linear transformations. *Mod-R: right modules over a ring R and module homomorphisms. This generalizes the two previous examples; to prove that every epimorphism f: X ‚Üí Y in Mod-R is surjective, we compose it with both the canonical quotient map g 1: Y ‚Üí Y/f(X) and the zero map g2: Y ‚Üí Y/f(X). *Top: topological spaces and continuous functions. To prove that every epimorphism in Top is surjective, we proceed exactly as in Set, giving {0,1} the indiscrete topology, which ensures that all considered maps are continuous. *HComp: compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions. If f: X ‚Üí Y is not surjective, let y ‚àà Y ‚àí fX. Since fX is closed, by Urysohn's Lemma there is a continuous function g1:Y ‚Üí [0,1] such that g1 is 0 on fX and 1 on y. We compose f with both g1 and the zero function g2: Y ‚Üí [0,1]. However, there are also many concrete categories of interest where epimorphisms fail to be surjective. A few examples are: *In the category of monoids, Mon, the inclusion map N ‚Üí Z is a non-surjective epimorphism. To see this, suppose that g1 and g2 are two distinct maps from Z to some monoid M. Then for some n in Z, g1(n) ‚â† g2(n), so g1(-n) ‚â† g2(‚àín). Either n or ‚àín is in N, so the restrictions of g1 and g2 to N are unequal. *In the category of algebras over commutative ring R, take R[N] ‚Üí R[Z], where R[G] is the group ring of the group G and the morphism is induced by the inclusion N ‚Üí Z as in the previous example. This follows from the observation that 1 generates the algebra R[Z] (note that the unit in R[Z] is given by 0 of Z), and the inverse of the element represented by n in Z is just the element represented by ‚àín. Thus any homomorphism from R[Z] is uniquely determined by its value on the element represented by 1 of Z. *In the category of rings, Ring, the inclusion map Z ‚Üí Q is a non-surjective epimorphism; to see this, note that any ring homomorphism on Q is determined entirely by its action on Z, similar to the previous example. A similar argument shows that the natural ring homomorphism from any commutative ring R to any one of its localizations is an epimorphism. *In the category of commutative rings, a finitely generated homomorphism of rings f : R ‚Üí S is an epimorphism if and only if for all prime ideals P of R, the ideal Q generated by f(P) is either S or is prime, and if Q is not S, the induced map Frac(R/P) ‚Üí Frac(S/Q) is an isomorphism (EGA IV 17.2.6). *In the category of Hausdorff spaces, Haus, the epimorphisms are precisely the continuous functions with dense images. For example, the inclusion map Q ‚Üí R, is a non-surjective epimorphism. The above differs from the case of monomorphisms where it is more frequently true that monomorphisms are precisely those whose underlying functions are injective. As for examples of epimorphisms in non-concrete categories: * If a monoid or ring is considered as a category with a single object (composition of morphisms given by multiplication), then the epimorphisms are precisely the right-cancellable elements. * If a directed graph is considered as a category (objects are the vertices, morphisms are the paths, composition of morphisms is the concatenation of paths), then every morphism is an epimorphism. Properties Every isomorphism is an epimorphism; indeed only a right-sided inverse is needed: if there exists a morphism j : Y ‚Üí X such that fj = idY, then f: X ‚Üí Y is easily seen to be an epimorphism. A map with such a right-sided inverse is called a split epi. In a topos, a map that is both a monic morphism and an epimorphism is an isomorphism. The composition of two epimorphisms is again an epimorphism. If the composition fg of two morphisms is an epimorphism, then f must be an epimorphism. As some of the above examples show, the property of being an epimorphism is not determined by the morphism alone, but also by the category of context. If D is a subcategory of C, then every morphism in D that is an epimorphism when considered as a morphism in C is also an epimorphism in D. However the converse need not hold; the smaller category can (and often will) have more epimorphisms. As for most concepts in category theory, epimorphisms are preserved under equivalences of categories: given an equivalence F : C ‚Üí D, a morphism f is an epimorphism in the category C if and only if F(f) is an epimorphism in D. A duality between two categories turns epimorphisms into monomorphisms, and vice versa. The definition of epimorphism may be reformulated to state that f : X ‚Üí Y is an epimorphism if and only if the induced maps :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\operatorname{Hom}(Y,Z) &\\\\rightarrow& \\\\operatorname{Hom}(X,Z)\\\\\\\\\\\\ g &\\\\mapsto& gf\\\\end{matrix} are injective for every choice of Z. This in turn is equivalent to the induced natural transformation :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\operatorname{Hom}(Y,-) &\\\\rightarrow& \\\\operatorname{Hom}(X,-)\\\\end{matrix} being a monomorphism in the functor category SetC. Every coequalizer is an epimorphism, a consequence of the uniqueness requirement in the definition of coequalizers. It follows in particular that every cokernel is an epimorphism. The converse, namely that every epimorphism be a coequalizer, is not true in all categories. In many categories it is possible to write every morphism as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism. For instance, given a group homomorphism f : G ‚Üí H, we can define the group K = im(f) and then write f as the composition of the surjective homomorphism G ‚Üí K that is defined like f, followed by the injective homomorphism K ‚Üí H that sends each element to itself. Such a factorization of an arbitrary morphism into an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism can be carried out in all abelian categories and also in all the concrete categories mentioned above in (though not in all concrete categories).  Related concepts  Among other useful concepts are regular epimorphism, extremal epimorphism, immediate epimorphism, strong epimorphism, and split epimorphism. * An epimorphism is said to be regular if it is a coequalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms. * An epimorphism \\\\varepsilon is said to be extremal if in each representation \\\\varepsilon=\\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\varphi, where \\\\mu is a monomorphism, the morphism \\\\mu is automatically an isomorphism. * An epimorphism \\\\varepsilon is said to be immediate if in each representation \\\\varepsilon=\\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon', where \\\\mu is a monomorphism and \\\\varepsilon' is an epimorphism, the morphism \\\\mu is automatically an isomorphism. * thumb An epimorphism \\\\varepsilon:A\\\\to B is said to be strong if for any monomorphism \\\\mu:C\\\\to D and any morphisms \\\\alpha:A\\\\to C and \\\\beta:B\\\\to D such that \\\\beta\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon=\\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\alpha, there exists a morphism \\\\delta:B\\\\to C such that \\\\delta\\\\circ\\\\varepsilon=\\\\alpha and \\\\mu\\\\circ\\\\delta=\\\\beta. * An epimorphism \\\\varepsilon is said to be split if there exists a morphism \\\\mu such that \\\\varepsilon\\\\circ\\\\mu=1 (in this case \\\\mu is called a right-sided inverse for \\\\varepsilon). There is also the notion of homological epimorphism in ring theory. A morphism f: A ‚Üí B of rings is a homological epimorphism if it is an epimorphism and it induces a full and faithful functor on derived categories: D(f) : D(B) ‚Üí D(A). A morphism that is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism is called a bimorphism. Every isomorphism is a bimorphism but the converse is not true in general. For example, the map from the half-open interval [0,1) to the unit circle S1 (thought of as a subspace of the complex plane) that sends x to exp(2œÄix) (see Euler's formula) is continuous and bijective but not a homeomorphism since the inverse map is not continuous at 1, so it is an instance of a bimorphism that is not an isomorphism in the category Top. Another example is the embedding Q ‚Üí R in the category Haus; as noted above, it is a bimorphism, but it is not bijective and therefore not an isomorphism. Similarly, in the category of rings, the map Z ‚Üí Q is a bimorphism but not an isomorphism. Epimorphisms are used to define abstract quotient objects in general categories: two epimorphisms f1 : X ‚Üí Y1 and f2 : X ‚Üí Y2 are said to be equivalent if there exists an isomorphism j : Y1 ‚Üí Y2 with j f1 = f2. This is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are defined to be the quotient objects of X.  Terminology  The companion terms epimorphism and monomorphism were first introduced by Bourbaki. Bourbaki uses epimorphism as shorthand for a surjective function. Early category theorists believed that epimorphisms were the correct analogue of surjections in an arbitrary category, similar to how monomorphisms are very nearly an exact analogue of injections. Unfortunately this is incorrect; strong or regular epimorphisms behave much more closely to surjections than ordinary epimorphisms. Saunders Mac Lane attempted to create a distinction between epimorphisms, which were maps in a concrete category whose underlying set maps were surjective, and epic morphisms, which are epimorphisms in the modern sense. However, this distinction never caught on. It is a common mistake to believe that epimorphisms are either identical to surjections or that they are a better concept. Unfortunately this is rarely the case; epimorphisms can be very mysterious and have unexpected behavior. It is very difficult, for example, to classify all the epimorphisms of rings. In general, epimorphisms are their own unique concept, related to surjections but fundamentally different.

CE) and used methods that were radically different than those used in Buddhist monasteries, including living in forests and caves and practicing meditation in charnel grounds similar to those practiced by Shaiva Kapalika ascetics. These yogic circles came together in tantric feasts (ganachakra) often in sacred sites (pitha) and places (ksetra) which included dancing, singing, sex rites and the ingestion of taboo substances like alcohol, urine, meat, etc.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 168. At least two of the mahasiddhas cited in the Buddhist literature are comparable with the Shaiva Nath saints (Gorakshanath and Matsyendranath) who practiced Hatha Yoga. According to Schumann, a movement called Sahaja-siddhi developed in the 8th century in Bengal. It was dominated by long-haired, wandering mahasiddhas who openly challenged and ridiculed the Buddhist establishment. The mahasiddhas pursued siddhis, magical powers such as flight and extrasensory perception as well as spiritual liberation.Dowman, The Eighty-four Mahasiddhas and the Path of Tantra - Introduction to Masters of Mahamudra, 1984. http://keithdowman.net/essays/introduction-mahasiddhas-and-tantra.html Ronald M.

Tantras Diamond Realm Mandala, based on the tantric Vajrasekhara Sutra, and symbolizing the final realization of Vairocana Buddha in Shingon. kapalas), closeup of a Chakrasamvara mandala Many of the elements found in Buddhist tantric literature are not wholly new. Earlier MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras already contained some elements which are emphasized in the Tantras, such as mantras and dharani.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. p 122. The use of protective verses or phrases actually dates back to the Vedic period and can be seen in the early Buddhist texts, where they are termed paritta. The practice of visualization of Buddhas such as AmitƒÅbha is also seen in pre-tantric texts like the Longer SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha S≈´tra.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 225. There are other MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras which contain \\"proto-tantric\\" material such as the Gandavyuha and the Dasabhumika which might have served as a central source of visual imagery for Tantric texts.Osto, Douglas. ‚ÄúProto‚ÄìTantric‚Äù Elements in The Gandavyuha sutra. Journal of Religious History Vol. 33, No. 2, June 2009. Later MahƒÅyƒÅna texts like the KƒÅra·πá·∏çavy≈´ha S≈´tra (c. 4th-5th century CE) expound the use of mantras such as Om mani padme hum, associated with vastly powerful beings like Avalokiteshvara. The popular Heart Sutra also includes a mantra. VajrayƒÅna Buddhists developed a large corpus of texts called the Buddhist Tantras, some of which can be traced to at least the 7th century CE but might be older. The dating of the tantras is \\"a difficult, indeed an impossible task\\" according to David Snellgrove.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 147. Some of the earliest of these texts, Kriya tantras such as the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´-m≈´la-kalpa (c. 6th century), teach the use of mantras and dharanis for mostly worldly ends including curing illness, controlling the weather and generating wealth.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 205-206. The Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra (Compendium of Principles), classed as a \\"Yoga tantra\\", is one of the first Buddhist tantras which focuses on liberation as opposed to worldly goals. In another early tantra, the Vajrasekhara (Vajra Peak), the influential schema of the five Buddha families is developed.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 210. Other early tantras include the MahƒÅvairocana Abhisa·πÉbodhi and the GuhyasamƒÅja (Gathering of Secrets).Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, Routledge, (2008), page 19. The GuhyasamƒÅja is a Mahayoga class of Tantra, which features new forms of ritual practice considered \\"left-hand\\" (vamachara) such as the use of taboo substances like alcohol, sexual yoga, and charnel ground practices which evoke wrathful deities.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 212. Ryujun Tajima divides the tantras into those which were \\"a development of MahƒÅyƒÅnist thought\\" and those \\"formed in a rather popular mould toward the end of the eighth century and declining into the esoterism of the left\\",Tajima, R. √âtude sur le Mah√†vairocana-S√πtra this \\"left esoterism\\" mainly refers to the Yogini tantras and later works associated with wandering antinomian yogis. This practice survives in Tibetan Buddhism, but it is rare for this to be done with an actual person. It is more common for a yogi to use an imagined consort (a buddhist tantric deity, i.e. a yidam).Mullin, Glenn H.; Tsong-Kha-Pa, (2005) The Six Yogas Of Naropa, Tsongkhapa's Commentary Entitled A Book Of Three Inspirations A Treatise On The Stages Of Training In The Profound Path Of Naro's Six Dharmas, p. 70. Snow Lion Publications. These later tantras such as the Hevajra Tantra and the Chakrasamvara are classed as \\"Yogini tantras\\" and represent the final form of development of Indian Buddhist tantras in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Kalachakra tantra developed in the 10th century. It is farthest removed from the earlier Buddhist traditions, and incorporates concepts of messianism and astrology not present elsewhere in Buddhist literature. According to Ronald M. Davidson, the rise of Tantric Buddhism was a response to the feudal structure of Indian society in the early medieval period (ca. 500-1200 CE) which saw kings being divinized as manifestations of gods. Likewise, tantric yogis reconfigured their practice through the metaphor of being consecrated (abhi≈õeka) as the overlord (rƒÅjƒÅdhirƒÅja) of a mandala palace of divine vassals, an imperial metaphor symbolizing kingly fortresses and their political power.Gordon White, David; Review of \\"Indian Esoteric Buddhism\\", by Ronald M. Davidson, University of California, Santa Barbara JIATS, no. 1 (October 2005), THL #T1223, 11 pp. Relationship to Shaivism Vajrayana adopted deities such as Bhairava, known as Yamantaka in Tibetan Buddhism. The central deity of the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra, which according to scholars like David B. Gray and Alexis Sanderson, appropriated numerous elements from nondual Shaiva Tantra The question of the origins of early VajrayƒÅna has been taken up by various scholars. David Seyfort Ruegg has suggested that Buddhist tantra employed various elements of a ‚Äúpan-Indian religious substrate‚Äù which is not specifically Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava.Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 171. According to Alexis Sanderson, various classes of VajrayƒÅna literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Shaivism.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The ≈öaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of ≈öaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 124. The relationship between the two systems can be seen in texts like the Ma√±jusrimulakalpa, which later came to be classified under Kriya tantra, and states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The ≈öaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of ≈öaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 129-131. Alexis Sanderson notes that the VajrayƒÅna Yogini tantras draw extensively from the material also present in Shaiva Bhairava tantras classified as Vidyapitha. Sanderson's comparison of them shows similarity in \\"ritual procedures, style of observance, deities, mantras, mandalas, ritual dress, Kapalika accouterments like skull bowls, specialized terminology, secret gestures, and secret jargons. There is even direct borrowing of passages from Shaiva texts.\\"Sanderson, Alexis; Vajrayana:, Origin and Function, 1994 Sanderson gives numerous examples such as the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, which prescribes acting as a Shaiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The ≈öaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of ≈öaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 144-145. Sanderson claims that the Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Shaiva text Tantrasadbhava, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place. Ronald M. Davidson meanwhile, argues that Sanderson's claims for direct influence from Shaiva Vidyapitha texts are problematic because \\"the chronology of the Vidyapitha tantras is by no means so well established\\"Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 204. and that \\"the available evidence suggests that received Saiva tantras come into evidence sometime in the ninth to tenth centuries with their affirmation by scholars like Abhinavagupta (c. 1000 c.e.)\\"Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 206. Davidson also notes that the list of pithas or sacred places \\"are certainly not particularly Buddhist, nor are they uniquely Kapalika venues, despite their presence in lists employed by both traditions.\\"Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 207. Davidson further adds that like the Buddhists, the Shaiva tradition was also involved in the appropriation of Hindu and non-Hindu deities, texts and traditions, an example being \\"village or tribal divinities like Tumburu\\".Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 214. Davidson adds that Buddhists and Kapalikas as well as other ascetics (possibly Pasupatas) mingled and discussed their paths at various pilgrimage places and that there were conversions between the different groups. Thus he concludes: > The Buddhist-Kapalika connection is more complex than a simple process of > religious imitation and textual appropriation. There can be no question that > the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by Kapalika and other Saiva > movements, but the influence was apparently mutual. Perhaps a more nuanced > model would be that the various lines of transmission were locally > flourishing and that in some areas they interacted, while in others they > maintained concerted hostility. Thus the influence was both sustained and > reciprocal, even in those places where Buddhist and Kapalika siddhas were in > extreme antagonism.Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social > History of the Tantric Movement, p. 217. Davidson also argues for the influence of non-brahmanical and outcaste tribal religions and their feminine deities (such as Parnasabari and Janguli).Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 228, 231. Philosophical background According to Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin and Alex Wayman, the philosophical view of the Vajrayana is based on Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, mainly the Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools.Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 3.L. de la Vall√©e Poussin, Bouddhisme, √©tudes et mat√©riaux, pp. 174-5. The major difference seen by Vajrayana thinkers is the superiority of Tantric methods, which provide a faster vehicle to liberation and contain many more skillful means (upaya). The importance of the theory of emptiness is central to the Tantric Buddhist view and practice. The Buddhist emptiness view sees the world as being fluid, without an ontological foundation or inherent existence, but ultimately a fabric of constructions. Because of this, tantric practice such as self-visualization as the deity is seen as being no less real than everyday reality, but a process of transforming reality itself, including the practitioner's identity as the deity. As Stephan Beyer notes, \\"In a universe where all events dissolve ontologically into Emptiness, the touching of Emptiness in the ritual is the re-creation of the world in actuality\\".Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of TƒÅrƒÅ: Magic and Ritual in Tibet, 1978, page 69 The doctrine of Buddha-nature, as outlined in the RatnagotravibhƒÅga of Asanga, was also an important theory which became the basis for Tantric views.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125. As explained by the Tantric commentator Lilavajra, this \\"intrinsic secret (behind) diverse manifestation\\" is the utmost secret and aim of Tantra. According to Alex Wayman this \\"Buddha embryo\\" (tathƒÅgatagarbha) is a \\"non-dual, self-originated Wisdom (jnana), an effortless fount of good qualities\\" that resides in the mindstream but is \\"obscured by discursive thought.\\"Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 56. This doctrine is often associated with the idea of the inherent or natural luminosity (Skt: prak·πõti-prabhƒÅsvara-citta, T. ‚Äôod gsal gyi sems) or purity of the mind (prakrti-parisuddha). Another fundamental theory of Tantric practice is that of transformation. In VajrayƒÅna, negative mental factors such as desire, hatred, greed, pride are used as part of the path. As noted by French Indologist Madeleine Biardeau, the tantric doctrine is \\"an attempt to place kama, desire, in every meaning of the word, in the service of liberation.\\"Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 202. This view is outlined in the following quote from the Hevajra tantra: > Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain > thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, > by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of > reversals is not known.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: > Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125-126. The Hevajra further states that \\"one knowing the nature of poison may dispel poison with poison.\\" As Snellgrove notes, this idea is already present in Asanga's Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika and therefore it is possible that he was aware of Tantric techniques, including sexual yoga.Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 126. According to Buddhist Tantra, there is no strict separation of the profane or samsara and the sacred or nirvana, rather they exist in a continuum. All individuals are seen as containing the seed of enlightenment within, which is covered over by defilements. Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana sees Buddhahood not as something outside or an event in the future, but as immanently present.Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna in \\"A companion to Buddhist philosophy\\", page 100. Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as Buddhaguhya, Vimalamitra, RatnƒÅkara≈õƒÅnti and Abhayakaragupta continued the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and adapted it to their commentaries on the major Tantras. Abhayakaragupta‚Äôs Vajravali is a key source in the theory and practice of tantric rituals. After monks such as Vajrabodhi and ≈öubhakarasi·πÉha brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as Yi Xing and K≈´kai. Likewise in Tibet, Sakya Pandita (1182-28 - 1251), as well as later thinkers like Longchenpa (1308‚Äì1364) expanded on these philosophies in their tantric commentaries and treatises. The status of the tantric view continued to be debated in medieval Tibet. Tibetan Buddhist Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo (1012‚Äì1088) held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra, which was based on basic purity of ultimate reality.Koppl, Heidi. Establishing Appearances as Divine. Snow Lion Publications 2008, chapter 4. Tsongkhapa (1357‚Äì1419) on the other hand, held that there is no difference between VajrayƒÅna and other forms of Mahayana in terms of prajnaparamita (perfection of insight) itself, only that VajrayƒÅna is a method which works faster.Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo- Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 5. Place within Buddhist tradition Tangut Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union. Various classifications are possible when distinguishing VajrayƒÅna from the other Buddhist traditions. VajrayƒÅna can be seen as a third yana, next to ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna and Mahayana. VajrayƒÅna can be distinguished from the Sutrayana. The Sutrayana is the method of perfecting good qualities, where the VajrayƒÅna is the method of taking the intended outcome of Buddhahood as the path. VajrayƒÅna can also be distinguished from the paramitayana. According to this schema, Indian Mahayana revealed two vehicles (yana) or methods for attaining enlightenment: the method of the perfections (Paramitayana) and the method of mantra (Mantrayana). The Paramitayana consists of the six or ten paramitas, of which the scriptures say that it takes three incalculable aeons to lead one to Buddhahood. The tantra literature, however, claims that the Mantrayana leads one to Buddhahood in a single lifetime. According to the literature, the mantra is an easy path without the difficulties innate to the Paramitayana. Mantrayana is sometimes portrayed as a method for those of inferior abilities. However the practitioner of the mantra still has to adhere to the vows of the Bodhisattva. Characteristics Manjushri, the bodhisattva associated with praj√±ƒÅ. Goal The goal of spiritual practice within the Mahayana and VajrayƒÅna traditions is to become a SammƒÅsambuddha (fully awakened Buddha), those on this path are termed Bodhisattvas. As with the Mahayana, motivation is a vital component of VajrayƒÅna practice. The Bodhisattva-path is an integral part of the VajrayƒÅna, which teaches that all practices are to be undertaken with the motivation to achieve Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. In the vehicle of Sutra Mahayana the \\"path of the cause\\" is taken, whereby a practitioner starts with his or her potential Buddha-nature and nurtures it to produce the fruit of Buddhahood. In the VajrayƒÅna the \\"path of the fruit\\" is taken whereby the practitioner takes his or her innate Buddha-nature as the means of practice. The premise is that since we innately have an enlightened mind, practicing seeing the world in terms of ultimate truth can help us to attain our full Buddha-nature. Experiencing ultimate truth is said to be the purpose of all the various tantric techniques practiced in the Vajrayana.  Esoteric transmission  Monks attending the 2003 Kalachakra empowerment in Bodhgaya, India. Some empowerment ceremonies can include large numbers of initiates. VajrayƒÅna Buddhism is esoteric in the sense that the transmission of certain teachings only occurs directly from teacher to student during an empowerment (abhi·π£eka) and their practice requires initiation in a ritual space containing the mandala of the deity.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 231. Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that secrecy itself is not important and only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.Dhammasaavaka. The Buddhism Primer: An Introduction to Buddhism, p. 79. In order to engage in VajrayƒÅna practice, a student should have received such an initiation or permission: The secrecy of teachings was often protected through the use of allusive, indirect, symbolic and metaphorical language (twilight language) which required interpretation and guidance from a teacher.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 198. The teachings may also be considered \\"self-secret\\", meaning that even if they were to be told directly to a person, that person would not necessarily understand the teachings without proper context. In this way, the teachings are \\"secret\\" to the minds of those who are not following the path with more than a simple sense of curiosity.Morreale, Don (1998) The Complete Guide to Buddhist America p.215Trungpa, Ch√∂gyam and Ch√∂dzin, Sherab (1992) The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra p. 144. Because of their role in giving access to the practices and guiding the student through them, the role of the Guru, Lama or Vajracharya is indispensable in VajrayƒÅna.  Affirmation of the feminine, antinomian and taboo  Tibetan Chakrasamvara statue in Yab-Yum union with his consort VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´ Some VajrayƒÅna rituals traditionally included the use of certain taboo substances, such as blood, semen, alcohol and urine, as ritual offerings and sacraments, though some of these are often replaced with less taboo substances such as yogurt. Tantric feasts and initiations sometimes employed substances like human flesh as noted by Kahha‚Äôs Yogaratnamala.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 236. The use of these substances is related to the non-dual (advaya) nature of a Buddha's wisdom (buddhaj√±ana). Since the ultimate state is in some sense non-dual, a practitioner can approach that state by \\"transcending attachment to dual categories such as pure and impure, permitted and forbidden\\". As the Guhyasamaja Tantra states \\"the wise man who does not discriminate achieves Buddhahood\\". VajrayƒÅna rituals also include sexual yoga, union with a physical consort as part of advanced practices. Some tantras go further, the Hevajra tantra states ‚ÄòYou should kill living beings, speak lying words, take what is not given, consort with the women of others‚Äô. While some of these statements were taken literally as part of ritual practice, others such as killing were interpreted in a metaphorical sense. In the Hevajra, \\"killing\\" is defined as developing concentration by killing the life-breath of discursive thoughts.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 237. Likewise, while actual sexual union with a physical consort is practiced, it is also common to use a visualized mental consort. Alex Wayman points out that the symbolic meaning of tantric sexuality is ultimately rooted in bodhicitta and the bodhisattva's quest for enlightenment is likened to a lover seeking union with the mind of the Buddha.Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 39. Judith Simmer-Brown notes the importance of the psycho-physical experiences arising in sexual yoga, termed \\"great bliss\\" (mahasukha): \\"Bliss melts the conceptual mind, heightens sensory awareness, and opens the practitioner to the naked experience of the nature of mind.\\"Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 217 This tantric experience is not the same as ordinary self-gratifying sexual passion since it relies on tantric meditative methods using the subtle body and visualizations as well as the motivation for enlightenment.Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 217-219 As the Hevajra tantra says: > \\"This practice [of sexual union with a consort] is not taught for the sake > of enjoyment, but for the examination of one's own thought, whether the mind > is steady or waving.\\"Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The > Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 219 Feminine deities and forces are also increasingly prominent in VajrayƒÅna. In the Yogini tantras in particular, women and female yoginis are given high status as the embodiment of female deities such as the wild and nude Vajrayogini.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 240. The Candamaharosana Tantra (viii:29‚Äì30) states: : > Women are heaven, women are the teaching (dharma) : > Women indeed are the highest austerity (tapas) : > Women are the Buddha, women are the Sangha : > Women are the Perfection of Wisdom. In India, there is evidence to show that women participated in tantric practice alongside men and were also teachers, adepts and authors of tantric texts.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 242.  Vows and behaviour  Practitioners of VajrayƒÅna need to abide by various tantric vows or pledges called samaya. These are extensions of the rules of the PrƒÅtimok·π£a and Bodhisattva vows for the lower levels of tantra, and are taken during initiations into the empowerment for a particular Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra. The special tantric vows vary depending on the specific mandala practice for which the initiation is received and also depending on the level of initiation. Ngagpas of the Nyingma school keep a special non-celibate ordination. A tantric guru, or teacher is expected to keep his or her samaya vows in the same way as his students. Proper conduct is considered especially necessary for a qualified Vajrayana guru. For example, the Ornament for the Essence of Manjushrikirti states:Tsongkhapa, Tantric Ethics: An Explanation of the Precepts for Buddhist Vajrayana Practice , page 46.  Tantra techniques  Mani stones, stones inscribed with the \\"om mani padme hum\\" mantra. A Japanese Handscroll depicting various mudras, 11th‚Äì12th century. While all the VajrayƒÅna Buddhist traditions include all of the traditional practices used in Mahayana Buddhism such as developing bodhicitta, practicing the paramitas, and samatha - vipassana meditations, they also make use of unique tantric methods that are seen as more advanced. These include mantras, mudras, deity yoga, other visualization based meditations, subtle body yogas like tummo and rituals like the goma fire ritual. Vajrayana teaches that these techniques provide faster path to Buddhahood.Hopkins, Jeffrey; Tantric Techniques, 2008, pp 220, 251 A central feature of tantric practice is the use of mantras, and seed syllables (bijas). Mantras are words, phrases or a collection of syllables used for a variety of meditative, magical and ritual ends. Mantras are usually associated with specific deities or Buddhas, and are seen as their manifestations in sonic form. They are traditionally believed to have spiritual power, which can lead to enlightenment as well as supramundane abilities (siddhis).Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences), p. 132. According to Indologist Alex Wayman, Buddhist esotericism is centered on what is known as \\"the three mysteries\\" or \\"secrets\\": the tantric adept affiliates his body, speech, and mind with the body, speech, and mind of a Buddha through mudra, mantras and samadhi respectively.Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 63. Padmavajra (c 7th century) explains in his Tantrarthavatara Commentary, the secret Body, Speech, and Mind of the Buddhas are:Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 36. :Secret of Body: Whatever form is necessary to tame the living beings. :Secret of Speech: Speech exactly appropriate to the lineage of the creature, as in the language of the yaksas, etc. :Secret of Mind: Knowing all things as they really are. These elements are brought together in the practice of tantric deity yoga, which involves visualizing the deity's body and mandala, reciting the deity's mantra and gaining insight into the nature of things based on this contemplation. Advanced tantric practices such as deity yoga are taught in the context of an initiation ceremony by tantric gurus or vajracharyas (vajra-masters) to the tantric initiate, who also takes on formal commitments or vows (samaya). In Tibetan Buddhism, advanced practices like deity yoga are usually preceded by or coupled with \\"preliminary practices\\" called ngondro which includes prostrations and recitations of the 100 syllable mantra.Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 178. Vajrayana is a system of tantric lineages, and thus only those who receive an empowerment or initiation (abhiseka) are allowed to practice the more advanced esoteric methods. In tantric deity yoga, mantras or bijas are used during the ritual evocation of deities which are said to arise out of the uttered and visualized mantric syllables. After the deity's image and mandala has been established, heart mantras are visualized as part of the contemplation in different points of the deity's body.Williams, Wynne, and Tribe. Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pp. 223-224. Deity yoga An 18th century Mongolian miniature which depicts a monk generating a tantric visualization. Siddham Script). Visualizing deities in the form of seed syllables is a common Vajrayana meditation. In Shingon, one of the most common practices is Ajikan (ÈòøÂ≠óËßÄ), meditating on the syllable A. The fundamental practice of Buddhist Tantra is ‚Äúdeity yoga‚Äù (devatayoga), meditation on a chosen deity or \\"cherished divinity\\" (Skt. I·π£·π≠a-devatƒÅ, Tib. yidam), which involves the recitation of mantras, prayers and visualization of the deity, the associated mandala of the deity's Buddha field, along with consorts and attendant Buddhas and bodhisattvas.Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 37 According to the Tibetan scholar Tsongkhapa, deity yoga is what separates Tantra from Sutra practice.Power, John (2007). Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, p. 271. In the Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras, the most widespread tantric form in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, this method is divided into two stages, the generation stage (utpatti-krama) and the completion stage (nispanna-krama). In the generation stage, one dissolves one's reality into emptiness and meditates on the deity-mandala, resulting in identification with this divine reality. In the completion stage, the divine image along with the subtle body is applied to the realization of luminous emptiness. The Indian tantric scholar RatnƒÅkara≈õƒÅnti (c. 1000 CE) describes the generation stage cultivation practice thus: > [A]ll phenomenal appearance having arisen as mind, this very mind is > [understood to be] produced by a mistake (bhrƒÅntyƒÅ), i.e. the appearance of > an object where there is no object to be grasped; ascertaining that this is > like a dream, in order to abandon this mistake, all appearances of objects > that are blue and yellow and so on are abandoned or destroyed (parih·πõ-); > then, the appearance of the world (vi≈õvapratibhƒÅsa) that is ascertained to > be oneself (ƒÅtmani≈õcitta) is seen to be like the stainless sky on an autumn > day at noon: appearanceless, unending sheer luminosity.Tomlinson, Davey K; > The tantric context of RatnƒÅkara≈õƒÅnti‚Äôs theory of consciousness This dissolution into emptiness is then followed by the visualization of the deity and re-emergence of the yogi as the deity. During the process of deity visualization, the deity is to be imaged as not solid or tangible, as \\"empty yet apparent\\", with the character of a mirage or a rainbow.Ray, Reginald A.

This visualization is to be combined with \\"divine pride\\", which is \\"the thought that one is oneself the deity being visualized.\\"Cozort, Daniel; Highest Yoga Tantra, page 57. Divine pride is different from common pride because it is based on compassion for others and on an understanding of emptiness.Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 273. tummo (Skt. candali, inner heat) and phowa (transference of consciousness). Following mastery of the \\"generation stage\\", one practices the \\"perfection\\" or \\"completion\\" stage. The Indian commentator Buddhaguhya (c.700 CE), in his commentary on the Mahavairocana Tantra, outlines the \\"perfection stage\\" practices thus: > First you should actualize all the four branches of recitation for a while > as before, and then analyze the manifestation of the created (parikalpita) > colour, shape, and so on, of your tutelary deity who is identical to > yourself, breaking them down into atoms. Or it is also acceptable to do this > by way of the reasoning that is unborn and unarising from the very > beginning, or similarly by way of the technique of drawing-in the vital > energy (prana) through the yoga of turning your mind inside, or by way of > not focusing on its appearance [as colour and shape]. In accordance with > that realization, you should then actualize the mind which is just self- > aware, free from the body image of your tutelary deity and without > appearance [as subject and object], and mentally recite your vidya mantra as > appropriate.Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of > Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation(Treasury > of the Buddhist Sciences), pp. 72-73 The Tibetologist David Germano outlines two main types of completion practice: a formless and image-less contemplation on the ultimate empty nature of the mind and various yogas that make use of the subtle body to produce energetic sensations of bliss and warmth.Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation(Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences), pp. 73-74 The subtle body yogas systems like the Six Dharmas of Naropa and the Six Yogas of Kalachakra make use of energetic schemas of human psycho-physiology composed of \\"energy channels\\" (Skt. nadi, Tib. rtsa), \\"winds\\" or currents (Skt. vayu, Tib. rlung), \\"drops\\" or charged particles (Skt. bindu, Tib. thig le) and chakras (\\"wheels\\"). These subtle energies are seen as \\"mounts\\" for consciousness, the physical component of awareness. They are engaged by various means such as pranayama (breath control) to produce blissful experiences that are then applied to the realization of ultimate reality.Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45 Other methods which are associated with the completion stage in Tibetan Buddhism include dream yoga (which relies on lucid dreaming), practices associated with the bardo (the interim state between death and rebirth), transference of consciousness (phowa) and Ch√∂d, in which the yogi ceremonially offers their body to be eaten by tantric deities in a ritual feast. Other practices A Newari Buddhist mandala used for Guru Puja, Nepal, 19th century, gilt copper inlaid with semiprecious stones. Video of a Shingon Goma Fire Ritual at Yaku≈çin Y≈´kiji, Mount Takao Another form of Vajrayana practice are certain meditative techniques associated with MahƒÅmudrƒÅ and Dzogchen, often termed \\"formless practices\\" or the path of self- liberation. These techniques do not rely on deity visualization per se but on direct pointing-out instruction from a master and are often seen as the most advanced and direct methods.Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 112-113. Another distinctive feature of Tantric Buddhism is its unique and often elaborate rituals. They include pujas (worship rituals), prayer festivals, protection rituals, death rituals, tantric feasts (ganachakra), tantric initiations (abhiseka) and the goma fire ritual (common in East Asian Esotericism). A video of the Cham dance, a traditional practice in some sects of Tibetan Buddhism. An important element in some of these rituals (particularly initiations and tantric feasts) seems to have been the practice of ritual sex or sexual yoga (karmamudra, \\"desire seal\\", also referred to as \\"consort observance\\", vidyavrata, and euphemistically as \\"puja\\"), as well as the sacramental ingestion of \\"power substances\\" such as the mingled sexual fluids and uterine blood (often performed by licking these substances off the vulva, a practice termed yonipuja).Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences), pp. 108-118. The practice of ingestion of sexual fluids is mentioned by numerous tantric commentators, sometimes euphemistically referring to the penis as the \\"vajra\\" and the vagina as the \\"lotus\\". The Cakrasamvara Tantra commentator Kambala, writing about this practice, states: > The seats are well-known on earth to be spots within the lotus mandala; by > abiding within it there is great bliss, the royal nature of nondual joy. > Therefore the lotus seat is supreme: filled with a mixture of semen and > uterine blood, one should especially kiss it, and lolling with the tongue > take it up. Unite the vajra and lotus, with the rapture of drinking [this] > liquor.Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri > Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of > the Buddhist Sciences), p. 118. According to David Gray, these sexual practices probably originated in a non- monastic context, but were later adopted by monastic establishments (such as Nalanda and Vikramashila). He notes that the anxiety of figures like Atisa towards these practices, and the stories of Vir≈´pa and Maitripa being expelled from their monasteries for performing them, shows that supposedly celibate monastics were undertaking these sexual rites.Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences), p. 126. Because of its adoption by the monastic tradition, the practice of sexual yoga was slowly transformed into one which was either done with an imaginary consort visualized by the yogi instead of an actual person, or reserved to a small group of the \\"highest\\" or elite practitioners. Likewise, the drinking of sexual fluids was also reinterpreted by later commentators to refer subtle body anatomy of the perfection stage practices.Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri Heruka): ≈örƒ´herukƒÅbhidhƒÅna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences), pp. 121, 127. Symbols and imagery Dagchen Rinpoche's hand holds a vajra drawing lines that close the Hevajra Mandala, after the empowerment, Tharlam Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism, Boudha, Kathmandu, Nepal. VajrayƒÅna uses a rich variety of symbols, terms, and images that have multiple meanings according to a complex system of analogical thinking. In VajrayƒÅna, symbols, and terms are multi- valent, reflecting the microcosm and the macrocosm as in the phrase \\"As without, so within\\" (yatha bahyam tatha ‚Äôdhyatmam iti) from Abhayakaragupta‚Äôs Nispannayogavali.Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 62. The Vajra Bronze Vajras and Bell from Itsukushima, Japan The Sanskrit term \\"vajra\\" denoted a thunderbolt like a legendary weapon and divine attribute that was made from an adamantine, or an indestructible substance which could, therefore, pierce and penetrate any obstacle or obfuscation. It is the weapon of choice of Indra, the King of the Devas. As a secondary meaning, \\"vajra\\" symbolizes the ultimate nature of things which is described in the tantras as translucent, pure and radiant, but also indestructible and indivisible. It is also symbolic of the power of tantric methods to achieve its goals.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 217. A vajra is also a scepter-like ritual object ( dorje), which has a sphere (and sometimes a gankyil) at its centre, and a variable number of spokes, 3, 5 or 9 at each end (depending on the sadhana), enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in tantric rituals in combination with the bell or ghanta; symbolically, the vajra may represent method as well as great bliss and the bell stands for wisdom, specifically the wisdom realizing emptiness. The union of the two sets of spokes at the center of the wheel is said to symbolize the unity of wisdom (praj√±a) and compassion (karuna) as well as the sexual union of male and female deities.Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 219. Imagery and ritual in deity yoga Ch√∂d ritual, note the use of Damaru drum and hand-bell, as well as the Kangling (thighbone trumpet). Representations of the deity, such as statues (murti), paintings (thangka), or mandala, are often employed as an aid to visualization, in Deity yoga. The use of visual aids, particularly microcosmic/macrocosmic diagrams, known as \\"mandalas\\", is another unique feature of Buddhist Tantra. Mandalas are symbolic depictions of the sacred space of the awakened Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as well as of the inner workings of the human person.Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 42 The macrocosmic symbolism of the mandala then, also represents the forces of the human body. The explanatory tantra of the Guhyasamaja tantra, the Vajramala, states: \\"The body becomes a palace, the hallowed basis of all the Buddhas.\\"Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 83. Mandalas are also sacred enclosures, sacred architecture that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a central deity or yidam and their retinue. In the book The World of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama describes mandalas thus: \\"This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.\\" The Five Tathagatas or 'Five Buddhas', along with the figure of the Adi-Buddha, are central to many Vajrayana mandalas as they represent the \\"five wisdoms\\", which are the five primary aspects of primordial wisdom or Buddha-nature.Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 130. All ritual in Vajrayana practice can be seen as aiding in this process of visualization and identification. The practitioner can use various hand implements such as a vajra, bell, hand-drum (damaru) or a ritual dagger (phurba), but also ritual hand gestures (mudras) can be made, special chanting techniques can be used, and in elaborate offering rituals or initiations, many more ritual implements and tools are used, each with an elaborate symbolic meaning to create a special environment for practice. Vajrayana has thus become a major inspiration in traditional Tibetan art.  Texts  Three leafs from a manuscript of the VajrƒÅvalƒ´, a ritual compendium compiled by Abhayakaragupta, abbot of the Vikramashila monastery around 1100 CE. There is an extended body of texts associated with Buddhist Tantra, including the \\"tantras\\" themselves, tantric commentaries and shastras, sadhanas (liturgical texts), ritual manuals (Jp. gikirui, ÂÑÄËªåÈ°û), dharanis, poems or songs (dohas), termas and so on. According to Harunaga Isaacson, > Though we do not know precisely at present just how many Indian tantric > Buddhist texts survive today in the language in which they were written, > their number is certainly over one thousand five hundred; I suspect indeed > over two thousand.

(2015), A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, John Wiley & Sons, p. 120. In Tibetan Buddhism, a large number of tantric works are widely studied and different schools focus on the study and practice of different cycles of texts.

Traditions Buddhist tradition throughout Asia, Vajrayana (in the form of Tibetan Buddhism) dominates the Himalayan regions and in the Mongolian regions. The Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ engraved on a stele. Temple Fo Ding Shan Chao Sheng in Sanyi Township, Taiwan. Erected in June 2005. Although there is historical evidence for VajrayƒÅna Buddhism in Southeast Asia and elsewhere (see History of VajrayƒÅna above), today the VajrayƒÅna exists primarily in the form of the two major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and Japanese Esoteric Buddhism in Japan known as Shingon (literally \\"True Speech\\", i.e. mantra), with a handful of minor subschools utilising lesser amounts of esoteric or tantric materials. The distinction between traditions is not always rigid. For example, the tantra sections of the Tibetan Buddhist canon of texts sometimes include material not usually thought of as tantric outside the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, such as the Heart SutraConze, The Prajnaparamita Literature and even versions of some material found in the Pali Canon.Peter Skilling, Mahasutras, volume I, 1994, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, page xxiv  Chinese Esoteric Buddhism  Esoteric and Tantric teachings followed the same route into northern China as Buddhism itself, arriving via the Silk Road and Southeast Asian Maritime trade routes sometime during the first half of the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty and received sanction from the emperors of the Tang dynasty. During this time, three great masters came from India to China: ≈öubhakarasi·πÉha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra who translated key texts and founded the Zhenyan (ÁúüË®Ä, \\"true word\\", \\"mantra\\") tradition.Baruah, Bibbhuti (2008) Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism: p. 170 Zhenyan was also brought to Japan as Shingon during this period. This tradition focused on tantras like the Mahavairocana tantra, and unlike Tibetan Buddhism, it does not employ the antinomian and radical tantrism of the Anuttarayoga Tantras. The prestige of this tradition influenced other schools of Chinese Buddhism such as Chan and Tiantai to adopt esoteric practices.Orzech, Charles D. (general editor) (2011). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia, Brill, Page 296.Sharf, Robert (2001) Coming to Terms With Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the Treasure Store Treatise: p. 268Faure, Bernard (1997) The Will to Orthodoxy: A Critical Genealogy of Northern Chan Buddhism: p. 85 During the Yuan dynasty, the Mongol emperors made Tibetan Buddhism the official religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court.Nan Huaijin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. York Beach: Samuel Weiser. 1997. p. 99. Imperial support of Tibetan Vajrayana continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties. Today, esoteric traditions mostly exist at the margins of mainstream Chinese Buddhism. Though esoteric elements are part of mainstream Chinese Buddhism as well such as various rituals which make use of tantric mantra and dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ and the veneration of certain tantric deities like Cundi and Acala. According to Hsuan Hua, the most popular example of esoteric teachings still practiced in many Chan monasteries of East Asia is the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra and its dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama Mantra, along with the Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha DhƒÅra·πáƒ´.Shi, Hs√ºan Hua (1977). The Shurangama Sutra, pp. 68‚Äì71 Sino-American Buddhist Association, Buddhist Text Translation Society. . Another form of esoteric Buddhism in China is Azhaliism, which is practiced among the Bai people of China and venerates Mahakala as a major deity. p. 441  Japanese Esotericism  Kobo Daishi (Kukai) holding a vajra and a mala, 14th century, Art Institute of Chicago. =Shingon Buddhism= The Shingon school is found in Japan and includes practices, known in Japan as Mikky≈ç (\\"Esoteric (or Mystery) Teaching\\"), which are similar in concept to those in Vajrayana Buddhism. The lineage for Shingon Buddhism differs from that of Tibetan Vajrayana, having emerged from India during the 9th-11th centuries in the Pala Dynasty and Central Asia (via China) and is based on earlier versions of the Indian texts than the Tibetan lineage. Shingon shares material with Tibetan Buddhism ‚Äì such as the esoteric sutras (called Tantras in Tibetan Buddhism) and mandalas ‚Äì but the actual practices are not related. The primary texts of Shingon Buddhism are the Mahavairocana Sutra and Vajrasekhara Sutra. The founder of Shingon Buddhism was Kukai, a Japanese monk who studied in China in the 9th century during the Tang dynasty and brought back Vajrayana scriptures, techniques and mandalas then popular in China. The school mostly died out or was merged into other schools in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty but flourished in Japan. Shingon is one of the few remaining branches of Buddhism in the world that continues to use the siddham script of the Sanskrit language. =Tendai Buddhism= Although the Tendai school in China and Japan does employ some esoteric practices, these rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the Lotus Sutra. By chanting mantras, maintaining mudras, or practicing certain forms of meditation, Tendai maintains that one is able to understand sense experiences as taught by the Buddha, have faith that one is innately an enlightened being, and that one can attain enlightenment within the current lifetime. =Shugend≈ç= Yamabushi priests at Gose, Nara. Shugend≈ç was founded in 7th-century Japan by the ascetic En no Gy≈çja, based on the Queen's Peacocks Sutra. With its origins in the solitary hijiri back in the 7th century, Shugend≈ç evolved as a sort of amalgamation between Esoteric Buddhism, Shinto and several other religious influences including Taoism. Buddhism and Shinto were amalgamated in the shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç, and K≈´kai's syncretic religion held wide sway up until the end of the Edo period, coexisting with Shinto elements within Shugend≈çMiyake, Hitoshi. Shugendo in History. pp45‚Äì52. In 1613 during the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued a regulation obliging Shugend≈ç temples to belong to either Shingon or Tendai temples. During the Meiji Restoration, when Shinto was declared an independent state religion separate from Buddhism, Shugend≈ç was banned as a superstition not fit for a new, enlightened Japan. Some Shugend≈ç temples converted themselves into various officially approved Shint≈ç denominations. In modern times, Shugend≈ç is practiced mainly by Tendai and Shingon sects, retaining an influence on modern Japanese religion and culture.ÂØÜÊïô„Å®‰øÆÈ®ìÈÅì Korean milgyo Esoteric Buddhist practices (known as milgyo, ÂØÜÊïô) and texts arrived in Korea during the initial introduction of Buddhism to the region in 372 CE.Georgieva-Russ, Nelly. Esoteric Buddhist Ritual Objects of the Kory≈è Dynasty (936-1392) Esoteric Buddhism was supported by the royalty of both Unified Silla (668-935) and Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392). During the Goryeo Dynasty esoteric practices were common within large sects like the Seon school, and the Hwaeom school as well as smaller esoteric sects like the Sinin (mudra) and Ch'ongji (Dharani) schools. During the era of the Mongol occupation (1251-1350s), Tibetan Buddhism also existed in Korea though it never gained a foothold there.S√∏rensen. Esoteric Buddhism under the Kory≈è in the Light of the Greater East Asian Tradition. International Journal of Buddhist Thought & Culture September 2006, Vol.7, pp. 55-94. During the Joseon dynasty, Esoteric Buddhist schools were forced to merge with the Son and Kyo schools, becoming the ritual specialists. With the decline of Buddhism in Korea, Esoteric Buddhism mostly died out, save for a few traces in the rituals of the Jogye Order and Taego Order. There are two Esoteric Buddhist schools in modern Korea: the Chin≈èn (ÁúûË®Ä) and the Jingak Order (Áúû Ë¶∫). According to Henrik H. S√∏rensen, \\"they have absolutely no historical link with the Korean Buddhist tradition per se but are late constructs based in large measures on Japanese Shingon Buddhism.\\"  Indo-Tibetan Buddhism  VajrayƒÅna Buddhism was initially established in Tibet in the 8th century when various figures like PadmasambhƒÅva (8th century CE) and ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita (725‚Äì788) were invited by King Trisong Detsen, some time before 767. Tibetan Buddhism reflects the later stages tantric Indian Buddhism of the post-Gupta Early Medieval period (500 to 1200 CE).Davidson, Ronald M (2004). Indian Esoteric Buddhism: Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 2. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. This tradition practices and studies a set of tantric texts and commentaries associated with the more \\"left hand,\\" (vamachara) tantras, which are not part of East Asian Esoteric Buddhism. These tantras (sometimes termed 'Anuttarayoga tantras' include many transgressive elements, such as sexual and mortuary symbolism that is not shared by the earlier tantras that are studied in East Asian Buddhism. These texts were translated into Classical Tibetan during the \\"New translation period\\" (10th-12th centuries). Tibetan Buddhism also includes numerous native Tibetan developments, such as the tulku system, new sadhana texts, Tibetan scholastic works, Dzogchen literature and Terma literature. There are four major traditions or schools: Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug. In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368), founded by Kublai Khan, which ruled China, Mongolia and parts of Siberia. In the modern era it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora (1959 onwards). The Tibetan Buddhist tradition is today found in Tibet, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, southwestern and northern China, Mongolia and various constituent republics of Russia that are adjacent to the area, such as Amur Oblast, Buryatia, Chita Oblast, the Tuva Republic and Khabarovsk Krai. Tibetan Buddhism is also the main religion in Kalmykia. It has also spread to Western countries and there are now international networks of Tibetan Buddhist temples and meditation centers in the Western world from all four schools. Nepalese Newar Buddhism Newar Buddhism is practiced by Newars in Nepal. It is the only form of Vajrayana Buddhism in which the scriptures are written in Sanskrit and this tradition has preserved many Vajrayana texts in this language. Its priests do not follow celibacy and are called vajracharya (literally \\"diamond- thunderbolt carriers\\").  Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism  A painting by G.B. Hooijer (c. 1916‚Äî1919) reconstructing the scene of Borobudur during its heyday Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism refers to the traditions of Esoteric Buddhism found in the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra before the rise and dominance of Islam in the region (13-16th centuries). The Buddhist empire of Srivijaya (650 CE‚Äì1377 CE) was a major center of Esoteric Buddhist learning which drew Chinese monks such as Yijing and Indian scholars like Ati≈õa.J. Takakusu (2005). A Record of the Buddhist Religion : As Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago (A.D. 671-695)/I-Tsing. New Delhi, AES. . The temple complex at Borobudur in central Java, built by the Shailendra dynasty also reflects strong Tantric or at least proto-tantric influences, particularly of the cult of Vairocana.Levenda, Peter. Tantric Temples: Eros and Magic in Java, page 99.Fontein, Jan. Entering the DharmadhƒÅtu: A Study of the Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism may have also reached the Philippines, possibly establishing the first form of Buddhism in the Philipines. The few Buddhist artifacts that have been found in the islands reflect the iconography of Srivijaya‚Äôs Vajrayana.Laszlo Legeza, \\"Tantric Elements in Pre-Hispanic Gold Art,\\" Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129-133. Southern Esoteric Buddhism \\"Southern Esoteric Buddhism\\" or BorƒÅn kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna ('ancient practices') is a term for esoteric forms of Buddhism from Southeast Asia, where Theravada Buddhism is dominant. The monks of the Sri Lankan, Abhayagiri vihara once practiced forms of tantra which were popular in the island.Cousins, L.S. (1997), \\"Aspects of Southern Esoteric Buddhism\\", in Peter Connolly and Sue Hamilton (eds.), Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakd Papers from the Annual Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Luzac Oriental, London: 185-207, 410. Another tradition of this type was Ari Buddhism, which was common in Burma. The Tantric Buddhist 'YogƒÅvacara' tradition was a major Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era.Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression Hong Kong: Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, This form of Buddhism declined after the rise of Southeast Asian Buddhist modernism. This form of esoteric Buddhism is unique in that it developed in Southeast Asia and has no direct connection to the Indian Tantric Movement of the Mahasiddhas and the tantric establishments of Nalanda and Vikramashila Universities. Thus, it does not make use of the classic Buddhist tantras and has its own independent literature and practice tradition. Academic study difficulties Serious Vajrayana academic study in the Western world is in early stages due to the following obstacles: # Although a large number of Tantric scriptures are extant, they have not been formally ordered or systematized. # Due to the esoteric initiatory nature of the tradition, many practitioners will not divulge information or sources of their information. # As with many different subjects, it must be studied in context and with a long history spanning many different cultures. # Ritual, as well as doctrine, need to be investigated. Buddhist tantric practice is categorized as secret practice; this is to avoid misinformed people from harmfully misusing the practices. A method to keep this secrecy is that tantric initiation is required from a master before any instructions can be received about the actual practice. During the initiation procedure in the highest class of tantra (such as the Kalachakra), students must take the tantric vows which commit them to such secrecy.Kalachakra Tantra taking initiation (accessed June 26, 2010) \\"Explaining general tantra theory in a scholarly manner, not sufficient for practice, is likewise not a root downfall. Nevertheless, it weakens the effectiveness of our tantric practice.\\" Dr Alex Berzin on Tantric Vows accessed June 20, 2016  Terminology  The terminology associated with Vajrayana Buddhism can be confusing. Most of the terms originated in the Sanskrit language of tantric Indian Buddhism and may have passed through other cultures, notably those of Japan and Tibet, before translation for the modern reader. Further complications arise as seemingly equivalent terms can have subtle variations in use and meaning according to context, the time and place of use. A third problem is that the Vajrayana texts employ the tantric tradition of twilight language, a means of instruction that is deliberately coded. These obscure teaching methods relying on symbolism as well as synonym, metaphor and word association add to the difficulties faced by those attempting to understand Vajrayana Buddhism: The term Tantric Buddhism was not one originally used by those who practiced it.

Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaud√≠'s original plans, drawings and plaster models, which led to 16 years of work to piece together the fragments of the master model. Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament. It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaud√≠'s death.\\"Video: See How La Sagrada Fam√≠lia Will Progress in 2015\\", metropolismag.com, 25 September 2014 (retrieved 2 October 2019) The basilica has a long history of splitting opinion among the residents of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with Barcelona's cathedral, over Gaud√≠'s design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaud√≠'s death disregarded his design, and the 2007 proposal to build a tunnel of Spain's high-speed rail link to France which could disturb its stability. Describing the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, art critic Rainer Zerbst said \\"it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art\\",Rainer Zerbst, Gaud√≠ ‚Äì a Life Devoted to Architecture., pp. 190‚Äì215 and Paul Goldberger describes it as \\"the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages\\". The basilica is not the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Barcelona, as that title belongs to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia. History Background Model of the complete design The Bas√≠lica de la Sagrada Fam√≠lia was the inspiration of a bookseller, Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of Asociaci√≥n Espiritual de Devotos de San Jos√© (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph). After a visit to the Vatican in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by the basilica at Loreto. The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, whose plan was for a Gothic revival church of a standard form. The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Antoni Gaud√≠ assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically. Gaudi began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884. Construction New stonework at the Sagrada Fam√≠lia is clearly visible against the stained and weathered older sections. On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaud√≠ is said to have remarked: \\"My client is not in a hurry.\\" When Gaud√≠ died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete. After Gaud√≠'s death, work continued under the direction of Dom√®nec Sugra√±es i Gras until interrupted by the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Parts of the unfinished basilica and Gaud√≠'s models and workshop were destroyed during the war by Catalan anarchists. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940, the architects Francesc Quintana, Isidre Puig Boada, Llu√≠s Bonet i Gari and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by Carles Bu√Øgas. The current director and son of Llu√≠s Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol, has been introducing computers into the design and construction process since the 1980s. Mark Burry of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by J. Busquets, Etsuro Sotoo and the controversial Josep Maria Subirachs decorate the fantastical fa√ßades. Barcelona-born Jordi Fauli took over as chief architect in 2012. The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the transept vaults and apse. , work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main steeple of Jesus Christ as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory fa√ßade. The church shares its site with the Sagrada Fam√≠lia Schools building, a school originally designed by Gaud√≠ in 1909 for the children of the construction workers. Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition. File:Baldomer Gili Roig.

Aerial photograph by Walter Mittelholzer, ETH- Bibliothek. Construction status Chief architect Jordi Fauli announced in October 2015 that construction is 70 percent complete and has entered its final phase of raising six immense steeples. The steeples and most of the church's structure are to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaud√≠'s death; as of a 2017 estimate, decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032. Visitor entrance fees of ‚Ç¨15 to ‚Ç¨20 finance the annual construction budget of ‚Ç¨25million. Computer-aided design technology has been used to accelerate construction of the building. Current technology allows stone to be shaped off-site by a CNC milling machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand. Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo at work in the gypsum workshop In 2008, some renowned Catalan architects advocated halting construction (English tr.) to respect Gaud√≠'s original designs, which although they were not exhaustive and were partially destroyed, have been partially reconstructed in recent years. In 2018, the stone type needed for the construction was found in a quarry in Brinscall, near Chorley, England. Recent history =AVE tunnel= Since 2013, AVE high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Fam√≠lia through a tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona. The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (Ministerio de Fomento) claimed the project posed no risk to the church. Sagrada Fam√≠lia engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia (Patronat de la Sagrada Fam√≠lia) and the neighborhood association AVE pel Litoral (AVE by the Coast) had led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success. In October 2010, the tunnel boring machine reached the church underground under the location of the building's principal fa√ßade. Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013. Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by Edilon Sedra in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations. No damage to the Sagrada Fam√≠lia has been reported to date. =Consecration= The main nave was covered and an organ installed in mid-2010, allowing the still-unfinished building to be used for religious services. (English tr) The church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 November 2010 in front of a congregation of 6,500 people. A further 50,000 people followed the consecration Mass from outside the basilica, where more than 100 bishops and 300 priests were on hand to offer Holy Communion. Starting on 9 July 2017, there is an international mass celebrated at the basilica on every Sunday and holy day of obligation, at 9 a.m, open to the public (until the church is full). Occasionally, Mass is celebrated at other times, where attendance requires an invitation. When masses are scheduled, instructions to obtain an invitation are posted on the basilica's website. In addition, visitors may pray in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament and Penitence. =Fire= On 19 April 2011, an arsonist started a small fire in the sacristy which forced the evacuation of tourists and construction workers. The sacristy was damaged, and the fire took 45 minutes to contain. =COVID-19 pandemic= On 11 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, construction was stopped and the basilica was closed. This is the first time the construction has been halted since the Spanish Civil War. The Gaud√≠ House Museum in Park G√ºell was also closed. The basilica reopened, initially to key workers, on 4 July 2020. Design The style of la Sagrada Fam√≠lia is variously likened to Spanish Late Gothic, Catalan Modernism or Art Nouveau. While the Sagrada Fam√≠lia falls within the Art Nouveau period, Nikolaus Pevsner points out that, along with Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, Gaud√≠ carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration. Plan While never intended to be a cathedral, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building. Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as Burgos Cathedral, Le√≥n Cathedral and Seville Cathedral. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an ambulatory with a chevet of seven apsidal chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament. Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or cloister which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the narthex of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaud√≠'s design or its deviations from traditional church architecture. There are no exact right angles to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design. Spires Gaud√≠'s original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the Twelve Apostles,Note: the two Apostles who are also Evangelists are left out and replaced by St. Paul and also St. Barnabas. the Virgin Mary, the four Evangelists and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Eight spires have been built , corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity fa√ßade and four apostles at the Passion fa√ßade. According to the 2005 \\"Works Report\\" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaud√≠ and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaud√≠ to be shorter than those of the evangelists. The spire height will follow Gaud√≠'s intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation. The Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull (Saint Luke), a winged man (Saint Matthew), an eagle (Saint John), and a winged lion (Saint Mark). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant cross; its total height () will be less than that of Montju√Øc hill in Barcelona, as Gaud√≠ believed that his creation should not surpass God's. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the Eucharist. Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaud√≠ performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple. However, only one bell is currently in place. The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Fam√≠lia the tallest church building in the world. Fa√ßades The Nativity fa√ßade The Church will have three grand fa√ßades: the Nativity fa√ßade to the East, the Passion fa√ßade to the West, and the Glory fa√ßade to the South (yet to be completed). The Nativity Fa√ßade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaud√≠ influence. The Passion fa√ßade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the Cross. These controversial designs are the work of Josep Maria Subirachs. The Glory fa√ßade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the Seven deadly sins and the Seven heavenly virtues. =Nativity Fa√ßade= Sculpture of the choir of angel children Constructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity fa√ßade was the first fa√ßade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaud√≠'s naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the fa√ßade, and are symbolic of change. The fa√ßade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four steeples complete the fa√ßade and are each dedicated to a Saint (Matthias, Barnabas, Jude the Apostle, and Simon the Zealot). Originally, Gaud√≠ intended for this fa√ßade to be polychromed, for each archivolt to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals. Gaud√≠ chose this fa√ßade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this fa√ßade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Fa√ßade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Fa√ßade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it. Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo. =Passion Fa√ßade= Passion fa√ßade of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia in 2018 In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Fa√ßade, the Passion Fa√ßade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the fa√ßade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaud√≠ for future architects and sculptors. The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by Josep Maria Subirachs, began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fa√ßade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaud√≠ intended for this fa√ßade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to \\"break\\" arcs and \\"cut\\" columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice. Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fa√ßade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble Sequoia trunks. Above there is a pyramidal pediment, made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle (James, Thomas, Philip, and Bartholomew) and, like the Nativity Fa√ßade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light. The scenes sculpted into the fa√ßade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an S form and reproduce the stations of the Cross (Via Crucis of Christ). The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the Last Supper, Kiss of Judas, Ecce homo, and the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes The Three Marys, Saint Longinus, Saint Veronica, and a hollow-face illusion of Christ on the Veil of Veronica. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the Resurrection of Christ can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the Ascension of Jesus. (English tr.) The fa√ßade contains a magic square based on the magic square in the 1514 print Melencolia I. The square is rotated and one number in each row and column is reduced by one so the rows and columns add up to 33 instead of the standard 34 for a 4x4 magic square. =Glory Fa√ßade= File:Sagradafamilia-model.jpgModel of the completed Temple; the Glory Fa√ßade is on the foreground.

The largest and most striking of the fa√ßades will be the Glory Fa√ßade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal fa√ßade and will offer access to the central nave. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while Hell is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this fa√ßade completed, Gaud√≠ made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were used as the basis for the development of the design for the fa√ßade. The completion of this fa√ßade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca. To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground. It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to gifts of the Holy Spirit. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the Seven Deadly Sins, and at the top, The Seven Virtues. *Gifts: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord. *Sins: greed, lust, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy. *Virtues: kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity. Eucharist Door of the Glory Facade showing, at bottom, the \\"A...G\\" for Antoni Gaud√≠ This facade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Fa√ßade a total seven doors representing the sacraments: *Baptism *Confirmation *Eucharist *Penance *Holy orders *Marriage *Unction of the sick In September 2008, the doors of the Glory fa√ßade, by Subirachs, were installed. Inscribed with the Lord's prayer, these central doors are inscribed with the words \\"Give us our daily bread\\" in fifty different languages. The handles of the door are the letters \\"A\\" and \\"G\\" that form the initials of Antoni Gaud√≠ within the phrase \\"lead us not into temptation\\". Interior File:Sagrada Fam√≠lia interior north east.jpgStanding in the transept and looking northeast (2011) File:Sagrada Familia nave roof detail.jpgDetail of the roof in the nave. Gaud√≠ designed the columns to mirror trees and branches.Zerb, p.30 File:Sagrada Familia March 2015-18a.jpg File:La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona, Spain - panoramio (2).jpg File:Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia,_Columns.jpg The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach while the side nave vaults reach . The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5metre (25 ft) grid. However, the columns of the apse, resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches . The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching . Gaud√≠ intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft. There are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below. The columns of the interior are a unique Gaud√≠ design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise). Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration. =Organ= In 2010 an organ was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard. To overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, Geometric details Alpha and Omega carving at Sagrada Fam√≠lia entrance The steeples on the Nativity fa√ßade are crowned with geometrically shaped tops that are reminiscent of Cubism (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of Art Nouveau, but Gaud√≠'s unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization. Gaud√≠ used hyperboloid structures in later designs of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia (more obviously after 1914). However, there are a few places on the nativity fa√ßade‚Äîa design not equated with Gaud√≠'s ruled-surface design‚Äîwhere the hyperboloid crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican, there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the \\"bishop's mitre\\" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures. The paper explores the assemblies of second order hyperbolic surfaces as they are used throughout the design composition of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia Church building. In his later designs, ruled surfaces are prominent in the nave's vaults and windows and the surfaces of the Passion fa√ßade. Symbolism Detail of a steeple of the Passion Fa√ßade decorated with the word Sanctus Themes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The steeples are decorated with words such as \\"Hosanna\\", \\"Excelsis\\", and \\"Sanctus\\"; the great doors of the Passion fa√ßade reproduce excerpts of the Passion of Jesus from the New Testament in various languages, mainly Catalan; and the Glory fa√ßade is to be decorated with the words from the Apostles' Creed, while its main door reproduce the entire Lord's Prayer in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of \\"Give us this day our daily bread\\" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Fa√ßade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory fa√ßade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion fa√ßade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse steeple bears Latin text of Hail Mary. All in all, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ. Areas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match. Burials *Josep Maria Bocabella *Antoni Gaud√≠ Appraisal The art historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaud√≠'s buildings as growing \\"like sugar loaves and anthills\\" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly \\"bad taste\\" but handled with vitality and \\"ruthless audacity\\".Nikolaus Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture, Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394‚Äì5 The building's design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaud√≠'s fellow architects were generally positive; Louis Sullivan greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Fam√≠lia as the \\"greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised in stone!\\" Walter Gropius praised the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, describing the building's walls as \\"a marvel of technical perfection\\". Time magazine called it \\"sensual, spiritual, whimsical, exuberant\\", However, author and critic George Orwell called it \\"one of the most hideous buildings in the world\\", Author James A. Michener called it \\"one of the strangest-looking serious buildings in the world\\" and British historian Gerald Brenan stated about the building \\"Not even in the European architecture of the period can one discover anything so vulgar or pretentious.\\" The building's distinctive silhouette has nevertheless become symbolic of Barcelona itself, drawing an estimated 3 million visitors annually. World Heritage status Together with six other Gaud√≠ buildings in Barcelona, part of la Sagrada Fam√≠lia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as testifying \\"to Gaud√≠'s exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology\\", \\"having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia\\" and \\"anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century\\". The inscription only includes the Crypt and the Nativity Fa√ßade. Visitor access Visitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity steeples. Entrance to either of the steeples requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the steeples to the bridge between the steeples. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.https://sagradafamilia.org/en/avis- legal Legal Disclaimer As of June 2017, online ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa ATM kiosks (part of CaixaBank) or online. During the peak season, May to October, reservation delays for entrance of up to a few days are not unusual.  International masses  The Archdiocese of Barcelona holds an international mass at the Basilica of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia every Sunday and on holy days of obligation. * Date and time: Every Sunday and on holy days of obligation at 9 am * There is no charge for attending mass but capacity is limited * Visitors are asked to dress appropriately and behave respectfully. Funding and building permit Construction on Sagrada Fam√≠lia is not supported by any government or official church sources. Private patrons funded the initial stages. Money from tickets purchased by tourists is now used to pay for the work, and private donations are accepted through the Friends of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia. The construction budget for 2009 was ‚Ç¨18 million. In October 2018, Sagrada Fam√≠lia trustees agreed to pay ‚Ç¨36 million in payments to the city authorities, to land a building permit after 136 years of construction. Most of the funds would be directed to improve the access between the church and the Barcelona Metro. The permit was issued by the city on 7 June 2019.

It is a type of proteinuria. Albumin is a major plasma protein (normally circulating in the blood); in healthy people, only trace amounts of it are present in urine, whereas larger amounts occur in the urine of patients with kidney disease. For a number of reasons, clinical terminology is changing to focus on albuminuria more than proteinuria. Signs and symptoms It is usually asymptomatic but whitish foam may appear in urine. Swelling of the ankles, hands, belly or face may occur if losses of albumin are significant and produce low serum protein levels (nephrotic syndrome). Causes The kidneys normally do not filter large molecules into the urine, so albuminuria can be an indicator of damage to the kidneys or excessive salt intake. It can also occur in patients with long-standing diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes. Recent international guidelines (KDIGO 2012) reclassified chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category, and albuminuria category (A1, A2, A3). Causes of albuminuria can be discriminated between by the amount of protein excreted. * The nephrotic syndrome usually results in the excretion of about 3.0 to 3.5 grams per 24 hours. * Nephritic syndrome results in far less albuminuria. * Microalbuminuria (between 30 and 300 mg/24h,Page 291 in: mg/l of urinePerson‚Äîmicroalbumin level (measured) at Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 01/03/2005 or Œºg/mg of creatinine ) can be a forerunner of diabetic nephropathy. The term albuminuria is now preferred in Nephrology since there is not a \\"small albumin\\" (microalbuminuria) or a \\"big albumin\\" (macroalbuminuria). A1 represents normal to mildly increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (<30 mg/g or < 3 mg/mmmol); A2 represents moderately increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (30‚Äì300 mg/g or 3‚Äì30 mg/mmmol, previously known as microalbuminuria); and A3 reflects severely increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio >300 mg/g or > 30 mg/mmol). Diagnosis The amount of protein being lost in the urine can be quantified by collecting the urine for 24 hours, measuring a sample of the pooled urine, and extrapolating to the volume collected. Also a urine dipstick test for proteinuria can give a rough estimate of albuminuria. This is because albumin is by far the dominant plasma protein, and bromophenol blue the agent used in the dipstick is specific to albumin.

The Palau G√ºell (, ) is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaud√≠ for the industrial tycoon Eusebi G√ºell, and was built between 1886 and 1888. It is situated on the Carrer Nou de la Rambla, in the El Raval neighborhood of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Works of Antoni Gaud√≠\\". The home is centered around the main room for entertaining high society guests. Guests entered the home in horse-drawn carriages through the front iron gates, which featured a parabolic arch and intricate patterns of forged ironwork resembling seaweed and in some parts a horsewhip. Animals could be taken down a ramp and kept in the livery stable in the basement where the servants resided, while the guests went up the stairs to the receiving room. The ornate walls and ceilings of the receiving room disguised small viewing windows high on the walls where the owners of the home could view their guests from the upper floor and get a \\"sneak peek\\" before greeting them, in case they needed to adjust their attire accordingly. The main party room has a high ceiling with small holes near the top where lanterns were hung at night from the outside to give the appearance of a starlit sky. In 2004, visits by the public were completely suspended due to renovations; some of the stone used in the original construction was weak and had cracked over the years causing structural problems within the building. It is currently completely open, with all restoration work completed in April 2011. It was used in Antonioni's film The Passenger as a backdrop for the first meeting between Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider.

He was born in Paris and trained at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and Atelier Fernand Cormon in Montmartre, Paris. His fellow Cormon students were his brother Jacques, Andr√©-√âdouard Marty, Charles Martin, Georges Lepape. Students at the workshop drew, painted and designed wallpaper, furniture and posters. Earlier, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, and Henri Matisse had studied and worked there. His older brother Jacques Brissaud was a portrait and genre painter and his uncle Maurice Boutet de Monvel illustrated the fables of La Fontaine, songbooks for children and a life of Joan of Arc. A first cousin was the celebrated artist and celebrity portrait painter Bernard Boutet de Monvel. Brissaud is known for his pochoir (stencil) prints for the fashion magazine Gazette du Bon Ton published by Lucien Vogel, Paris. Many of his illustrations are realistic leisure scenes of the well-to- do. They illustrate the designs of Paris fashion houses such as Jeanne Lanvin, Ch√©ruit, Worth, and Doucet. Brissaud's illustrations appeared in Vogue after it bought Bon Ton in 1925, as well as House & Garden and Fortune, and in books like Madame Bovary, Manon Lescaut, M√©moires de Saint-Simon, the autobiographical novels of Anatole France, Two gentlemen of Verona and many others. In 1907 he exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and the Salon d'Automne.

Encyclopedia Britannica On-Line edition, Jugendstil It was the German counterpart of Art Nouveau. The members of the movement were reacting against the historicism and neo-classicism of the official art and architecture academies. It took its name from the art journal Jugend, founded by the German artist Georg Hirth. It was especially active in the graphic arts and interior decoration. Its major centers of activity were Munich and Weimar and the Darmstadt Artists' Colony founded in Darmstadt in 1901. Important figures of the movement included the Swiss graphic artist Hermann Obrist, Otto Eckmann, and the Belgian architect and decorator Henry van de Velde. In its earlier years, the style was influenced by Belgian and French Art Nouveau mainly through van de Velde, who was among founders of the Belgian movement. It was also influenced by Japanese prints. In later years, it tended toward abstraction and more geometrical forms, and after 1910 began to be replaced by modernism. Encyclopedia Britannica On-Line edition, Jugendstil History The movement had its origins in Munich with the founding of an association of visual artists in 1892, which broke away from the more formal historical and academic styles of the Academy. Georg Hirth chose the name Munich Secession for the Association. Later, the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 and the Berlin Secession took their own names from the Munich group. The journal of the group, Jugend, begun in 1896, along with another Munich publication, Simplicissimus and Pan in Berlin, became the most visible showcases of the new style. The leading figures of this movement, including Peter Behrens, Bernhard Pankok, and Richard Riemerschmid, as well as the majority of the founding members of the Munich Secession, all provided illustrations to Jugend. In the beginning, the style was used primarily in illustrations and graphic arts. Jugendstil combined floral decoration and sinuous curves with more geometric lines, and soon was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often created original styles of typeface that worked harmoniously with the image, such as the Arnold B√∂cklin typeface created in 1904. Otto Eckmann was one of the most prominent German artists associated with both Jugend and Pan. His favourite animal was the swan, and so great was his influence that the swan came to serve as the symbol of the entire movement. Another prominent designer in the style was Richard Riemerschmid, who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco. The Swiss artist Hermann Obrist, living in Munich, made designs sinuous double curves, modeled after plants and flowers, which were a prominent motif of the early style. Joseph Maria Olbrich and the Darmstadt Artists' Colony  The Darmstadt Artists' Colony is a remarkable collection of Jugendstil buildings created beginning in 1899 by Ernest Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse and nephew of Queen Victoria, to promote both commerce and the arts. He brought together a group of designers to create his new community, including Peter Behrens, Hans Christiansen, and Joseph Maria Olbrich.Sembach, Art Nouveau (1991), pp. 141-163 The Colony architecture represented a complete break with the earlier floral style, and was much bolder in its design. Peter Behrens and several of the other architects built their own houses there, and designed every detail, from the doorknobs to the dishes.Sembach (1993) pp. 141-163 The most impressive building of the Colony is the Maison Ernst-Ludwig, named from the Grand Duke, which contained the workshops of the artists. It was designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich, with an entrance in the form of a three-quarter circle, flanked by two statues, Force and Beauty, by Ludwig Habich (1901).

Van de Velde had played an important role in the early Belgian Art Nouveau, building his own house and decorating it in Art Nouveau style, with the strong influence of the British Arts and Crafts Movement. He was a known in Germany for his work in Belgium and Paris, and began a new career in Dresden in 1897, with a display at the Dresden Exposition of decorative arts. His work became known in Germany through decorative arts journals, and he received several commissions for interiors in Berlin, for a villa in Chemnitz, the Folkwang Museum in Hagen, and the Nietzsche House in Weimar for Elisabeth F√∂rster- Nietzsche, the sister of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. He settled in Weimar in 1899 and produced a wide variety of decorative works, including silverware and ceramics, all in strikingly original forms. His silverware was particularly unusual: each piece had its own form, with sleek curving lines, but together they formed a harmonious ensemble. In 1902, he decorated the apartment of Count Harry Kessler, a prominent patron of the Impressionist painters.Sembach (1991), pg. 132-134 In 1905, with the patronage of the Grand Duke of Weimar, he created the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar. He created a showcase of applied arts for the Dresden Exposition of Applied Arts in 1906, decorated with paintings by Ludwig von Hofmann, intended as the main room of a new museum of decoration in Weimar. He transposed the characteristics of his silverware, dishes, and furniture into the architecture. Van de Velde left off the curling vegetal lines of Art Nouveau decoration and replaced them with much simpler, more stylized curves which were part of the structure of his buildings and decorative works.Sembach (1991), pg. 132-134 In 1907, van de Velde became director of the a new school of decorative arts in Weimar. His remake of Art Nouveau into a more functional and simplified style very different appeared in his door handles, his chairs, and the facades of his buildings. The ornament merged into the structure. The importance of Weimar as a cultural was broken in 1906, when its main patron, Count Harry Kessler, commissioned Rodin to make a nude statue for the Archduke. The Archduke was scandalized, and Kessler was forced to resign. The Weimar school of design lost its importance until 1919, when it returned as the Bauhaus under Walter Gropius, and played a major part in the emergence of modern architecture.Sembach (1991), pg. 139 File:Kunstpalast, Raum 6 Henry Van de Velde Zimmer, Foto Otto Renard, 1902.jpgInterior of Room 6 of the Arts Palace, D√ºsseldorf by Henry van de Velde (1902) File:Deep plate by Henry van de Velde, Meissen factory, 1903, porcelain with blue underglaze and gold decoration - Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt - Darmstadt, Germany - DSC00722.jpgPorcelain plate by Henry van de Velde for Meissen factory (1903) (Darmstandt Museum) File:Henry van de velde per theodor m√ºller, terrina (1905-06 ca.) e coltello da caviale (1903), argento, weimar.JPGSilver terrine by Henry van de Velde (1905‚Äì06)  Peter Behrens and the German Werkbund  The architect and designer Peter Behrens (1868‚Äì1940) was a key figure in the final years of the Jugendstil, and in the transition to modern architecture. Born in Hamburg, where he studied painting, Behrens moved to Munich in 1890 and worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder. In 1890, he was one of the founders of the Munich Secession. In 1899, he was invited to participate in the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, where he designed his own house and all of its contents, including the furniture, towels and dishes. After 1900 he became involved in industrial design and the reform of architecture to more functional forms. In 1902, he participated in the Turin International Exposition, one of the first major Europe-wide showcases of Art Nouveau. In 1907, Behrens and a group of other notable Jugendstil artists, including (Hermann Muthesius, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, and Fritz Schumacher, created the Deutscher Werkbund. Modeled after the Arts and Crafts movement in England, it was goal was to improve and modernize the design of industrial products and everyday objects. He first major project was AEG turbine factory in Berlin (1908‚Äì1909). Behren's assistants and students at this time included Mies van der Rohe, C.E. Jeanerette (the future Le Corbusier), and Walter Gropius, the future head of the Bauhaus. The work of Behrens and the Werkbund effectively launched the transition from the Jugendstil to modernism in Germany, and the end of the Jugendstil.Bony, L'Architecture Moderne (2012), pp. 55-57 File:MusikzimmerHausBehrensSchiedmayer.jpgMusic room of Behrens' house in Darmstadt (1902) File:AEG by Peter Behrens.jpgAEG Turbine Factory in Berlin, by Peter Behrens (1908‚Äì1909), Architecture and decoration In Berlin, August Endell was both editor of Pan magazine and a major figure in Jugendstil decoration, designing hotels and theaters, such as the interior of Buntes Theater in Berlin (1901), destroyed during World War II. He designed every detail of the interior down to the nails. with each room in a different color, and on a different theme. He also designed the Hackesche H√∂fe, a complex of buildings in the centre of Berlin, noted for the imaginative details of the decoration, in spirals and curling forms, File:K√∂penicker Stra√üe Buntes Theater 1901.jpgBuntes Theater, Berlin (1901) by August Endell File:200806 Berlin 485.JPGDecoration of the Hackesche H√∂fe in central Berlin by August Endell File:Berlin, Hackesche H√∂fe, Treppenhaus -- 2011 -- 4.jpgStairway decoration at Hackesche H√∂fe in Berlin by August Endell (1901) Posters and graphic arts The most prominent graphic artist was Otto Eckmann, who produced numerous illustrations for the movement's journal Jugend, in a sinuous, floral style that was similar to the French style. He also created a type style based upon Japanese calligraphy. Joseph Sattler was another graphic artist who contributed to the style through another artistic journal called Pan. Sattler designed a type face often used in Jugendstil. Another important German graphic artist was Josef Rudolf Witzel (1867‚Äì1925), who produced many early covers for Jugend, with curving, floral forms which helped shape the style. The magazine Simplicissimus, published in Munich, was also noted for its Jugendstil graphics, as well as for the modern writers it presented, including Thomas Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke. Important illustrators for the magazine included Thomas Theodor Heine. File:Joseph Sattler-PAN.jpgCover of Pan magazine by Joseph Sattler (1895) File:Bernhard Pankok - Jugend 24.

With this ideal in mind, they established their own workshops to produce furniture. August Endell, Theodor Fischer, Bruno Paul, and especially Richard Riemerschmid were important figures in Jugendstil furniture.

EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database by mapping database rows to Java or Objective-C objects. This largely relieves developers from writing low-level SQL code. EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT's object-oriented platform. Since Apple Inc's merger with NeXT in 1996, EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects, an application server also originally from NeXT. Many of the core concepts of EOF re-emerged as part of Core Data, which further abstracts the underlying data formats to allow it to be based on non-SQL stores.  History  In the early 1990s NeXT Computer recognized that connecting to databases was essential to most businesses and yet also potentially complex. Every data source has a different data-access language (or API), driving up the costs to learn and use each vendor's product. The NeXT engineers wanted to apply the advantages of object-oriented programming, by getting objects to \\"talk\\" to relational databases. As the two technologies are very different, the solution was to create an abstraction layer, insulating developers from writing the low-level procedural code (SQL) specific to each data source. The first attempt came in 1992 with the release of Database Kit (DBKit), which wrapped an object- oriented framework around any database. Unfortunately, NEXTSTEP at the time was not powerful enough and DBKit had serious design flaws. NeXT's second attempt came in 1994 with the Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF) version 1, a complete rewrite that was far more modular and OpenStep compatible. EOF 1.0 was the first product released by NeXT using the Foundation Kit and introduced autoreleased objects to the developer community. The development team at the time was only four people: Jack Greenfield, Rich Williamson, Linus Upson and Dan Willhite. EOF 2.0, released in late 1995, further refined the architecture, introducing the editing context. At that point, the development team consisted of Dan Willhite, Craig Federighi, Eric Noyau and Charly Kleissner. EOF achieved a modest level of popularity in the financial programming community in the mid-1990s, but it would come into its own with the emergence of the World Wide Web and the concept of web applications. It was clear that EOF could help companies plug their legacy databases into the Web without any rewriting of that data. With the addition of frameworks to do state management, load balancing and dynamic HTML generation, NeXT was able to launch the first object-oriented Web application server, WebObjects, in 1996, with EOF at its core. In 2000, Apple Inc. (which had merged with NeXT) officially dropped EOF as a standalone product, meaning that developers would be unable to use it to create desktop applications for the forthcoming Mac OS X. It would, however, continue to be an integral part of a major new release of WebObjects. WebObjects 5, released in 2001, was significant for the fact that its frameworks had been ported from their native Objective-C programming language to the Java language. Critics of this change argue that most of the power of EOF was a side effect of its Objective-C roots, and that EOF lost the beauty or simplicity it once had. Third-party tools, such as EOGenerator, help fill the deficiencies introduced by Java (mainly due to the loss of categories). The Objective-C code base was re-introduced with some modifications to desktop application developers as Core Data, part of Apple's Cocoa API, with the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. How EOF works Enterprise Objects provides tools and frameworks for object-relational mapping. The technology specializes in providing mechanisms to retrieve data from various data sources, such as relational databases via JDBC and JNDI directories, and mechanisms to commit data back to those data sources. These mechanisms are designed in a layered, abstract approach that allows developers to think about data retrieval and commitment at a higher level than a specific data source or data source vendor. Central to this mapping is a model file (an \\"EOModel\\") that you build with a visual tool -- either EOModeler, or the EOModeler plug-in to Xcode. The mapping works as follows: * Database tables are mapped to classes. * Database columns are mapped to class attributes. * Database rows are mapped to objects (or class instances). You can build data models based on existing data sources or you can build data models from scratch, which you then use to create data structures (tables, columns, joins) in a data source. The result is that database records can be transposed into Java objects. The advantage of using data models is that applications are isolated from the idiosyncrasies of the data sources they access. This separation of an application's business logic from database logic allows developers to change the database an application accesses without needing to change the application. EOF provides a level of database transparency not seen in other tools and allows the same model to be used to access different vendor databases and even allows relationships across different vendor databases without changing source code. Its power comes from exposing the underlying data sources as managed graphs of persistent objects. In simple terms, this means that it organizes the application's model layer into a set of defined in-memory data objects. It then tracks changes to these objects and can reverse those changes on demand, such as when a user performs an undo command. Then, when it is time to save changes to the application's data, it archives the objects to the underlying data sources. Using Inheritance In designing Enterprise Objects developers can leverage the object-oriented feature known as inheritance. A Customer object and an Employee object, for example, might both inherit certain characteristics from a more generic Person object, such as name, address, and phone number. While this kind of thinking is inherent in object-oriented design, relational databases have no explicit support for inheritance. However, using Enterprise Objects, you can build data models that reflect object hierarchies. That is, you can design database tables to support inheritance by also designing enterprise objects that map to multiple tables or particular views of a database table. What is an Enterprise Object (EO)?  An Enterprise Object is analogous to what is often known in object-oriented programming as a business object -- a class which models a physical or conceptual object in the business domain (e.g. a customer, an order, an item, etc.). What makes an EO different from other objects is that its instance data maps to a data store. Typically, an enterprise object contains key-value pairs that represent a row in a relational database. The key is basically the column name, and the value is what was in that row in the database. So it can be said that an EO's properties persist beyond the life of any particular running application. More precisely, an Enterprise Object is an instance of a class that implements the com.webobjects.eocontrol.EOEnterpriseObject interface. An Enterprise Object has a corresponding model (called an EOModel) that defines the mapping between the class's object model and the database schema. However, an enterprise object doesn't explicitly know about its model. This level of abstraction means that database vendors can be switched without it affecting the developer's code. This gives Enterprise Objects a high degree of reusability.  EOF and Core Data  Despite their common origins, the two technologies diverged, with each technology retaining a subset of the features of the original Objective-C code base, while adding some new features.  Features Supported Only by EOF  EOF supports custom SQL; shared editing contexts; nested editing contexts; and pre-fetching and batch faulting of relationships, all features of the original Objective-C implementation not supported by Core Data. Core Data also does not provide the equivalent of an EOModelGroup‚Äîthe NSManagedObjectModel class provides methods for merging models from existing models, and for retrieving merged models from bundles.  Features Supported Only by Core Data  Core Data supports fetched properties; multiple configurations within a managed object model; local stores; and store aggregation (the data for a given entity may be spread across multiple stores); customization and localization of property names and validation warnings; and the use of predicates for property validation. These features of the original Objective-C implementation are not supported by the Java implementation.

That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of separation of powers. Many countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing judges. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting life tenure or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide cases and make rulings according to the rule of law and judicial discretion, even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England. In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of judicial review. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional. Theory of judicial independence Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, by portraitist Daniel Huntington c. 1865. In The Federalist No. 78, published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: \\"The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution.\\" Importance Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents executive and legislative encroachment upon those rights.. It serves as a foundation for the rule of law and democracy. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the judiciary's affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.. The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference. The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.Constitution, Art. 93A, and the , ss. 71‚Äì80; and the , ss. 92‚Äì101. Disadvantages The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well. Also, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld. Economic basis Constitutional economics studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a market economy.Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009 In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges. Development of the concept National and international developments The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.S Shetreet, ‚ÄòThe Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges‚Äô (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332 This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence. A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the Act of Settlement 1701.See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial. The second phase was evident when England's concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu‚Äôs separation of powers doctrine,See Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans). and the Founding Fathers of the US Constitution used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution's Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.Article III of the US Constitution provides that ‚Äúthe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.‚Äù Other common law countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001). In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,UK Human Rights Act - 1998 as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the European Convention on Human Rights in British law through the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force in the UK in 2000.Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at <> (visited Mar 27, 2009). Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British Constitutional Reform Act 2005Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161‚Äì74 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55‚Äì68 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the Lord Chancellor, one of the country's oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294 The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the House of Lords; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard ‚Äì impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers.Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6 The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial Appellate Committee of the House of Lords from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the Supreme Court, and creating a Judicial Appointments Commission. The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113 Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in European Union law,See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, ‚ÄúThe Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.‚Äù in civil law countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada) International standards The International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montr√©al Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges. The justice system In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.Shimon Shetreet, Fundamental Values of the Justice System, 23 THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW 61-76, (2012). Australia There was a struggle to establish judicial independence in colonial Australia, [2013] 12 Macquarie Law Journal 21. but by 1901 it was entrenched in the Australian constitution, including the separation of judicial power such that the High Court of Australia held in 2004 that all courts capable of exercising federal judicial power must be, and must appear to be, independent and impartial.. Writing in 2007 Chief Justice of Australia Murray Gleeson stated that Australians largely took judicial independence for granted and the details were not matters of wide interest. No federal judge and only one supreme court judge has been removed for misconduct since 1901. Immunity from suit for judicial acts, security of tenure, and fixed remuneration are all established parts of judicial independence in Australia. The appointment of judges remains exclusively at the discretion of the executive which gives rise to concerns expressed that judicial appointments are political and made for political gain. Issues continue to arise in relation to dealing with judicial misconduct not warranting removal and incapacity of judges. In 2013 Chief Justice of NSW Tom Bathurst identified the way in which judicial and court performance was measured as one of the most substantial risks to the separation of powers in Australia. [2013] New South Wales Judicial Scholarship 39. Canada Canada has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its Constitution, awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the Constitution Act, 1867. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the Parliament of Canada (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in criminal law (but not civil law) by section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, although in the 1986 case Valente v. The Queen it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control. The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the Supreme Court of Canada in the Provincial Judges Reference found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission now recommend judicial salaries in Canada. There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.  Hong Kong  In Hong Kong, independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty registered with the United Nations, independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English common law, has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the Basic Law.\\"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\\"- Chapter 1, basiclaw.gov.HK, 17 March 2008.

Singapore  Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the Constitution of Singapore, statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the common law. To safeguard judicial independence, Singapore law lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of Supreme Court judges may be discussed in Parliament and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges. The Chief Justice and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President of Singapore acting on the advice of the Cabinet of Singapore. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy security of tenure up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis. United Kingdom England and Wales =History= During the middle ages, under the Norman monarchy of the Kingdom of England, the king and his Curia Regis held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the early modern period; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, Supreme Court of Canada, para. 305. Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The Stuart dynasty used this power frequently in order to overpower the Parliament of England. After the Stuarts were removed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King William III approved the Act of Settlement 1701, which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306. =Contemporary usage= Under the uncodified British Constitution, there are two important conventions which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of parliamentary privilege: that Members of Parliament are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts. Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 aims to increase diversity among the judiciary. The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \\"good order,\\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the Bar Council and the Law Society. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the Legal Services Board, composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the Legal Services Act 2007. This saw the establishment of the Solicitors Regulation Authority to regulate solicitors and the Bar Standards Board to regulate barristers. United States of America Federal courts Article III of the United States Constitution establishes the federal courts as part of the federal government. The Constitution provides that federal judges, including judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, are appointed by the President \\"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\\" Once appointed, federal judges: Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or impeachment and removal from office by Congress; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase \\"during good behavior\\" predates the Declaration of Independence. John Adams equated it with quamdiu se bene gesserint in a letter to the Boston Gazette published on 11 January 1773, a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1701 in England. The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the American Bar Association, whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee \\"Well Qualified,\\" \\"Qualified\\" or \\"Not Qualified.\\" State courts State courts deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both trial courts and appellate courts (including state supreme courts), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some states, judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a nonpartisan one), while in others they are appointed by the governor or state legislature. The 2000 case of Bush v. Gore, in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the George W. Bush then pending in the Florida Supreme Court, whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

Definition  The judiciary is the system of courts that interprets, defends and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary can also be thought of as the mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make statutory law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law, defends and applies it to the facts of each case. However, in some countries the judiciary does make common law. In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of judicial review. Courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm, such as primary legislation, the provisions of the constitution, treaties or international law. Judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus in common law countries creating the body of constitutional law.  History  This is a more general overview of the development of the judiciary and judicial systems over the course of history.  Roman judiciary  = Archaic Roman Law (650‚Äì264 BC) = The most important part was Ius Civile (Latin for \\"civil law\\"). This consisted of Mos Maiorum (Latin for \\"way of the ancestors\\") and Leges (Latin for \\"laws\\"). Mos Maiorum was the rules of conduct based on social norms created over the years by predecessors. In 451‚Äì449 BC, the Mos Maiorum was written down in the Twelve Tables.Crawford, M.H. 'Twelve Tables' in Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth, and Esther Eidinow (eds.) Oxford Classical Dictionary (4th ed.) Leges were rules set by the leaders, first the kings, later the popular assembly during the Republic. In these early years, the legal process consisted of two phases. The first phase, In Iure, was the judicial process. One would go to the head of the judicial system (at first the priests as law was part of religion) who would look at the applicable rules to the case. Parties in the case could be assisted by jurists. Then the second phase would start, the Apud Iudicem. The case would be put before the judges, which were normal Roman citizens in an uneven number. No experience was required as the applicable rules were already selected. They would merely have to judge the case. = Pre-classical Roman Law (264‚Äì27 BC) = The most important change in this period was the shift from priest to praetor as the head of the judicial system. The praetor would also make an edict in which he would declare new laws or principles for the year he was elected. This edict is also known as praetorian law. = Principate (27 BC‚Äì284 AD) = The Principate is the first part of the Roman Empire, which started with the reign of Augustus. This time period is also known as the \\"classical era of Roman Law\\" In this era, the praetor's edict was now known as edictum perpetuum, which were all the edicts collected in one edict by Hadrian. Also, a new judicial process came up: cognitio extraordinaria (Latin for \\"extraordinary process\\"). This came into being due to the largess of the empire. This process only had one phase, where the case was presented to a professional judge who was a representative of the emperor. Appeal was possible to the immediate superior. During this time period, legal experts started to come up. They studied the law and were advisors to the emperor. They also were allowed to give legal advise on behalf of the emperor. Corpus Iuris Civilis, 1607 = Dominate (284‚Äì565 AD) = This era is also known as the \\"post-classical era of roman law\\". The most important legal event during this era was the Codification by Justinianus: the Corpus Iuris Civilus. This contained all Roman Law. It was both a collection of the work of the legal experts and commentary on it, and a collection of new laws. The Corpus Iuris Civilus consisted of four parts: # Institutiones: This was an introduction and a summary of roman law. # Digesta/Pandectae: This was the collection of the edicts. # Codex: This contained all the laws of the emperors. # Novellae: This contained all new laws created.  Middle Ages  During the late Middle Ages, education started to grow. First education was limited to the monasteries and abbies, but expanded to cathedrals and schools in the city in the 11th century, eventually creating universities. The universities had five faculties: arts, medicine, theology, canon law and Ius Civile, or civil law. Canon law, or ecclesiastical law are laws created by the Pope, head of the Roman Catholic Church. The last form was also called secular law, or Roman law. It was mainly based on the Corpus Iuris Civilis, which had been rediscovered in 1070. Roman law was mainly used for \\"worldly\\" affairs, while canon law was used for questions related to the church. The period starting in the 11th century with the discovery of the Corpus Iuris Civilis is also called the Scholastics, which can be divided in the early and late scholastics. It is characterised with the renewed interest in the old texts. = Ius Civile =  Early scholastics (1070‚Äì1263)  The rediscovery of the Digesta from the Corpus Iuris Civilis led the university of Bologna to start teaching Roman law. Professors at the university were asked to research the Roman laws and advise the Emperor and the Pope with regards to the old laws. This led to the Glossators to start translating and recreating the Corpus Iuris Civilis and create literature around it: *Glossae: translations of the old Roman laws *Summae: summaries *Brocardica: short sentences that made the old laws easier to remember, a sort of mnemonic *Quaestio Disputata (sic et non): a dialectic method of seeking the argument and refute it. Accursius wrote the Glossa Ordinaria in 1263, ending the early scholastics.  Late scholastics (1263‚Äì1453)  The successors of the Glossators were the Post-Glossators or Commentators. They looked at a subject in a logical and systematic way by writing comments with the texts, treatises and consilia, which are advises given according to the old Roman law. = Canon Law = Gratian  Early Scholastics (1070‚Äì1234)  Canon law knows a few forms of laws: the canones, decisions made by Councils, and the decreta, decisions made by the Popes. The monk Gratian, one of the well-known decretists, started to organise all of the church law, which is now known as the Decretum Gratiani, or simply as Decretum. It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the Corpus Juris Canonici. It was used by canonists of the Roman Catholic Church until Pentecost (19 May) 1918, when a revised Code of Canon Law (Codex Iuris Canonici) promulgated by Pope Benedict XV on 27 May 1917 obtained legal force.  Late Scholastics (1234‚Äì1453)  The Decretalists, like the post-glossators for Ius Civile, started to write treatises, comments and advises with the texts. = Ius Commune = Around the 15th century a process of reception and acculturation started with both laws. The final product was known as Ius Commune. It was a combination of canon law, which represented the common norms and principles, and Roman law, which were the actual rules and terms. It meant the creation of more legal texts and books and a more systematic way of going through the legal process. In the new legal process, appeal was possible. The process would be partially inquisitorial, where the judge would actively investigate all the evidence before him, but also partially adversarial, where both parties are responsible for finding the evidence to convince the judge. Lady Justice (Latin: Justicia), symbol of the judiciary.Hamilton, Marci. God vs. the Gavel, p. 296 (Cambridge University Press 2005): \\"The symbol of the judicial system, seen in courtrooms throughout the United States, is blindfolded Lady Justice.\\"Fabri, Marco. The challenge of change for judicial systems, p, 137 (IOS Press 2000): \\"the judicial system is intended to be apolitical, its symbol being that of a blindfolded Lady Justice holding balanced scales.\\" Statue at Shelby County Courthouse, Memphis, Tennessee After the French Revolution, lawmakers stopped interpretation of law by judges, and the legislature was the only body permitted to interpret the law; this prohibition was later overturned by the Napoleonic Code.Cappelletti, Mauro et al. The Italian Legal System, p. 150 (Stanford University Press 1967). Functions of the judiciary in different law systems In common law jurisdictions, courts interpret law; this includes constitutions, statutes, and regulations. They also make law (but in a limited sense, limited to the facts of particular cases) based upon prior case law in areas where the legislature has not made law. For instance, the tort of negligence is not derived from statute law in most common law jurisdictions. The term common law refers to this kind of law. Common law decisions set precedent for all courts to follow. This is sometimes called stare decisis. In civil law jurisdictions, courts interpret the law, but are prohibited from creating law, and thus do not issue rulings more general than the actual case to be judged. In other words, they do not set precedent. Jurisprudence does not necessarily play a similar role to case law. Courts can decide if they follow jurisprudence in a given case or not. Country-specific functions In the United States court system, the Supreme Court is the final authority on the interpretation of the federal Constitution and all statutes and regulations created pursuant to it, as well as the constitutionality of the various state laws; in the US federal court system, federal cases are tried in trial courts, known as the US district courts, followed by appellate courts and then the Supreme Court. State courts, which try 98% of litigation,American Bar Association (2004). How the Legal System Works: The Structure of the Court System, State and Federal Courts . In ABA Family Legal Guide. may have different names and organization; trial courts may be called \\"courts of common plea\\", appellate courts \\"superior courts\\" or \\"commonwealth courts\\".The American Legal System . The judicial system, whether state or federal, begins with a court of first instance, is appealed to an appellate court, and then ends at the court of last resort.Public Services Department. In France, the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the Council of State for administrative cases, and the Court of Cassation for civil and criminal cases. In the People's Republic of China, the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the National People's Congress. Other countries such as Argentina have mixed systems that include lower courts, appeals courts, a cassation court (for criminal law) and a Supreme Court. In this system the Supreme Court is always the final authority, but criminal cases have four stages, one more than civil law does. On the court sits a total of nine justices. This number has been changed several times. Judicial systems by country  Japan  Japan's process for selecting judges is longer and more stringent than in various countries, like the United States and in Mexico. Assistant judges are appointed from those who have completed their training at the Legal Training and Research Institute located in Wako. Once appointed, assistant judges still may not qualify to sit alone until they have served for five years, and have been appointed by the Supreme Court of Japan. Judges require ten years of experience in practical affairs, as a public prosecutor or practicing attorney. In the Japanese judicial branch there is the Supreme Court, eight high courts, fifty district courts, fifty family courts, and 438 summary courts.  Mexico  Justices of the Mexican Supreme Court are appointed by the President of Mexico, and then are approved by the Mexican Senate to serve for a life term. Other justices are appointed by the Supreme Court and serve for six years. Federal courts consist of the 21 magistrates of the Supreme Court, 32 circuit tribunals and 98 district courts. The Supreme Court of Mexico is located in Mexico City. Supreme Court Judges must be of ages 35 to 65 and hold a law degree during the five years preceding their nomination.  United States  United States Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President of the United States and approved by the United States Senate. The Supreme Court justices serve for a life term or until retirement. The Supreme Court is located in Washington, D.C. The United States federal court system consists of 94 federal judicial districts. The 94 districts are then divided up into twelve regional circuits. The United States has five different types of courts that are considered subordinate to the Supreme Court: United States bankruptcy courts, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, United States Court of International Trade, United States courts of appeals, and United States district courts. Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch; immigration judges are employees of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, part of the United States Department of Justice in the executive branch.

As the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, it is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. It is named after the Malacca Sultanate that ruled over the archipelago between 1400 and 1511, the center of administration of which was located in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia.

History The Strait of Malacca as viewed from the city of Malacca, Malaysia. Pulau Besar is visible in the distance. Early traders from Arabia, Africa, Persia, and the Southern Indian kingdoms reached Kedah before arriving at Guangzhou. Kedah served as a western port on the Malay Peninsula. They traded glassware, camphor, cotton goods, brocades, ivory, sandalwood, perfume, and precious stones. These traders sailed to Kedah via the monsoon winds between June and November. They returned between December and May. Kedah provided accommodations, porters, small vessels, bamboo rafts, elephants, as well as tax collections for goods to be transported overland toward the eastern ports of the Malay Peninsula such as Langkasuka and Kelantan. After the Tenth Century, ships from China began to trade at these eastern trading posts and ports. Kedah and Funan were famous ports throughout the 6th century, before shipping began to utilize the Strait of Malacca itself as a trade route. In the 7th century the maritime empire of Srivijaya based on Palembang, Sumatra, rose to power, and its influence expanded to the Malay peninsula and Java. The empire gained effective control on two major choke points in maritime Southeast Asia; the Strait of Malacca and the Sunda Strait. By launching a series of conquests and raids on potential rival ports on both sides of the strait, Srivijaya ensured its economic and military domination in the region, which lasted for about 700 years. Srivijaya gained great benefits from the lucrative spice trade, e.g. the tributary trade system with China, and trade with Indian and Arab merchants. The Strait of Malacca became an important maritime trade route between India and China. The importance of the Strait of Malacca in global trade networks continued well into later centuries with the rise of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, the Johor Sultanate, and the rise of the modern city-state of Singapore. Since the 17th century, the strait has been the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Different major regional powers managed the straits during different historical periods. In the early 19th century, the Dutch and British empires drew an arbitrary boundary line in the strait and promised to hunt down pirates on their respective sides; that line went on to become today's border between Malaysia and Indonesia. The strait was already established as one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with Indonesia controlling the majority of the sea lane. Economic importance A ship sailing on the Strait of Malacca, as seen from Bukit Melawati in Kuala Selangor From an economic and strategic perspective, the Strait of Malacca is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. The strait is the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, linking major Asian economies such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Over 94,000 vesselsAljazeera.net pass through the strait each year (2008) making it the busiest strait in the world,Strait of Malacca - World Oil Transit Chokepoints , Energy Information Administration, U.S. Department of Energy carrying about 25% of the world's traded goods, including oil, Chinese manufactured products, coal, palm oil and Indonesian coffee.. A book review citing this information can be found at University of Toronto Quarterly, Volume 74, Number 1, Winter 2004/5, pp. 528-530 About a quarter of all oil carried by sea passes through the Strait, mainly from Persian Gulf suppliers to Asian markets. In 2007, an estimated 13.7 million barrels per day were transported through the strait, increasing to an estimated 15.2 million barrels per day in 2011. In addition, it is also one of the world's most congested shipping choke points because it narrows to only 2.8 km (1.5 nautical miles) wide at the Phillips Channel (close to the south of Singapore). The maximum size (specifically draught) of a vessel that can pass through the Strait is referred to as Malaccamax, that is, for some of the world's largest ships (mostly oil tankers), the Strait's minimum depth (25 metres or 82 feet) is not deep enough. This is determined by the relatively shallow Singapore Strait, which provides passage to the Karimata Strait in the east. The next closest passageway (the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java) is even more shallow and narrow. Therefore, ships exceeding the Malaccamax must detour a few thousand nautical miles and use the Lombok Strait, Makassar Strait, Sibutu Passage, and Mindoro Strait instead. Shipping hazards Piracy has been a problem in the strait. Piracy had been high in the 2000s, with additional increase after the events of September 11, 2001. After attacks rose again in the first half of 2004, regional navies stepped up their patrols of the area in July 2004\\\\. Subsequently, attacks on ships in the Strait of Malacca dropped, to 79 in 2005 and 50 in 2006.Piracy down 3rd year in row: IMB report , Journal of Commerce Online, January 23, 2007 Recent reports indicate that attacks have dropped to near-zero levels in recent years. There are 34 shipwrecks, some dating to the 1880s, in the local TSS channel (the channel for commercial ships under the global Traffic Separation Scheme). These pose a collision hazard in the narrow and shallow strait. On 20 August 2017, the United States Navy destroyer lost ten of its crew's lives in a collision with the merchant ship Alnic MC a short distance east of the strait whilst full steering capabilities had been lost and making a series of errors in attempted mitigation, its external lights being changed to \\"red over red\\" (\\"vessel not under command\\"). Yearly haze from the smoke of raging bush fires, limiting visibility. Another risk is the annual haze due to bush fires in Sumatra, Indonesia. It may reduce visibility to , forcing ships to slow down in the busy strait. The strait is frequently used by ships longer than . Proposals to relieve the strait Thailand has developed plans to divert much of the strait's traffic and hence some of its economic significance to a shorter route: the Thai government has, several times, proposed to cut a canal through the Isthmus of Kra, saving around from the journey between the two oceans. China has offered to cover the costs, according to a report leaked to The Washington Times in 2004. Nevertheless, and despite the support of several Thai politicians, the prohibitive financial and ecological costs suggest that such a canal will not be built. An alternative is to install a pipeline across the Isthmus of Kra to carry oil to ships waiting on the other side. Proponents calculate it would cut the cost of oil delivery to Asia by about $0.50/barrel ($3/m3). Myanmar has also made a similar pipeline proposal.
