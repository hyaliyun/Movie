The foundation works to achieve its goals by tourism, education, archaeological excavations and obtaining homes in the area to establish a Jewish presence. Background \\"Ir David\\" - or the City of David is the name given to a site beyond the southern edge of Jerusalem's Temple Mount and Old City, with the Tyropoeon Valley on its west, the Hinnom valley to the south, and the Kidron Valley on the east. Modern Jewish settlement on the ridge began in the City of David began in 1873-1874, when the Meyuchas family, a Jewish rabbinical and merchant family that had lived in Jerusalem since their expulsion from Spain, moved a short distance outside the city walls to a house in the area.Eliezer David Jaffe, Yemin Moshe:The Story of a Jerusalem Neighborhood, Praeger, 1988, p. 51. With the outbreak of 1936 riots Jews were advised by the British authorities to leave the area since they could not guarantee their safety.Shimi Friedman, 'Adversity in a Snowball Fight: Jewish Childhood in the Muslim village of Sillwan,' in Drew Chappell (ed.) Children under construction: critical essays on play as curriculum, Peter Lang Publishing 2010, pp.259-276, pp.260-261. The foundation was founded in 1986 by David Be‚Äôeri a former deputy commander of Duvdevan Unit, with the intention to purchase the former Meyuchas family home and other properties in the city. In 1986 they were granted the authority to work on behalf of the Jewish National Fund to reclaim land in the area. For a long time, Elad refused to provide the names of its funders and when they did they requested successfully that the names be kept under privilege.Ahdaf Soueif, \\"The dig dividing Jerusalem,\\" The Guardian (26 May 2010) [Retrieved: 29 May 2010] In 2016 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that the organization received 450 million shekels (US$115 million) in donations between 2006 and 2013. Most of the money came via corporations in international tax havens whose owners could not be identified. About half of Elad's income between 2003 and 2018, amounting to 348 million shekels, came from four companies registered in the Virgin Islands. Documents in the leaked FinCEN Files revealed in 2020 that at least three of the four companies are owned by Russian‚ÄìIsraeli billionaire Roman Abramovich. While the archaeological sites are clearly from at least the Second Temple Period, there is no clear evidence of the presence of King David or Solomon at the site. However, much of the narrative in Samuel and Kings I is consistent with the archaeologic discoveries, including the water shaft through which David's troops are described scaling when they entered the city and captured it from the Jebusites. Both names appear in the Book of Jeremiah (38:1). The two men were ministers in the court of King Zedekiah, the last king to rule in Jerusalem before the destruction of the First Temple. Activities Tourism Inside the Siloam tunnel 2010 To expand tourist activity, the foundation created a massive marketing campaign which led to a sharp increase in the number of visitors in recent years. In 2001 the foundation had only 25,000 visitors, but 250,000 in 2006 and 350,000 in 2007. In a program called \\"Ancient Jerusalem\\", they bring visitors to the three sites of Biblical Jerusalem, the City of David, Armon HaNetziv and the Mount of Olives. There were 450,000 visitors in 2011.http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=263430 Education Ir David invests considerable resources in education and strengthening ties to Jerusalem, and increasing the knowledge of and research of Ancient Jerusalem. In association with the IDF, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation and Yad Ben Zvi, the foundation gives day tours of Jerusalem to soldiers, with an emphasis on sites connected to Jewish heritage and Zionism. The association operates weekends and seminars on leadership and Zionism among the officers, held at various tourist sites in Ancient Jerusalem. The association also works in conjunction with Bnei Akiva, a religious Zionist youth movement, giving visitors educational tours. In 2001, the foundation established the Megalim Institute dedicated to expanding knowledge of Jerusalem in the fields of history, archaeology and the Bible. The Institute teaches academics both in Israel and internationally through courses, seminars and tours. Every year the Institute hosts the 'City of David Archaeological Conference', where excavators and researchers present the latest innovations in the study of Jerusalem. Megalim Institute also publishes various books and publications in areas relevant to historical research. Archaeological Excavations Ir David Foundation funds most of the archaeological excavations conducted in recent years in the City of David and the surrounding areas. All excavations are conducted by the Antiquities Authority, or with their approval. Among the many excavation sites the association found in 2005 the proposed Pool of Siloam 200 meters from another \\"Pool of Siloam\\" which was a fifth-century reconstruction and the road that connected the Spring to the Temple. The pool was used as Mikveh for ritual purification performed before visiting the Temple. In December 2008 excavations funded by the foundation found a large hoard of over 250 gold coins, dated to around the seventh century near the end of the Byzantine period. A clay seal bearing the name of Gedaliah son of Pashhur was also found. His name is explicitly mentioned in the bible (Book of Jeremiah (38:1)). The Foundation also funded excavation of a house the archaeologists suspect belonged to Helena of Adiabene, a fourth-century mansion, and an ancient water tunnel. Home Purchases Ir David purchases houses in Silwan and rents them to Jewish families. According to the foundation, some houses in Silwan were originally owned by Jews before the establishment of the state, representing the Jewish settlement of Kfar Shiloah, established for immigrants from Yemen in the late 19th century. With the outbreak of 1936 riots Jewish settlement in the city of David was eradicated, Jewish property looted, and the houses seized by Arabs, some of whom live in these homes today. As of 2009, 75 Jewish families live in properties owned by the Association. The Ir David foundation acquires property in the city of David and surroundings in one of four ways: * Locating assets belonging to Jews in the city of David and seeking legal action to return them to the original owner. * Buying properties declared absentee property. According to Haaretz, Elad took control of properties by making a very dubious use of the Israeli 'Absentees Property Law'Meron Rapoport ‚ÄúThe republic of Elad,‚Äù Haaretz (23-04-2006) [Retrieved 29-05-2010] * Persuading Arab residents to voluntarily sell their homes to Jews. * Construction of new neighbourhoods in the area also known as Israeli settlements. The foundation endeavours to buy up property from Muslims in the area, but the acquisition of houses is complex, since under Waqf law, Muslims are not permitted to sell their land to Jews, since according to Islamic jurisprudence the lands they dwell on belongs to Allah. Elad employs Muslim middle men as brokers to bypass the Waqf rules and to purchase the properties.Shimi Friedman, 'Adversity in a Snowball Fight,' p.261. In September 2014, Ir David Foundation aided residents moving into 25 apartments in Silwan, the largest acquisition in the foundation's history.Jews occupy once-Arab apartments The apartments were spread over seven different buildings, which were purchased by Ir David Foundation through a US shadow organization.You, American taxpayer, are helping to fund Israeli settlements Funding The largest single funder of the organization is Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and the companies he controls, which have donated $100 million. These donations came to light through a leak of bank documents known as the FinCEN Files that had been submitted to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.BBC News, September 2020, \\"Israeli Settlers' Chelsea Boss Backer\\"  Criticism   Critics on archaeology  In 1997 the organisation was sued by the Israeli state for damaging archaeological remains and for building on a historic site without a permit, and the Israel Antiquities Authority strongly recommended that the upkeep and control of the archaeological sites not be handed over to the organisation.Yigal Bronner, Archaeologists for hire, The Guardian, 1 May 2008 In 1998 a proposed contract to do this was annulled. However, in 2002 the contract was re-confirmed, this time without opposition from the IAA, and from that time the organisation has had responsibility for the preservation and maintenance of the City of David National Park. In 1999 unauthorized construction on the Temple Mount by the Waqf resulted in trucks fulls of dirt filled with archaeological artifacts being dumped. In 2005 the Ir David Foundation joined a Bar Ilan University and the National Parks Authority, Temple Mount Sifting Project, where volunteers and professionals recover these artifacts. Thousands of artifacts have been recovered including 5,000 ancient coins. In March 2017 the Temple Mount Sifting Project announced it stopped collaborating with the Ir David Foundation. The reason was not published. In 2011, a leading Israeli specialist on the archeology of Jerusalem, Dr. Eilat Mazar, who in the past collaborated with the Elad foundation, wrote a letter protesting the foundation's lack commitment to \\"scientific archeological work\\". In particular she expressed concerns over their intention to demolish a wall in a subterranean trench called \\"Jeremiah's Pit,\\" which she regards as part of a tourist gimmick. The Antiquities Authority replied that she was only trying to appropriate the site for herself. Elad countered that her contract forbids her from complaining about future excavations.Nir Hasson, ‚ÄòLeading archaeologist slams Elad excavation at Jerusalem's City of David,‚Äô in Haaretz 11 October 2011 Elad was blamed by Silwan residents when a channel dug for archaeological excavations partially collapsed in December 2011 near the village's mosque. The excavations were carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority and funded by Elad.  Critics on evictions  Critics accuse the foundation of methodically moving of Jerusalem to \\"Judaicize\\" the city. The foundation claims its actions are legal under Israeli law. In December 2011, joint activities between the Elad Association and the Jewish National Fund in Israel (JNF-KKL) led to Seth Morrison's resignation from the board of JNF-USA, the JNF's arm in the United States. Morrison resigned in protest at the decision by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF-KKL, to launch eviction proceedings against the Sumarin family, who lived in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In the case of the Sumarin family, the children of the original owner, Musa Sumarin, were declared absentees after his death even though there were other family members living in the home at the time. In 1991, the Israeli government took the step of transferring the property to the JNF subsidiary. The action on the Sumarin home, he added in a letter to The Jewish Daily Forward, \\"is not an isolated case. JNF has gained ownership of other Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and, in many instances, then transferred these properties through its subsidiaries to Elad, a settler organization whose purpose is to ‚ÄúJudaize‚Äù East Jerusalem\\". Under Israel‚Äôs controversial Absentee Property Law, the state may reclaim homes whose owners were not present in 1967, when Israel took control of East Jerusalem. Morrison asserted that the expulsion of the Sumarin family is a violation of human rights, and part of the systematic transfer of Palestinian property to ideological settlers who wish to put facts on the ground that hinder a lasting peace agreement. A campaign against the eviction was launched by T'ruah then known as Rabbis for Human Rights, and by the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement, and in the United Kingdom by the Jewish organization Yachad. The pressures led the JNF to delay the eviction.  Other criticism  Ir Amim and others petitioned the High Court in July 2010, to cancel an agreement between the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) and Elad because of secret transfer of authority to Elad, which would carry out a political agenda.Jillian Kestler-D'Amours, Israeli bill to give settler group authority in Silwan.

The patients buried in the cemetery were from the Infirmary Division, the William P. Seymour General Hospital, the T.B. Sanitarium and the Eloise Hospital (Psychiatric Division). In the United States at the dawn of the 20th century, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death, and that was true here. The majority of burials were from the Infirmary Division which was the largest of the three divisional housing up to 7,000 patients at a time. Most burials were of adult males, but there are women and a few infants and children. History The first notation made of an institutional cemetery was in 1892 when the Hospital arranged with Catholic Bishop John Samuel Foley to move bodies which had been buried northwest of the County House to an island in the middle of the reservoir. This move was made to enable the first paving of Michigan Avenue which occurred in 1910. Part of the artificial lake at that time had to be filled in. There were actually two other cemeteries that were used to bury Eloise patients after the turn of the century. The first was on the northeast corner of farmland south of Michigan Avenue and one further south on the farm site facing Henry Ruff Road. The second cemetery is surrounded by pine trees and is the one used from 1910 to 1948. In effect, this was operated as a \\"Potter's Field\\", that is a publicly run place to bury the poor unclaimed dead at the public expense. In the early days patients were buried by inmates or employees of the institution. In 1937 the contract was given to Charles C. Diggs, Sr., who founded \\"The House of Diggs\\" (reputed to be Michigan's largest funeral home at one time) and a politician, to handle burials in the cemetery and transfers to Wayne State University School of Medicine as state law mandated that these functions be handled or supervised by a licensed mortician. Charles Diggs, Jr., then 15 years old, would drive his mother from Detroit to the morgue which was a red brick building at Eloise called the round house because of its shape and they would prepare the body for burial. White sheets were used to line the wooden coffins and, unless the patient had clothing, they were covered in another white sheet. If family or friends were present there would be an interment service; if not the deceased would just be buried by inmates. About 7,100 people were buried in the Eloise cemetery between 1910 and 1948. These were patients who died at the institution and had no known relatives or relatives who were unwilling or unable to bury them. Only numbered blocks identify the graves. After 1948 all unclaimed bodies were sent to the Wayne State University College of Medicine and no further burials were made there. Burial records in the late 1920s and 1930s were especially problematical or nonexistent. For example, \\"There were only four extant death records for 1934.\\" The names of over 4,000 of the 7,100 people buried in the cemetery were added to Find A Grave. Patricia Ibbotson worked as a nurse at Eloise before it was closed. She is also the author of the book, Eloise: Poorhouse, Farm, Asylum and Hospital 1839-1984. She raised money for the historic marker.Clem 2007 Observer She also wrote Detroit's Hospitals, Healers and Helpers which has an entire chapter of captioned photos of Eloise. From the 19th century, the cemetery was a source of cadavers, after body snatching, which were used by medical students at the University of Michigan. From 1948, the laws were changed so that the hospital became a ready source and bodies were sent to Detroit Medical College. Present situation The cemetery is owned and maintained by Wayne County. It is fenced and there are \\"No Trespassing\\" signs posted. The graves are marked by numbered markers and the names of most of the people buried there have been lost to history. However, presently 5500 of the burials are now on FindAGrave. The site and the adjoining asylum are reputed to be haunted. The field lay forgotten and neglected, especially since the last burial (in one of the three plots) was in 1948; it now stands in the way of other uses, and is seen as a responsibility by Wayne County commissioners who are perplexed over use of the Eloise site. The presence of over 7,000 marked but unnamed graves and the absence of many supporting records is potentially an insuperable obstacle to any future development. Similar situations exist. In 1989, former, Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young abandoned a plan to expand Detroit City Airport's runway because the adjoining Gethsemane Cemetery blocked the way, and outraged relatives protested. As a result, a few years later Southwest Airlines ended its operations there, citing the city's inability to keep its promises and the need for longer runways to accommodate larger jet aircraft. Likewise, in the 1980s, the Hamtramck, Michigan Poletown plant was built around Beth Olem, a/k/a The Smith Street Cemetery, a small Jewish cemetery. According to Frank Rembisz, former Hamtramck city council president, to move the cemetery, they needed to get surviving relatives's permission, and would have had to retain \\"Talmudic scholars from Israel to sift through the earth to make sure there were no remains left.\\" General Motors decided the expense exceeded the benefit, and left it in place.

The law replaced the death penalty for the most serious crimes with life imprisonment and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. This makes New Mexico the fifteenth state in the U.S. to abolish capital punishment. Since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 (in the case of Gregg v. Georgia), only one person has been executed in New Mexico. This was Terry Clark, who was put to death in 2001, by lethal injection, for the murder of a child. The penalty was abolished by House Bill 2085,Full text of House Bill 2085 which was signed by Governor Bill Richardson on March 18, 2009 and came into force on July 1 of that year. Section 6 of the law states, \\"The provisions of this act apply to crimes committed on or after July 1, 2009\\". Fate of remaining offenders still on death row Because the legislation is not retroactive, it is still possible for convicts to be executed for crimes committed before July 1, 2009. For ten years after abolition, there were two men on death row in New Mexico whose crimes and trials took place before then: *Robert Ray Fry, bludgeoning and stabbing of a Shiprock woman in 2000 (he has also three other murder convictions). *Timothy Allen, for the kidnapping, rape, and murder by strangulation of a teenage girl in 1994 Both Allen and Fry filed petitions for writ of habeas corpus asserting that the death sentences in their cases are unconstitutional, both generally, and as applied to them individually. On June 28th, 2019, their death sentences were overturned by the New Mexico Supreme Court, which in a split decision ruled that their sentences were disproportionate to their crimes.https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new- mexico/articles/2019-06-28/new-mexico-vacates-last-remaining-death-sentences This effectively closes down New Mexico's death row unless another prisoner were to be tried, convicted and condemned for a homicide that occurred prior to 2009. Only one death penalty trial has taken place since 2009 for crimes that were committed beforehand, that of Michael Astorga, and because the jurors in that case were unable to agree on a death sentence, he received life imprisonment. Governor Martinez seeks reinstatement Republican Governor Susana Martinez announced on August 17, 2016, that she will introduce legislation to reinstate the death penalty in the 2017 legislative session. On October 14, 2016, the New Mexico House of Representatives approved the bill on a 36-30 vote. The bill provided the death penalty for only three kinds of murder: child murder, murder of an on-duty police officer, and murder of a prison employee by an inmate.

The largest trade organization in Washington State, BIAW's membership comprises about 8,000 member companies, home builders, trade contractors, suppliers and industry professionals.  Background  BIAW is the 3rd largest state association affiliated with the National Association of Home Builders. The Building Industry Association of Washington is the voice of the housing industry in the state of Washington. The association is dedicated to ensuring and enhancing the vitality of the building industry for the benefit of its members and the housing needs of the citizens. To accomplish this purpose, the association's primary focus is to educate, influence and affect the legislative, regulatory, judicial and executive agencies of Washington's government. The Building Industry Association of Washington will offer its membership those services which can best be provided on a statewide basis and will disseminate information concerning the building industry to all association members and the public.

Their largest program, ROII Select: https://biaw.com/ROII, a Department of Labor and Industries' Retrospective Rating Program, known as Return on Industrial Insurance Program or Retro. Through Retro, participating employers can recover a portion of their workers' compensation premiums if they are able to reduce injury rates and lower associated claim costs. Of the 40-some Retro programs in the state, BIAW has the largest. Additional program offerings from BIAW and BIAW MSC include: Education: https://biaw.com/Education Health Insurance: https://biaw.com/Health_Insurance Legal: https://biaw.com/Legal Codes & Regulations: https://biaw.com/Codes Building Industry Insurance Program:https://biaw.com/BiiP  Campaign Financing  The BIAW uses PACs to fund various campaigns. BIAW has several PACs including the Washington Affordable Housing Council, \\"It's Time for a Change\\" and \\"Walking for Washington\\". The same legal contact information appears for all BIAW PACs. BIAW‚Äôs political action committee, the Washington Affordable Housing Council (WAHC) plays an active role in Washington state elections: investing time, energy, and money into promoting pro-business and pro-housing candidates. Electing supportive state officials is imperative to the building industry and the continued economic growth of our state. The BIAW has given funds to its local affiliates including the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties, and the Home Builders Association of Kitsap County.  Legal challenges  In 2008 a letter to Attorney General Rob McKenna and three county prosecutors accused the BIAW of amassing $3.5 million in an illegal secret fund for its campaign to defeat Democratic Gov. Christine Gregoire. It also claims that the builders associations failed to properly register as \\"political committees\\" or report where the money is coming from. The accusation comes from a group led by two former Democratic state Supreme Court justices Faith Ireland and Robert Utter. The group said it would sue if the government attorneys do not take action against the BIAW and two local builders associations. AG McKenna filed suit against the Building Industry Association of Washington‚Äôs Member Services Corporation (BIAW-MSC) for violating the state‚Äôs campaign finance disclosure law, which was settled September 24, 2010. Under the terms of the settlement filed in Thurston County Superior Court today, the BIAW-MSC was fined $584,000. The settlement requires BIAW-MSC to pay $242,000 in fines and an additional $50,000 in attorney fees within 30 days. As is common in these types of cases, the remaining $342,000 was suspended. BIAW MSC would have had to immediately owe the suspended amount if it is found to have committed any new campaign law violations between now and Dec. 31, 2016, which did not occur. BIAW MSC has paid its fines and the matter is settled.  Legislative and political agenda  BIAW Government Affairs exists to defend affordable housing for the citizens of Washington state. BIAW‚Äôs highly qualified staff and experienced team of lobbyists work on behalf of members to pass pro-housing and pro-business legislation, as well as defeat regulations harmful to the housing industry. BIAW works year-round to engage in relevant builder activities and provide regular participation in rule making and agency task forces. Through our grassroots alliance, BIAW has access to timely information and resources to help us be more successful advocates for our members. BIAW publishes a biennial ‚ÄúHow They Voted‚Äù guide, a voting record of each legislator‚Äôs support for, or opposition to, issues important to the building industry. The guide is distributed to every BIAW member, making it a valuable resource in determining how their elected officials performed on housing.

He founded his first company, internet software firm Orchestream, at the age of 21. His latest venture, CognitionX, was co-founded with Tabitha Goldstaub in 2015. The company's mission is to build the most trusted source of personalised advice on artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. It held its first annual AI conference, CogX, in June 2017, to explore the impact of AI. The conference's second installment takes place during London Tech Week in June 2018, at Tobacco Dock in Wapping, East London with SoftBank Investment Advisers as its headline sponsor.  Early life and education  Muirhead was born in London, England and educated at Bedales School in Hampshire. At the age of 18, Muirhead handled his first management buyout of a musical-equipment rental business. At 19 he enrolled at the Imperial College London to study computer science.  Founded companies   CognitionX  Charlie Muirhead and Tabitha Goldstaub founded CognitionX in 2015, after identifying the need for greater clarity in the ‚Äúfast-paced‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasingly fragmented‚Äù area of artificial intelligence. The company launched with the stated goal of creating a \\"well-organised knowledge base... about everything going on in AI, in one place‚Äù. CognitionX is building a proprietary software platform, the Knowledge Network, powered by augmented intelligence. In March 2018 CognitionX was commissioned by the Mayor of London to carry out a census of AI innovation in the capital. The free, public version of the Knowledge Network empowers users to immediately access a global network of AI experts, on-demand, while the Enterprise edition also enables large firms to capitalise on internal expertise. In addition, the company issues a daily AI newsletter, authored by Tabitha Goldstaub, which has over 11,000 subscribers. CognitionX also produces bespoke research projects and has held over 60 meetups since June 2015 on topics ranging from HRTech to the future of chatbots In 2018, CognitionX was commissioned by the Mayor of London's Office to write a report analysing the AI ecosystem in London. The final report, which looks at London's unique strengths as a global hub of AI, found that London was the AI capital of Europe; highlights include the fact that London hosts over 750 AI suppliers. In June 2017, CognitionX hosted the inaugural CogX, a two-day ‚ÄòInnovation Exchange‚Äô for 1,500 delegates discussing how AI will shape the future of society. CogX 2018 saw 6,500 attendees and over 370 speakers at Tobacco Dock. CogX 2019, held in the King's Cross area of London, was home to over 10,000 attendees and over 600 speakers.  Orchestream  In 1996, while at university, Muirhead founded the company Orchestream, which allowed web users to prioritise their data on the Internet. In the two decades since, Muirhead has set up a total eight of startups, including NexAgent, iGabriel, InterProvider, t5m, and Brave Bison (formerly known as Rightster). He left Imperial early to work on the company full-time, though he received a note from the university stating that he could return if his business idea fell through. By 1999 Orchestream was worth ¬£1 billion and was listed on the NASDAQ. Muirhead stepped down from his position as CEO in 2000, though maintained a position as non-executive director with the company.  NexAgent, iGabriel, and InterProvider  In July 2000 Muirhead founded the data communications company Nexagent, which secured ¬£10.3m in its first round of funding. Muirhead served as President and CEO of the company until 2003, when he relinquished his role as CEO, but retained his role as President of the company. Muirhead also founded iGabriel.net‚Äîan Internet incubator fund that invested in start-up web companies. According to The Daily Telegraph, \\"Unlike other incubators, iGabriel only accepts funds from individuals, and mainly from people in the technology or media industries who can help develop the companies in which the fund invests.\\" iGabriel.net would eventually merge with Pi-Capital. In 2001 Muirhead founded the company InterProvider. InterProvider supplied proprietary software and serviced interconnections to telecom operators, and Time Magazine featured Muirhead as an up-and-coming entrepreneur in its coverage of the company's founding.  t5m  In 2007 Muirhead founded the company t5m, standing for \\"the 5th medium\\". The website is an online television network that features interviews with prominent individuals talking about socially conscious issues. Early offerings included an exclusive channel run by Nelson Mandela's charity 46664, which partnered with t5m for World AIDS Day. The company relaunched in 2008 to syndicate original content clips between 3 and 5 minutes long, and distribute its own proprietary video-player. t5m combines the traditional television format of network-owned syndication alongside programs with production company-owned rights. The company also produced the television show Trinny and Susannah ‚Äì What They Did Next.  Rightster / Brave Bison  In 2011 Muirhead co- founded Rightster with Tabitha Goldstaub, a software company that automates the end-to-end lifecycle for content owners, publishers, and marketers of digital video content including distribution, marketing, and monetisation of the content. Content partners for the company came from a broad range of industries, from London Fashion Week to ITN Productions and The Guardian newspaper. The company provided rights management through a cloud-based platform in addition to live streaming, audience development and YouTube/Facebook management services. Events that have streamed on Rightster have included the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton and the Leveson Inquiry. By March 2012, monthly video views of Rightster's clients grew from approximately one million views per month to 100 million views per month. Its staff also quadrupled during that time, and has offices in London, New York City, and Delhi. On 10 May 2016, it was announced that the company was relaunching under the name Brave Bison.

History  Antonio Galanti started the Galanti accordion factory with his three sons in the small village of Mondaino Italy. Galanti earned his living by traveling throughout Italy showcasing his Merry-Go-Round, while continuing to develop the first Galanti accordion in 1890. The first Galanti accordions saw production in 1917. It was not until 1920 when a significant number of Italians had immigrated to the United States that the Galanti Brothers saw an opportunity to grow and expand the company and started exporting the Galanti brand to New York City. Ahlborn Galanti started making classical organs during the late 1970s and subsequently founded the General Music or GEM. Similarly Marcello Galanti founded Intercontinental Electronics, later known as Viscount International to design and manufacture electronic organs after leaving his brothers in 1969.  Acclaim  Galanti produced a successful line of accordions, with its Super Dominator model leading the way in overall quality. An advertisement for the Super Dominator read, \\"This sensitive musical instrument will outperform any other comparable accordion. It is the supreme achievement of the Galanti artisans... the culmination of a half-century of musical craftsmanship.\\" Chris Saccheri of www.letspolka.com writes, \\"This was an excellent accordion and one of the world's best during its time.\\" Galanti guitars were also recognized for their craftsmenship and used widely by professionals at the time in Italy.  The Rock Era  In the 1950s, rock and roll emerged as the dominant force in music, and the accordion's popularity saw a dramatic decline. Like many instrument makers, Galanti responded to this cultural change by adding electric guitars and keyboards to its product line.

Education  He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College in Berkshire. Military career Joining the Scots Guards, he was wounded by a German bullet while going 'over the top' in France. He reached the rank of lieutenant in the First World War. As a subaltern in the Scots Guards he fought in France until wounded by a bullet through the palm of one hand. Gangrene impeded swift healing, but at last he was ready to return to the front and confided in a friend that if he had to die for it, he would try to win a decoration for gallantry in action to make his father proud of him. But instead of being sent overseas he was shunted into a 'cushy' job at the War Office. During the Second World War he served in France as a captain in the Scots Guards and as ADC to the General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication before being evacuated from St Nazaire. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the newly formed 74th (City of Glasgow) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, in the Territorial Army on 11 January 1939, and held the position until 1944.Monthly Army List.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 100th Edn, London, 1953. Inverclyde was on board the RMS Lancastria when she was sunk off St Nazaire on 17 June 1940. He was rescued by the crew of HMT Cambridgeshire, a 443-ton anti-submarine trawler, which had been requisitioned by the navy in August 1939; she was then given a 4-inch gun, machine guns and depth charges, she herself surviving the war and, after returning to peacetime trawling in 1945 as the Kingstone Sapphire, was scrapped in 1954. After returning to England, Inverclyde presented each of his rescuers with a round rosewood box full of cigarettes, each box with an engraved silver plaque, each individually named and then given the wording \\"... HMS Cambridgeshire, St Nazaire to Plymouth, 17 to 19 June 1940, from a grateful passenger, Inverclyde/Scots Guards\\". Arms of Lord Inverclyde Burns succeeded as Lord Inverclyde on the death of his father on 16 August 1919, and was invested as a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John and admitted to the Royal Company of Archers. Post-military career Not having inherited any business acumen from his immediate forebears he eschewed the idea of taking an active role in the running of the Cunard Steamship Company and preferred instead the pleasant job of aide-de-camp to the Governor of Gibraltar, 1920‚Äì21. Inverclyde became a lieutenant in the Reserve of Officers, and in 1922 was Assistant Private Secretary, in an unpaid capacity, to the Secretary of State for Scotland. After leaving his regiment he retired into private life as master of Wemyss and man-about-town with a bachelor flat in Mayfair. He acquired hunters, a yacht and a grouse moor. During the winter he rode with the Eglinton in Ayrshire; in the early summer months he cruised the Mediterranean; in the late summer and early autumn he shot grouse. His civic duties were not obligatory and, according to his second wife, June, he never took more than cursory interest in local matters. He did, however, endow two public buildings which remain in use: the Inverclyde National Sports Training Centre at Largs and the Inverclyde Centre in Greenock as a British Sailors Society home, now used by the local authority's homeless persons unit. He was chairman of the British Sailors' Society in Scotland for 18 years. He was awarded Commandeur L√©gion d'honneur, La Medaille de la Reconnaissance, La M√©daille de la Ville de Nancy, honorary citizenship of the towns of Brest and Veulettes-sur-Mer and an honorary doctorate of the University of Dijon. He was president of the Franco-Scottish Society (1949‚Äì54), chairman of Friends of France Council for Glasgow and West of Scotland (1942‚Äì57) and an honorary member of the Association of Fran√ßaise Libres. Personal life He married, firstly, Olive Sylvia Sainsbury, daughter of Arthur Sainsbury, millionaire owner of the J Sainsbury chain of grocery shops, on 23 November 1926. They divorced in Scotland in 1928. She went on to marry the racehorse trainer Captain James Townsend Pearce. Secondly he married June Howard-Tripp, daughter of Walter Howard-Tripp, on 21 March 1929. As simply 'June', she had been a well established star of revue and silent films, but gave up her showbusiness career on marriage, although this too was to end in divorce, in 1933. Death Inverclyde died on 17 June 1957, at the age of 59, without issue, the title becoming extinct on his death. The name Inverclyde was however resurrected in the early 1970s for the new local authority district centred on Greenock, a creation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The local newspaper, the Greenock Telegraph, said that the name \\"would in a way be a tribute to a man whose interest in the area was always constant\\".Greenock Telegraph editorial, 5 July 1973 Inverclyde remains as a Scottish council area. Publications Inverclyde published a memoir of two cruises: on the steam yacht the Sapphire, which belonged to the mother of his friend Huttleston Broughton, to India and Malaya in 1924/5, and on his own steam yacht the Beryl around the Mediterranean in 1929. Entitled Porpoises and People, it was published in 1930. Although in part dedicated to his wife ('Topsy' in the book), in her own memoirs, June states that Burns never told her or anyone else he was writing it.

It was a spacecraft, which was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and was used to study radiation and conduct optical observations of the atmosphere of the Earth. It was equipped with eight telescopes, including one for ultraviolet astronomy. It was primarily used to study the Sun, although several other X-ray emissions were detected. A Kosmos-2I 63SM carrier rocket was used to launch Kosmos 215 into low Earth orbit. The launch took place from Site 86/4 at Kapustin Yar. It occurred at 22:29:52 GMT on 18 April 1968, and resulted in the successfully insertion of the satellite into orbit. Upon reaching orbit, the satellite was assigned its Kosmos designation, and received the International Designator 1968-033A. The North American Air Defense Command assigned it the catalogue number 03205. Kosmos 215 performed ultraviolet photometry of 36 A and B stars from parallel telescopes and two UV photometers with maximum responses at 274.0 and 227.5 nanometres.

M. Chaudhry, was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and a professor of particle physics at the Government College University. His teaching and instructions on modern physics influenced many of his student to pursue career in physics who regard him as one of the key architects of having been the pioneer of experimental nuclear physics research in Pakistan and, along with Abdus Salam and Ishrat Hussain Usmani, one of the main creators of Pakistan's nuclear weapons research program in the 1970s. Chaudhry, who served as professor of nuclear physics at Government College University, was later referred to by Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, one of his students, as \\"the true father of the nuclear weapons program of Pakistan \\".A.Q. Khan and Samar Mubarakmand ‚Äì Krepon ‚Äì Arms Control Wonk Early life and education Chaudhry was born in 1903 to a middle class Rajput family(Rao) in Kahnaur, a small village in Rohtak district of Eastern Punjab. He passed the university entrance exam with highest marks and earned a scholarship awarded by the Viceroy Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading. He used the scholarship to enroll as a student of chemical engineering at Aligarh University in 1923, but after taking an engineering physics course, he decided to change his focus to thermodynamics and multivariable calculus. He was successful as a physics student, earning the respect of his peers and professors. In 1927, Chaudhry took his BSc in Experimental physics, followed by his 1929 MSc in physics with First Class Honours. The same year, Chaudhry gained attention from Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal of princely state of Bhopal, who awarded him a science scholarship for higher studies. Under that scholarship, Chaudhry travelled to United Kingdom to study for his doctoral degree. Chaudhry joined the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. At Cambridge, Chaudhry studied Calculus of mathematical Integrals, and learned Tensor calculus, quantum physics, and general relativity under Nobel laureate in Chemistry Ernest Rutherford. At Cavendish, he studied with Mark Oliphant, who particularly influenced him to study nuclear physics. Chaudhry and Oliphant carried out research in artificial disintegration of the atomic nucleus and positive ions. In 1933, Chaudhry earned his D.Phil in Nuclear physics under Ernest Rutherford. He then returned to the British India. Professorship in Europe At age 30, Chaudhry moved to Lahore and took an academic professorship in physics at the Lahore Islamia College. In 1935, he became Chairman of Department of Physics there, remaining in that position until 1938. In 1938, Chaudhry moved back to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to teach physics, again becoming head of his department. In 1944, Chaudhry was contacted by Mark Oliphant, who offered him an opportunity to return to the Cavendish Laboratory. In response, Chaudhry moved to United Kingdom, where he joined Oxford University's Nuffield College and was appointed a Nuffield Fellow. Along with Oliphant and Homi J. Bhabha, Chaudhry created a group of physicists that did research in theories of Gamma and Beta decay, as well as researching the neutrino‚Äîpostulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930‚ÄîCompton scattering, and the behaviour of slow neutrons during the atomic bombardment process. On the recommendation of Oliphant, Chaudhry joined Atomic Energy Research Establishment to continue research in nuclear physics. There, he established a laboratory to conduct research in nuclear power plants. He applied his research work to the behaviour of slow neutrons in research nuclear reactors and set about identifying the heavier particles emitted by alpha decay and alpha decay's extension to the Cluster decay. Return to India In 1948, months after the independence of Pakistan, while in Great Britain, he was contacted by Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru offered him a senior position at the Physics Laboratory of India. Chaudhry consulted mentor Mark Oliphant about the offer, and Oliphant wrote letters to Founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Governor-General. The letter encouraged Jinnah to engage his country in research in nuclear technology, particularly nuclear physics. According to Oliphant, no other Muslim scientist was available in the South Asia except Dr. Chaudhary who could prove useful for the newly born country in the field of Nuclear Technology. However, Nehru came to know of this development, and personally offered him a position of \\"Deputy Directorship\\" of Physics Laboratory of India. While Chaudhry was considering the offers, Jinnah sent him a letter where Jinnah had personally requested him to come to Pakistan, and join Government College University. Despite a personal phone call from Nehru urging him to come to India, Chaudhry chose the Pakistani position. In 1948, Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry migrated to Pakistan and joined Government College University as head of the Physics Department and a professor of nuclear physics. Pakistan Following his settlement in Pakistan, the Government of Pakistan asked him to engage research in physics at the Government College University. In 1952, Chaudhry established the \\"High Tension Laboratory\\" (now \\"Centre for Advanced Studies in Physics\\") as an offshoot of the Physics Department at Government College.Ashok Kapur, \\"1953‚Äì59: The Origins and Early History of Pakistani Nuclear Activities,\\" Pakistan's Nuclear Development, (New York: Croom Helm, 1987), p. 36. Chaudhry was an instrumental figure in the installation of the 1.2 MeV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator in the High Tension Laboratory (HTL) in 1954 for carrying out basic research in atomic and nuclear physics. Chaudhry led projects that investigated fundamental problems of physics concerning gaseous diffusion, ion and electron impact phenomena, nuclear physics, radioactivity, and cosmic rays. The research carried out at the laboratory resulted in research publications in Nature and it was visited by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 1958. At HTL, Chaudhry influenced many physicists who studied under him, such as N. M. Butt and Samar Mubarakmand, who became the senior scientists in Pakistan's indigenous nuclear development. After retirement from Government College, Lahore in 1958 he continued as Director of High Tension Laboratory until 1965. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Dr. Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry with English physicist, Thomas Allibone, Naeem Syed (in middle) and his other students in 1964, Government College, Lahore In 1960, Chaudhry joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, where he engaged nuclear technology research. He was the first director of the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH), and was instrumental in the installation of nuclear particle accelerator there. Chaudhry published 42 research papers while at PINSTECH, and due to the sensitivity of the work, the papers were highly classified. Chaudhry was an administrative and influential figure in the establishment of PARR-I reactor as well, as being part team that supervised the first reactor criticality at PINSTECH. In 1967, Rafi supervised the team of scientists at PINSTECH that successfully produced the first batch of radioisotopes. 1971 war and atomic bomb project In 1968, Chaudhry went to United States with a fellowship awarded by University of California at Berkeley. There, he was joined by Hafeez Qureshi, a mechanical engineer who built weapons in the 1970s. In 1969, Chaudhry moved to the University of Chicago where he did his research at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In 1970, Chaudhry and Qureshi visited the National Museum of the United States Air Force where they saw the actual design of Fat Man ‚Äì an implosion device built during the World War II. In 1971, after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Chaudhry returned to Pakistan and joined Government College University. In January 1972, Chaudhry represented the HTL's delegation at the Multan Meeting, convened by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. During the meeting, Chaudhry spoke, as he said: I was perhaps the only one among the scientists who had seen an actual atom bomb. Chaudhry was immediately posted at PINSTECH institute, where he was made director of Radiation Physics Division (RPD). Chaudhry was among the senior scientists that built the first nuclear pile PARR-II reactor at Pinstech. Under Chaudhry, the RPD scientists engaged in research in radiation physics. Post career In 1973, Rafi moved back to High Tension Laboratory at GCU Lahore. In 1975, he joined the Centre for Solid State Physics at the Punjab University and continued to work there as an honorary Professor; he was made Professor Emeritus in 1977. Chaudhry peacefully died at the age of 85 in Lahore. Recognition and honours Chaudhry was an influential figure at the Government College University and his work in PAEC and PINSTECH has been far reaching. In 1998, on personal recommendation of Noor Muhammad Butt, the Government of Pakistan awarded him Nishan-e-Imtiaz ‚Äì the first high civil award. In 2004, the \\"High Tension Laboratory (HTL)\\" was renamed as \\"Rafi Chaudhry High Tension Laboratory\\" by the then-President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharaffhttp://www.dawn.com/2004/01/17/letted.htm#6 in the honour of Chaudhry. Due to his work, scientists at PINSTECH named him the \\"Father of the Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme\\". Family of physicists Dr Rafi had nine children, all of whom became physicists. The most distinguished ones are Dr. Anwar Chaudhri, currently working in Germany, and Dr. Munawar Chaudhri, working at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, UK.

Together with Philip King and Sonny Condell in 1974 he formed a popular folk rock/jazz fusion group that started out as an occasional band called The Sunday Night Band. The following year, after White had left the band, it morphed into Scullion. In 1977 he formed The Fake and the following year he formed The Freddie White Band. During 1978 White toured as the opening act for the Irish band Clannad with their producer/sound manager Nicky Ryan recording those gigs, and providing selections to compile into White's first album Recorded Live on Tour 1978. On the 15th March 1979 he opened the concert for Eric Clapton and his band (including Albert Lee), in the Downtown Club in Dundalk. In 1992 White emigrated to Boston, US where he remained for twelve years, returning to Ireland in 2004. After seven years back home in Ireland, White relocated to Sydney Australia in March 2011 with his wife, Trish Hickey; they married in Sydney in June 2013. The couple relocated to New York City in December 2016 for one year. In January 2018, they moved back to Cobh, Ireland.

Goblinshead. p.402 The remains are protected as a scheduled monument. History Tranent Tower was built on lands belonging to the Seton family in 1542, and may have been built for them, but it was acquired by the Vallance family in the sixteenth century, who retained it until the nineteenth century. At one time it may have been used as a barracks, and in the early twentieth century as a hay loft. Structure The small tower is at the end of a lane in the town of Tranent, which has grown up around it. The remains are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. There are two vaulted chambers in the basement. There is a main block of three storeys, and a four-storey stair-wing. It has a pantiled roof. The first floor included the hall. The tower is in a poor state of repair. The stair-wing is at the south-west corner. The entrance is to the south, as are most of the windows. This suggests that there was a barmkin on this side, but there is no other evidence for this. The tower, which measures , is constructed in buff and brown sandstone rubble. It is likely that there was a corbelled out watch-chamber at the head of the stair which was later made into a dovecote which had a single- pitch roof. There were crow-stepped gables. The roof was still pantiled in the mid-20th century, but this is unlikely to have been its original covering and the upper storey may have been considerably reworked. There is a cross wall subdividing each floor. These walls appear to be early insertions. Probably there were earlier, less permanent, cross partitions. The hall has a large blocked fireplace, a lavabo, aumbries, and what may be a buffet recess in the north wall.

It advocates on behalf of small-scale farmers and discusses the topics of animal welfare, environmental pollution, corporate responsibility and food sovereignty.http://farmsnotfactories.org/resources/pig-business/ Plot summary The film begins with an introduction by Tracy Worcester in which she reflects upon the role that the countryside and small-scale farms have had on her personal and family life. She proceeds to argue that this cultural heritage is under-threat from large-scale corporations that, driven by profit maximization, have replaced traditional farming with a system that treats animals as a mere raw material or input in an industrial system. Worcester narrates the history and development of these large-scale corporations through the anti-competitive practices of vertical and horizontal integration. Through interviews with affected parties, as well as footage of campaign rallies and undercover expos√©s within factory farms, the film suggests that powerful corporations may take advantage of a monopoly position by acting in an unethical manner. It states that because the external costs of intensive animal farming are not taken into consideration by consumers, the industry constitutes an example of market failure. Of particular focus is the expansion of food giant Smithfield Foods within Poland, a location selected for its low costs and strategic access to the European Union market, following Smithfield's acquisition of the former state-owned meat producer Animex Foods in 1999.http://en.animex.pl/animex/company/ Drawing on testimony from Polish academics, politicians, industry leaders, farmers and villagers, the film argues that poor corporate regulation has resulted in a number of human and environmental disasters within Poland. Specifically, Animex is accused of causing harm to human health through the over-application of pig slurry as an agricultural fertilizer, as well as of antibiotic misuse within factory farms. Worcester further suggests that Smithfield has influenced government legislation through the sponsoring of sympathetic politicians with financial grants. Speaking in 2006, then CEO of Animex Foods Morten Jensenhttps://www.campofriofoodgroup.com/company/organisation/morten- jensen?q=morten_jensen states that Animex is compliant with all Polish and European environmental legislation. In an interview given in 2008, Smithfield's Vice-President of environmental and corporate affairs Dennis H Treacyhttps://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1522487&privcapId;=303885&previousCapId;=303885&previousTitle;=Smithfield%20Foods,%20Inc. states that contamination caused by slurry is illegal and that the organisation goes to \\"extra-ordinary lengths to ensure that they have a system in place that doesn't allow that\\". Responding to the issue of corporate donations, Treacy argues that such contributions are \\"the way of life in American government - part of the American system\\".http://farmsnotfactories.org/resources/pig-business/#pigbusiness Guardian columnist Warwick Smith argues that such donations corrupt democracy.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political- donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise In closing, the documentary proposes a number of solutions to the issues it highlights. It advocates buying British meat to ensure that products are not imported from jurisdictions with less stringent animal rights legislation, particularly in relation to the use of sow stalls and tail docking. It further promotes the adoption of clearer labeling systems on food, and recommends buying meat certified high-welfare, outdoor-bred, free range or organic. Controversy The film which took five years to make was initially refused for broadcasting by then BBC World due to fears of a legal backlash from Smithfield Foods. It was accepted for broadcast by Channel 4 but in February 2009 Channel 4 postponed broadcasting the film due to legal pressure.

It was introduced in 1985 by Leo Breiman and Jerome Friedman along with generalized additive models. In most cases, the backfitting algorithm is equivalent to the Gauss-Seidel method algorithm for solving a certain linear system of equations. Algorithm Additive models are a class of non-parametric regression models of the form: : Y_i = \\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{j=1}^p f_j(X_{ij}) + \\\\epsilon_i where each X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots, X_p is a variable in our p-dimensional predictor X, and Y is our outcome variable. \\\\epsilon represents our inherent error, which is assumed to have mean zero. The f_j represent unspecified smooth functions of a single X_j. Given the flexibility in the f_j, we typically do not have a unique solution: \\\\alpha is left unidentifiable as one can add any constants to any of the f_j and subtract this value from \\\\alpha. It is common to rectify this by constraining : \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N f_j(X_{ij}) = 0 for all j leaving : \\\\alpha = 1/N \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N y_i necessarily. The backfitting algorithm is then: Initialize \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} = 1/N \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N y_i, \\\\hat{f_j} \\\\equiv 0, \\\\forall j Do until \\\\hat{f_j} converge: For each predictor j: (a) \\\\hat{f_j} \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{Smooth}[\\\\lbrace y_i - \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} - \\\\sum_{k eq j} \\\\hat{f_k}(x_{ik}) \\\\rbrace_1^N ] (backfitting step) (b) \\\\hat{f_j} \\\\leftarrow \\\\hat{f_j} - 1/N \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\hat{f_j}(x_{ij}) (mean centering of estimated function) where \\\\text{Smooth} is our smoothing operator. This is typically chosen to be a cubic spline smoother but can be any other appropriate fitting operation, such as: * local polynomial regression * kernel smoothing methods * more complex operators, such as surface smoothers for second and higher-order interactions In theory, step (b) in the algorithm is not needed as the function estimates are constrained to sum to zero. However, due to numerical issues this might become a problem in practice.Hastie, Trevor, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman (2001). The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. Springer, . Motivation If we consider the problem of minimizing the expected squared error: : \\\\min E[Y - (\\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{j=1}^p f_j(X_j))]^2 There exists a unique solution by the theory of projections given by: : f_i(X_i) = E[Y - (\\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{j eq i}^p f_j(X_j))  X_i] for i = 1, 2, ..., p. This gives the matrix interpretation: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} I & P_1 & \\\\cdots & P_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_2 & I & \\\\cdots & P_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_p & \\\\cdots & P_p & I \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} f_1(X_1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_2(X_2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_p(X_p) \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P_1 Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ P_2 Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_p Y \\\\end{pmatrix} where P_i(\\\\cdot) = E(\\\\cdotX_i). In this context we can imagine a smoother matrix, S_i, which approximates our P_i and gives an estimate, S_i Y, of E(YX) : \\\\begin{pmatrix} I & S_1 & \\\\cdots & S_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_2 & I & \\\\cdots & S_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_p & \\\\cdots & S_p & I \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} f_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_p \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} S_1 Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ S_2 Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_p Y \\\\end{pmatrix} or in abbreviated form : \\\\hat{S}f = QY \\\\, An exact solution of this is infeasible to calculate for large np, so the iterative technique of backfitting is used. We take initial guesses f_i^{(0)} and update each f_i^{(j)} in turn to be the smoothed fit for the residuals of all the others: : \\\\hat{f_i}^{(j)} \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{Smooth}[\\\\lbrace y_i - \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} - \\\\sum_{k eq j} \\\\hat{f_k}(x_{ik}) \\\\rbrace_1^N ] Looking at the abbreviated form it is easy to see the backfitting algorithm as equivalent to the Gauss-Seidel method for linear smoothing operators S.

Retrieved 2015-08-19. we can formulate the backfitting algorithm explicitly for the two dimensional case. We have: : f_1 = S_1(Y-f_2), f_2 = S_2(Y-f_1) If we denote \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} as the estimate of f_1 in the ith updating step, the backfitting steps are : \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} = S_1[Y - \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i-1)}], \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} = S_2[Y - \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)}] By induction we get : \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} = Y - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 0}^{i-1}(S_1 S_2)^\\\\alpha(I-S_1)Y - (S_1 S_2)^{i -1} S_1\\\\hat{f}_2^{(0)} and : \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} = S_2 \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 0}^{i-1}(S_1 S_2)^\\\\alpha(I-S_1)Y + S_2(S_1 S_2)^{i -1} S_1\\\\hat{f}_2^{(0)} If we set \\\\hat{f}_2^{(0)}= 0 then we get : \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} = Y - S_2^{-1} \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} = [I - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 0}^{i-1}(S_1 S_2)^\\\\alpha(I-S_1)]Y : \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} = [S_2 \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 0}^{i-1}(S_1 S_2)^\\\\alpha(I-S_1)]Y Where we have solved for \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} by directly plugging out from f_2 = S_2(Y-f_1) . We have convergence if \\\\S_1 S_2\\\\ < 1 . In this case, letting \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)}, \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} \\\\xrightarrow{} \\\\hat{f}_1^{(\\\\infty)}, \\\\hat{f}_2^{(\\\\infty)} : : \\\\hat{f}_1^{(\\\\infty)} = Y - S_2^{-1} \\\\hat{f}_2^{( \\\\infty)} = Y - (I - S_1 S_2)^{-1} (I - S_1) Y : \\\\hat{f}_2^{(\\\\infty)} = S_2 (I - S_1 S_2)^{-1} (I - S_1) Y We can check this is a solution to the problem, i.e. that \\\\hat{f}_1^{(i)} and \\\\hat{f}_2^{(i)} converge to f_1 and f_2 correspondingly, by plugging these expressions into the original equations. Issues The choice of when to stop the algorithm is arbitrary and it is hard to know a priori how long reaching a specific convergence threshold will take. Also, the final model depends on the order in which the predictor variables X_i are fit. As well, the solution found by the backfitting procedure is non-unique. If b is a vector such that \\\\hat{S}b = 0 from above, then if \\\\hat{f} is a solution then so is \\\\hat{f} + \\\\alpha b is also a solution for any \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. A modification of the backfitting algorithm involving projections onto the eigenspace of S can remedy this problem. Modified algorithm We can modify the backfitting algorithm to make it easier to provide a unique solution. Let \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_i) be the space spanned by all the eigenvectors of Si that correspond to eigenvalue 1. Then any b satisfying \\\\hat{S}b = 0 has b_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_i) \\\\forall i=1,\\\\dots,p and \\\\sum_{i=1}^p b_i = 0. Now if we take A to be a matrix that projects orthogonally onto \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_1) + \\\\dots + \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_p) , we get the following modified backfitting algorithm: Initialize \\\\hat{\\\\alpha} = 1/N \\\\sum_1^N y_i, \\\\hat{f_j} \\\\equiv 0, \\\\forall i, j, \\\\hat{f_+} = \\\\alpha + \\\\hat{f_1} + \\\\dots + \\\\hat{f_p} Do until \\\\hat{f_j} converge: Regress y - \\\\hat{f_+} onto the space \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_i) + \\\\dots + \\\\mathcal{V}_1(S_p) , setting a = A(Y- \\\\hat{f_+}) For each predictor j: Apply backfitting update to (Y - a) using the smoothing operator (I - A_i)S_i, yielding new estimates for \\\\hat{f_j} References External links *R Package for GAM backfitting *R Package for BRUTO backfitting Numerical linear algebra Generalized linear models ","title":"Backfitting algorithm"},{"id":"25099321","text":"\\"My Morning Straitjacket\\" is the seventh episode of the sixth season and the eighty fourth overall episode of the animated comedy series American Dad!. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 22, 2009, and is written by Mike Barker and directed by Chris Bennett. In the episode, when Stan crashes a My Morning Jacket concert to drag Hayley out of it, he decides that he likes the band so much so that he becomes a groupie and follows them on the road. Plot Stan gets angry when Hayley is not at the dinner table because she has gone to a rock concert, which he considers to be a bad influence. Stan decides to scare Hayley straight by dressing up as a spider when she comes home, but Hayley defends herself against Stan and says that she is going to see My Morning Jacket when they play the next evening. Stan swallows Hayley's ticket, but Francine later retrieves it from Stan's body using tongs, then reminisces with Hayley about her own concert-going days, remarking on how hard she had to work to get backstage. While Hayley is at the concert Francine has Roger dress up as Hayley. Stan does not notice at first, but the ruse fails when Francine calls Roger by name. Stan races to the concert, only to find himself entranced by the music, leading to disasters around the house, such as Francine almost choking to death on the cord of a vacuum, eating Klaus who Francine rescues via the tongs, letting a burglar steal Francine's necklace and stab Steve in the gut, and trapping Hayley in the pool so he could dance on it. Stan becomes obsessed with My Morning Jacket and decides to meet Jim James, believing they are soul mates and that James is writing the music specifically for him. Disguised as a reporter for Rolling Stone (an allusion to the film Almost Famous), Stan follows My Morning Jacket on tour, accompanied by Roger. Roger manages to get Stan backstage at a show and onto the tour bus, but when Stan tells a bogus story about freebasing cocaine with 'Tina Jivestrong' & 'the black guy from The Beatles', they get thrown off the bus. Roger steals a car to get them to the next concert in Albany, New York. However, Stan does not get through the backstage entrance after Roger abandons him. Deciding to help Stan and end his quest, Francine turns up, dressed as a groupie. She effortlessly flirts and flashes her way through numerous security checkpoints, progressing from a simple hair-flip through lifting her shirt to lifting her skirt and finally making out with the last guard, a woman. Stan meets Jim James, who, after being freaked out by Stan, points out the flaws in his logic and tells him that he could not possibly be writing his songs just for him, seeing as how they never knew each other, and that Francine is the one who truly understands him. The episode ends with Francine and Stan rekindling their passion for each other (still in Jim James's dressing room) with the female security guard coming in the room to join them, closing the door behind her. Production In a November 2009 interview the episode's writer Mike Barker spoke about how an experience at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival inspired the episode, saying: \\"At Bonnaroo, I‚Äôm watching these guys create this lush, intense sound as the rain is washing over them‚Ä¶ and as the sheet of rain attacks the stage, the raindrops are being illuminated by the multi-colored stage lights, and it was just‚Ä¶ biblical. And it was one of those moments ‚Äî and by moment I don‚Äôt mean during a certain chorus or something, I mean the entire time the guys are playing ‚Äî it was one of those moments where everyone in attendance realized they were witnessing something really special. No one‚Äôs worried about getting wet, or getting their shoes muddy, or needing to sit down after standing shoulder to shoulder with wet strangers for four straight hours. And I actually remember having the thought, ‚ÄúIf lightning strikes these guys dead, there‚Äôs not a thing tragic about that.‚Äù Seriously, can you tell me a better way for a musician to go? Because I can't think of it. But during the show, I start to become aware of how intensely I loved this music, and by extension, these guys for playing it. And I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWhat if I try to share this experience through the characters in American Dad? Is it possible to translate how much I love this music to a large portion of American Dad‚Äôs audience that presently has no idea that this band even exists?‚Äù That would be my way of giving back, I suppose. My Morning Jacket is one of the greatest bands of all time, so why wouldn't I try to share that fact?\\" American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker wrote the episode. He also spoke about producing the episode, saying: \\"I was definitely conscious of the fact that the band could end up hating this episode and resenting me for not delivering like I had assured them I would. I mean, it‚Äôs tricky. Normally when we (the writers) make our episodes, our primary rule is that we have to make ourselves laugh. We have to find the episode interesting and funny. Because if we‚Äôre laughing, then there‚Äôs a good chance our audience is laughing, too. But with this episode‚Ä¶ well, suddenly there‚Äôs this entirely new segment of people that will be watching the show, many of them for the first time, and that‚Äôs the My Morning Jacket fans. And the fans have certain thoughts and feelings about both the music, as well as the guys making it. The last thing I want is for my episode ‚Äî which is really a pretty personal creative experiment ‚Äî is for it to somehow reflect negatively back on the band. Jim and the guys were really great at respecting my autonomy throughout the process. This is a story I wanted to tell, and basically they took a big leap of faith by entrusting me, this absolute stranger, with their music, their voices, and ultimately, their image. So perhaps the most important thing for me in regards to the band was to do everything in my power to make sure that the episode didn‚Äôt suck. Because if it‚Äôs bad, or embarrassing, then that leads to questions from the fans like ‚ÄúWhy would MMJ do this?‚Äù and suddenly this incredibly thoughtful and principled band is on the firing line for selling out or something.\\" He also spoke about if the band had any input on their character designs, saying: \\"We gave the band customary consultation and they signed off on all of the artwork we ran by them. It‚Äôs always tricky animating real people. Because you‚Äôre not just animating them to resemble who they are in real life, you also have to make sure they resemble characters that live in the American Dad universe, and that carries with it a whole host of challenging parameters for our animators. But I think our character designers did a great job at capturing Jim and the guys.\\" Reception Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"Good old reliable American Dad was again the best of the bunch, though I suspect I would have liked this episode a lot more if I had any real knowledge about My Morning Jacket, a band I always mean to get into but never do. The show seems to do a lot of plots where Stan is introduced to some new craze by one of the supporting characters and then he goes nuts for it, but it's usually funny because Stan is such a straitlaced character. So his obsession with the band, which seemed like it would stop being funny roughly a minute after it was introduced, kept getting weirder and weirder and funnier and funnier.\\" The episode was watched by a total of 5.52 million people, this made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 7.38 million. Music The songs featured in the episode are \\"Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part 2\\", \\"I'm Amazed\\", \\"Remnants\\", and \\"Highly Suspicious\\" from the album Evil Urges, and \\"Phone Went West\\" from At Dawn. The song most prominently featured in the episode is \\"Wordless Chorus\\" from Z. A live performance of the song taken from the concert film Okonokos plays over the ending credits.

(season 6) episodes My Morning Jacket ","title":"My Morning Straitjacket"},{"id":"25099322","text":"\\"G-String Circus\\" is the eighth episode of the sixth season of American Dad!. It aired on November 29, 2009, on Fox. This episode mainly centers on Stan, who is saddened by the fact that Hayley refuses to take any advice from him. Stan goes to a strip club with his CIA co-workers, where he meets a stripper named Tanqueray. Plagued with a leg cramp, he suggests that she eat a banana because of its level of potassium. Her cramps go away, which drives Stan to prove his daughter wrong and that she should take his advice. His plan for a dry-cleaning business ultimately fails, and in order to pay off the debt, Stan becomes a stripper. With the large amount of money he receives from stripping, Stan tries to hide away the fact that he is stripping in order to prove Hayley wrong. This episode was written by Erik Durbin and directed by Bob Bowen. It was met with mixed reception from most television critics, with much of the praise coming from the development of the storyline centering on the relationship between Hayley and Stan. This episode was viewed by 6.4 million homes during its initial airing, and it garnered a 3.3 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings. It featured guest appearances from Kat Dennings, Donald Faison, and Jim Rash, along with several recurring voice actors and actresses of the show. Plot When Hayley announces she is taking a semester off to raise money for charity through organic mulch, Stan is depressed because she is not interested in his idea to start a dry cleaning business instead. Meanwhile, Deputy Director Bullock finds out they need to spend any remaining money in the CIA budget immediately or face cutbacks in the following year. They go to a strip club to spend the money. Stan meets a stripper named Tanqueray and talks her into a dry cleaning business after she takes his advice about eating a banana to help her with a potassium deficiency. Hayley's business takes off while Stan's goes into the tank. Stan decides the answer is to hire even more strippers. Roger promptly puts them on the internet and taunts Steve. Feeling bad that Stan's business is failing, Tanqueray goes back to stripping to make money for Stan. Stan shows up at the club but finds out it is \\"ladies night\\" and the girls have left. The club manager is impressed with Stan's physique and talks him into dancing for money when the club is short of dancers. Stan passes off the money he makes as money earned from his dry cleaning business. Roger takes Hayley to the club to cheer her up because she is depressed that Stan appears to be succeeding. She sees him dancing as a stripper and realizes Stan has lied about how he earned the money. Hayley returns home to find Tanqueray, who suggests her to appreciate her father's advice as she leaves. Meanwhile, Steve and his friends find out they have been accepted for Space Camp. It turns out the time at camp will be spent doing unexciting, administrative things. When Steve sees the girls Roger has in his room making out with each other, he and the gang decide to escape. When they get home, they find the girls have already left. Roger tosses them a G-string to fawn over until he tells them it was Stan's. Reception \\"G-String Circus\\" was broadcast on November 29, 2009 as part of the animation television block on Fox. It was preceded by The Simpsons, and its sister shows The Cleveland Show and Family Guy. It was watched by 6.4 million homes during its original airing, despite simultaneously airing with Sunday Night Football on NBC, Desperate Housewives on ABC, and A Dog Named Christmas on CBS. It acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18-49 demographic. The episode's total viewership and ratings increased at a considerable rate from the previous episode, \\"My Morning Straitjacket\\", which was watched by 5.52 million homes during its initial airing, and got a 2.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic. \\"G-String Circus\\" was met with generally positive reception from television critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the main plot a positive review, writing, \\"I liked how it was built on the relationship he has with Haley [sic], which is one of the relationships the show could do more work with.\\" However, he criticized the delivery of the plot, calling it \\"predictable\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, saying, \\"Everything about this episode was on fire. Stan's ridiculous scheme to have his gaggle of mentally vacant strippers run a dry-cleaning service, to his own turn as a stripper to try and earn back the money he was losing on the dry cleaning business. I would have liked to see a bit more of just how horrible the Space Camp experience was for Steve and his friends, but I still appreciated their disturbing rise from the mud and ultimate escape.\\" He went on to praise the episode for its humor, writing, \\"The highlight for me was when Roger called Steve, who was at the worst Space Camp ever, and showed him the strippers cavorting around his room, and making out on his bed. At least I thought that was the highlight, until Roger instigated a pillow fight, knocking one of the girls out cold with his pillowcase of full soda cans.\\" References External links 2009 American television episodes American Dad!

Counter-Maniera or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity in art issued by the Council of Trent in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of High Renaissance art, with \\"clarity in formal order and legibility in content\\".Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429‚Äì430 The term was devised by the art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg (1914‚Äì1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians. Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his Painting in Italy, 1500‚Äì1600, first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: \\"First Maniera, High Maniera, Counter-Maniera and Late Maniera\\".Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles. The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High Maniera remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-Maniera in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high maniera style.Freedberg, 429‚Äì430 Freedberg's contemporary Federico Zeri had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term arte sacra (\\"sacred art\\") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-Maniera may be in decline, as impatience with such \\"style labels\\" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century for her \\"fundamental flaw\\" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic \\"Note on style labels\\" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.Murphy, 324 Scope and characteristics The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1 and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so. Many parts of Italy, led by Venice and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of maniera influence.Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded maniera, without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as \\"counterpart\\" and \\"counterpoint\\", explaining that he intends \\"implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition\\".Freedberg, 429 quoted, and passim on individual artists; Friedl√§nder, 50‚Äì51 Characteristics of the maniera often retained in counter-maniera works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedl√§nder, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the maniera that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a decorum suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168‚Äì169, 178‚Äì179; Friedl√§nder, 6‚Äì10, and Part 1 generally In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.Freedberg, 657‚Äì660 The term counter-maniera is not usually applied to the more radical Bolognese reaction of the Carraccis from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was \\"a new and un-Maniera attitude to art\\";Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178‚Äì179 elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-Maniera with \\"anti-Maniera\\", apparently reflecting \\"Anti-Mannerism\\", the term used by Walter Friedl√§nder for the \\"palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting\\" that occurred \\"sometime around 1590\\".Friedl√§nder, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the \\"anti-Maniera\\" of Antonio Campi see 585‚Äì587, and for that of Scipione Pulzone see 658, and \\"non-Maniera\\" is also used; The use of the term has not been extended to Northern Mannerism. Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in John Shearman's Mannerism (1967), he picks Santi di Tito's Vision of St Thomas Aquinas (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624 Shearman's other main example of Counter- Mannerism is Federigo Barocci, who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632‚Äì640 Influences Many painters looked to revive the styles of Raphael, Andrea del Sarto and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of Michelangelo's late work was important for many artists.Freedberg, 428‚Äì429 The Florentine biographer and critic Raffaello Borghini, author of Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,Ellis, \\"Conclusion\\"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,Friedl√§nder, 50‚Äì51 and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: \\"Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly\\".Freedberg, 499, when discussing Girolamo Muziano Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as \\"a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture\\".Freedberg, 427‚Äì428, 427 quoted It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period‚Äîeven today‚Äîtended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of Gian Pietro Bellori's Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a \\"pro-Bolognese\\" artistic account of Counter-Maniera reform.Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed.

A powerful Category 5 super typhoon, Elsie formed out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, 1989, and initially moved relatively slowly in an area of weak steering currents. On October 15, the storm underwent a period of rapid intensification, attaining an intensity that corresponds to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. After taking a due west track towards the northern Philippines, the storm intensified further, becoming a Category 5 super typhoon hours before making landfall in Luzon. After moving inland, the typhoon rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Once back over water in the South China Sea, wind shear prevented re-intensifcation. Elsie eventually made landfall in Vietnam on October 22 and dissipated the following day over Laos. In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the situation already left in the wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population in the area of landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4 million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless. Meteorological history Typhoon Elsie making landfall in the Philippines. Super Typhoon Elsie, the third typhoon to impact the Philippines within a 12-day span during 1989, originated from a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) over the western Pacific Ocean in mid-October. By October 13, a tropical disturbance developed out of the system roughly east-northeast of Manila, Philippines. At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor the system as a tropical depression. Located between two other TUTT cells, the disturbance's outflow was enhanced, allowing it to intensify. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on October 13\\\\. Early the following day, the disturbance was designated as Tropical Depression 30W as it began to stall in an area of weak steering currents between two subtropical highs. Shortly after being declared a depression, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, giving it the name Elsie. At the same time, the JMA also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm. By October 15, Elsie began to take a slow track to the west- northwest and intensified. Later that day, a short-wave trough passed to the north of the storm, again enhancing its outflow. This led to a period of rapid intensification, during which Elsie intensified from a tropical storm to the equivalent of a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale in a 24-hour span. The JMA also upgraded Elsie to a typhoon, though they reported a much more gradual rate of intensification. After strengthening further to Category 4 intensity, maximum winds leveled out for most of October 17. On October 18, another period of intensification took place as the storm neared the northern Philippines. Early in the day, Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240 km/h (150 mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a barometric pressure of 898 hPa (mbar). The peak intensity of Elsie was assessed by the JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175 km/h (115 mph 10-minute sustained) and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar). The center of Elsie crossed the Philippine coastline at around 0300 UTC on October 19. Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved over the mountainous terrain of northern Luzon. Roughly nine hours after crossing the coastline, Elsie was downgraded to a tropical storm. The weakened storm continued its westward track as it entered the South China Sea along a monsoonal surge. This surge also helped to keep Elsie as a tropical storm due to increased wind shear over the northern portion of the cyclone. The JMA, unlike the JTWC, did not downgrade Elsie to a tropical storm until October 21. Failing to re-intensify, Elsie eventually made landfall in central Vietnam on October 22 and degenerated into a remnant-low pressure system early the following day. The remnants of Elsie were monitored by the JTWC on satellite imagery for a short time until the former typhoon dissipated over Laos. Impact and aftermath During the storm, roughly 50,500 people sought refuge in shelters set up across the country. Throughout the Philippines, 47 people were killed by the typhoon, mostly from drowning. Sixteen of these fatalities occurred in Isabela Province, where Elsie made landfall. Heavy rains triggered several landslides across mountainous areas of the country. High winds also created deadly air- borne debris, including roofing and tree limbs. Downed power lines across the northern provinces left most of Luzon without power. Officials stated that about 61,300 homes were either damaged or destroyed by Elsie in the Philippines. In the wake of the typhoon, roughly 332,000 people were left homeless. Damages sustained by agriculture amounted to 105 million PHP ($2,253,702 USD). In all, Typhoon Elsie killed 47 people and injured 363 others in the Philippines, and left roughly $35.4 million in damages. Although Elsie brushed Hainan Island in China and made landfall in northern Vietnam, little damage was reported in these regions. In addition to damages caused by Brian, Angela and Dan, roughly ¬•1.9 billion ($278.3 million) was left in damages. Following the storm, the Red Cross and World Food Council (UNDRO) set up shelters and began assisting residents in need of food and shelter. Several thousand residents were provided food, clothing and shelter across the country in mass-feeding shelters. The UNDRO also contributed $461,000 in funds to the Philippines. Another $46,000 was provided by the Government of Norway and the Catholic Relief Services donated $50,000. The Government of Japan provided $300,000 and the Government of the United States donated $25,000 in response to the overall effects of Elsie and the three preceding storms. Two other non- governmental organizations, the Lutheran World Federation and World Council of Churches allocated $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, for the Philippines.

Early life and education  Trained as a musician and ethnographer, Sara G√≥mez came from the folkloric Havana neighborhood of Guanabacoa ‚Äì traditionally viewed as one of the epicenters of Afro-Cuban popular culture, as well as a marginal sector of Cuba that has many issues such as racism and gender inequality which was depicted later on in her films. She studied music (piano), literature, and Afro-Cuban ethnography. \\"Raised by her paternal grandmother and four aunts, she grew up surrounded by Afro-Cuban professionals, including family members who played in the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra, and attended dances at black recreational societies like the Porvenir and El Club Progreso (The Progressive Club), which inspired her studies at the Conservatory of Music in Havana.\\" G√≥mez was not poor or uneducated. Being brought up around scholars and art that shaped the culture around her, she used her voice to represent those who do not like those seen in her work.G√≥mez explored journalism by writing for the youth magazine Mella and for the Communist Party newspaper Noticias de Hoy (News of Today) ‚Äì before taking a position at the newly formed Instituto Cubano Del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos (ICAIC). At the ICAIC she served as assistant director to Jorge Fraga, Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea, and Agn√®s Varda. She became the first female film director in Cuba. G√≥mez made a series of documentary shorts on assigned topics before directing her first feature-length film. Cuban directors see documentaries as an important training ground because it forces them to focus on the material reality of Cuba, consequently, emphasizing filmmaking as an expression or tool of the culture. G√≥mez directed multiple short documentaries which emphasized and criticized the Cuban revolutionary society. Her short films explored the positions of women and Afro-Cubans within society.  Personal Life  She married fellow director Hector Veitia and had daughter Iddia. In 1967 on set of Y tenemos sabor she met Germinal Hernandez. They met working together, she was the director and he was a sound technician. They started an affair and later married and had two children, Ibis and Alfredo. Career ‚Äì contribution to Cuban cinema  De Cierta Manera (One Way or Another)  Sara G√≥mez's last film, the hybrid narrative/documentary De cierta manera, (translated for US audiences as One Way or Another) has been hailed as the \\"first movie to truly explore conflicting threads of racial and gender identity within a revolutionary context.\\"Andrea Easley Morris, Afro-Cuban Identity in Postrevolutionary Novel and Film: Inclusion, Loss, and Cultural Resistance (Lanham: Bucknell University Press, 2012), p. 12. This revolutionary film was produced by the ICAIC in 1974. This film takes place in Miraflores, a lower-class neighborhood in Havana, Cuba. This film addresses issues of class, race, and gender after the 1959 Cuban Revolution. This film shifts between a documentary style that analysis the revolution and a fictitious love story that challenges the attitudes around race, social class and gender in Cuban culture.Sara Gomez chooses both professional actors and nonprofessional actors to represent the issues of story and in real life: the conflict between Cuba marginal population's life and the Revolution. At the begging of the film Gomez Says it is \\"a film about real people, and some fictitious ones.‚Äù Noted Cuban film scholar Michael Chanan observes that the film is \\"an aesthetically radical film...mix[ing]...fiction and documentary, in the most original way...by using real people to play themselves alongside professional actors.\\"Michael Chanan, The Cuban Image (London: BFI Publishing, 1985), pp. 284‚Äì85. Haseenah Ebrahim writes about how G√≥mez's work brings attention to religious groups such as the Abaku√°, \\"Afrocuban religions make an appearance in the films and videos of almost all Afrocuban filmmakers, and feature prominently in the work of G√≥mez...\\" and highlights the importance of Sara G√≥mez's background as a black Cuban woman in cinema by noting, \\"In the case of both G√≥mez and Rolando, race has functioned to provide a perspective that is not mirrored in the work of non-black Cuban filmmakers. Significantly, both women self-identified themselves as black Cubans: Sara G√≥mez has been quoted as saying she did not want to be 'just another middle-class black woman who plays the piano'\\". Essayist Roberto Zurbano Torres states, \\"it is also essential to mark her commitment to popular culture and her critical and self-critical passion through which she expressed the complexity of a world under construction: contributing a cinema of conscience, pointing out the virtues and defects of a social process that tried to change the world from an island in the Caribbean.\\" G√≥mez died before the film could be completed and so Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea, Rigoberto Lopez, and Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa supervised the sound-mix and post-production stages of preparing One way or Another for theatrical release.Julia Lesage. One Way or Another: dialectical, revolutionary, feminist. from Jump Cut, no. 20, may 1978; Jump Cut, No. 57, Fall 2016 The film was not released for a few years because of technical problems such as damaged negative that were sent to Sweden for repairing.  Legacy  As of 2011 G√≥mez remains the only Cuban women filmmaker to direct a feature-length film produced by the ICAIC. She is still the only black women to be a part of this institution. G√≥mez's films are used in feminist studies due to their reflections of marginalization. Susan Lord, a professor in the Film and Media department at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada wrote that G√≥mez's films embody feminist, radical, and democracy. The content of G√≥mez's work depicted scenes of life that existed in Cuba during a time of revolution. By employing ethnographic techniques, the themes in her work exposed discrimination in terms of race, gender and class. A critical analysis conducted by Devyn Spence Benson, a historian of 19th and 20th century Latin America, concluded that G√≥mez's films advocated for a revolution that fought against discrimination of all forms. The framing of her films cast light upon the hostility that existed in a post 1959 Cuba concerning censorship and opportunities of equality. She captured the everyday lives of those living with minimal power, giving the viewer a glimpse of Afro-Cuban culture and politics. Providing this exposure gave an opportunity to be heard that had not been previously available to those with little power. The evidence of this new acknowledgement can be seen in G√≥mez's film Ir√© a Santiago, released in 1964, which pictured the city of Santiago through the daily actions of its people. The opening panoramic shots of Afro-Cuban women engaging in everyday work, usually accompanied with Cuban music, was one of the ways in which G√≥mez showed how the people and their experiences were central to the construction of a new Cuba. This created a lasting impact because her work had provided a channel of discourse about discrimination and the struggle for equality at the time. In addition to the content of G√≥mez's work, her use of formal filmmaking techniques has also been analyzed and praised as innovative stylization fitting into the 1960s trend of imperfect cinema. This form of film was popular in Cuba around the period of 1968-88 and centered around the intentional use of aesthetic imperfections. This visual technique incited social discourse and analysis about the films themselves. An example of this can be found in G√≥mez's 1977 feature De cierta manera, where she employed the coalescence of actors and non-actors to film scenes of the non-actors‚Äô everyday lives. G√≥mez's work reflected the essence of the imperfect cinema tradition by supplying storylines which resonated with the audience's own life and experiences. G√≥mez and her work were relatively unknown for many years, specifically in Cuba, due to the censorship of her films. The ICAIC had most of her documentaries restricted under censorship and they were stagnant in the institute archives until around 2007 when a group pushed for the digitization of her short films. The National Film Institute also had very little acknowledgement of G√≥mez and her career until 1989 when a special program was dedicated to her life.  As a subject  Salut les Cubains At the end of Agn√®s Varda's short documentary Salut les Cubains (1963), Sara G√≥mez is featured as a young filmmaker dancing Cha-cha-cha with her fellow ICAIC filmmakers (illustrated through photographic animation.) Agn√®s Varda describes G√≥mez in the documentary as one who, \\"directs didactic films.\\"Agnes Varda. Salut les Cubains (1963) France, Film.Throughout the production of this film, \\"She [G√≥mez] had the opportunity to accompany the prestigious gala director Agn√®s Varda in her tour of our country and collaborate with her in the documentary\\" Varda and Gomez became friends throughout the making of this film.  Sara G√≥mez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker  In 2004, the Swiss filmmaker Alessandra Muller directed the documentary film: Sara G√≥mez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker (2004), supported both by ICAIC and Agn√®s Varda. This film which looks back on her life and revisits G√≥mez's family and friends. In the documentary, they describe her film sets as social events and emphasize that Sara would listen to everyone's input, of professionals and those who were not. Actor Mario Balmaseda notes \\"We spent a lot of time with people from this area, almost three, four months living with them sometimes sleeping and eating in their home, and this made it a lot easier. We slipped from a professional level into friendship.\\" In the documentary, Sara G√≥mez is praised by her family as a woman who refused to choose between family and normal life. Alessandra Muller.

It is found from southern California and southern Utah north to southern British Columbia, central Saskatchewan and south-western Manitoba. The wingspan is 38‚Äì42 mm. Adults are on wing from June to August depending on the location. The moths emerge from the pupae with the eggs nearly fully developed, and they are laid within a week or two. Eggs are laid in loose soil in mid-summer, and the larvae hibernate when partly grown, completing development the following spring. The larvae can bury themselves very rapidly if uncovered.

The Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) Nuits-Saint-Georges may be used for red and white wine with respectively Pinot noir and Chardonnay as the main grape variety. The name of the appellation is sometimes written simply as Nuits, without the Saint-Georges part. The word \\"Nuits\\" has nothing to do with \\"nighttime\\" but comes from the Latin for walnuts, Nutium.Wilson, James E. (1998): Terroir, The Role of Geology, Climate, And Culture in the Making of the French Wines University of California Press. The production of red wine dominates greatly, with around 97 per cent, and only around three per cent white wine. There are no Grand Cru vineyards within Nuits-Saint-Georges. In 2008 there were of vineyard surface in production for Nuits-Saint-Georges wine at village and Premier Cru level, and 12,031 hectoliter of wine was produced, of which 11,703 hectoliter red wine and 328 hectoliter white wine.BIVB: Les Appellations d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e de Bourgogne, accessed on November 16, 2009 Some of this area was used for the white wines in 2007.BIVB: Nuits-Saint- Georges, accessed on November 16, 2009 The total amount produced corresponds to just over 1.6 million bottles, of which just over 1.55 million bottles of red wine and a little over 40,000 bottles of white wine. The AOC regulations allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines,AOC regulations, last updated 1998 but this not very often practiced. For white wines, both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc are allowed, but most wines are likely to be 100% Chardonnay. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine. The C√¥te de Nuits subregion of Burgundy has been named after Nuits-Saint-Georges, which is the subregion's largest town, and which used to play an important role in the trading of these wines. Premiers Crus There are 41 climats within the Nuits-Saint-Georges AOC classified as Premier Cru vineyards. The wines of these vineyards are designated Nuits-Saint-Georges Premier Cru + vineyard name, or may be labelled just Nuits-Saint-Georges Premier Cru, in which case it is possible to blend wine from several Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC. In 2007 of the total Nuits-Saint-Georges vineyard surface consisted of Premier Cru vineyards, of which red and white Nuits-Saint-Georges Premier Cru.

Life  Vives was born in Or√°n, Salta. He was Captain General of Cuba during 1823‚Äì1832, when all Spanish possessions on the American continent had become independent. He had then but few troops under his command, but managed to maintain order and preserve the island of Cuba for Spain without troubles or any sort of violence. In recognition of his valuable services to the mother country, the government rewarded him with high honors, among them the title of Count of Cuba. Military Life In the early 1800s, when Spain and France had a joint treaty, Vives was commander of the first infantry of Catalonia. He served in Etruria fighting Germany under the leadership of General Brunn (1807). When Napoleon set his brother as king of Spain, the Spanish troops that were back in Europe heard of the unrest of the nation in regards to the new king. Francisco Vives and his men reached Denmark and boarded British vessels arriving in Santander, Spain, in 1808. In 1823, King Fernando VII named Vives captain general of Cuba. He served for nine years, in which he was able to lead, showing qualities of high moral character, courage, generosity, and honor. He did away with the secessionist conspiracies of \\"Suns and Rays of Bolivar\\" and of \\"black Eagle\\" (1829). Vives also favored the expansion of the sugar industry and liberalized the foreign trade, creating a great economic growth. He improved public health by opening new hospitals for women, children and mental health patients. On May 15, 1832, he was replaced and named captain general of Valencia (1834-1836), and awarded with the title of a nobleman of his majesty the king of Spain. Francisco Dionisio Vives married Dona Francisca Candelaria Oliva in Trinidad, Cuba. He fathered a daughter, which he left behind with his wife with the promise to return a retired general. He arrived in Spain and disappeared soon after, unable to ever see his wife and daughter Juana Vives. In letters sent to Segovia, Vives' wife urges the ministry of war to search for her lost husband. Recorded history shows that an order of search was put out by the constitutional king of Spain, Don Alfonso XII, on January 1, 1881, in order to award Vives with an award according to the military order of San Germenegildo. Vives's daughter married Juan Ferrer and had seven children. They named one of the boys after the General \\"Francisco\\"(Paco)Ferrer.

Although Vpered emerged from the Bolshevik wing of the party, it was critical of Lenin. The group was gathered by Alexander Bogdanov in December 1909 and was active until 1912.Marot J. E. \\"Alexander Bogdanov, Vpered, and the Role of the Intellectual in the Workers' Movement.\\" Russian Review July 1990 49(3) p241 - 264 Blackwell. . Other notable members of the group included Maxim Gorky, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Grigory Aleksinsky, Stanislav Volski, and Martyn Liadov.  Schism in Bolshevism  Alexander Bogdanov Vpered developed in a political atmosphere of counterrevolution and squabbling for political control, authenticity and funds within the RSDLP.Read C. \\"Lenin: a revolutionary life.\\" Routledge, 2013 , 9781134624713.Sochor Z. A. \\"Revolution and Culture: The Bogdanov-Lenin Controversy.\\" Cornell University Press 1988 p4. , 9780801420887. Philosophically, Bogdanov and his supporters envisaged a strong role for intellectuals in the party, along the lines of Lenin's What Is To Be Done?. They advocated ways for intellectuals of the party to systematise the socialist education of workers, in order to allow workers a greater and deserved role in the leadership of the party. Otherwise, with the departure of many intellectuals from the party, those remaining in its ranks would form the new party leadership. Meanwhile, Lenin had distanced himself from this work. Vpered began when Zhdanov presented a statement to the editors of Proletarii (Workers, the Bolshevik journal).Day R. B. and Gaido J. \\"Witnesses to Permanent Revolution: The Documentary Record.\\" Volume 21 of Historical Materialism Book Series. BRILL 2009 p568 , 9789004167704. In a meeting with the editorial board in late June 1908, Lenin succeeded in having Bogdanov excluded from the board (but not from the party). and to the conference of the extended editorial board called by Lenin in June 1909 in Paris. In this context, Bogdanov raised the issue of the \\"practical work\\" of \\"widening and deepening the fully socialist propaganda\\" among the working class. He argued that the editors of Proletarii had not adequately addressed the intellectual development of the workers. He said that the lack of any \\"theoretical and historical\\" elaboration of the peoples' armed struggle against the autocracy meant the absence of \\"conscious leaders\\" in workers' organizations and that the intelligentsia were necessary to train workers as \\"conscious leaders\\". Bogdanov aimed to meet this challenge by organizing proletarian universities. Bogdanov hoped to nurture an \\"influential nucleus of workers\\" who could act as \\"conscious leaders\\" in all forms of proletarian struggle. A 1909 Paris conference rejected Bogdanov's proposal outright, at which point Bogdanov left.Marot J. E. \\"The October Revolution in Prospect and Retrospect: Interventions in Russian and Soviet History.\\" BRILL, 2012 , 9789004229877. Bogdanov then wrote a report, which appeared in July 1909. This delineated Vpered's agenda: that Lenin and his allies had fundamentally deviated from \\"revolutionary Marxism\\" and the centrality of the hegemonic role of the proletariat in the coming democratic revolution.Waller M. \\"Democratic Centralism: An Historical Commentary.\\" Manchester University Press, 1981 p28 , 9780719008023. Bogdanov and Krasin complained that Proletarii had failed to produce even one pamphlet in 18 months, and, that the party had abandoned socialist propaganda work. The failure of the Russian Revolution of 1905 gave rise to bourgeois liberalism during the Duma period, rule by elected members, in the Social Democratic movement. Bogdanov and his allies accused Lenin and his partisans of allowing this through \\"parliamentarism at any price.\\" Although the actions of the Otzovists, (those promoting decentralisation which Lenin feared would lead to the liquidation of the party), including Bogdanov, did constitute a reassertion of revolutionary Marxism, and may have been a point of unity, the recall of RSDLP delegates from the Duma was seen by Bogdanov as impractical.  Proletarian universities  What Is to Be Done? (1902) Vpered organised an experimental proletarian university on the Isle of Capri which operated from August to December 1909 (from Gorky's home on the island). Another operated in Bologna from November 1910 to March 1911. Lenin argued that Vpered had used 80,000 rubles for the undertaking and that the group should be expelled from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP).  Outcome  While Bogdanov and Lunacharsky had become disenchanted with party politics and sought to focus on education and proletarian culture, Alexinsky saw Vpered as perpetuating the \\"illegals\\" tradition which sought to use traditional means of subversion. Joined by Pokrovsky and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, this redefined group gained control of the editorial board of Proletarii and disassociated it from \\"proletarian culture and science\\".Biggart J. \\"Alexander Bogdanov, Left-Bolshevism and the Proletkult 1904 - 1932.\\" University of East Anglia 1989 p150. However, Vpered lost momentum and eventually stalled in 1912. Evidently, perhaps soon after the February Revolution, Vpered began being published as a Menshevik journal. In 1917, I. Iurenev, a Mezhraionka leader, published a three-part history of the underground movement which was founded in 1913. (See .I. lurenev, Borba za edinstvo partii, Petrograd, 1917.

Vpered continued to be published 'in the first half of 1918 when socialist newspapers such as the Menshevik Vpered, Gorki's Novaia zhizn, and Delo naroda were tolerated.'

History The Fellowship is a free, Evangelical Church based on Methodist principles of faith. It is heir to the Movement initiated by the theologian and pastor John Wesley, organized into an independent Methodist Church at the end of the 18th century. The Fellowship was established in the mid-seventies as a result of the refusal to co-operate with the notorious Office of Church Affairs by a group within the Hungarian Methodist Church, followed by their secession. As a consequence, their churches were impropriated and their ministers were given suspended sentences of imprisonment. After eight years of persecution they were finally recognized by the state on 1 October 1981. The small community, numbering approximately 3000 members, is served country-wide by ten pastors. Among its institutions is the John Wesley Theological College, where 500 students study theology, ministry, teaching of religion, social work and environmental security. It supports one-parent families, three hostels for the homeless and a hospital which was visited by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993. Divine services were held by a converted, former public house. In 1992 they received a plot of land measuring 5,500 m2 to build a church and lay out a park. The poor-quality soil is being cleaned continuously, so far 1,000 trees, shrubs and pines have been planted. For the design of the church the planning office of B√°lint Nagy & Co. and for the building the contractors Zsigmond & Co. have been appointed. Work was completed by Tul√°t Ltd. Partnership in 1998 on the basis of a modified plan and was consecrated by the President of the Church, Tibor Iv√°nyi on 1 October. Costs were borne by the Foundation for the House of Reconciliation, the Capital Budapest, the Municipality of the 3rd district and the Church. Locality of the planned parsonage is to be ascertained. Description The small church, comprising 500 m2, professes the brotherhood of Christian and Jewish religion by the repeated representation of the Cross, the Star of David, and Moses‚Äô Tablets of Stone, both outside and inside the building. The walls of the interior, which radiates a warm, friendly atmosphere, are built from brick, the ceiling is faced by wood. It has a traditional cross plan. The pews, made of larch, turn towards the altar in V-form, separated by a nave, on their front and on the Moses-chair we see the Star of David. The upper part of the side of the pews is carved in the form of two semicircles, reminiscent of Moses‚Äô Tablets, with a cross underneath each. The Menorah is depicted on the window on the right, a picture of the ship the \\"preserver\\" is on the left one. Moses‚Äô Tablets appear again above the altar. An ornament of the chancel is a living vine-plant behind the altar, its branches climbing up on a T-shaped cross, symbolising Nature, with large stones at its foot and the light streaming in from above through a large V-shaped glass roof. Beside the small Lord‚Äôs Table, on the left is a red copper baptismal font, on its right is the pulpit. A concert is being held on the last Monday of each month. The bell (weighing 80 kg) is a Dutch donation, received through the Capital. Opposite the altar, projecting from the gallery is the fine, old organ, assembled from several parts received from various places (Solt, Nagyk≈ër√∂s), based on the work of the renowned Angster organ factory of P√©cs.

Retrieved on January 23, 2020 History The Burroughs Wellcome Fund was founded in 1955 as an American extension of the Wellcome Trust in England. These foundations trace their origins to the American pharmaceutical magnates Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs, who founded Burroughs Wellcome and Co. in England in 1880. This pharmaceutical company was one of the four large organizations that eventually merged to become GlaxoSmithKline. After Silas Burroughs died in 1895, Henry Wellcome expanded the company into several continents and numerous countries, including the United States. In 1924, Wellcome consolidated all of the company's holdings under a corporate umbrella that he named The Wellcome Foundation Ltd. When he died in 1936, his will vested all of the corporate shares in a new charity entity ‚Äì the Wellcome Trust. The Trust‚Äôs purpose was to use profits from the Wellcome Foundation to advance research in medicine and medical history. In 1955, Sir Henry Dale, one of the Trust's original trustees and its chair for 21 years, and William N. Creasy, president and chair of Burroughs Wellcome Co. USA, created a U.S. extension of the Wellcome Trust called the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. From 1955 to 1993, it operated as a corporate foundation to support scientific research. In 1993 a $400 million gift from the trustees allowed it to become an independent entity with no ties to the Wellcome Foundation or to GlaxoSmithKline, which by 2000 had purchased all shares of Wellcome Foundation.\\"https://www.ncpedia.org/burroughs-wellcome-fund\\" NCPedia.

Cohen's stated purpose was to create a dialogue between the camps with a view to bridging the intellectual divide. It has been argued that it is Cohen's characterization of the British IPE that has provoked the biggest criticisms.New Political Economy, Volume 14 Issue 3 (2009), Special Issue: 'The \\"British School\\" of International Political Economy' This approach is interested in what Cohen terms 'the Really Big Question', which is really two questions: where is the world going, and how can \\"we\\" influence its direction? The aim of this British IPE is for Cohen more strategic than practical. It deals not with how states might best manage trade policy or monetary policy (given the existing conditions) but rather, with \\"the stresses and conflicts within the whole complex of societies and states that could lead to a transformation of existing structures in directions that might be either disastrously divisive and conflictual or, alternatively, more equitable and more peaceful\\".Robert Cox: \\"The ‚ÄòBritish School‚Äô in the Global Context\\", New Political Economy Special Issue (cited above), pages 315‚Äì328 To address these really big questions, a wide range of factors should be taken into account: indeed anything that might influence people and their political structures.

The name is also used as an attribute of the demon Rahu and Ketu in Puranic mythology, who are also connected to Solar Eclipse and Lunar Eclipse.

SvarbhƒÅnu is described to strike Surya dev, overshadowing the sun with darkness.Mitchiner 1982, p. 258 Stella Kramrisch considers this act as SvarbhƒÅnu as a deity greater than the sun. The Rig veda further narrates after this, the king of heaven - Indra struck down SvarbhƒÅnu and sage Atri found the hidden sun and replaced it in the sky. Svarbhanu again appears in the Yajurveda and the Brahmanas. According to the Brahmanas, SvarbhƒÅnu with darkness pierced ƒÄditya (the Sun), whom, however, the gods set free by means of svara (accents).Jaiminƒ´ya BrƒÅhma·πáa 2:386; MaitrƒÅya·πái BrƒÅhma·πáa 4:5:2 An assistant of Shukra, SvarbhƒÅnu was the teacher of the asuras and god of the planet Venus.

Background The British naval forces under commodore Sir Charles Knowles had failed against the Spaniards in the attack at La Guaira (2 March 1743). La Guaira was as it still is; the port of Caracas and an important shipping centre of Royal Gipuzkoan Company. It was believed by the Admiralty to be very weakly defended, an opinion possibly based on the report of the ships which attacked it in 1739.The Navy In the War of 1739-48, Cambridge University Press, pp. 244 Knowles prepared to sail toward a new Caribbean objective, Puerto Cabello. Puerto Cabello was the careening port of the Royal Gipuzkoan Company, whose ships had rendered great assistance to the Spanish navy during the war in carrying troops, arms, stores and ammunition from Spain to her colonies, and its destruction would be a severe blow both to the Company and the Spanish Crown. The Royal Navy fleet included: HMS Suffolk 70 gun third-rate HMS Burford 70 gun third-rate HMS Norwich 50 gun fourth-rate HMS Assistance 50 gun fourth-rate HMS Eltham 40 gun fifth-rate HMS Scarborough 24 gun sixth-rate HMS Lively 20 gun sixth-rate HMS Otter 14 gun sloop HMS Comet 8 gun bomb vessel Battle Knowles in armour, one hand gestures to fortifications and a burning ship Knowles and his fleet arrived from La Guaira four miles northeast of the Spanish port of Borburata, he first sent the bomb vessel HMS Comet to take up station inshore while he prepared the remainder of this expedition for an assault in Puerto Cabello. Around this time the Spaniards sighted HMS Otter and instantly raised the alarm. The next day the 50-gun HMS Norwich, the 40-gun HMS Eltham and the 20-gun Lively moved in to bombard two small Spanish batteries. This attack was intended to wear the batteries' defenders, after which a large force would be disembarked nearby under cover of darkness to overwhelm the isolated outposts and turn the artillery against San Felipe Castle, the harbour's main fortification. Knowles' operation started well, with three warships in action they pounded the batteries until 7:00 P.M., after the bombardment, 1,100-1,200 Britons were landed unseen under Major Lucas at 10:30 P.M. But, upon advancing, the troops stumbled into a 40-man Spanish company with two small cannons and grape shot. This small company routed the British who fled back to their boats.David Marley, Wars of the Americas, pp 265 On 28 April the three Royal Navy warships resumed their offshore bombardment to little effect. On 2 May Caracas's Governor Gabriel de Zuloaga arrived overland with reinforcements for the Spanish garrison, a normal complement is three companies of regulars and 300-400 militia. Sometime the next day, Governor de Zuloaga was wounded in the leg by British fire after inspecting the Punta Brava battery. By now, running low on ammunition and provisions, Knowles decided to attempt a general assault on 4 May. However, the wind died down before the British squadron could get under way at 1:00 P.M., so the operation was postponed until 5 May. On that day, Knowles weighed anchor at 11:00 A.M., prompting the Spaniards to man their defenses. HMS Assistance, HMS Burford, HMS Suffolk, and HMS Norwich were to batter San Felipe Castle while HMS Scarborough, HMS Lively, and HMS Eltham engage the batteries to the north. Another battle began shortly after 1:00 P.M, on 5 May, the warships anchored so close to San Felipe castle that only one of its guns could be suppressed. At 4:00 P.M. the wind rose, and de Zuloaga suspected the British would charge the harbor mouth. He therefore ordered a blockship to be scuttled in the harbor entrance. Upon seeing the channel closing; Knowles gave the signal to retire, two and a half hours later, only to see his formation become becalmed. The British suffered heavily before eventually fleeing out of range by 9:00 P.M. Aftermath Having endured about 100 casualties during this desperate gamble, plus another 100 during previous tries, Knowles ordered his most crippled ships to make for the Borburata Keys on the morning of 7 May while continued to shell the Puerto Cabello's inner harbor with his lone bomb vessel. The commodore Knowles eventually offered a prisoner exchange to Zuloaga, and, after being allowed to fresh water by the begrudging governor, sailed away with two divisions on 11 and 13 May to Jamaica.

Life Hawkins was born in Abilene in west Texas, to a teenage mother. She was raised by her mother Nora Hall and her stepfather Harold Hall, with guidance from her grandmother, who would tell her tales of her family. She spent much of her childhood reading, believing \\"that the world I read in books existed out there.\\" The family would later move to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she would ultimately meet and marry her first husband, Olaf Hoek, a Danish architect. The couple would seen move to England where she studied art at the Slade School of Fine Arts of the University College London for one year.They would later move to British Honduras, now Belize, where she taught in missionary schools. She would also attend Sophia University. The two would later divorce after having two daughters. She returned to New Mexico where she met Robert Creeley, a teacher who would later become a famous poet in his own right. The two soon married. It was Creeley's position that any wife of a poet would want to write themselves, but derided Hawkins' attempts, to the point that she was \\"too married, too old, and too late\\" for her do so. \\"I was fighting for the right to write badly until I got better.\\" Her first book Own Your Body came out in 1973. Hawkins and Creeley would separate in 1975, after having two more daughters. Hawkins not only wrote, but she was an accomplished artist. Her first one-woman show consisting of paintings and collages was at the Gotham Book Mart in 1974. Many of her artworks would grace the covers her books. In 1978, Anne Waldman and Allen Ginsberg hired her to teach fiction writing workshops and courses unliterary studies at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute at Boulder, Colorado. It is now called Naropa University. She remained at the school until her retirement in 2010. After retiring, she continued to offer readings and teach for Naropa's Summer Writing Program. She wrote a one-hour play for PBS called \\"Talk\\" in 1980. She released two CD‚Äôs, Live at the Great American Music Hall and Jaded Love. In 2001, Life As We Know It, a one-woman show, was performed in Boulder and New York City. She would publish nineteen books and pieces Inver fifty anthologies and journals. As part of the Beat Movement, many of her poems feature unconventional construction. 'What's to save his life?\\" reads more like a brief prose passage, rather than a poem, but it still carrys weight and emotion. Many her poems are short, such as \\"trouble and hope,\\" which has only three lines, but showcases the random nature of life, both the good and the bad. Her ethic might be best explained in another work of hers, \\"in time I'll do what\\":‚Äî She was survived by her two daughters from her second marriage, one daughter from her first marriage, and two grandchildren.

A gamma-ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, and often followed by a longer-lived \\"afterglow\\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio). GRB 980425 occurred at approximately the same time as SN 1998bw, providing the first evidence that gamma-ray bursts and supernovae are related.  Observations  GRB 980425 was first detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor onboard BeppoSAX on 25 April 1998 at 21:49 UTC. The burst lasted approximately 30 seconds and had a single peak in its light curve. The Narrow Field Instruments (NFIs) onboard BeppoSAX began making observations of the region approximately 10 hours after the burst was detected. The NFIs detected two previously unknown x-ray sources‚Äîone at Œ± = , Œ¥ = , and the other at Œ± = , Œ¥ = . In the days that followed the burst, a variable object was detected in the original BeppoSAX error box that was not coincident with either of the two X-ray sources. The object's light curve implied that it might be a supernova.  Supernova relation  A search for the burst's radio afterglow resulted in one object that was coincident with the previously discovered supernova candidate, giving early credence to the idea that SN 1998bw and GRB 980425 were related. This was the first evidence of a physical relationship between gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. Evidence for this relationship and the details thereof continues to develop in the years since this breakthrough. Analyses of previously discovered bursts, such as GRB 970228 and GRB 980326, showed that they may have also been affected by supernovae.

Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit, is a city plaza along the Detroit River. It is located more or less on the site at which Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac landed in 1701 when he founded Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit, the settlement that became Detroit. In 2011, the Detroit-Wayne County Port Authority opened its new cruise ship passenger terminal and dock at Hart Plaza, adjacent to the Renaissance Center, which receives major cruise ships such as the MS Hamburg and the Yorktown.Detroit Wayne County Port Authority Breaks Ground on $11.25 Million Public Dock and Terminal.(June 21, 2004).PRNewswire. Retrieved on January 20, 2008. The plaza, which is named for the late U.S. Senator Philip Hart, opened in 1975 and has a capacity for about 40,000 people. At the center of the plaza is the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain, designed by Isamu Noguchi and Walter Budd in 1978. History The area where Hart Plaza stands today is believed to be where Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac landed in 1701. The waterfront area became the main source of communication and transportation to the outside world until the inventions of the railroad and telegraph. By the mid 19th century this area was covered by docks, warehouses, and other industry, as was most of Detroit's waterfront of the time. It wasn't until 1890 that Hazen S. Pingree, Detroit's mayor at that time, suggested the location would be ideal for the creation of a waterfront center for city functions. However, the project was not carried through. In 1924, the architect Eliel Saarinen was commissioned by the AIA of Michigan to compose a waterfront civic center design. However, World War II got in the way of its development, and it wasn't until the late 1940s that things got under way. The first parts to go up in the area were the buildings, including a veteran's hall, an auditorium, and the city-county building. Finally, it came to the creation of what is now Hart Plaza. What was created was a departure from Saarinen's original design, which was originally to be a grassy lawn area. It was decided to build the current concrete plaza instead, with several built in amphitheaters for concerts, as well as Dodge Fountain. The final design was done by the firm of Smith, Hinchman, and Grylls, with the help of Isamu Noguchi. The plaza opened in 1975 and in 1976 was dedicated to Philip Hart, a United States Senator from 1959 to 1976. However, the park was not completed until 1979. On the city's 300th birthday ‚Äî July 24, 2001 - a statue was unveiled depicting Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac arrival at what would become Detroit in 1701. On October 20, 2001, the Gateway to Freedom International Memorial to the Underground Railroad opened ‚Äî commemorating Detroit's role in the Underground Railroad. It was sculpted by Edward Dwight, after winning a competition to design the International Memorial to the Underground Railroad. Transcending, an arch sculpture and the Michigan Labor Legacy Landmark, was dedicated on August 30, 2003. It is located west of the entrance to Hart Plaza near the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Jefferson Avenue In 2006 the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority added a cruise ship dock and passenger terminal to the site. Events People attending a musical performance during 2011 Motor City Pride in the plaza's main outdoor amphitheater Thousands of people from the Midwest and Canada come together during the summer for celebrations, concerts held in one of the plaza's two open-air amphitheaters, and festivals generally held from May through September. Some of the events held at Hart Plaza over the years include: Sign and planter benches at entrance to Hart Plaza Surroundings Hart Plaza is surrounded by many important areas and buildings of the Downtown Detroit area. It is within a few blocks of the GM Renaissance Center (RenCen), Joe Louis Arena and TCF Center. In recent years, Hart Plaza has become a part of the Detroit International Riverfront. Visitors to Hart Plaza can see across the river to Windsor, Ontario's riverfront and the Belle Isle State Park. Layout The park is 8 acres in size and is bound by the Detroit River to the south, East Jefferson Avenue to north, Bates Avenue to the east, and Civic Center Drive to the west. It consists of the upper level at the level of Jefferson Avenue, which is a supported cement slab faced in carnelian granite and concrete, and suspended above the lower level at the level of Atwater Street. The plaza was designed by Detroit-based architects Smith, Hinchman & Grylls in consultation with Japanese American architect Isamu Noguchi. The plaza's main entrance is located at the foot of Woodward Avenue, south of the Monument to Joe Louis. At the entrance is the Pylon, a stainless steel spire sculpture designed by Isamu Noguchi. Located west of the entrance is the Michigan Labor Legacy Landmark, whose centerpiece is a 63-foot tall steel arch sculpture by David Barr and Sergio de Giusti titled Transcending. Near the center of the courtyard is the focal point of Hart Plaza, the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain, also designed by Isamu Noguchi.Detroit Then and Now.Cheri T. Gay, San Diego, California: Thunder Bay Press (2001), 13 Hard-Cover The lower level of Hart Plaza includes an open-air amphitheater near the center of the courtyard, dressing rooms, food preparation areas with kitchen service food court, three sets of public rest rooms, permanent beverage booths, temporary storage areas, offices, Detroit Police Department post at the southeast corner of the plaza, art gallery, and loading dock. Memorials and sculptures Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac Statue Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac Statue Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac ‚Äî the founder of Detroit ‚Äî is shown in this sculpture depicting the moment he arrived at that spot in 1701. The sculpture was a gift to the City of Detroit from the French-American Chamber of Commerce, Michigan Chapter and was unveiled on the city's 300th birthday ‚Äî July 24, 2001. The bronze statue was designed by William Kieffer and Ann Feeley in 2001. Gateway to Freedom International Memorial to the Underground Railroad Located on the riverfront of Hart Plaza, the Gateway to Freedom International Memorial to the Underground Railroad commemorates Detroit's role in the Underground Railroad. It was sculpted by Edward Dwight, after winning a competition to design the International Memorial to the Underground Railroad, and dedicated on October 20, 2001. The project was a collaboration between Detroit 300 and the International Underground Railroad Monument Collaborative. The companion monument by the same sculptor, Tower of Freedom, is located in Windsor, Ontario's Civic Esplanade, on Pitt Street East near Caesars Windsor, and features a former slave raising his arms to celebrate his emancipation while a Quaker woman offers assistance to a woman and her child as another child looks back toward Detroit. Several routes of the Underground Railroad went through Michigan. Detroit's terminal, whose code name was Midnight, was one of the largest terminals of the Underground Railroad. At first, Michigan was a destination for freedom seekers, and by the mid-1830s, there was a modest population of former slaves living there who aided other former slaves to escape to freedom. However, Canada became a safer sanctuary after slavery was abolished there in 1834. With passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, many runaways left their homes in Detroit and crossed the river to Canada to remain free. Some returned after Emancipation in 1863. This statue commemorates the route through Detroit. Another crossing point was south of Detroit near where Amherstburg, Ontario is located. The memorial features two gateway pillars that bracket a by sculpture showing six fugitive slaves ready to board a boat to cross to Canada. The gentleman pointing from Detroit to Windsor is George DeBaptist, a Detroit resident who helped slaves to get across the river to freedom. The monument's plaque mentions several Detroit institutions that were active in the Underground Railroad and continue to serve the city's population in the Twenty-first century. In October 2011, for the ten year anniversary of the dedication, the Downtown Development Authority spent $30,000 cleaning the monument and repairing several fixtures and the area around the monument. The Wayne County Commission and Detroit City Council passed resolutions testimonial resolutions commemorating the anniversary and recognizing the sculptor, Edward Dwight, who at 78 was on-hand to receive them. Additionally, Representative John Conyers, Jr. introduced a resolution to the United States Congress celebrating the 10-year commemoration of the sculpture, however it did not get past committee referrals. A three-day conference, \\"Celebrating the River at Midnight -The Fluid Frontier: Slavery, War, Freedom, and the Underground Railroad\\", was also held to commemorate the anniversary. Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain View of the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain from the front in the evening Located at the center of Hart Plaza, the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain was designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1978 and built in 1981. Anna Thompson Dodge gave the City of Detroit $1 million towards the construction of a fountain in memory of her late husband and son. The stainless steel fountain is composed of two legs topped by a ring to the height of 30 feet above a circular, black granite pool. The fountain contains 300 jets and 300 lights and has intricate and computerized lighting and nozzle functions, which can create different configurations, dependent on temperature. The Dodge fountain was inoperable from January 2013 to late August 2013 after vandals did more than $1 million worth of damage to Hart Plaza, $400,000 of which was done to the fountain itself. Pylon Pylon is a stainless steel spire sculpture designed by Isamu Noguchi positioned near the entrance to Hart Plaza. The sculpture, which stands tall with a base, is a double helix that appears to make a quarter turn between the bottom and the top. The design for the pylon was inspired by the double helix of DNA. The name of the sculpture, Pylon, often refers to Egyptian gateway structures that resembled a truncated pyramid. These structures were commonly built in significant locations by Egyptian architects. The word came into the western European languages and was used to describe a tall tower, such as those used to support elevated wires. The sculpture was commissioned via Smith, Hinchman and Grylls Associates, Inc. and built in 1981 as a companion piece to the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain. The $402,000 total cost of the sculpture was paid for by funds from the Detroit Capital Gifts Committee, which determines how financial gifts to the City of Detroit will be spent. Transcending Transcending is an arch sculpture and the Michigan Labor Legacy Landmark. It is located west of the entrance to Hart Plaza near the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Jefferson Avenue and was dedicated on August 30, 2003. In 2000, the Michigan Labor History Society established a project to create a monument that would celebrate Michigan's contributions to the labor movement. Funding was obtained from the United Automobile Workers, AFL‚ÄìCIO, and other civic and labor organizations. Sculptors were invited to enter a competition and submit sketches of their designs; 120 artists entered the competition. The selection committee chose Transcending, by David Barr of Novi, Michigan and Sergio de Guisti, an Italian sculptor living in Redford Charter Township, Michigan at the time of the sculptor's selection. The two steel arcs, the work of David Barr, stretch into the sky and weigh . Barr saw them as an elegantly stylized gear emerging from the ground. They are not joined and many assume that it is to remind viewers of the unfinished mission of the American labor movement. However, at night, a light project from one of the arcs at its zenith to the other. The sculptors assumed that viewers would focus on that light. To them, this light symbolized the energy of workers. At the base there are fourteen Vermont granite boulders, each in height. The bas reliefs on the boulders are the work of Sergio de Guisti. They are meant to symbolize the sacrifices and achievements of American workers. There are also more than a dozen plaques commemorating the accomplishments of the American labor movement such as the prohibition of child labor, free public school education and employer paid pensions and health care. The monument stands close to where Martin Luther King, Jr. first gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech on June 20, 1963, a speech that was repeated later that year at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. One of Dr. King's phrases - \\"The arc of history bends toward justice\\" - is included in the sculpture. A few lines of Melba Boyd's poem, \\"We Want Our City Back\\" is also inscribed on the sculpture.Melba J. Boyd - Distinguished Professor & Chair . Wayne State University. Retrieved May 6, 2015.

A lecturer on surgery and anatomy at Glasgow, he studied medicine in Glasgow. He visited Russia in 1804 and he published anatomical treatises. He was the son of Revd Dr John Burns, a minister of the Barony Church, and Elizabeth Stevenson. Of his brothers, Dr John Burns (1775‚Äì1850) became Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow; James was a shipowner and George was his partner in G & J Burns. Allan Burns commenced medical study at fourteen under his brother, John Burns. In 1804 he went to London to seek medical service in the army, and was induced to go to St. Petersburg to take charge of a hospital about to be established by the Empress Catherine on the English plan; but finding the position uncongenial, he returned to Scotland in a few months. He had taken the position for a three-month trial, and very early he 'got into a scrape' for dissecting a Russian, whom he decapitated, and a German. The removal of any body parts was then prohibited, unless they were Tartars or Jews. He had failed to make arrangements for a salary, and on discovering that government surgeons were paid ¬£90, he returned to Scotland, where he became a highly popular lecturer on anatomy  wearing the diamond and topaz ring given to him by the Empress Catherine when he left Russia. Burns then established himself as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery at Glasgow, his brother having given up his lectures on anatomy, owing to a body- snatching scandal. He attained very considerable success, being both vivid in illustration and accurate in knowledge. Allan authored a number of publications which were quickly translated into German and were published concurrently in the United States. He also published papers in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. His work on vascular pressure systems and on heart disease were seen as pioneering and were long in print. In 1809 he published Observations on Diseases of the Heart, and in 1812 Observations on the Surgical Anatomy of the Head and Neck. In the latter, he provides with James Wardrop the first description of what is now considered to be a uveal melanoma that later metastasized to the liver. From 1810 his health began to fail, and his promising career was cut short by his death on 22 June 1813. His favourite pupil, Granville Sharp Pattison, has a short memoir of him, prefixed to an addition of some of his writings, which were translated for text-books on the Continent. He was himself a favourite pupil of Sir Astley Cooper's. Allan and his brother, John, built up a considerable museum which provided material for teaching. The museum was eventually bought by Granville Sharp Pattison and some of the exhibits found their way to Philadelphia.

Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science. He and his wife, the economist Elinor Ostrom, made numerous contributions to the field of political science, political economy, and public choice. The Ostroms made particular study of fragmentation theory, rational choice theory, federalism, common-pool resources and polycentrism in government. The Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization published a special issue, \\"Polycentric Political Economy: A Festschrift for Elinor and Vincent Ostrom\\", as the proceedings of a 2003 conference held in their honor, at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.(2005) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Vol. 57 (2) Education and personal life Vincent Ostrom graduated from Mount Baker High School in Deming, Washington (1937), and attended Los Angeles City College (1938‚Äì1940). He received a B.A. in political science (1942) and a M.A (1945) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He received his Ph.D from UCLA in political science in 1950. He was married to Nobel Laureate and political scientist Elinor Ostrom (1933‚Äì2012) from 1963 until her death, which occurred shortly before his own.Telegraph obituary of Elinor Ostrom Career Ostrom began working at Indiana University in 1964 as a Professor of Political Science and co-founded the university's Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis with his wife and colleague, Elinor Ostrom. The Ostrom Workshop is committed to the collaborative engagement of faculty, students, and scholars, with a mission of advancing \\"the interdisciplinary study of institutions, incentives, and behavior as they relate to policy-relevant applications.\\" The Ostrom Workshop research focuses on polycentrism, common- pool resources, and the roles of self-governance and collective action.(2005) P. J. Boettke and C. J. Coyne. Methodological individualism, spontaneous order and the research program of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Vol. 57 (2), pp. 145‚Äì58. Earlier in his career, Ostrom had held faculty positions at the University of Wyoming, the University of Oregon, and UCLA. He was a key consultant to the Alaska Constitutional Convention (1955‚Äì56) in the drafting of the Natural Resource ArticleSection 8: Natural Resource Article of the Constitution of Alaska (Article VIII), which mandated that the state's resources were to be a public trust. Ostrom served on the editorial board for journals such as American Political Science Review (1957‚Äì1960), Public Administration Review (Editor-in-Chief, 1963‚Äì1966), Publius: The Journal of Federalism (1972‚Äì2005), Constitutional Political Economy (1989‚Äìpresent), and International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior (1997‚Äì2006).Vincent Ostrom profile at Indiana University website Research Ostrom's work can be summarized as seeking to understand the decision-making process of individuals and the balance between group and individual interests. This study involves attention to what drives human behavior (altruism or self-interest), the effect of institutions and rules on individual and group behavior, and how institutions transform and are transformed by individuals.C. C. Gibson. In pursuit of better policy outcomes. Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Vol. 57 (2), pp. 227‚Äì30. (2005) Ostrom co-developed (with Charles Tiebout and Robert Warren) and refined the concept of polycentricity in public administration ‚Äì or multiple, formally independent decision-making centers within a system of government.(1961) V. Ostrom, C. M. Tiebout, and R. Warren. The organization of government in metropolitan areas: a theoretical inquiry. American Political Science Review, Vol. 55, pp. 831‚Äì42. He proposed that quasi-market conditions (i.e. competition) between decision centers would increase flexibility and responsiveness. In contrast to hierarchical frameworks, polycentrism removes government from the focal point of ultimate knowledge and authority.(2005) R. E. Wagner. \\"Self-governance, polycentrism, and federalism: recurring themes in Vincent Ostrom's scholarly oeuvre.\\" Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Vol. 57 (2), pp. 173‚Äì88. Ostrom was recognized for advancing rational choice theory and democratic administration not only as a means for understanding bureaucratic behavior and the provision of public services, but as a distinct theory of public administration.(2003) H. G. Frederickson and K. B. Smith. The Public Administration Theory Primer. Westview Press: Boulder, Colorado, 279p. Rational choice theory of administration, Ostrom argued, provides a balance and foundation for public administration based on the democratic principles of the U.S. Constitution. In his 1973 book, The Intellectual Crisis in Public Administration,(1973) V. Ostrom. The Intellectual Crisis in American Public Administration. University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Ostrom outlines his observation of a breaking down of the intellectual foundation of public administration as formulated by Woodrow Wilson,(1887) W. Wilson. The study of administration. Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 2 (2), pp. 197‚Äì222. concisely, the concentration of power centers in government and the separation of the will of the state (policy) from administration. He noted increases in citizen involvement in decision processes and the broad diffusion of power. A democratic administration has a more heterogeneous, \\"bottom, up\\" character in contrast with ordered, trickle-down hierarchies. Ostrom considered the hierarchical order, accountable to a single center of power, less capable of serving the diverse needs among citizens and coping with diverse conditions, and less cost efficient than a polycentric administration. Fragmentation of authority among decision centers within a jurisdiction and the overlapping of jurisdictional authority are key to advancing human welfare and a stable political order.(1973) V. Ostrom. The Intellectual Crisis in American Public Administration. University of Alabama Press: Tuscaloosa, Alabama.(1977) R.T. Golembiewski. A critique of \\"Democratic Organization\\" and its supporting ideation. The American Political Science Review. Vol. 71 (4), pp. 1488‚Äì507.

The episode aired on November 30, 2009.  Plot  As Noah Bennet goes over what he knows already about the carnival people, he is surprised by Lauren who decided to take him out on a date to the movies instead of the other way around. When she asks about what Noah was doing, he explains his investigation, and in doing so discovers the compass is gone and deduces Claire Bennet must have taken it. Lauren offers her help by using CIA technology to triangulate her cellphone's location and get a general idea of where Claire is heading. As they attempt to locate her, Noah and Lauren find themselves striking up a conversation about their relationship which leads Noah to reveal the truth about Lauren having the Haitian erase her memories of their breakfasts together among other things. Shortly after, they are interrupted by one of Samuel Sullivan's carnies who has the ability to create multiple copies of himself. They escape into the bathroom and grab some hidden guns. When they return to the main room, the man and his multiple selves are gone along with the Primatech files Noah was hanging onto. Angela Petrelli meets with Peter Petrelli, informing him he must move to the \\"fifth stage\\" and accept that Nathan Petrelli is dead. Peter intends to confront Sylar and force Nathan out of him by use of sedatives. The Haitian arrives upon Peter's request and he absorbs his ability as a backup plan. Peter runs into Sylar almost immediately, who had shape-shifted into a nurse, and Peter escapes onto a floor of the hospital undergoing renovations. Sylar dumps all the medical supplies out of his bag, but Peter uses the Haitian's ability to suppress Sylar's abilities. After a brief fist fight, Peter manages to literally pin Sylar to a table with a nail gun. Peter then uses the Haitian's other ability to suppress Sylar's mind deep down, allowing Nathan to resurface. Nathan and Peter take a walk out onto the same roof top that was seen in \\"Don't Look Back\\". Nathan tells Peter he can't keep fighting Sylar and needs to accept his death. Peter refuses, but then Nathan takes a running start and throws himself over the roof. Peter quickly grabs hold of him, but Nathan tells him to let him go. Peter refuses and attempts to pull him up, but Nathan tells him that it's time to let him go. Peter says he can't and Nathan tells him that he has to carry on for the both of them. He asks Peter to tell Angela that he loves her and to take care of Claire. He also tells Peter that he is what's good in the world and that he has to keep fighting the good fight because the world hasn't seen anything yet. Peter says he can't do it without him, but Nathan tells him he can. The two say they love each one last time and knowing Nathan is right, Peter then lets him go and watches as Nathan falls and crashes onto a car below. Sylar morphs back and all traces of Nathan are gone. He quickly heals, and gets up, waving snidely to Peter who glares down at him. Sylar then turns around and walks away. Lydia informs Samuel that she is aware he killed Joseph, but then states because she has a daughter to look after, she'll keep his secret safe. Meanwhile, after driving for twenty-one hours, Claire and Gretchen reach what the compass seems to reveal to them as being their destination: The Sullivan Bros. Carnival. Claire is unsure to enter, but Gretchen convinces her to go for it by reminding her that this is a journey she has been on her whole life; trying to find a way to fit in, to belong, so she should at the very least take a look. Upon entering they are welcomed by Samuel, who encourages them to walk around free of charge and see what the carnival is like for themselves. They meet Lydia, who tells Claire to take her hand and reveal to her what she needs to see. The ink forms an image of Claire with the moniker \\"Indestructible Woman\\" bannered in front of her, which Lydia tells her is the ink manifesting itself into her desire. As they investigate further, they come upon a ball throwing booth where they see a customer taking far too many turns, so the person running the booth uses his telekinesis to make the balls start to miss and drive him away. Gretchen thinks its cruel the people here are using their abilities to swindle people out of their money, but Claire and Gretchen then see they may really be good at heart. When a little girl who was waiting for the man to finish finally takes her turn, the man moves the ball she throws to knock the balls over, so he gives her a prize. Samuel later takes the two back into their living area, where Claire sees a loving family environment. She runs into Eric Doyle, who says he wishes to speak with her later, and is then asked by Samuel to tell the children a bedtime story. When the man from earlier confronts Samuel about being cheated, Claire is surprised to find he does not fight back when the man starts punching him. Enraged, she stands in the way and scares him away with her ability when he cuts her and she heals. Soon after this, she tells Gretchen she will remain at the carnival for the rest of the Thanksgiving holiday before returning to see her. Then in a final glimpse of the carnival we see the enraged man's body in the back of a truck, dead. The episode ends with Samuel addressing his family, including Claire, at Joseph's grave, saying he wishes to start a new homeland for people with abilities at this site. As he speaks, a montage of the other heroes are shown: Peter returning to his mother after accepting Nathan's death; Emma Coolidge playing the cello; Hiro Nakamura, Ando Masahashi, and Mohinder Suresh running through a forest; Sylar donning his signature black hat; and Tracy Strauss controlling her abilities, apparently at the carnival. Claire watches Samuel with genuine admiration and support; implying that, while oblivious to Samuel's true colors, she may be joining the Carnival after all. Critical reception Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C+. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7.4 out of 10.

His official height was from the floor to his shoulder. The previous holder was another Great Dane, Gibson who measured , and died in August 2009. During the nomination process, Titan, who suffered from several health conditions, fought off competition from a Newfoundland from North Dakota and another Great Dane, from Arizona.

Titan had a number of health problems, including being epileptic, deaf and partially blind. He was trained to respond to commands through touch, although previously when he could see out of one eye, his owner had taught him sign language and he required acupuncture and chiropractic sessions every three weeks to ease his problems. Because of his size, he was often mistaken by children for a horse or cow. Titan's official measurements were and high at the shoulder. His owner hopes to use Titan's fame to educate the public about the breed, specifically issues with white Great Danes. Great Danes that are predominantly white are usually deaf and can have a variety of eye problems due to a genetic defect called the \\"merle gene\\". After being named the world's tallest dog on November 13, 2009 he appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Titan died March 31 2010 due to complications resulting from a ruptured intestine. Nomination Following the former record holder's death, Gibson, there was a period of nomination to the Guinness World Records. Contenders included Boomer, a Landseer Newfoundland from North Dakota who registered in the race at 180 lbs, 7 feet long and 36 inches tall at the shoulder. Another contender was George, a male Great Dane from Arizona, weighing in at 245 pounds and a height at the shoulder of some 42 inches. However, George's height has been in question since his entry into the competition. Previous pictures showing an accurate measurement of 39 1/8 inches at the shoulder and 43 inches when incorrectly measured at the head have since been removed from his website. George has just been named the tallest dog in the world by Guinness World Records after a judge was sent to verify it, beating out Titan by only a quarter of an inch. However the 2010 edition of the Guinness Book of Records was published on 17 September 2009 listing the former record holder, Gibson, still as the world's tallest dog. Titan's record was announced on 12 November 2009, which was Guinness World Record Day, when more than 30 records were announced or set. While the charitable work planned by his owner has been slowed due to controversy over the title holder, his owner has managed to make some headway in the development of temporary shelters that will house people and their pets after natural disasters. His owner hopes to use Titan's notoriety to complete the project and then donate no less than five mobile shelters to rescue organizations for deployment when needed.

It encompasses the north of the Autonomous Community of Valencia, in Castell√≥n province, and parts of the east of the Aragonese province of Teruel. The area is mountainous and sparsely populated with a rich mixture of flora and fauna. The district was under control of military orders following the 12th-century Christian reconquest of the area from the Moors. It also had a significant role in the 19th century Carlist Wars and the 20th century Spanish Civil War. After many years of decline the area is undergoing some re- vitalization, helped by funding from the European Union and tourism. History Cave painting at la Valltorta ravine. The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the Pleistocene era, 25,000 years ago. Cave paintings have been discovered in many locations and they have been designated by UNESCO as part of the Rock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula World Heritage Site. Occupation by the Ilercavones, a tribe of Iberians, Romans and the Moors followed, but the identity of the region was first established following the Reconquista when the area was dominated by military orders. Local stories persist that a group of Cathars, led by the perfectus Guillaume B√©libaste escaped from Carcassonne and took refuge in the Maestrazgo, living with a small community near Morella for about ten years, before being betrayed by a spy in the service of the Inquisition. B√©libaste was taken to Carcassonne and burnt at the stake there.Webster, 198-202 The name Maestrazgo is derived from the word maestre (English meaning - master) as these territories were historically under the jurisdiction of the Grand Masters of the military orders of the Knights Templar, St John of Malta and Montesa. In 1838, during the Carlist Wars, the military district of la Comandancia General del Maestrazgo was created by Ram√≥n Cabrera. During the Spanish Civil War the area was intensively fought over, especially after the fall of Teruel. Republican guerillas of the Agrupaci√≥n guerrillera de Levante y Arag√≥n held out in the mountains of the Maestrazgo until the 1950s.Webster, 162-164. (see Spanish Maquis). Geography The mountains in the Maestrazgo, like the Serra de la Creu, Serra d'En Segures, Talaies d'Alcal√†, Serra de la Vall d'√Ängel, Serra d'en Galceran, Serra d'Esparreguera, Serra de Sant Pere, Serra de Vallivana, Serra d'En Celler, Tossal de la Barbuda, Montegordo, the Cervera Mountains, Serra del Turmell, Serra de l'Espadella, Moles de Xert and the Benifass√† Mountains, form the Mediterranean end of the Sistema Ib√©rico. The highest point is the high Penyagolosa, located at the southern end of the region. At the base of the mountain is the important pilgrimage destination of Sant Joan de Penyagolosa. In the Castell√≥n province administrative divisions, the Maestrazgo is divided into Alt Maestrat and Baix Maestrat. The historical territory does not exactly match these boundaries including also parts of Alcalat√©n and Plana Alta. In Aragon, Teruel Province there is a comarca officially called Maestrazgo since 1999, but historically locations in other districts were also part of the Maestrazgo. The region has formed a Mancomunidad, a free association for cooperative purposes, between fifty five municipalities. Major settlements include Vilafranca, Cantavieja, Morella and Alca√±iz. The Maestrazgo Cultural Park has been established to protect the regional culture and landscape. The area lies between altitudes of to and is drained by the Guadalope and Turia rivers. Flora and fauna The Maestrazgo supports a diverse section of plants and trees including thyme, rosemary, lavender, mint, pennyroyal, mountain tea, chamomile, black truffles, poplars, elms, ash, beech, holm oaks and black pine.Webster, 327-342 Fauna includes ibex, mufl√≥n, wildcats, otters, pine martens, foxes, genets, goshawks, Bonelli's eagles, sparrowhawks, owls, vultures, and game and fish such as partridges, quails, hares, rabbits, wild boar, trout, and catfish. Today Tourism has in recent years brought a halt to economic decline in the region and the injection of European Union funding has led to the development of heritage centres and cooperatives providing training in practical crafts. Agriculture, including pigs, poultry, sheep, goats and smallholdings predominate in the valleys. In 1995, Ken Loach's award winning film about the Spanish Civil War, Land and Freedom, was filmed in the Maestrazgo. Life in the area and much of its history is described vividly in Jason Webster's 2009 book Sacred Sierra - A Year on a Spanish Mountain. Efforts have been made to halt de-population by attracting immigrants from South America and Romania. This has had some success, helping keeping village facilities alive. In 2008 palaeontologists discovered an intact specimen of a previously unknown species of sauropod dinosaur at a site near Morella. The animal was believed to have lived in the early Cretaceous period, approximately 120 million years ago. Funding from wind energy companies and the regional government has aided the excavations and will support a dinosaur museum to be opened at Morella.

It revolves around Tinker Bell, a fairy character created by J. M. Barrie for his 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, and featured in subsequent adaptations, especially in Disney's animated works. Animated by Prana Studios, the film was produced using Digital 3D modeling. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 21, 2010. Unlike the other films in the series, it takes place entirely away from Pixie Hollow. Plot Tinker Bell and her friends attend a summer fairy camp on the mainland. Out of curiosity, Tink goes to visit the nearby human house followed by Vidia. At the same moment, Dr. Griffiths and his daughter Lizzy arrive at the house, their summer home. Lizzy leaves out a hand-made fairy house, which Tink is fascinated by, despite Vidia's constant warnings; annoyed, Vidia jams the door shut. When Lizzy returns, Vidia tries to free Tink to no avail, resulting in Lizzy discovering Tink inside and taking her home. Lizzy attempts to show Tink to her father, but he is too busy. Seeing all the butterflies he has pinned in display for research, Lizzy decides to keep Tink a secret. In her room, Lizzy reveals her fascination of fairies to Tinker Bell. Flattered by Lizzy‚Äôs interests, Tink decides to teach her about fairies; Lizzy records all the information in a blank field journal given to her by her father. As the rain dies down, the two say goodbye; Tink prepares to leave, while Lizzy runs downstairs to show her father her research. Tink flies down to look but sees that Lizzy‚Äôs father is too busy dealing with leaks in the ceiling to pay attention. Tink spends the night fixing the leaks so Dr. Griffiths will spend more time with his daughter. When she finishes, she releases a captive butterfly that, unknown to her, Dr. Griffiths had intended to show to a museum committee in London. Meanwhile, Vidia rallies Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, Clank and Bobble to rescue Tinker Bell. Due to their inability to fly in the rain, the group build a boat to sail to the house. Despite smooth sailing at first, the boat encounters a waterfall and crashes, forcing the party to proceed on foot. On the way, Vidia confesses that it was her fault that Tink was captured, but they forgive her by telling her it would‚Äôve been worse if she hadn‚Äôt been there at all. The next morning, Lizzy is greeted by Tinker Bell and is excited to hear that the leaks have been fixed. She runs down to show her father her field journal but instead he blames her for the missing butterfly and sends her to her room. To cheer her up, Tink teaches Lizzy to fly, using her pixie dust, and the commotion brings her father upstairs. Dr. Griffiths sternly demands the truth and Lizzy confesses in tears about Tink. Still refusing to believe in fairies, he begins tearing down her artworks and tossing them in the wastebasket, including her field journal. Infuriated, Tink bursts out of her hiding place and angrily scolds Lizzy‚Äôs father, much to his astonishment. At the same moment, the rescue party arrives at the house. While the rest of them distract Lizzy‚Äôs cat, Vidia flies upstairs to look for Tinker Bell. Seeing Dr. Griffiths about to capture her, Vidia quickly bumps Tink out of the way and gets captured instead. Ignoring Lizzy‚Äôs pleas, her father unknowingly takes Vidia and drives to London to show his discovery to the museum committee. Lizzy, with the help of Tink and the other fairies, takes flight and chases her father to London. Flying ahead, Tinker Bell tampers with the car‚Äôs engine, causing it to stop and allowing Lizzy to catch up. Lizzy pleads with her father not to take Vidia to the museum. Dr. Griffiths finally listens to his daughter and apologises for not believing her. Lizzy and the fairies teach her father to fly and they all return to the house. Soon after, Lizzy and her father have a picnic in the field with the fairies, reading Lizzy‚Äôs field journal.

Location of Batroumine  Batroumine is a Lebanese Village Located in the northern part of the country. It's located in the hilly El-Koura county south east of Tripoli and lies at an altitude of 324 meters from sea level. Although Batroumine is located over hills, it would only take 10 minutes to reach the seashore; where you can enjoy the beautiful beaches and Resorts like Las Salinas which is a fine example of how good a vacation anyone can enjoy on the beautiful Mediterranean coast.Batroumine, archived from batroumine.org Batroumine is a Lebanese village with a long history. This history is seen through the fine examples of traditional Lebanese houses located in the village center. Observation of the preserved architecture shows that the village has roots in the Byzantine period, such roots are strongly noted in the architecture of the church in the village center. One of the important sites in Batroumine is the \\"Ain Al- Zarka\\"; it is an ancient water spring, very famous in Batroumine and its location became a natural attraction nowadays.  History of Batroumine  Historian and language experts, Anis Frayha; wrote in his book A Dictionary of the Names of Towns and Villages in Lebanon that Batroumine could mean the House of the Nobles, or the Roman Base. Old men and women in Batroumine told many stories about the origins of this village, which emphasize the explanation Anis Frayha gave. Frayha said that the word \\"Batroumine\\" is Syriac and not Arabic, but the inhabitants of Batroumine claim that the name Batroumine is derived from \\"Bayt Roumine\\" in Arabic language, which means \\"The House of Roumine\\", while \\"Roumine\\" was a Roman princess who lived in this village more than 1500 years ago. Whether the origin of the word \\"Batroumine\\" is derived from Arabic or Syriac, they both rely on the old Byzantic and Modern Arabic heritage Batroumine has.  Ruins found under Batroumine  Ruins of the old village were found under the modern Batroumine; around 40 stone houses connected with paved roads going back to the Byzantine era.

He played for Wishaw Juniors early in his football career and then most notably for Scunthorpe United.http://www.wishawjuniors.com/page24.htm Playing career He began his playing career with Lanarkshire side Wishaw Juniors when he was 17. He was quickly snapped up by Scottish Second Division Hamilton Academicals where he played from 1961-1963 scoring 13 goals in 39 league appearances. In 1963 he moved to England to join second division Scunthorpe United. He spent three seasons with Scunthorpe scoring 7 times in 54 league outings and once quipped about his time there that, \\"The only time we hit the headlines was when we were relegated to the Third Division in my third season\\". It was during his time with Scunthorpe that he met his wife, a Belfast girl. Following that relegation in 1966 Jackie found himself on the move again, this time back to Scotland where he joined St. Mirren, spending one season with the Paisley 'Buddies' scoring twice in 22 league games. With his Belfast bride, Jackie moved to Northern Ireland in 1967 working in the civil service. He joined Glentoran under fellow Scot John Colrain, spending four seasons with the East Belfast club, scoring 18 goals in 87 games. At The Oval Jackie won two Irish League winners and one City Cup winners medals. In May 1971 he was on the move once more, this time to Portadown and another Scots manager, Gibby MacKenzie. His Portadown debut was delayed due to the Troubles and with the country in turmoil, the opening Ulster Cup games were postponed. In midweek however he made his debut in a dramatic Mid-Ulster derby at Mourneview Park against Glenavon on 19 August 1971, with the Ports winning 4-3. It was to be a winning start to his Ports career, picking up a Gold Cup winners medal in a 2-1 final replay success against Ards at Mourneview Park in May 1972. This made up for the bitter disappointment of losing the Irish Cup Final 2-1 against Coleraine the previous month. A year later Linfield defeated Portadown 2-0 in the Gold Cup final but Hutton did add to his trophy haul however, captaining the Ports to the Carlsberg Cup with a 3-0 win over Ards at Windsor Park. The silverware kept on coming back to Shamrock Park and in season 1973-74 it was the All-Ireland Texaco Cup which nestled in the Shamrock Park trophy cabinet. Jackie captained The Ports to a 5-3 aggregate success in the two leg final against Bohemians. The following season there was a measure of European success as Portadown beat Icelandic side Valur of Reykjavik in the first round before losing 6-1 on aggregate to Partizan Belgrade. Managerial career In 1975/76 Jackie was transferred to Cliftonville and would go on to manage the Reds to a famous Irish Cup Final victory against Portadown in 1979. Five months later Hutton would return to Shamrock Park as manager following the departure of Bertie Neill. His first game in charge was a disastrous 5-1 defeat at the hands of Linfield. He remained in charge until August 1983, when he was sacked after a poor start to the season. Ironically on the day he and assistant Jackie Patterson were notified of their dismissal the Ports thumped Bangor 6-1 at Shamrock Park. He also managed Cliftonville's rivals Crusaders, where he is best remembered for appointing Roy Walker as his assistant, who went on to become one of the greatest managers in Crusaders' history.

They are produced by a variety of dinoflagellates, most notably Lingulodinium polyedrum and Gonyaulax spinifera. When the environmental conditions encourage the growth of YTX producing dinoflagellates, the toxin(s) bioaccumulate in edible tissues of bivalve molluscs, including mussels, scallops, and clams, thus allowing entry of YTX into the food chain.  History  The first YTX analog discovered, yessotoxin, was initially found in the scallop species Patinopecten yessoensis in the 1960s. Since then, numerous yessotoxin analogs have been isolated from shellfish and marine algae (including 45-hydroxyyessotoxin and carboxyyessotoxin). Initially, scientists wrongly classified YTXs in the group of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins along the lines of okadaic acid and azaspiracids. These type of toxins can cause extreme gastrointestinal upset and accelerate cancer growth. Once scientists realized YTXs did not have the same toxicological mechanism of action as the other toxins (protein phosphatase inhibitors), they were given their own classification.  Toxicity  A large number of studies have been conducted to assess the potential toxicity of YTXs. To date none of these studies has highlighted any toxic effects of YTXs when they are present in humans. They have, however, found YTXs to have toxic effects in mice when the YTX had been administered by an intraperitoneal injection into the animal. The toxicicological effects encountered are similar to those seen for paralytic shellfish toxins, and include hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, with a YTX level of 100 Œºg/kg causing toxic effects. Limited toxic effects have been seen after oral administration of the toxin to animals. The mechanism by which YTX exerts a toxic effect is unknown and is currently being studied by a number of research groups. However, some recent studies suggest the mode of action may have something to do with altering calcium homeostasis. Genotoxicity has been newly reported and confirmed. Although no data illustrate the direct association of YTXs and toxicity in humans, issues with regards to the potential health risks of YTXs still stand due to the significant animal toxicity observed, and like other algal toxins present within shellfish, YTKs are not destroyed by heating or freezing. As a result, several countries, including New Zealand, Japan, and those in Europe, regulate the levels of YTXs in shellfish. In 2002, the European Commission placed the regulatory level at 1 Œºg of YTXs per g (1 mg/kg) of shellfish meat intended for human consumption (Directive 20012/225/EC). Recently, it was shown that yessotoxins can trigger ribotoxic stress.  Analysis  The analysis of YTXs is necessary because of the possible health risks and the limits put in place by the European Commission directive. It is complex due to the large number of YTX analogues that can be present in the sample. Analysis is also problematic because YTXs have similar properties to other lipophilic toxins present in the samples, so methods can be subject to false negative or false positive results due to sample interferences. Several experimental techniques have been developed to detect YTXs, each offering varying levels of selectivity and sensitivity, whilst having numerous advantages and disadvantages.  Extraction methods  Prior to analysis, YTXs must be isolated from the sample medium whether this is the digestive gland of a shellfish, a water sample, or a growth- culture medium. This can be achieved by several methods: = Liquid‚Äìliquid or solvent extraction = Liquid‚Äìliquid extraction or solvent extraction can be used to isolate YTXs from the sample medium. Methanol is normally the solvent of choice, but other solvents can also be used including acetone and chloroform. The drawback of using the solvent extraction method is the levels of analyte recovery can be poor, so any results obtained from the quantification processes may not be representative of the sample. = Solid phase extraction = Solid phase extraction also can be used to isolate YTXs from the sample medium. This technique separates the components of a mixture by using their different chemical and physical properties. This method is robust and extremely useful when small sample volumes are being analysed. It is advantageous over solvent extraction, as it concentrates (can give sample enrichment up to the power of 10) and can purify the sample by the removal of salts and nonpolar substances which can interfere with the final analysis. This technique is also beneficial because it gives good levels of YTX recovery ‚Äî ranging from 40‚Äì50%.  Analytical techniques  A range of analytical methods can be used to identify and quantify YTXs. = Mouse bioassay = The mouse bioassay (MBA) procedure developed by Yasumoto et al. is the official reference method used to analyse for YTX and lipophilic toxins including okadiac acid, dinophysistoxins (DSPs), azaspiracids, and pectenotoxins. The MBA involves injecting the extracted toxin into a mouse and monitoring the mouse survival rate; the toxicity of the sample can be subsequently deduced and the analyte concentration determined. This calculation is made on the basis that one mouse unit (MU) is the minimum quantity of toxin needed to kill a mouse in 24hours. The MU is set by regulating bodies at 0.05 MU/g of animal. The original Yasumoto MBA is subject to interferences from paralytic shellfish toxins and free fatty acids in solution, which cause false positive results. Several modifications to the MBA can be made to allow the test to be performed without these errors. The MBA, however, still has many drawbacks; *The method is a nonspecific assay- it is unable to differentiate between YTX and other sample components, including DSP toxins *The method has economic and social issues with regards to testing on animals. *The results produced are not very reproducible. *The method has insufficient detection capabilities. The method, though, is quick and inexpensive. Due to these factors, the other, more recently developed, techniques are being preferred for analysis of YTX. = Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay = The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique used for the analysis of YTXs is a recently developed method by Briggs et al. This competitive, indirect immunoassay uses polyclonal antibodies against YTX to determine its concentration in the sample. The assay is commercially available, and is a rapid technique for the analysis of YTXs in shellfish, algal cells, and culture samples. ELISA has several advantages: it is very sensitive, has a limit of quantification of 75 Œºg/kg, is relatively cheap, and is easy to carry out. The major disadvantage to this method is it cannot differentiate between the different YTX analogues and takes a long time to generate results. = Chromatographic methods = A variety of chromatographic methods can be used to analyse YTXs. This includes chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry and fluorescence detectors. All of the chromatographic techniques require a calibration step prior to sample analysis. ;Chromatographic methods with fluorescence detection Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) provides a selective, relatively cheap, reproducible method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of YTX for shellfish and algae samples. This method requires an additional sample preparation step after the analyte extraction procedure has been completed (in this case SPE is preferentially used so common interferences can be removed from the sample). This additional step involves the derivatization of the YTXs with a fluorescent dienophile reagent ‚Äî dimethoxy-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinoxalinyl)ethyl]-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione, which facilitates analyte detection. This additional sample preparation step can make LC-FLD analysis extremely time-consuming and is a major disadvantage of the technique. ;Chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry This technique is extremely useful for the analysis of multiple toxins. It has numerous advantages over the other techniques used. It is a sensitive and selective analytical method, making it ideal for the analysis of complex samples and those with low analyte concentrations. The method is also beneficial in that it provides important structural information on the analyte which is helpful for aiding analyte identification and when unknown analytes are present in the sample. The technique has benefits over LC-FLD as the derivatisation and purification extraction steps are not necessary. YTX analysis limits of detection of 30 mg/g of shellfish tissue for chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry have been recorded. The major drawback to LC-MS is that the equipment is very expensive. = Capillary electrophoresis = Capillary electrophoresis (CE)is emerging as the preferred analytical method for YTX analysis, as it has significant advantages over the other analytical techniques used, including high efficiency, a fast and simple separation procedure, a small sample volume required, and minimal reagent is required. The techniques used for YTX analysis include: CE with ultraviolet (UV) detection and CE coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). CEUV is a good method for YTX analysis, as its selectivity can easily differentiate between YTXs and DSP toxins. The sensitivity of these techniques can, however, be poor due to the low molar absorptivity of the analytes. The technique gives a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 Œºg/ml and a limit of quantification (LOQ)of 0.9 Œºg/ml. The sensitivity of conventional CEUV can be improved by using micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). CEMS has the added advantage over CEUV of being able to give molecular weight and/or structural information about the analyte. This enables the user to carry out unequivocal confirmations of the analytes present in the sample. The LOD and the LOQ have been calculated as 0.02 Œºg/ml and 0.08 Œºg/ml, respectively, again meeting the European Commission directive.

He is known for having stolen 11.6 million euros from the Banque de France while on duty. At the time of the theft, he had emptied his flat and bank account. His colleagues reported that he had complained about the security firm and poor working conditions. Musulin became a hot topic of conversation on a social networking website, where he was praised for \\"the heist of the century\\" and for doing it without resorting to violence or guns.  Early life  Toni Musulin was born in Saint-Martin-d'H√®res on 8 June 1970 and grew up in Seynod with his brother and sister after his family moved there shortly after his birth. His father, Vinko Musulin, is an electrician who emigrated, when he was 22 years old, from Yugoslavia to France in 1965.Portrait de Toni Musulin, nouvelobs.com, 10 mai 2010. Toni Musulin's first career was as an electrician, like his father. At some point he founded a \\"\\" (SCI Jacquemart) through which he bought an apartment building located 16 rue Jacquemart in Romans-sur-Is√®re in the Dr√¥me department, with the ground floor being rented out as small shop. At the end of the 1990s he became a security van driver for Loomis, for which he worked for 10 years, until the theft. His mother, also of Serbian origin, had by then divorced his father and was living in New Caledonia with her daughter Laur√®ne. Shortly before the theft, he emptied his bank accounts of an amount of ‚Ç¨137,000, which was a significant amount for someone being paid ‚Ç¨1,700 per month. Most of that money was in fact obtained through loans from multiple banks.http://www.tonymusulin.fr/ He was 39 years old when the theft occurred.Tony Musulin, un Monsieur Toutlemonde √† la double vie, 20minutes.fr, 9 novembre 2009. Theft On 5 November 2009 he stole the armored van he was driving containing 11.6 million euros. This was made possible by lenient application of security procedures. The armored van was found empty shortly later with its GPS tracking device disabled. On 7 November 2009, the police were tipped off by witnesses and searched a garage in which they found most of the stolen cash: 9.1 million euros as well as a hired van. The remaining 2.5 million however could not be found. Musulin claims that he left them in the van with the rest of the cash. He claims that he did the robbery because he had been \\"mistreated\\" while at his job. Surrender Interpol searched for Musulin in its 185 member states, with suspicions he might have fled to Serbia. He finally surrendered himself to a police station in Monaco on 16 November 2009. His lawyer claims that Musulin surrendered because \\"he is a responsible man, he committed an offense, not a crime, and decided to face his responsibilities\\". Police on the other hand believe that it was a planned surrender and that Musulin had no intention of cooperating. They believe that after his prison sentence, Musulin will be free to enjoy the remaining 2.5 million euros, which are still nowhere to be found. According to French law, since the theft did not include any element of violence, the maximum prison term is only three years, with possible parole after 18 months. However, Musulin is also accused of false insurance claim. A few months prior to the van theft, Toni Musulin had declared that his red Ferrari F430 had been stolen, though in fact he had simply left it in Serbia. Trial and verdict On 12 May 2010, a court in Lyon sentenced Musulin to three years in prison. The Epoch Time reported that he accepted the verdict with a smile and was not planning to appeal. The prosecutor said: \\"We will do everything so that it does not end up like this. Toni Musulin will not enjoy in peace the 2.5 million euros he has hidden somewhere in Eastern Europe.\\" On 3 November 2010, the sentence was extended to five years for the Ferrari F430 insurance fraud. Release On 29 September 2013, after four years in jail, Musulin was released from prison. In movies In 2013 a movie entitled 11.6 was released, based on the theft story, starring Fran√ßois Cluzet as Toni Musulin.

It is mandated to provide advanced instruction in the arts, agricultural and natural sciences as well as in technological and professional fields.Philippine Presidential Decree No. 1434 Section 2 Its main campus is located in Echague, Isabela.Philippine Presidential Decree No. 1434 Section 1 Milestone The Isabela State University traces its beginning in December 1918 to a farm school ‚Äì the Echague Farm School, constituting a four-room academic building and a home economics building established through the efforts of an American supervising teacher, Mr. Horatio Smith, under the provisions of the Compulsory Education Act. With ten teachers to run the school, it accommodated 100 pupils from grades five to seven to take up elementary agriculture. Soon after, growth was gradually seen when the 100 enrollees increased to 300, necessitating the hiring of more home economics teachers and a farm manager as was provided by the same provision. Subsequently, more infrastructures were gradually constructed in 1925 to include a modest library building, a granary, a poultry swine building, garden houses and a nursery. More developments soon followed with the conversion of the farm school into a rural high school in 1928. This progress provided for the opening of higher academic levels ‚Äì the first and second-year classes, and the third and fourth-year classes thereafter. In response to increasing demands for appropriate higher education programs, the secondary agricultural education and home economics courses were made fully operational. The year 1935 brought in another development for the Isabela State University when the Municipal Council of Echague, Isabela withdrew its support from the gradually progressing rural high school. Consequently, the school was transferred to Jones, Isabela where it saw the reverting of its status to a farm school again until World War II. When the liberation period came in 1946, the farm school was named Isabela Agricultural High School and was relocated to Echague, Isabela. In 1952, it was renamed Echague Rural High School. As the course in forestry was integrated into the agricultural courses of the school in 1960, it was deemed appropriate to rename it as Echague Agricultural and Forestry School. Soon, the school began to gain recognition when in 1963 it earned the status of an agricultural school in the region. With the status came a broader sphere of responsibility as it was then expected to respond to the needs of its clientele not only in the provincial but also in the regional level. This seemed to have served as the cue for more innovations to follow. More academic programs were offered as demanded by its regional school status supported by the timely reorganization of the administrative advisory structure of the newly created Bureau of Vocational Education which gave greater freedom to the agricultural, trade and fixture schools to plan and implement their educational programs. Concurrent with the agricultural school status, in 1970, the Echague Agricultural and Forestry School was also designated as the Manpower Training Center for the region. The filing of House Bill 2866 during the Seventh Congress of the Philippines continually elevated the status of the school. The bill made possible the conversion of the Echague Agricultural and Forestry School into a state college. The conversion move was approved by the Lower House on April 17, 1972 and was subsequently passed by the Senate on May 30, 1972. However, its presidential approval was made pending. But shortly after the declaration of Martial Law, the bill was finally signed and the now state college was named Isabela State College of Agriculture. With its new status, the programs in agriculture, forestry and home economics were expanded and engineering, agri-business and post-secondary two-year courses were opened. The Educational Decree of 1972 promulgated on September 20, 1972 set another direction for the educational system. The decree declared a government policy to re-orient the educational system for an accelerated national economic growth and social development. During this time, the province of Isabela was also experiencing growth in many aspects. As the province saw the need to accommodate the results of its growth and respond to the call for national development through education, it felt the need to integrate and convert the institutions of higher learning into one effective and efficient state university. Presidential Decree (PD) 1434 then emerged two state colleges- the Isabela State College of Agriculture in Echague and the Cagayan Valley Institute of Technology (CVIT) in Cabagan to become the Isabela State University. This also transferred the college level courses of the Isabela School of Arts and Trades in Ilagan; the Jones Rural School in Jones; the Roxas Memorial Agricultural and Industrial School in Roxas; the San Mateo Vocational and Industrial School in San Mateo. As likewise provided in the same decree, Echague campus is the seat of the administration. PD 1437 complemented PD 1434 by defining the composition, powers, and functions of the governing board which was amended by RA 8292 (Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997). In 1999, the CHED Memorandum Order No. 18 s. 1999, which provides the guidelines for the integration of CHED Supervised Institutions (CSIs) to SUCs, was enacted. Pursuant to this order, the first CHED supervised institution that was integrated into the University is the Cauayan Polytechnic College at Cauayan Isabela in 2000. In 2002, another three CSIs were integrated into the system, namely: the Roxas Memorial Agricultural and Industrial School (RMAIS) with ISU Roxas Campus; the Delfin Albano Memorial Institute of Agriculture and Technology (DAMIAT) in San Mariano, Isabela; and, the Angadanan Agro-Industrial College (AAIC) in Angadanan, Isabela. With the enthusiasms of the Palanan and Santiago City Local Government Units (LGUs), the ISU and the said LGUs had entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to establish extension campuses to their respective places. Palanan campus was established in 2004 while, Santiago City ISU campus last June 2008. To date, the university has 11 campuses grouped into four clusters strategically located in the four congressional districts of Isabela. Past administrators * FELIPE B. CACHOLA, Ph.D. in Agricultural Education (1978‚Äì1986). He was appointed as the university‚Äôs first president by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on October 6, 1978. His administration laid down the groundwork needed for a beginning yet fast developing university by promptly drafting the university‚Äôs philosophy, mission, goals and objectives and its strategy for growth and survival which has immediately provided direction to the university. He crafted strategies for effective educational management and development programs which elicited the needed loyalty and commitment to the University from his constituents. His conviction that the Isabela State University should not just be another university but one ‚Äúthat can touch and shape the lives of the people in Isabela as well as in Region 2‚Äù became contagious. For democratic and effective management, he organized a group of competent men to backstop him in the task of running a system composed of six developing schools. * RODOLFO C. NAYGA, Ph.D. in Agricultural Education (1986‚Äì1999). He served as the second president of the university after his appointment on August 1, 1987. It was during his term that pioneering degree programs in Asia and the country, e.g. B.S.A. in Farming Systems, B.S. Agritech, B.S. Food Engineering, B.S. Development Management Education were established. He started offering doctoral programs major in: Agricultural Sciences, Occupational Education and Institutional Development and Management. He caused the delineation of 3.5 hectares of land which is now the site of the Ilagan campus. He was also instrumental in the construction of four buildings for the campus next to the Ilagan School of Arts and Trades campus. During his term, ISU was named the lead agency in establishing national (Agricultural Education Outreach Project, Environmental Development Program, etc.) and regional (Provincial Agricultural Institute, local government trainings, DA- DENR, etc.) programs and projects. Under his leadership, the University received recognitions in research in the national level (awarding of Dr. Francisco M. Basuel as one of the six (6) Outstanding Young Scientist of the Philippines) and the regional level (creative research on Legulac Technology, PCARRD funded research project). * MIGUEL P. RAMOS. Ph.D. in Education (1999‚Äì2003). He served as the third ISU President. During his time, ISU for one realized the need to align all facets of the academe to the new era. Despite financial setbacks and impending forced financial autonomy from the government, the university strived to take more insistent steps of filling resource gaps to meet its goals. His four years term was consequently focused on competitive instruction, timely Research and Development and Extension (RDE), and aggressive measures for financial stability. * ROMEO R. QUILANG, Ph.D. At present the university is at the helm of the 4th University President. Dr. Quilang provided the university with new policy directions and sets the new horizons for ISU to strive. To give ISU a boost in its administrative management, Dr. Quilang spearheaded the formulation of campus clustering breaking the long chain of onerous per campus management. To date, there are four clusters comprising the whole ISU system ‚Äì the Echague cluster comprising Echague Campus, Jones Campus, Santiago City Campus and Angadanan Campus, Cauayan cluster consisting of San Mateo Campus, Roxas Campus and Cauayan Campus, Cabagan cluster comprising Cabagan Campus and Palanan Campus and Ilagan cluster covering San Mariano and Ilagan campuses. Another milestone in his administration is the formulation of the new University Organizational Structure which placed a better management system, timely in the increasing number of students. As a result, the ISU and their programs qualified to several accretion bodies like SUC Leveling, AACCUP and CHED. It was in 2006 that ISU became SUC level 4. Forestry program in Cabagan campus obtained Center of Excellence by CHED while, agriculture and agricultural engineering programs in Echague campus were qualified recently as Center of Development by the same institution. Most of the core academic programs of the university had gone to level 2 to 3 by the AACCUP. Linkages became strong within and outside the country that helped the university perform better in its quadrangular functions such as instruction, research, extension, and production. Organizational structure The adoption of the new organizational structure is an initiative to implement better university management. Adhering to the principles of organization and management, the overall purpose of changing/revising the university organizational structure is to keep it attuned with recent developments and to streamline the institution to become more efficient, effective and economical in responding to the needs of its clientele. The significant changes in the organizational structure are highlighted by the clustering of the university campuses. The eleven campuses were grouped into four constituent clusters in which component campuses (smaller campuses) are placed under each constituent campus, namely: Echague Campus with Jones, Angadanan and Santiago City as component campuses, Cauayan City Campus with Roxas and San Mateo as component campuses, City of Ilagan Campus with San Mariano as its component campus and Cabagan Campus with Palanan as its component campus. The constituent campuses are headed by Executive Officers while the component campuses are headed by Campus Administrators. The organizational structure (Figure 1) shows the different levels of management both in the administrative and academic levels. The Board of Regents (BOR) is the policy-making and governing board of the University under which is the University President, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the University. Two major councils support the President ‚Äì the Administrative Council (ADCO) and the Academic Council (ACO). The President chairs both councils. The ADCO reviews and recommends to the BOR for appropriate action policies governing the administration, management and development plans of the University while the ACO reviews and recommends the curricular offerings and rules of discipline of the university subject to appropriate action of the BOR. It fixes requirements for the admission of students as well as for the graduation and the conferment of degrees, subject to review and/or approval by the BOR through the University President. Supporting the Office of the President are the Presidential Management Staff and the Internal Audit Services. Directly under the Office of the President are the four Offices of Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs, Administration and Finance, Research, Development, Extension and Training and Planning and Development. Also directly under the President are the four Executive Officers of each constituent campus/cluster under which are the deans and campus administrators. The colleges, institutes and schools constitute the academic units of the University and are headed by the deans. The deans report directly to their respective Executive Officers. Associate Deans of Colleges/Schools/Institutes report directly to the deans concerned on matters pertaining to academic policies and programs. Departments of academic units are headed by the Chairmen who report directly to their respective Deans or Associate Deans.

While the first railway in the country dates back to 1885, it was not until 3 August 1995 that the first electrified railway service, KTM Komuter, began operations. The term \\"railway electrification\\" mainly refers to the project to electrify the Keretapi Tanah Melayu's West Coast Line from Padang Besar to Johor Bahru, combined with the duplication of the single-track line and the elimination of level crossings. As of November 2015, the stretch between Padang Besar and Gemas has been completed, with two electrified train services operating on the stretch: the KTM Komuter and the ETS. Rapid transit and monorail systems in Malaysia are relatively new (the first of which is the Ampang Line on 16 December 1996); they are designed and built fully electrified and grade separated from the start. Systems * 25 kV AC railway electrification - Used by KTM Komuter Completed sections Rawang-Ipoh Tanjung Malim railway station, built as part of the Rawang- Ipoh double tracking and electrification project, will be the new terminus for the KTM Komuter network. The double-tracking and electrification of this 179 km stretch of the main West Coast Line has enabled Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd to run trains at a maximum speed of 160 km/h between Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh. This project, which had been beset by problems and delays, was completed in early 2008 and electric train services along the stretch commenced in 2010, cutting the journey time between Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh to 2.5 hours. This project has also enabled KTMB to extend its KTM Komuter service to Tanjung Malim. The infrastructure works component of the project was originally awarded to DRB-Hicom Berhad in 2000 for a value of RM2,579,920,005, while Mitsui of Japan was awarded the electrification and signalling component of the project worth RM1.9 billion supported by its principle sub-contractor, Siemens-Balfour Beatty Consortium. The contract between DRB-Hicom and the Malaysian government was signed on 2 April 2001. Four main subcontractors were appointed: Emrail Sdn Bhd for trackwork, Perspec Prime (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd for civil works, IJM Corporation Berhad for the construction of stations and UEM Construction Sdn Bhd for the construction of bridges. The original completion date for DRB-Hicom was December 2003. The project however suffered problems which caused numerous delays, resulting in the government terminating the contract with DRB-Hicom and appointing UEM Construction Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM (Malaysia) Berhad, to take over the project from 1 June 2005. At that stage, DRB-Hicom was said to have completed 88% of the work. DRB-Hicom said one of the main causes of the delays was a dispute over a variation order and losses and expenses with the government. Although there were threats of litigation, the matter was submitted for arbitration and was finally settled in May 2006 with the government paying DRB-Hicom a sum of RM425 million. The company added that it was still in negotiations with the government over issues pertaining to liquidated ascertained damages and release of the performance bond. Mitsui had also submitted a claim for compensation for being unable to carry out the electrification part of the project because of the delays to civil works with the government settling on an undisclosed sum in December 2006. On 17 January 2008, the double-tracking project between Rawang and Ipoh was officially completed. This was marked by an event where the Transport Minister officially declared the line opened. Despite the completion of electrification and double-tracking, electric train services only began operating in 2010. Between 1 December 2008 and 2010, trains hauled by diesel locomotives were used, running 10 trips a day. KTMB had initially planned to introduce a rapid intercity service between KL Sentral and Ipoh, running 16 services a day initially and ultimately 32 services a day. Currently, there are seven KTM ETS trips for each direction. Another six trips, 1 pair between and . 1 pair between Padang Besar and Kuala Lumpur Sentral. 1 pair between Gemas and Butterworth also run along this stretch. Sentul-Port Klang extension to Batu Caves Batu Caves KTM Komuter station which will be constructed under the Sentul-Batu Caves double tracking and electrification project. Another artist's impression of the new Batu Caves KTM Komuter station. The 7.2 km extension to the Batu Caves branch line started at the end of 2006. The project - which will cost RM515mil - will include electrification, double-tracking and refitting the existing old track, signalling, communications, as well as construction of new stations at Sentul, Batu Kentonmen (English: Batu Cantonment), Kampung Batu (English: Batu Village), Taman Wahyu and Batu Caves. Sentul is currently the terminus for KTM Komuter's Sentul-Port Klang Line and the extension will enable the commuter train service to be extended to Batu Caves. Proposed during the 1990s, the project was initially given to DRB-Hicom Berhad and a letter of intent was issued by the Transport Ministry to the company on 13 April 2001. No letter of award was however issued and there was no movement until 2006 when site possession was given to contractor YTL Corporation Berhad on 17 November 2006. The project was completed on August 2010. The Sentul station is part of the Sentul Raya masterplan development under YTL Corporation Berhad. Seremban- Gemas On 7 January 2008, the government of Malaysia announced that the Indian company, IRCON International won the RM3.45 billion (USD1 billion) contract to build a double track from Seremban to Gemas. The 100 km Seremban- Sungai Gadut double tracking project was scheduled to be completed by 2010 and to Gemas by 2012. The track involves 64.85 km stretch in Negeri Sembilan, 27.84 km in Melaka and 1.45 km in Johor. A 1.8 km tunnel and 9 bridges will be built in the process On 23 May 2008, a joint venture between IJM and Norwest Corporation won a RM490.12 million contract from IRCON to construct, commission and maintain infrastructure works for the electrified double-track project. The construction period is 21 months. On 27 May 2008, a joint venture between Loh & Loh Corporation Bhd and Pasti Abadi Sdn Bhd won a RM273.01 million contract to construct, commission and maintain infrastructure works. The contract include site clearance, demolition and relocation works. On 26 January 2010, Chief Minister of the state of Malacca, Datuk Seri Mohd Ali Rustam said the work on the dual-track railway was 32.81% completed and it was expected to be operational by August 2012. Once completed, the travel time between Malacca and Negeri Sembilan will be shortened and new six-coach trains capable of carrying 350 passengers at 140 km per hour will be used. Part of the project, from Seremban railway station to Sungai Gadut Komuter station was completed in April 2011, and from Sungai Gadut Komuter station to Gemas railway station has been completed on 31 July 2013. The line was energised in stages starting with the Sungai Gadut - Rembau stretch in April 2013, Rembau - Batang Melaka stretch in early July 2013 and finally Batang Melaka - Gemas section in late July 2013. The line was completed on 30 October 2013. Ipoh- Padang Besar This project was proposed in 2002 as a continuation of the Rawang-Ipoh double-tracking and electrification project. Initially awarded to two consortium. The 329 km \\"Northern section\\" between Ipoh and Padang Besar was to be handled by a consortium made up of the Indian Railway Construction Company (Ircon), DRB-Hicom Berhad and Emrail Sdn Bhd while the \\"Southern section\\" between Seremban and Johor Bahru was to be handled by a consortium made up of the China Railway Engineering Corporation-China Railway Telecommunications Corporation (CRET), DRB-Hicom Berhad and Hikmat Asia Sdn Bhd. However, on 21 October 2003, a letter of award was issued to a 50:50 joint venture between Gamuda Berhad and Malaysian Mining Corporation Berhad. The change in contractors was based on the fact that Gamuda-MMC lowered the project cost to RM14.448bil, compared with over RM44bil by the two foreign contractors. Members of the two previous consortia were invited to be sub- contractors and were given the first right of refusal but the invitation was not taken up. On 17 December 2003, not long after taking over from Dr Mahathir Mohamad, new Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced that the Malaysian government had decided to postpone the project. The government revived the project in 2007 when on 16 March, Deputy Prime Minister Mohd Najib Abdul Razak announced that the Cabinet Committee on Public Transport had decided to revive the shelved Northern section double tracking project. On 21 April 2007, Transport Minister Chan Kong Choy confirmed Ircon's participation in the \\"revived double-tracking project\\" and that the company will undertake the Seremban-Gemas portion of the Seremban-Johor Baru. On 6 June 2007, Gamuda Berhad announced to Bursa Malaysia that it had received a letter from the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department that the Malaysian government had agreed to Gamuda-MMC's proposal to implement the \\"Northern\\" section of the project on a private financing initiative basis. It added that negotiations on the formal agreement would begin as soon as possible. Transport Minister Chan Kong Choy said work on the Northern section will begin by the end of 2007 and is expected to be completed by Jan 2013. On 14 December 2007, Gamuda announced that it together with MMC had received a letter of acceptance dated 13 December 2007 wherein the Malaysian Government accepted the proposal by the Gamuda-MMC joint venture to carry out the Electrified Double Tracking Project from Ipoh to Padang Besar on a design and build basis for a lump sum price of RM12.485 billion. The works comprises the design and construction of the infrastructure and system works in respect of the project which is to be completed within 60 months from the commencement date. The project cost has escalated due to rise in oil prices and building materials. The group managing director, Datuk Lin Yun Ling, added that the company will undertake only 20 percent of the whole project while the rest of the construction will be out sourced to various companies around the country. The project will be implemented as a construction contract with progressive payments, instead of private finance initiative envisioned earlier. The design and build contract between the joint venture company and the government of Malaysia is formally signed on 25 July 2008. The project will consist of two sections, a 171 km stretch from Ipoh to Butterworth and another 158 km stretch from Bukit Mertajam to Padang Besar. It is expected that the Ipoh-Butterworth section will given a higher priority as it is a continuation from the Rawang stretch, and will eventually shorten the travel time between Kuala Lumpur to Butterworth to 3.5 hours. The project will also feature a 3.3 km tunnel in Perak, which will become the longest rail tunnel in South East Asia. The government has announced on 18 January 2008 that site possession has been given to Gamuda MMC on 8 January 2008. Work on the site is expected to start immediately thereafter and completed by 2013. It is also noted that the tracks will have the design speed of 160 to 180 km/h although the operator is expect to use only 140 to 160 km/h On 8 July 2008, The joint venture company has announced that electrification and power supply contract has been awarded to Balfour Beatty group with a contract value of GBP 160 million. Work is expected to start immediately and complete by January 2013. On the same day, the signalling and communication package has been awarded to Ansaldo STS. The contract is expected to be worth Euro 135 million. On March 2009, the project reached the 20% milestone and three months later, it completed 25% overall. According to the developer, the project is on schedule with expected completion by January 2013.http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=465927 On December 2009, Gamuda, one of the main contractors of the project has announced that the government have extended the deadline to complete the project by 11 months to December 2013. This is due to late approval of the design and late hand over of lands from the authorities. Construction has completed in October 2014 for the entire stretch. Current and future projects Gemas-Johor Bahru = History of the Gemas- Johor Bahru EDTP = The RM8 billion contract was expected to be tendered out by end 2008 pending a mid-term review of Ninth Malaysia Plan. The project would have included building over 200 km of parallel railway tracks, including stations, depots, halts, yards and bridges and cover systems such as electrification, signalling and communications. This included the realignment between Pulau Sebang, Melaka to Gemas section. On May 2009, Global Rail Sdn Bhd, a relatively small contractor and its Chinese partner, China Infraglobe submitted a proposal to the Government to build and upgrade tracks from Gemas to Johor Bahru at a cost of RM5 billion. According to them, the project would be on a Private Finance Initiative basis and the plan submitted to the Finance Ministry later in June 2009 was conditional upon signing over mineral rights in Johor State. On 29 January 2011, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Kong Cho Ha said that The Gemas- Johor Bharu double-tracking and electrification project is expected to start that year. He added that the Government hoped to appoint the contractor for the project this year and Malaysia is still in the midst of talking with China Railway Construction, but nothing is confirmed yet. Kong said two consultants had been appointed, a design consultant and an independent checker, to monitor the project. The construction of the 197 km of tracks, at an estimated cost between RM6-7 billion, would take three years. On 27 October 2015, the public display exercise, required for all development of new railways under Section 84 of Malaysia's Land Public Transport Act 2010, for the Gemas-Johor Bahru Electrification Double Tracking Project began and will run until 27 January 2016. According to documents on display to the public, construction is expected to begin in 2016 and be completed in 2021 (old plan).All materials available for public inspection are available at http://www.mot.gov.my/my/projek-pembangunan/projek-pembangunan-rel/projek- gemas-jb = Current Developments = The length of the line to be electrified and double-tracked is 197 km between Chainage 563.040 at Gemas and Chainage 754.180 at Johor Bahru. The project includes the construction of 11 stations at , , , , , , , , , and , and 3 future stations at , and . The upgraded line is supposed to cater for at least 22 services daily involving KTM ETS, KTM Intercity and shuttle train services. The documents displayed also stated that the electrification for the stretch will have the same specifications as that of the Seremban-Gemas stretch, name at 25 kV AC 50 Hz single phase and supplied via an overhead catenary. Train operations for this stretch will be integrated with the Train Control Centres at KL Sentral and Gemas. The designed speed for the tracks is 160 km/h.This is expected to reduce the time taken for travel between Kl Sentral and Gemas from 6 houirs to approximately 3.5 hours. On 11 December 2015, the Chinese company China Railway Construction Company (CRCC) has been awarded to build the Gemas ‚Äì Johor Bahru Electrification and Double-Tracking project within a consortium comprising itself, China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) and China Communications Construction Corp (CCCC). A local joint- venture consortium, SIPP-YTL JV is the local sub contractor and is responsible for civil work including the upgrading of all stations. The construction is planned to start by Jan 2018 and is expected to complete by Oct 2022. Terminal Skypark Line The under construction of Skypark Line taken from Persiaran Kerjaya, Glenmarie The Electrified Double Tracking Project consists of two phases. Phase 1 is between Subang Jaya to Subang Skypark which has been awarded to Skypark Link-Lion Pacific and phase 2 is between Subang Skypark to KTM/MRT Sg. Buloh to relief rail cargo traffic bypass city centre of Kuala Lumpur. The phase 1 between Subang Jaya and Terminal Skypark was funded by the Government through Ministry of Transport to provide rail based public transport especially to connect the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah (SAAS) Airport Terminal 3 (Terminal Skypark) and the vicinity area with the existing railway. When complete, this line will be Malaysia's second airport rail link service, after the Express Rail Link (KLIA Ekspres). The phase 1 line was due to be completed by April 2018. Generally, the project consists of two main section i.e. at grade section in between Subang Jaya and old Sri Subang spur line for the length of 4.09 km using the existing railway reserve previously funded by Petronas to transport fuel to the airport and also the new section in between new location of Sri Subang for the total length of 4.067 km which is elevated rail track along the existing Sungai Damansara river reserve and till end up at car park nearby Terminal Subang Skypark. Klang Valley Double Track Project The project was implemented by Keretapi Tanah Melayu began in 2016 and phase 1 is expected to be completed by 2021. The project entails the rehabilitation of 42 km of tracks between and as well as and Simpang Batu.

He currently holds a variety of coaching positions with the Football Association of Finland. Player A native of Finland, Liekoski was drafted into the Finnish army when he was eighteen. After completing his service two years later, he moved to the United States. In 1964, Liekoski was working as a dishwasher when Al Miller noticed him watching Miller and his teammates practicing. At the time Miller played for the amateur Kingston Kickers and coached at the State University of New York at New Paltz. Miller invited Liekoski, a goalkeeper, to join the Kingston Kickers. After Liekoski proved his worth, Miller then recruited him into the New Paltz State soccer team. Miller moved to Hartwick College after Liekoski's freshman season, and took Liekoski with him. Liekoski sat out a season, per NCAA rules, then played his sophomore and junior seasons as the Warriors starting goalkeeper. After breaking his wrist during the preseason to his senior year, Liekoski moved to defender where he was a second team All American.1969 All Americans He graduated in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in economics and later earned a master's degree in education from Whittier College. Coach College Liekoski began his coaching career in 1972 when he served as the first head coach of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee soccer team. In 1973, Liekoski replaced Miller as head coach of the Hartwick College men's soccer team. He lasted only two seasons and compiled a 30‚Äì9‚Äì7 record. He took the Hawks to the 1974 NCAA Final Four and was inducted into the Hartwick College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.Hartwick Hawks Hall of Fame Professional In 1976, Miller became head coach of the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League. He brought Liekoski in as an assistant that year. In 1978, he became the head coach of the Houston Hurricane.

According to a retracted article by The Guardian, eyeball-licking was \\"seen as a new second-base; the thing you graduate to when kissing gets boring\\", possibly due to it being featured in a music video by the Japanese band Born. Further reports, e.g. in an article by the Huffington Post later corrected as a possible hoax, showed an increase in Japanese schoolchildren wearing eyepatches due to eye infections arising from the act, with one school finding one third of 12-year-old students admitting to engaging in oculolinctus.David Moye, 2013-06-12, \\"Eyeball Licking Causing Pinkeye In Japan\\", The Huffington Post (later corrected as a hoax) There are also accounts of this practice in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Risks of licking an eyeball The practice is associated with significant health risks, as tongues are coated with a film of microorganisms. These microorganisms may cause infections in the eye such as conjunctivitis, herpes, chlamydia, corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers. Oral bacteria on the tongue can potentially enter corneal scratches caused by licking the eye, which then lead to infection.Ashik Siddique, 2013-06-12, \\"Eyeball Licking ‚ÄòOculolinctus‚Äô Fetish Spreads Pink Eye Among Japanese Preteens\\", Medical Daily Furthermore, there is also the risk of blindness from the resulting infections, as well as styes.

An X-ray astronomy satellite studies X-ray emissions from celestial objects, as part of a branch of space science known as X-ray astronomy. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites. A detector is placed on a satellite which is then put into orbit well above the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike balloons, instruments on satellites are able to observe the full range of the X-ray spectrum. Unlike sounding rockets, they can collect data for as long as the instruments continue to operate. For example, the Chandra X-ray Observatory has been operational for more than fifteen years. Active X-ray observatory satellites Satellites in use today include the XMM-Newton observatory (low to mid energy X-rays 0.1-15 keV) and the INTEGRAL satellite (high energy X-rays 15-60 keV). Both were launched by the European Space Agency. NASA has launched the Swift and Chandra observatories. One of the instruments on Swift is the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT). This SXI image of the Sun was a first test of the imager taken on August 13, 2009, at 14:04:58 UTC. The GOES 14 spacecraft carries on board a Solar X-ray Imager to monitor the Sun's X-rays for the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment. It was launched into orbit on June 27, 2009, at 22:51 GMT from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. On January 30, 2009, the Russian Federal Space Agency successfully launched the Koronas-Foton which carries several experiments to detect X-rays, including the TESIS telescope/spectrometer FIAN with SphinX soft X-ray spectrophotometer. ISRO launched the multi-wavelength space observatory Astrosat in 2015. One of the unique features of ASTROSAT mission is that it enables the simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various astronomical objects with a single satellite. ASTROSAT observes universe in the optical, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band. The Italian Space Agency (ASI) gamma-ray observatory satellite Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Imagini Leggero (AGILE) has on board the Super-AGILE 15-45 keV hard X-ray detector. It was launched on April 23, 2007, by the Indian PSLV-C8. The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) is a Chinese X-ray space observatory, launched on June 15, 2017 to observe black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei and other phenomena based on their X-ray and gamma-ray emissions. The 'Lobster-Eye X-ray Satellite' was launched on 25 July 2020 by CNSA. it is the first in-orbit telescope to utilize the Lobster-Eye imaging technology of ultra-large field of view imaging to search for dark matter signals in the x-ray energy range. A soft X-ray solar imaging telescope is on board the GOES-13 weather satellite launched using a Delta IV from Cape Canaveral LC37B on May 24, 2006. However, there have been no GOES 13 SXI images since December 2006. Although the Suzaku X-ray spectrometer (the first micro-calorimeter in space) failed on August 8, 2005, after launch on July 10, 2005, the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) are still functioning. Past X-ray observatory satellites Past observatories include SMART-1, which contained an X-ray telescope for mapping lunar X-ray fluorescence, ROSAT, the Einstein Observatory (the first fully imaging X-ray telescope), the ASCA observatory, EXOSAT, and BeppoSAX. Uhuru was the first satellite launched specifically for the purpose of X-ray astronomy. Copernicus which carried an X-ray detector built by University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory made extensive X-ray observations. ANS could measure X-ray photons in the energy range 2 to 30 keV. Ariel 5 was dedicated to observing the sky in the X-ray band. HEAO-1 scanned the X-ray sky over 0.2 keV - 10 MeV. Hakucho was Japan's first X-ray astronomy satellite. ISRO's IRS-P3 launched in 1996 with the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on board which aimed to study the time variability and spectral characteristics of cosmic X-ray sources and for detection of transient X-ray sources. IXAE instruments consisted of three identical pointed mode proportional counters (PPCs) operated in the energy range 2-20 keV, FOV of 2¬∞ x 2¬∞ and effective area of 1200 cm2, and an X-ray sky monitor (XSM) operating in the energy range 2-10 keV. Array of low- energy X-ray imaging sensors The Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors (ALEXIS) featured curved mirrors whose multilayer coatings reflect and focus low-energy X-rays or extreme ultraviolet light the way optical telescopes focus visible light. The launch of ALEXIS was provided by the United States Air Force Space Test Program on a Pegasus Booster on April 25, 1993. The spacing of the molybdenum (Mo) and silicon (Si) layers on each telescope's mirror is the primary determinant of the telescope's photon energy response function. ALEXIS operated for 12 yr. OSO-3 The Third Orbiting Solar Observatory, OSO 3, carried a hard X-ray experiment (7.7 to 210 keV) and an MIT gamma-ray instrument (>50 MeV), besides a complement of solar physics instruments. The third Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 3) was launched on March 8, 1967, into a nearly circular orbit of mean altitude 550 km, inclined at 33¬∞ to the equatorial plane, deactivated on June 28, 1968, followed by reentry on April 4, 1982. Its XRT consisted of a continuously spinning wheel (1.7 s period) in which the hard X-ray experiment was mounted with a radial view. The XRT assembly was a single thin NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal plus phototube enclosed in a howitzer-shaped CsI(Tl) anti-coincidence shield. The energy resolution was 45% at 30 keV. The instrument operated from 7.7 to 210 keV with 6 channels. OSO-3 obtained extensive observations of solar flares, the diffuse component of cosmic X-rays, and the observation of a single flare episode from Scorpius X-1, the first observation of an extrasolar X-ray source by an observatory satellite. Among the extrasolar X-ray sources OSO 3 observed were UV Ceti, YZ Canis Minoris, EV Lacertae and AD Leonis, yielding upper soft X-ray detection limits on flares from these sources. ESRO 2B (Iris) Iris was mainly intended to study X-ray and particle emissions from the Sun, however, it is credited with some extra-solar observations. ESRO 2B (Iris) was the first successful ESRO satellite launch. Iris was launched on May 17, 1968, had an elliptical orbit with (initially) apogee 1086 km, perigee 326 km, and inclination 97.2¬∞, with an orbital period of 98.9 minutes. The satellite carried seven instruments to detect high energy cosmic rays, determine the total flux of solar X-rays, and measure trapped radiation, Van Allen belt protons and cosmic ray protons. Of special significance for X-ray astronomy were two X-ray instruments: one designed to detect wavelengths 1-20 √Ö (0.1-2 nm) (consisting of proportional counters with varying window thickness) and one designed to detect wavelengths 44-60 √Ö (4.4-6.0 nm) (consisting of proportional counters with thin Mylar windows). Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) is a method used to count the number of X-rays of a specific wavelength diffracted by a crystal. WDS only counts X-rays of a single wavelength or wavelength band. In order to interpret the data, the expected elemental wavelength peak locations need to be known. For the ESRO-2B WDS X-ray instruments, calculations of the expected solar spectrum had to be performed and were compared to peaks detected by rocket measurements. Other X-ray detecting satellites *The SOLar RADiation satellite program (SOLRAD) was conceived in the late 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity. Solrad 1 is launched on June 22, 1960, aboard a Thor Able from Cape Canaveral at 1:54 a.m. EDT. As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, Solrad 1 determined that radio fade-outs were caused by solar X-ray emissions. *The first in a series of 8 successfully launched Orbiting Solar Observatories (OSO 1, launched on March 7, 1963) had as its primary mission to measure solar electromagnetic radiation in the UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regions. *OGO 1, the first of the Orbiting Geophysical Observatories (OGOs), was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy on September 5, 1964, and placed into an initial orbit of 281 √ó 149,385 km at 31¬∞ inclination. A secondary objective was to detect gamma-ray bursts from the Sun in the energy range 80 keV - 1 MeV. The experiment consisted of 3 CsI crystals surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence shield. Once every 18.5 seconds, integral intensity measurements were made in each of 16 energy channels which were equally spaced over the 0.08-1 MeV range. OGO 1 was completely terminated on November 1, 1971. Although the satellite did not achieve its goals due to electrical interference and secular degradation, searching back through the data after the discovery of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by the Vela satellites revealed the detection of one or more such events in the OGO 1 data. *Solar X-ray bursts were observed by OSO 2 and an effort was made to map the entire celestial sphere for direction and intensity of X-radiation. GRAB 1 satellite, which carried two sets of instruments: Solrad 1 and Tattletale. *The first USA satellite which detected cosmic X-rays was the third Orbiting Solar Observatory, or OSO-3, launched on March 8, 1967. It was intended primarily to observe the Sun, which it did very well during its 2-year lifetime, but it also detected a flaring episode from the source Sco X-1 and measured the diffuse cosmic X-ray background. *The fourth successful Orbiting Solar Observatory, OSO 4, was launched on October 18, 1967. The objectives of the OSO 4 satellite were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere and to measure the direction and intensity over the entire celestial sphere in UV, X, and gamma radiation. The OSO 4 platform consisted of a sail section (which pointed 2 instruments continuously toward the Sun) and a wheel section which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail (which contained 7 experiments). The spacecraft performed normally until a second tape recorder failed in May 1968. OSO 4 was put into a \\"standby\\" mode in November 1969. It could be turned on only for recording special events in real-time. One such event occurred on March 7, 1970, during a solar eclipse. The spacecraft became totally inoperable on December 7, 1971. *OGO 5 was launched on March 4, 1968. The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly elliptical initial orbit with a 272 km perigee and a 148,228 km apogee. The orbital inclination was 31.1¬∞. The satellite took 3796 minutes to complete one orbit. The Energetic Radiations from Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971. Primarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray bursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The detector was a 0.5 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5 cm2 area. Data were accumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80, 80-104, 104-128, and > 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1.15 seconds once every 2.3 seconds. *Cosmos 215 was launched April 19, 1968 and contained an X-ray experiment. Orbit characteristics: 261 √ó 426 km, at an inclination of 48.5¬∞. The orbital period was ~ 91 minutes. It was intended primarily to perform solar studies, but did detect some non-solar X-ray events. It reentered the atmosphere on June 30, 1968. *The Soviet Union's Intercosmos series began in 1969. *OSO 5 was launched on January 22, 1969, and lasted until July 1975. It was the 5th satellite put into orbit as part of the Orbiting Solar Observatory program. This program was intended to launch a series of nearly identical satellites to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle. The circular orbit had an altitude of 555 km and an inclination of 33¬∞. The spin rate of the satellite was 1.8 s. The data produced a spectrum of the diffuse background over the energy range 14-200 keV. *OSO 6 was launched on August 9, 1969. Its orbital period was ~95 min. The spacecraft had a spin rate of 0.5 rps. On board was a hard X-ray detector (27-189 keV) with a 5.1 cm2 NaI(Tl) scintillator, collimated to 17¬∞ √ó 23¬∞ FWHM. The system had 4 energy channels (separated 27-49-75-118-189 keV). The detector spun with the spacecraft on a plane containing the Sun direction within ¬± 3.5¬∞. Data were read with alternate 70 ms and 30 ms integrations for 5 intervals every 320 ms. TRW. The two satellites, A and B, are separated after launch on May 23, 1969. *The Vela satellites 5A and 5B, launched on May 23, 1969, are responsible for significant discoveries of gamma-ray bursts and astronomical X-ray sources including V 0332+53. *Like the previous Vela 5 satellites, the Vela 6 nuclear test detection satellites were part of a program run jointly by the Advanced Research Projects of the U. S. Department of Defense and the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, managed by the U. S. Air Force. The twin spacecraft, Vela 6A and 6B, were launched on April 8, 1970. Data from the Vela 6 satellites were used to look for correlations between gamma-ray bursts and X-ray events. At least 2 good candidates were found, GB720514 and GB740723. The X-ray detectors failed on Vela 6A on March 12, 1972, and on Vela 6B on January 27, 1972. *Cosmos 428 was launched by the USSR into Earth orbit on June 24, 1971, and recovered July 6, 1971. The orbit characteristics: apogee/perigee/inclination 208 km, 271 km, and 51.8¬∞, respectively. It was a military satellite on which X-ray astronomy experiments had been added. There was a scintillation spectrometer sensitive to X-rays >30 keV, with a 2¬∞ √ó 17¬∞ field of view. In addition, there was an X-ray telescope which operated in the range 2-30 keV. Cosmos 428 detected several X-ray sources which were correlated to already identified Uhuru point sources. *Following on the success of Uhuru (SAS 1), NASA launched the Second Small Astronomy Satellite SAS 2. It was launched from the San Marco platform off the coast of Kenya, Africa, into a nearly equatorial orbit. The satellites launched with the Thor- Delta rocket system became known as the TD satellites. TD-1A was successfully launched on March 11, 1972, from Vandenberg Air Force Base (March 12 in Europe). *TD-1A was put in a nearly circular polar sun-synchronous orbit, with apogee 545 km, perigee 533 km, and inclination 97.6¬∞. It was ESRO's first 3-axis stabilized satellite, with one axis pointing to the Sun to within ¬±5¬∞. The optical axis was maintained perpendicular to the solar pointing axis and to the orbital plane. It scanned the entire celestial sphere every 6 months, with a great circle being scanned every satellite revolution. After about 2 months of operation, both of the satellite's tape recorders failed. A network of ground stations was put together so that real-time telemetry from the satellite was recorded for about 60% of the time. After 6 months in orbit, the satellite entered a period of regular eclipses as the satellite passed behind the Earth‚Äîcutting off sunlight to the solar panels. The satellite was put into hibernation for 4 months, until the eclipse period passed, after which systems were turned back on and another 6 months of observations were made. TD-1A was primarily a UV mission however it carried both a cosmic X-ray and a gamma-ray detector. TD-1A reentered on January 9, 1980. *To continue the intensive X-ray investigation of the Sun and the cosmic X-ray background, OSO 7 was launched on September 29, 1971. OSO 7 made the first observation of solar gamma-ray line emission, due to electron/positron annihilation at 511 keV, from a solar flare in April 1972. *To conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy and solar physics among others the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) built Aryabhata. It was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975, from Kapustin Yar. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit. *The third US Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3) was launched on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability. SAS 3 was the first to discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the soft X-ray background (0.1-0.28 keV). *Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 8) was launched on June 21, 1975. While OSO 8's primary objective was to observe the Sun, four instruments were dedicated to observations of other celestial X-ray sources brighter than a few milliCrab. A sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 \\"mCrab\\"). OSO 8 ceased operations on October 1, 1978. The Signe 3 spacecraft is operated by the Centre D'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Toulouse, France. *Signe 3 (launched on June 17, 1977) was part of the Soviet Union's Intercosmos program. *Bhaskara was the second Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) satellite. It was launched on June 7, 1979, with a modified SS-5 Skean IRBM plus upper stage from Kapustin Yar in the Soviet Union. A secondary objective was to conduct X-ray astronomy investigations. Bhaskara 2 was launched on November 20, 1981, from Kapustin Yar like its predecessor also in size, mass and design may have conducted X-ray astronomy investigations. *On March 23, 1983, at 12:45:06 UTC, the Astron spacecraft is launched into an orbit around the Earth with an apogee of 185,000 km allowing it to make observations with an onboard X-ray spectroscope outside the Earth's umbra and radiation belt. Observations of Hercules X-1 are made from 1983 to 1987 in both the prolonged low state (\\"off\\" state) and \\"high on\\" state. WIND satellite. *The Global Geospace Science (GGS) Polar Satellite was a NASA science spacecraft launched at 06:23:59.997 EST on February 24, 1996, aboard a McDonnell Douglas Delta II 7925-10 rocket from launch pad 2W at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California, to observe the Earth's polar magnetosphere. Polar is in a highly elliptical orbit, at an 86¬∞ inclination with an orbital period of ~18 hrs. It gathers multi-wavelength imaging (including X-ray) of the aurora, and measures the entry of plasma into the polar magnetosphere and the geomagnetic tail, the flow of plasma to and from the ionosphere, and the deposition of particle energy in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Polar Mission Operations were terminated at 14:54:41 EDT on April 28, 2008. The Astron spacecraft is based on Venera. *A later satellite of the Intercosmos series, Intercosmos 26, (launched on March 2, 1994) as part of the Coronas-I international project may have conducted X-ray studies of the Sun. *Hitomi, formerly known as Astro-H, was a Japanese satellite which attempted to re-fly the microcalorimeter that failed on the Suzaku mission, along with hard-X-ray and soft-gamma instruments. It launched successfully on February 17, 2016. However, spacecraft controllers lost communications with Hitomi on March 26, and declared the spacecraft lost April 28. Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites eROSITA and ART- XC Among the contracts negotiated in August 2009 at the MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon there was an agreement signed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The contract details the creation of the Orbital Astrophysics Observatory Spectrum-X-Gamma (SXG) initially planned to be launched in 2012.Spektr-RG to expand horizons of X-ray astronomy In May 2015 plans call for a 2016 launch.eROSITA, 26.05.2015 it is planned to launch in Sept 2017. According to Mikhail Pavlinsky, deputy head of the Space Research Institute (SPI), the total project cost nears ‚Ç¨50 million. Under the agreement, Germany will provide the main of the two X-ray telescopes (eROSITA), while Russia will install it on its platform, prepare the spacecraft, and take care of all related issues. Russia will also install an additional telescope (ART-XC) on this platform. The new observatory will help scientists perform an all-sky scan survey.New X-Ray Telescopes Search for Galaxy Clusters and Massive Black Holes, 16.09.2009 ATHENA Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics was selected in 2013 as a second large mission of the Cosmic Vision programme. It will be one hundred times more sensitive than the best of existing X-ray telescopes. Solar Orbiter The Solar Orbiter (SOLO) will approach to 62 solar radii to view the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution in visible, XUV, and X-rays. The nominally 6 yr mission will be from an elliptical orbit around the Sun with perihelion as low as 0.28 AU and with increasing inclination (using gravity assists from Venus) up to more than 30¬∞ with respect to the solar equator. The Orbiter will deliver images and data from the polar regions and the side of the Sun not visible from Earth. The launch date, if selected, could be Jan 2017. Astro-H2 In July 2016 there were discussions between JAXA and NASA on launching a satellite to replace the Hitomi telescope lost in 2016. The launch goal is 2020. International X-ray Observatory International X-ray Observatory (IXO) was a cancelled observatory. a result of the merging of NASA's Constellation-X and ESA/JAXA's XEUS mission concepts. It was planned to feature a single large X-ray mirror with a 3 m2 collecting area and 5\\" angular resolution, and a suite of instrumentation, including a wide field imaging detector, a hard X-ray imaging detector, a high-spectral-resolution imaging spectrometer (calorimeter), a grating spectrometer, a high timing resolution spectrometer, and a polarimeter. Constellation-X Constellation-X was early proposal that was superseded by IXO. It was to provide high resolution X-ray spectroscopy to probe matter as it falls into a black hole, as well as probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy by observing the formation of clusters of galaxies.

X-ray astronomy detectors are instruments that detect X-rays for use in the study of X-ray astronomy. X-ray astronomy is an observational branch of astronomy which deals with the study of X-ray emission from celestial objects. X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites. X-ray astronomy is part of space science. X-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time. Detection and imaging of X-rays Chandra's image of Saturn (left) and Hubble optical image of Saturn (right). Saturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun. 14 April 2003 X-rays span 3 decades in wavelength (~8 nm - 8 pm), frequency (~50 PHz - 50 EHz) and energy (~0.12 - 120 keV). In terms of temperature, 1 eV = 11,604 K. Thus X-rays (0.12 to 120 keV) correspond to 1.39 √ó 106 to 1.39 √ó 109 K. From 10 to 0.1 nanometers (nm) (about 0.12 to 12 keV) they are classified as soft X-rays, and from 0.1 nm to 0.01 nm (about 12 to 120 keV) as hard X-rays. Closer to the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum is the ultraviolet. The draft ISO standard on determining solar irradiances (ISO- DIS-21348) describes the ultraviolet as ranging from ~10 nm to ~400 nm. That portion closest to X-rays is often referred to as the \\"extreme ultraviolet\\" (EUV or XUV). When an EUV photon is absorbed, photoelectrons and secondary electrons are generated by ionization, much like what happens when X-rays or electron beams are absorbed by matter. The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes had a longer wavelength than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei (gamma rays). So older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10‚àí11 m, defined as gamma rays. However, as shorter wavelength continuous spectrum \\"X-ray\\" sources such as linear accelerators and longer wavelength \\"gamma ray\\" emitters were discovered, the wavelength bands largely overlapped. The two types of radiation are now usually distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus. Although the more energetic X-rays, photons with an energy greater than 30 keV (4,800 aJ), can penetrate the air at least for distances of a few meters, the Earth's atmosphere is thick enough that virtually none are able to penetrate from outer space all the way to the Earth's surface (they would have been detected and medical X-ray machines would not work if this was not the case). X-rays in the 0.5 to 5 keV (80 to 800 aJ) range, where most celestial sources give off the bulk of their energy, can be stopped by a few sheets of paper; 90% of the photons in a beam of 3 keV (480 aJ) X-rays are absorbed by traveling through just 10 cm of air. To detect X-rays from the sky, X-ray detectors must be flown above most of the Earth's atmosphere. There are three main methods of doing so: sounding rocket flights, balloons, and satellites. Proportional counters A proportional counter is a type of gaseous ionization detector that counts particles of ionizing radiation and measures their energy. It works on the same principle as the Geiger-M√ºller counter, but uses a lower operating voltage. All X-ray proportional counters consist of a windowed gas cell. Often this cell is subdivided into a number of low- and high-electric field regions by some arrangement of electrodes. An individual medium energy proportional counter on EXOSAT had a front window of beryllium with aluminized kapton foil for thermal protection, a front chamber filled with an argon/CO2 mixture, a rear chamber with xenon/CO2, and a beryllium window separating the two chambers. The argon portion of the detector was optimized for 2-6 keV and the total energy ranges for both detectors was 1.5-15 keV and 5-50 keV, respectively. The US portion of the Apollo-Soyuz mission (July 1975) carried a proportional counter system sensitive to 0.18-0.28 and 0.6-10.0 keV X-rays. The total effective area was 0.1 m2, and there was a 4.5¬∞ FWHM circular FOV. The French TOURNESOL instrument consisted of four proportional counters and two optical detectors. The proportional counters detected photons between 2 keV and 20 MeV in a 6¬∞ √ó 6¬∞ FOV. The visible detectors had a field of view of 5¬∞ √ó 5¬∞. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events. X-ray monitor Monitoring generally means to be aware of the state of a system. A device that displays or sends a signal for displaying X-ray output from an X-ray generating source so as to be aware of the state of the source is referred to as an X-ray monitor in space applications. On Apollo 15 in orbit above the Moon, for example, an X-ray monitor was used to follow the possible variation in solar X-ray intensity and spectral shape while mapping the lunar surface with respect to its chemical composition due to the production of secondary X-rays. The X-ray monitor of Solwind, designated NRL-608 or XMON, was a collaboration between the Naval Research Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The monitor consisted of 2 collimated argon proportional counters. The instrument bandwidth of 3-10 keV was defined by the detector window absorption (the window was 0.254 mm beryllium) and the upper level discriminator. The active gas volume (P-10 mixture) was 2.54 cm deep, providing good efficiency up to 10 keV. Counts were recorded in 2 energy channels. Slat collimators defined a FOV of 3¬∞ √ó 30¬∞ (FWHM) for each detector; the long axes of the FOVs were perpendicular to each other. The long axes were inclined 45¬∞ to the scan direction, allowing localization of transient events to about 1¬∞. The centers of the FOVs coincided, and were pointed 40¬∞ below the scan equator of the wheel in order to avoid scanning across the Sun. The spacecraft wheel rotated once every 6 seconds. This scan rate corresponds to 1¬∞ every 16 milliseconds (ms); counts were telemetered in 64 or 32 ms bins to minimize smearing the collimator response. The instrument parameters and data yield implied a 3 œÉ point source sensitivity of 30 UFU in one day's operation (1 UFU = 2.66‚àí12 erg/cm2-s-keV). Each detector was about 0.1 of the area of the Uhuru instrument. The instrument background at low geomagnetic latitudes was ~16 counts/s. Of this background, ~6 counts/s comes from the diffuse cosmic X-ray background, with the rest being instrumental. Assuming a conservative 10% data return, the net source duty cycle in scanning mode was 1.4 √ó 10‚àí3, implying a source exposure of 120 seconds per day. For a background of 16 counts/s, the 3 œÉ error in determining the flux from a given sky bin was then 4.5 counts/s, or about 45 UFU, after 1 day. A limiting sensitivity of 30 UFU was obtained by combining both detectors. A comparable error existed in the flux determination for moderately bright galactic sources. Source confusion due to the 5¬∞ FOV projected along the scan direction complicated the observation of sources in the galactic bulge region (approximately 30¬∞ > l > -30¬∞, b < 10¬∞). Scintillation detector A scintillator is a material which exhibits the property of luminescence when excited by ionizing radiation. Luminescent materials, when struck by an incoming particle, such as an X-ray photon, absorb its energy and scintillate, i.e. reemit the absorbed energy in the form of a small flash of light, typically in the visible range. Scintillation crystal surrounded by various scintillation detector assemblies The scintillation X-ray detector (XC) aboard Vela 5A and its twin Vela 5B consisted of two 1 mm thick NaI(Tl) crystals mounted on photomultiplier tubes and covered by a 0.13 mm thick beryllium window. Electronic thresholds provided two energy channels, 3-12 keV and 6-12 keV. In front of each crystal was a slat collimator providing a full width at half maximum (FWHM) aperture of ~6.1 √ó 6.1¬∞. The effective detector area was ~26 cm2. Sensitivity to celestial sources was severely limited by the high intrinsic detector background. The X-ray telescope onboard OSO 4 consisted of a single thin NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal plus phototube assembly enclosed in a CsI(Tl) anti-coincidence shield. The energy resolution was 45% at 30 keV. The instrument operated from ~8 to 200 keV with 6 channel resolution. OSO 5 carried a CsI crystal scintillator. The central crystal was 0.635 cm thick, had a sensitive area of 70 cm2, and was viewed from behind by a pair of photomultiplier tubes. The shield crystal had a wall thickness of 4.4 cm and was viewed by 4 photomultipliers. The field of view was ~40¬∞. The energy range covered was 14-254 keV. There were 9 energy channels: the first covering 14-28 keV and the others equally spaced from 28 to 254 keV. In-flight calibration was done with an 241Am source. The PHEBUS experiment recorded high energy transient events in the range 100 keV to 100 MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germinate (BGO) crystal 78 mm in diameter by 120 mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4œÄ steradians. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5 MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 œÉ (standard deviations) in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 channels over the energy range. The KONUS-B instrument consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10 keV to 8 MeV energy. They consisted of NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals 200 mm in diameter by 50 mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5 mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 5 √ó 10 to 5 √ó 10 ergs/cm¬≤, depending on the burst spectrum and rise time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16 s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8 s. Kvant-1 carried the HEXE, or High Energy X-ray Experiment, which employed a phoswich of sodium iodide and caesium iodide. It covered the energy range 15-200 keV with a 1.6¬∞ √ó 1.6¬∞ FOV FWHM. Each of the 4 identical detectors had a geometric area of 200 cm2. The maximum time resolution was 0.3-25 ms. Modulation collimator In electronics, Modulation is the process of varying one waveform in relation to another waveform. With a 'modulation collimator' the amplitude (intensity) of the incoming X-rays is reduced by the presence of two or more 'diffraction gratings' of parallel wires that block or greatly reduce that portion of the signal incident upon the wires. An X-ray collimator is a device that filters a stream of X-rays so that only those traveling parallel to a specified direction are allowed through. Minoru Oda, President of Tokyo University of Information Sciences, invented the modulation collimator, first used to identify the counterpart of Sco X-1 in 1966, which led to the most accurate positions for X-ray sources available, prior to the launch of X-ray imaging telescopes. SAS 3 carried modulation collimators (2-11 keV) and Slat and Tube collimators (1 up to 60keV). On board the Granat International Astrophysical Observatory were four WATCH instruments that could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180 keV range to within 0.5¬∞ using a Rotation Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% FWHM at 60 keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180 keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 s per 36 s. The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), Explorer 81, images solar flares from soft X-rays to gamma rays (~3 keV to ~20 MeV). Its imaging capability is based on a Fourier-transform technique using a set of 9 rotational modulation collimators. X-ray spectrometer OSO 8 had on board a Graphite Crystal X-ray Spectrometer, with energy range of 2-8 keV, FOV 3¬∞. The Granat ART-S X-ray spectrometer covered the energy range 3 to 100 keV, FOV 2¬∞ √ó 2¬∞. The instrument consisted of four detectors based on spectroscopic MWPCs, making an effective area of 2,400 cm¬≤ at 10 keV and 800 cm¬≤ at 100 keV. The time resolution was 200 microseconds. The X-ray spectrometer aboard ISEE-3 was designed to study both solar flares and cosmic gamma-ray bursts over the energy range 5-228 keV. The detector provided full-time coverage, 3œÄ FOV for E > 130 keV, time resolution of 0.25 ms, and absolute timing to within 1 ms. It was intended to be a part of a long-baseline interferometry network of widely separated spacecraft. The efforts were aimed primarily at determining the origin of the bursts through precise directional information established by such a network. The experiment consisted of 2 cylindrical X-ray detectors: a Xenon filled proportional counter covering 5-14 keV, and a NaI(Tl) scintillator covering 12-1250 keV. The proportional counter was 1.27 cm in diameter and was filled with a mixture of 97% Xenon and 3% carbon dioxide. The central part of the counter body was made of 0.51 mm thick beryllium and served as the X-ray entrance window. The scintillator consisted of a 1.0 cm thick cylindrical shell of NaI(Tl) crystal surrounded on all sides by 0.3 cm thick plastic scintillator. The central region, 4.1 cm in diameter, was filled by a quartz light pipe. The whole assembly was enclosed (except for one end) in a 0.1 cm thick beryllium container. The energy channel resolution and timing resolution could be selected by commands sent to the spacecraft. The proportional counter could have up to 9 channels with 0.5 s resolution; the NaI scintillator could have up to 16 channels and 0.00025 s resolution. CCDs Most existing X-ray telescopes use CCD detectors, similar to those in visible-light cameras. In visible-light, a single photon can produce a single electron of charge in a pixel, and an image is built up by accumulating many such charges from many photons during the exposure time. When an X-ray photon hits a CCD, it produces enough charge (hundreds to thousands of electrons, proportional to its energy) that the individual X-rays have their energies measured on read-out. Microcalorimeters Microcalorimeters can only detect X-rays one photon at a time (but can measure the energy of each). Transition edge sensors TES devices are the next step in microcalorimetry. In essence they are super-conducting metals kept as close as possible to their transition temperature. This is the temperature at which these metals become super-conductors and their resistance drops to zero. These transition temperatures are usually just a few degrees above absolute zero (usually less than 10 K).

St.Dominic's Fair, 2006 St. Dominic's Fair, together with Weihnachtmarkt and Oktoberfest, is one of the biggest trade and cultural open- air events in Europe, organized in the Main City ‚Äì the representative part of Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. History ≈õw. Ducha Street. St. Dominic's Fair, 2008 With 750 years of successful tradition, the history of the Fair goes back to the year 1260, when it was established by the decree of Pope Alexander IV. Saint Dominic was canonized in 1234 and his feast day was immediately included in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 5 August. With the introduction of the Tridentine Calendar in 1568, his feast was moved to 4 August, where it remained until the 1969 revision moved it to 8 August.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 100 It was thus at some time between 1568 and 1969 that it became customary to announce the opening of the Fair by the ringing of bells at noon on 4 August. In the beginning, it was all about prayers and entertainment, but later the Fair began to function as a trade and cultural event with great importance to the city. At first, it was held at the Dominic Square but, as the event developed, it needed greater space, so the Fair was moved into the area of Wa≈Çy Jagiello≈Ñskie and D≈Çuga Streets. Also, the new market places, such as Targ Drzewny, Targ Sienny, Targ Wƒôglowy, Targ WƒÖchany or Targ Rybny were created. Their names were closely related to the goods, which were sold on each market and in the case of D≈Çugi Targ the name was derived from its shape. Around 400 ships sailed to Port of Gda≈Ñsk for the August fair and the transactions were held in many languages. It was possible to buy famous Toru≈Ñ gingerbreads, Kashubian ceramics, Czech glass, Eastern furs and carpets, English cloth, gypsy pots, Goldwasser (type of vodka) and amber. Apart from merchants, in the Fair participated also circus performers, jugglers, acrobats and theatre groups. St. Dominic's Fair became an important event for the city, attended by gentry and even by the king himself. The most memorable fair for the citizens was the one from the year 1310, when, during the absence of the king W≈Çadys≈Çaw the Elbow-high, the Teutonic Knights plundered the city for the first time, killing many merchants and other participants of the Fair. St. Dominic's Fair had been organized annually for the centuries. However, the outbreak of the Second World War caused the Fair to disappear from the city for 33 years. In 1972, owing to the efforts of Wojciech ≈öwiƒôcicki, a journalist from a popular Gda≈Ñsk evening paper ‚ÄúWiecz√≥r Wybrze≈ºa‚Äù, the tradition of the Fair was restored. In the 1970s the Fair was mostly viewed as a trade event, providing the opportunity to buy desired goods. During special fashion shows commonly called ‚ÄúLive Journal‚Äù the latest Polish fashion collections were presented. St. Dominic‚Äôs Fair today For many years, since its reactivation in 1972, the St. Dominic's Fair lasted for 2 weeks. In 2004, a decision was made to extend it up to 3 full weeks. Every year, about 1000 merchants, artists, artisans and collectors take part in the Fair, and it is visited by an average of 70,000 people daily, whose number usually doubles at weekends. As the organizers declare, approximately 5 million people come and go through the Old Town of Gda≈Ñsk during each St. Dominic's Fair (in 2007 there were as many as 8.5 million of them which is still a record). The contemporary character of the event recalls the medieval tradition of fun and trade. One can find there an abundance of food stalls offering cold beer, meat, potatoes, sausages, and shish kebabs baked on a gridiron. Tourists from abroad will additionally have a unique opportunity to taste some traditional Polish dishes, like e.g. pierogi (dumplings), bigos (stewed dish made of sauerkraut and/or fresh cabbage, meat and mushrooms), or farmhouse bread with lard and dill pickles. Just as before the war, there is a funfair which used to be a major attraction during the times of the free city of Danzig. In year 1938 the funfair became even more famous when a 2-metre crocodile escaped from its menagerie and jumped into the Mot≈Çawa river. It took quite a long time to catch it, and the escape caused a general sensation. For obvious reasons, the funfair has changed its character throughout all those years. The halls of mirrors have disappeared and nobody cuts women into two pieces with a handsaw during magic shows; however, it still remains one of the main attractions for the youngest participants of the St. Dominic's Fair. The number of stalls increases each year, and the programme of the Fair is diversified by various cultural and entertainment events. On the stalls we can find numismatic and philatelic collections, as well as handicrafts, haberdashery, valuable cloths and antiques. All those products and many more may be bought on the popular flea market. Unfortunately, as it happens in other similar fairs in the world, some fake products are sold as well. In the past, for example, it was possible to buy pictures of Kossak, Witkacy and numerous other well-known painters. However, the majority of merchants and collectors are fair and treat visitors seriously. They arrive not only from the farthest corners of Poland but also from other countries, like Lithuania, Latvia, Germany, Austria, Sweden and such distant as Israel or Uzbekistan. All those foreign sellers offer products and souvenirs distinctive for their culture. The plan of the Fair * multibranch stalls - Szeroka, ≈õw.

Astrophysical X-ray sources are astronomical objects with physical properties which result in the emission of X-rays. There are a number of types of astrophysical objects which emit X-rays, from galaxy clusters, through black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) to galactic objects such as supernova remnants, stars, and binary stars containing a white dwarf (cataclysmic variable stars and super soft X-ray sources), neutron star or black hole (X-ray binaries). Some solar system bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the Moon, although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed X-ray background. The X-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung, either magnetic or ordinary Coulomb, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions. Furthermore, celestial entities in space are discussed as celestial X-ray sources. The origin of all observed astronomical X-ray sources is in, near to, or associated with a coronal cloud or gas at coronal cloud temperatures for however long or brief a period.  Galaxy clusters  X-ray photo by Chandra X-ray Observatory of the Bullet Cluster. Exposure time was 140 hours. The scale is shown in megaparsecs. Redshift (z) = 0.3, meaning its light has wavelengths stretched by a factor of 1.3. Clusters of galaxies are formed by the merger of smaller units of matter, such as galaxy groups or individual galaxies. The infalling material (which contains galaxies, gas and dark matter) gains kinetic energy as it falls into the cluster's gravitational potential well. The infalling gas collides with gas already in the cluster and is shock heated to between 107 and 108 K depending on the size of the cluster. This very hot gas emits X-rays by thermal bremsstrahlung emission, and line emission from metals (in astronomy, 'metals' often means all elements except hydrogen and helium). The galaxies and dark matter are collisionless and quickly become virialised, orbiting in the cluster potential well. At a statistical significance of 8œÉ, it was found that the spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law.  Quasars  { cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"vertical- align:top; float: right;\\" border=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  A view of 4C 71.07 from observations by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment. This helped convince scientists that they were studying data from the quasar and not some other source in the neighborhood.  In visible light, 4C 71.07 is less than impressive, just a distant speck of light. It's in radio and in X-rays ‚Äì and now, gamma rays ‚Äì that this object really shines. 4C 71.07 is its designation in the 4th Cambridge University catalog of radio sources. 4C 71.07 has a redshift of z=2.17, putting it about 11 billion years away in a 12 to 15-billion year-old universe (using z=1 as 5 billion light years). } A quasi- stellar radio source (quasar) is a very energetic and distant galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). QSO 0836+7107 is a Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO) that emits baffling amounts of radio energy. This radio emission is caused by electrons spiraling (thus accelerating) along magnetic fields producing cyclotron or synchrotron radiation. These electrons can also interact with visible light emitted by the disk around the AGN or the black hole at its center. These photons accelerate the electrons, which then emit X- and gamma- radiation via Compton and inverse Compton scattering. On board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) which detects in the 20 keV to 8 MeV range. QSO 0836+7107 or 4C 71.07 was detected by BATSE as a source of soft gamma rays and hard X-rays. \\"What BATSE has discovered is that it can be a soft gamma-ray source\\", McCollough said. QSO 0836+7107 is the faintest and most distant object to be observed in soft gamma rays. It has already been observed in gamma rays by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) also aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.  Seyfert galaxies  Seyfert galaxies are a class of galaxies with nuclei that produce spectral line emission from highly ionized gas. They are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and are thought to contain supermassive black holes.  X-ray bright galaxies  The following early-type galaxies (NGCs) have been observed to be X-ray bright due to hot gaseous coronae: 315, 1316, 1332, 1395, 2563, 4374, 4382, 4406, 4472, 4594, 4636, 4649, and 5128. The X-ray emission can be explained as thermal bremsstrahlung from hot gas (0.5‚Äì1.5 keV).  Ultraluminous X-ray sources  Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are pointlike, nonnuclear X-ray sources with luminosities above the Eddington limit of 3 √ó 1032 W for a black hole. Many ULXs show strong variability and may be black hole binaries. To fall into the class of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), their luminosities, thermal disk emissions, variation timescales, and surrounding emission-line nebulae must suggest this. However, when the emission is beamed or exceeds the Eddington limit, the ULX may be a stellar-mass black hole. The nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1313 has two compact ULXs, X-1 and X-2. For X-1 the X-ray luminosity increases to a maximum of 3 √ó 1033 W, exceeding the Eddington limit, and enters a steep power-law state at high luminosities more indicative of a stellar-mass black hole, whereas X-2 has the opposite behavior and appears to be in the hard X-ray state of an IMBH.  Black holes  Chandra image of Cygnus X-1, which was the first strong black hole candidate to be discovered. Black holes give off radiation because matter falling into them loses gravitational energy which may result in the emission of radiation before the matter falls into the event horizon. The infalling matter has angular momentum, which means that the material cannot fall in directly, but spins around the black hole. This material often forms an accretion disk. Similar luminous accretion disks can also form around white dwarfs and neutron stars, but in these the infalling gas releases additional energy as it slams against the high-density surface with high speed. In case of a neutron star, the infall speed can be a sizeable fraction of the speed of light. In some neutron star or white dwarf systems, the magnetic field of the star is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc. The material in the disc gets very hot because of friction, and emits X-rays. The material in the disc slowly loses its angular momentum and falls into the compact star. In neutron stars and white dwarfs, additional X-rays are generated when the material hits their surfaces. X-ray emission from black holes is variable, varying in luminosity in very short timescales. The variation in luminosity can provide information about the size of the black hole.  Supernova remnants (SNR)  { cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"vertical- align:top; float: right;\\" border=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Supernova 2005ke, which was detected in 2005, is a Type Ia supernova, an important \\"standard candle\\" explosion used by astronomers to measure distances in the universe. Shown here is the explosion in optical, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. This is the first X-ray image of a Type Ia, and it has provided observational evidence that Type Ia are the explosion of a white dwarf orbiting a red giant star.  X-ray image of the SN 1572 Type Ia remnant as seen by Chandra Space Telescope } A Type Ia supernova is an explosion of a white dwarf in orbit around either another white dwarf or a red giant star. The dense white dwarf can accumulate gas donated from the companion. When the dwarf reaches the critical mass of , a thermonuclear explosion ensues. As each Type Ia shines with a known luminosity, Type Ia are called \\"standard candles\\" and are used by astronomers to measure distances in the universe. SN 2005ke is the first Type Ia supernova detected in X-ray wavelengths, and it is much brighter in the ultraviolet than expected.  X-ray emission from stars   Vela X-1  Vela X-1 is a pulsing, eclipsing high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) system, associated with the Uhuru source 4U 0900-40 and the supergiant star HD 77581. The X-ray emission of the neutron star is caused by the capture and accretion of matter from the stellar wind of the supergiant companion. Vela X-1 is the prototypical detached HMXB.  Hercules X-1  This light curve of Her X-1 shows long term and medium term variability. Each pair of vertical lines delineate the eclipse of the compact object behind its companion star. In this case, the companion is a 2 Solar-mass star with a radius of nearly 4 times that of our Sun. This eclipse shows us the orbital period of the system, 1.7 days. An intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate mass star. Hercules X-1 is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Her) probably due to Roche lobe overflow. X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, , between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.  Scorpius X-1  The first extrasolar X-ray source was discovered on 12 June 1962. This source is called Scorpius X-1, the first X-ray source found in the constellation of Scorpius, located in the direction of the center of the Milky Way. Scorpius X-1 is some 9,000 ly from Earth and after the Sun is the strongest X-ray source in the sky at energies below 20 keV. Its X-ray output is 2.3 √ó 1031 W, about 60,000 times the total luminosity of the Sun. Scorpius X-1 itself is a neutron star. This system is classified as a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB); the neutron star is roughly 1.4 solar masses, while the donor star is only 0.42 solar masses.  Sun  The corona of the Sun as seen in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum on 8 May 1992 by the soft X-ray telescope on board the Yohkoh solar observatory spacecraft. In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species. In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun. After detecting X-ray photons from the Sun in the course of a rocket flight, T. Burnight wrote, \\"The sun is assumed to be the source of this radiation although radiation of wavelength shorter than 4 √Ö would not be expected from theoretical estimates of black body radiation from the solar corona.\\" And, of course, people have seen the solar corona in scattered visible light during solar eclipses. While neutron stars and black holes are the quintessential point sources of X-rays, all main sequence stars are likely to have hot enough coronae to emit X-rays. A- or F-type stars have at most thin convection zones and thus produce little coronal activity. Similar solar cycle-related variations are observed in the flux of solar X-ray and UV or EUV radiation. Rotation is one of the primary determinants of the magnetic dynamo, but this point could not be demonstrated by observing the Sun: the Sun's magnetic activity is in fact strongly modulated (due to the 11-year magnetic spot cycle), but this effect is not directly dependent on the rotation period. Solar flares usually follow the solar cycle. CORONAS-F was launched on 31 July 2001 to coincide with the 23rd solar cycle maximum. The solar flare of 29 October 2003 apparently showed a significant degree of linear polarization (> 70% in channels E2 = 40‚Äì60 keV and E3 = 60‚Äì100 keV, but only about 50% in E1 = 20‚Äì40 keV) in hard X-rays, but other observations have generally only set upper limits. This is a false- color, 3-layer composite from the TRACE observatory: the blue, green, and red channels show the 17.1 nm, 19.5 nm, and 28.4 nm, respectively. These TRACE filters are most sensitive to emission from 1, 1.5, and 2 million degree plasma, thus showing the entire corona and detail of coronal loops in the lower solar atmosphere. Coronal loops form the basic structure of the lower corona and transition region of the Sun. These highly structured and elegant loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar magnetic flux within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the solar cycle, it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with sunspots at their footpoints. Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface. The Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) observed X-rays in the 0.25‚Äì4.0 keV range, resolving solar features to 2.5 arc seconds with a temporal resolution of 0.5‚Äì2 seconds. SXT was sensitive to plasma in the 2‚Äì4 MK temperature range, making it an ideal observational platform to compare with data collected from TRACE coronal loops radiating in the EUV wavelengths. Variations of solar-flare emission in soft X-rays (10‚Äì130 nm) and EUV (26‚Äì34 nm) recorded on board CORONAS-F demonstrate for most flares observed by CORONAS-F in 2001‚Äì2003 UV radiation preceded X-ray emission by 1‚Äì10 min.  White dwarfs  When the core of a medium mass star contracts, it causes a release of energy that makes the envelope of the star expand. This continues until the star finally blows its outer layers off. The core of the star remains intact and becomes a white dwarf. The white dwarf is surrounded by an expanding shell of gas in an object known as a planetary nebula. Planetary nebula seem to mark the transition of a medium mass star from red giant to white dwarf. X-ray images reveal clouds of multimillion degree gas that have been compressed and heated by the fast stellar wind. Eventually the central star collapses to form a white dwarf. For a billion or so years after a star collapses to form a white dwarf, it is \\"white\\" hot with surface temperatures of ~20,000 K. X-ray emission has been detected from PG 1658+441, a hot, isolated, magnetic white dwarf, first detected in an Einstein IPC observation and later identified in an Exosat channel multiplier array observation. \\"The broad-band spectrum of this DA white dwarf can be explained as emission from a homogeneous, high-gravity, pure hydrogen atmosphere with a temperature near 28,000 K.\\" These observations of PG 1658+441 support a correlation between temperature and helium abundance in white dwarf atmospheres. A super soft X-ray source (SSXS) radiates soft X-rays in the range of 0.09 to 2.5 keV. Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady nuclear fusion on a white dwarf's surface of material pulled from a binary companion. This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion. Real mass transfer variations may be occurring in V Sge similar to SSXS RX J0513.9-6951 as revealed by analysis of the activity of the SSXS V Sge where episodes of long low states occur in a cycle of ~400 days. RX J0648.0-4418 is an X-ray pulsator in the Crab nebula. HD 49798 is a subdwarf star that forms a binary system with RX J0648.0-4418. The subdwarf star is a bright object in the optical and UV bands. The orbital period of the system is accurately known. Recent XMM-Newton observations timed to coincide with the expected eclipse of the X-ray source allowed an accurate determination of the mass of the X-ray source (at least 1.2 solar masses), establishing the X-ray source as a rare, ultra-massive white dwarf.  Brown dwarfs  According to theory, an object that has a mass of less than about 8% of the mass of the Sun cannot sustain significant nuclear fusion in its core. This marks the dividing line between red dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. The dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs occurs with objects that have masses below about 1% of the mass of the Sun, or 10 times the mass of Jupiter. These objects cannot fuse deuterium. Chandra image of LP 944-20 before flare and during flare. = LP 944-20 = With no strong central nuclear energy source, the interior of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, convection sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by Chandra from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of lightning. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf star, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2500 ¬∞C and becomes electrically neutral. Chandra observation of TWA 5B. = TWA 5B = Using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists have detected X-rays from a low mass brown dwarf in a multiple star system. This is the first time that a brown dwarf this close to its parent star(s) (Sun-like stars TWA 5A) has been resolved in X-rays. \\"Our Chandra data show that the X-rays originate from the brown dwarf's coronal plasma which is some 3 million degrees Celsius\\", said Yohko Tsuboi of Chuo University in Tokyo. \\"This brown dwarf is as bright as the Sun today in X-ray light, while it is fifty times less massive than the Sun\\", said Tsuboi. \\"This observation, thus, raises the possibility that even massive planets might emit X-rays by themselves during their youth!\\"  X-ray reflection  { cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top; float: right;\\" border=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Chandra X-ray (left) and Hubble optical (right) images of Saturn on 14 April 2003. Observation period: 20 hrs, 14‚Äì15 April 2003. Color code: red (0.4 ‚Äì 0.6 keV), green (0.6 ‚Äì 0.8 keV), blue (0.8 ‚Äì 1.0 keV).  Jupiter shows intense X-ray emission associated with auroras in its polar regions (Chandra observatory X-ray image on the left). The accompanying schematic illustrates how Jupiter's unusually frequent and spectacular auroral activity is produced. Jupiter's strong, rapidly rotating magnetic field (light blue lines) generates strong electric fields in the space around the planet. Charged particles (white dots), trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field, are continually being accelerated (gold particles) down into the atmosphere above the polar regions, so auroras are almost always active on Jupiter. Observation period: 17 hrs, 24‚Äì26 February 2003. } Electric potentials of about 10 million volts, and currents of 10 million amps ‚Äì a hundred times greater than the most powerful lightning bolts ‚Äì are required to explain the auroras at Jupiter's poles, which are a thousand times more powerful than those on Earth. On Earth, auroras are triggered by solar storms of energetic particles, which disturb Earth's magnetic field. As shown by the swept-back appearance in the illustration, gusts of particles from the Sun also distort Jupiter's magnetic field, and on occasion produce auroras. Saturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun indicating that Saturn's X-radiation is due to the reflection of solar X-rays by Saturn's atmosphere. The optical image is much brighter, and shows the beautiful ring structures, which were not detected in X-rays.  X-ray fluorescence  Some of the detected X-rays, originating from solar system bodies other than the Sun, are produced by fluorescence. Scattered solar X-rays provide an additional component. In the R√∂ntgensatellit (ROSAT) image of the Moon, pixel brightness corresponds to X-ray intensity. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in X-rays because it re-emits X-rays originating from the sun. The background sky has an X-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture. The dark side of the Moon's disk shadows this X-ray background radiation coming from the deep space. A few X-rays only seem to come from the shadowed lunar hemisphere. Instead, they originate in Earth's geocorona or extended atmosphere which surrounds the orbiting X-ray observatory. The measured lunar X-ray luminosity of ~1.2 √ó 105 W makes the Moon one of the weakest known non-terrestrial X-ray source.  Comet detection  Comet Lulin was passing through the constellation Libra when Swift imaged it on 28 January 2009. This image merges data acquired by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (blue and green) and X-Ray Telescope (red). At the time of the observation, the comet was 99.5 million miles from Earth and 115.3 million miles from the Sun. NASA's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite was monitoring Comet Lulin as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. \\"The solar wind ‚Äì a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun ‚Äì interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees\\", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.  Celestial X-ray sources  The celestial sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The IAU constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with the astronomical X-ray sources, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth.  Andromeda  Andromeda Galaxy ‚Äì in high- energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016). Andromeda's galactic center appears to harbor an X-ray source characteristic of a black hole of a million or more solar masses. Seen above, the false-color X-ray picture shows a number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within Andromeda's central region as yellowish dots. The blue source located right at the galaxy's center is coincident with the position of the suspected massive black hole. While the X-rays are produced as material falls into the black hole and heats up, estimates from the X-ray data show Andromeda's central source to be very cold ‚Äì only about million degrees, compared to the tens of millions of degrees indicated for Andromeda's X-ray binaries. Multiple X-ray sources have been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the ESA's XMM-Newton orbiting observatory.

The X-ray landmark NGC 4151, an intermediate spiral Seyfert galaxy has a massive black hole in its core.  Canis Major  A Chandra X-ray image of Sirius A and B shows Sirius B to be more luminous than Sirius A. Whereas in the visual range, Sirius A is the more luminous.  Cassiopeia  Cassiopeia A: a false color image composited of data from three sources. Red is infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, orange is visible data from the Hubble Space Telescope, and blue and green are data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Regarding Cassiopea A SNR, it is believed that first light from the stellar explosion reached Earth approximately 300 years ago but there are no historical records of any sightings of the progenitor supernova, probably due to interstellar dust absorbing optical wavelength radiation before it reached Earth (although it is possible that it was recorded as a sixth magnitude star 3 Cassiopeiae by John Flamsteed on 16 August 1680). Possible explanations lean toward the idea that the source star was unusually massive and had previously ejected much of its outer layers. These outer layers would have cloaked the star and reabsorbed much of the light released as the inner star collapsed. CTA 1 is another SNR X-ray source in Cassiopeia. A pulsar in the CTA 1 supernova remnant (4U 0000+72) initially emitted radiation in the X-ray bands (1970‚Äì1977). Strangely, when it was observed at a later time (2008) X-ray radiation was not detected. Instead, the Fermi Gamma- ray Space Telescope detected the pulsar was emitting gamma ray radiation, the first of its kind.  Carina  Classified as a Peculiar star, Eta Carinae exhibits a superstar at its center as seen in this image from Chandra. The new X-ray observation shows three distinct structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. Three structures around Eta Carinae are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. \\"The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays,\\" says Prof. Kris Davidson of the University of Minnesota.  Cetus  Two supermassive black holes spiraling towards merger near the center of NGC 1128, some 25,000 light years away from each other. Abell 400 is a galaxy cluster, containing a galaxy (NGC 1128) with two supermassive black holes 3C 75 spiraling towards merger.  Chamaeleon  The Chamaeleon complex is a large star forming region (SFR) that includes the Chamaeleon I, Chamaeleon II, and Chamaeleon III dark clouds. It occupies nearly all of the constellation and overlaps into Apus, Musca, and Carina. The mean density of X-ray sources is about one source per square degree. = Chamaeleon I dark cloud = This shows a ROSAT false-color image in X-rays between 500 eV and 1.1 keV of the Chamaeleon I dark cloud. The contours are 100 ¬µm emission from dust measured by the IRAS satellite. The Chamaeleon I (Cha I) cloud is a coronal cloud and one of the nearest active star formation regions at ~160 pc. It is relatively isolated from other star-forming clouds, so it is unlikely that older pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have drifted into the field. The total stellar population is 200‚Äì300. The Cha I cloud is further divided into the North cloud or region and South cloud or main cloud. = Chamaeleon II dark cloud = The Chamaeleon II dark cloud contains some 40 X-ray sources. Observation in Chamaeleon II was carried out from 10 to 17 September 1993.

Corona Borealis  Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2142. The galaxy cluster Abell 2142 emits X-rays and is in Corona Borealis. It is one of the most massive objects in the universe.  Corvus  From the Chandra X-ray analysis of the Antennae Galaxies rich deposits of neon, magnesium, and silicon were discovered. These elements are among those that form the building blocks for habitable planets. The clouds imaged contain magnesium and silicon at 16 and 24 times respectively, the abundance in the Sun.  Crater  The Chandra X-ray image is of the quasar PKS 1127-145, a highly luminous source of X-rays and visible light about 10 billion light years from Earth.

Instrument: ACIS. The jet exhibited in X-rays coming from PKS 1127-145 is likely due to the collision of a beam of high-energy electrons with microwave photons.  Draco  The Draco nebula (a soft X-ray shadow) is outlined by contours and is blue-black in the image by ROSAT of a portion of the constellation Draco. Abell 2256 is a galaxy cluster of > 500 galaxies. The double structure of this ROSAT image shows the merging of two clusters. Abell 2256 is a galaxy cluster of more than 500 galaxies. The double structure of this ROSAT image shows the merging of two clusters.  Eridanus  Eridanus and Orion. Soft X-rays are emitted by hot gas (T ~ 2‚Äì3 MK) in the interior of the superbubble. This bright object forms the background for the \\"shadow\\" of a filament of gas and dust. The filament is shown by the overlaid contours, which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 K as measured by IRAS. Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by UV light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the optical (HŒ±) and X-ray portions of the spectrum. Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray \\"hot spot\\" known as the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble, the Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement, or simply the Eridanus Bubble, a 25¬∞ area of interlocking arcs of HŒ± emitting filaments.

Betelgeuse is easily seen above the three stars of Orion's belt on the right. The X-ray colors represent the temperature of the X-ray emission from each star: hot stars are blue-white and cooler stars are yellow-red. The brightest object in the optical image is the full moon, which is also in the X-ray image. The X-ray image was actually obtained by the ROSAT satellite during the All-Sky Survey phase in 1990‚Äì1991. In the adjacent images are the constellation Orion. On the right side of the images is the visual image of the constellation. On the left is Orion as seen in X-rays only. Betelgeuse is easily seen above the three stars of Orion's belt on the right. The brightest object in the visual image is the full moon, which is also in the X-ray image. The X-ray colors represent the temperature of the X-ray emission from each star: hot stars are blue-white and cooler stars are yellow-red.  Pegasus  Stephan's Quintet, a compact group of galaxies discovered about 130 years ago and located about 280 million light years from Earth, provides a rare opportunity to observe a galaxy group in the process of evolving from an X-ray faint system dominated by spiral galaxies to a more developed system dominated by elliptical galaxies and bright X-ray emission. Being able to witness the dramatic effect of collisions in causing this evolution is important for increasing our understanding of the origins of the hot, X-ray bright halos of gas in groups of galaxies. Stephan's Quintet are of interest because of their violent collisions. Four of the five galaxies in Stephan's Quintet form a physical association, and are involved in a cosmic dance that most likely will end with the galaxies merging. As NGC 7318B collides with gas in the group, a huge shock wave bigger than the Milky Way spreads throughout the medium between the galaxies, heating some of the gas to temperatures of millions of degrees where they emit X-rays detectable with the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory. NGC 7319 has a type 2 Seyfert nucleus.  Perseus  Chandra observations of the central regions of the Perseus galaxy cluster. Image is 284 arcsec across.

The Perseus galaxy cluster is one of the most massive objects in the universe, containing thousands of galaxies immersed in a vast cloud of multimillion degree gas.  Pictor  This Chandra X-ray image of Radio Galaxy Pictor A shows a spectacular jet emanating from the center of the galaxy (left) and extends across 360 thousand lyr toward a brilliant hot spot.

Pictor A is a galaxy that may have a black hole at its center which has emitted magnetized gas at extremely high speed. The bright spot at the right in the image is the head of the jet.

Color code: Energy (Red 0.4‚Äì0.7 keV; Green 0.7‚Äì1.2 keV; Blue 1.2‚Äì10 keV). Instrument: ACIS. Puppis A is a supernova remnant (SNR) about 10 light-years in diameter. The supernova occurred approximately 3700 years ago.  Sagittarius  Sagittarius A (or Sgr A) is a complex at the center of the Milky Way. It consists of three overlapping components, the SNR Sagittarius A East, the spiral structure Sagittarius A West, and a very bright compact radio source at the center of the spiral, Sagittarius A*. The Galactic Center is at 1745‚Äì2900 which corresponds to Sagittarius A*, very near to radio source Sagittarius A (W24). In probably the first catalogue of galactic X-ray sources, two Sgr X-1s are suggested: (1) at 1744‚Äì2312 and (2) at 1755‚Äì2912, noting that (2) is an uncertain identification. Source (1) seems to correspond to S11.  Sculptor  This image combines data from four different observatories: the Chandra X-ray Observatory (purple); the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite (ultraviolet/blue); the Hubble Space Telescope (visible/green); the Spitzer Space Telescope (infrared/red).

The unusual shape of the Cartwheel Galaxy may be due to a collision with a smaller galaxy such as those in the lower left of the image. The most recent star burst (star formation due to compression waves) has lit up the Cartwheel rim, which has a diameter larger than the Milky Way. There is an exceptionally large number of black holes in the rim of the galaxy as can be seen in the inset.  Serpens  XMM-Newton spectrum from superheated iron atoms at the inner edge of the accretion disk orbiting the neutron star in Serpens X-1. The line is usually a symmetrical peak, but it exhibits the classic features of distortion due to relativistic effects. The extremely fast motion of the iron- rich gas causes the line to spread out. The entire line has been shifted to longer wavelengths (left, red) because of the neutron star's powerful gravity. The line is brighter toward shorter wavelengths (right, blue) because Einstein's special theory of relativity predicts that a high-speed source beamed toward Earth will appear brighter than the same source moving away from Earth. As of 27 August 2007, discoveries concerning asymmetric iron line broadening and their implications for relativity have been a topic of much excitement. With respect to the asymmetric iron line broadening, Edward Cackett of the University of Michigan commented, \\"We're seeing the gas whipping around just outside the neutron star's surface,\\". \\"And since the inner part of the disk obviously can't orbit any closer than the neutron star's surface, these measurements give us a maximum size of the neutron star's diameter. The neutron stars can be no larger than 18 to 20.5 miles across, results that agree with other types of measurements.\\" \\"We've seen these asymmetric lines from many black holes, but this is the first confirmation that neutron stars can produce them as well. It shows that the way neutron stars accrete matter is not very different from that of black holes, and it gives us a new tool to probe Einstein's theory\\", says Tod Strohmayer of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \\"This is fundamental physics\\", says Sudip Bhattacharyya also of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and the University of Maryland. \\"There could be exotic kinds of particles or states of matter, such as quark matter, in the centers of neutron stars, but it's impossible to create them in the lab. The only way to find out is to understand neutron stars.\\" Using XMM-Newton, Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer observed Serpens X-1, which contains a neutron star and a stellar companion. Cackett and Jon Miller of the University of Michigan, along with Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer, used Suzaku's superb spectral capabilities to survey Serpens X-1. The Suzaku data confirmed the XMM-Newton result regarding the iron line in Serpens X-1.

In Ursa Major at RA 10h 34m 00.00 Dec +57¬∞ 40' 00.00\\" is a field of view that is almost free of absorption by neutral hydrogen gas within the Milky Way. It is known as the Lockman Hole. Hundreds of X-ray sources from other galaxies, some of them supermassive black holes, can be seen through this window.  Exotic X-ray sources   Microquasar  A microquasar is a smaller cousin of a quasar that is a radio emitting X-ray binary, with an often resolvable pair of radio jets. SS 433 is one of the most exotic star systems observed. It is an eclipsing binary with the primary either a black hole or neutron star and the secondary is a late A-type star. SS 433 lies within SNR W50. The material in the jet traveling from the secondary to the primary does so at 26% of light speed. The spectrum of SS 433 is affected by Doppler shifts and by relativity: when the effects of the Doppler shift are subtracted, there is a residual redshift which corresponds to a velocity of about 12,000 kps. This does not represent an actual velocity of the system away from the Earth; rather, it is due to time dilation, which makes moving clocks appear to stationary observers to be ticking more slowly. In this case, the relativistically moving excited atoms in the jets appear to vibrate more slowly and their radiation thus appears red-shifted.  Be X-ray binaries  LSI+61¬∞303 is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma- ray source, CG135+01. LSI+61¬∞303 is a variable radio source characterized by periodic, non-thermal radio outbursts with a period of 26.5 d, attributed to the eccentric orbital motion of a compact object, probably a neutron star, around a rapidly rotating B0 Ve star, with a Teff ~26,000 K and luminosity of ~1038 erg s‚àí1. Photometric observations at optical and infrared wavelengths also show a 26.5 d modulation. Of the 20 or so members of the Be X-ray binary systems, as of 1996, only X Per and LSI+61¬∞303 have X-ray outbursts of much higher luminosity and harder spectrum (kT ~ 10‚Äì20 keV) vs. (kT ‚â§ 1 keV); however, LSI+61¬∞303 further distinguishes itself by its strong, outbursting radio emission. \\"The radio properties of LSI+61¬∞303 are similar to those of the \\"standard\\" high-mass X-ray binaries such as SS 433, Cyg X-3 and Cir X-1.\\"  Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs)  There are a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB supergiants and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). XTE J1739‚Äì302 is one of these. Discovered in 1997, remaining active only one day, with an X-ray spectrum well fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung (temperature of ‚àº20 keV), resembling the spectral properties of accreting pulsars, it was at first classified as a peculiar Be/X-ray transient with an unusually short outburst. A new burst was observed on 8 April 2008 with Swift.  Messier 87  A 5,000 ly jet of matter ejected from M87 at near lightspeed. Observations made by Chandra indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds Messier 87. These loops and rings are generated by variations in the rate at which material is ejected from the supermassive black hole in jets. The distribution of loops suggests that minor eruptions occur every six million years. One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave 85,000 light-years in diameter around the black hole. Other remarkable features observed include narrow X-ray emitting filaments up to 100,000 light-years long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago. The galaxy also contains a notable active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves.  Magnetars  Magnetar SGR 1900+14 is in the exact center of the image, which shows a surrounding ring of gas 7 ly across in infrared light, as seen by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The magnetar itself is not visible at this wavelength, but it has been seen in X-ray light. A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma rays. The theory regarding these objects was proposed by Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson in 1992, but the first recorded burst of gamma rays thought to have been from a magnetar was on 5 March 1979. These magnetic fields are hundreds of thousands of times stronger than any man-made magnet, and quadrillions of times more powerful than the field surrounding Earth. As of 2003, they are the most magnetic objects ever detected in the universe. On 5 March 1979, after dropping probes into the atmosphere of Venus, Venera 11 and Venera 12, while in heliocentric orbits, were hit at 10:51 am EST by a blast of gamma ray radiation. This contact raised the radiation readings on both the probes Konus experiments from a normal 100 counts per second to over 200,000 counts a second, in only a fraction of a millisecond. This giant flare was detected by numerous spacecraft and with these detections was localized by the interplanetary network to SGR 0526-66 inside the N-49 SNR of the Large Magellanic Cloud. And, Konus detected another source in March 1979: SGR 1900+14, located 20,000 light-years away in the constellation Aquila had a long period of low emissions, except the significant burst in 1979, and a couple after. What is the evolutionary relationship between pulsars and magnetars? Astronomers would like to know if magnetars represent a rare class of pulsars, or if some or all pulsars go through a magnetar phase during their life cycles. NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) has revealed that the youngest known pulsing neutron star has thrown a temper tantrum. The collapsed star occasionally unleashes powerful bursts of X-rays, which are forcing astronomers to rethink the life cycle of neutron stars. \\"We are watching one type of neutron star literally change into another right before our very eyes. This is a long-sought missing link between different types of pulsars\\", says Fotis Gavriil of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Chandra image shows the supernova Kes 75 with the young, normal pulsar, neutron star PSR J1846-0258 in the center of the blue area at the top. PSR J1846-0258 is in the constellation Aquila. It had been classed as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin (3.1 s‚àí1) and pulsar-like spectrum. RXTE caught four magnetar-like X-ray bursts on 31 May 2006, and another on 27 July 2006. Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14-second, they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns. \\"Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts\\", says Gavriil. \\"Young, fast-spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts\\", says Marjorie Gonzalez, formerly of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \\"Here's a normal pulsar that's acting like a magnetar.\\" These Chandra images show PSR J1846-0258 in Kes 75 in October 2000 (left) and June 2006 (right). The pulsar brightened in X-rays after giving off powerful outbursts earlier in 2006. The observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory showed that the object had brightened in X-rays, confirming that the bursts were from the pulsar, and that its spectrum had changed to become more magnetar-like. The fact that PSR J1846's spin rate is decelerating also means that it has a strong magnetic field braking the rotation. The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth's field, but it's 10 to 100 times weaker than a typical magnetar. Victoria Kaspi of McGill University notes, \\"PSR J1846's actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount, suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise, and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity.\\"  X-ray dark stars  During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images of the Sun in X-rays, the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. Betelgeuse, on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark. The X-ray flux from the entire stellar surface corresponds to a surface flux limit that ranges from 30‚Äì7000 ergs s‚àí1 cm‚àí2 at T=1 MK, to ~1 erg s‚àí1 cm‚àí2 at higher temperatures, five orders of magnitude below the quiet Sun X-ray surface flux. Like the red supergiant Betelgeuse, hardly any X-rays are emitted by red giants. The cause of the X-ray deficiency may involve * a turn- off of the dynamo, * a suppression by competing wind production, or * strong attenuation by an overlying thick chromosphere. Prominent bright red giants include Aldebaran, Arcturus, and Gamma Crucis. There is an apparent X-ray \\"dividing line\\" in the H-R diagram among the giant stars as they cross from the main sequence to become red giants. Alpha Trianguli Australis (Œ± TrA / Œ± Trianguli Australis) appears to be a Hybrid star (parts of both sides) in the \\"Dividing Line\\" of evolutionary transition to red giant. Œ± TrA can serve to test the several Dividing Line models. There is also a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F. In the few genuine late A- or early F-type coronal emitters, their weak dynamo operation is generally not able to brake the rapidly spinning star considerably during their short lifetime so that these coronae are conspicuous by their severe deficit of X-ray emission compared to chromospheric and transition region fluxes; the latter can be followed up to mid-A type stars at quite high levels. Whether or not these atmospheres are indeed heated acoustically and drive an \\"expanding\\", weak and cool corona or whether they are heated magnetically, the X-ray deficit and the low coronal temperatures clearly attest to the inability of these stars to maintain substantial, hot coronae in any way comparable to cooler active stars, their appreciable chromospheres notwithstanding.  X-ray interstellar medium  The Hot Ionized Medium (HIM), sometimes consisting of Coronal gas, in the temperature range 106 ‚Äì 107 K emits X-rays. Stellar winds from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant HII regions surrounding them) and shock waves created by supernovae inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures ‚Äì of varying sizes ‚Äì can be observed, such as stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas, by X-ray satellite telescopes. The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, a denser region in the low-density Local Bubble.  Diffuse X-ray background  This ROSAT image is an Aitoff-Hammer equal-area map in galactic coordinates with the Galactic center in the middle of the 0.25 keV diffuse X-ray background. In addition to discrete sources which stand out against the sky, there is good evidence for a diffuse X-ray background. During more than a decade of observations of X-ray emission from the Sun, evidence of the existence of an isotropic X-ray background flux was obtained in 1956. This background flux is rather consistently observed over a wide range of energies. The early high-energy end of the spectrum for this diffuse X-ray background was obtained by instruments on board Ranger 3 and Ranger 5. The X-ray flux corresponds to a total energy density of about 5 x 10‚àí4 eV/cm3. The ROSAT soft X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) image shows the general increase in intensity from the Galactic plane to the poles. At the lowest energies, 0.1 ‚Äì 0.3 keV, nearly all of the observed soft X-ray background (SXRB) is thermal emission from ~106 K plasma. Map of the column density of Galactic neutral hydrogen in the same projection as the 0.25 keV SXRB. Note the general negative correlation between the 0.25 keV diffuse X-ray background and the neutral hydrogen column density shown here. By comparing the soft X-ray background with the distribution of neutral hydrogen, it is generally agreed that within the Milky Way disk, super soft X-rays are absorbed by this neutral hydrogen. This 0.75 keV diffuse X-ray background map from the ROSAT all-sky survey in the same projection as the SXRB and neutral hydrogen. The image shows a radically different structure than the 0.25 keV X-ray background. At 0.75 keV, the sky is dominated by the relatively smooth extragalactic background and a limited number of bright extended Galactic objects.  X-ray dark planets  X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. \\"Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area.\\"  Earth  { cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"vertical- align:top; float: right;\\" border=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Polar satellite. The area of brightest X-ray emission is red. Such X-rays are not dangerous because they are absorbed by lower parts of the Earth's atmosphere.  In this sample of images from 2004, bright X-ray arcs of low energy (0.1 ‚Äì 10 keV) are generated during auroral activity. The images are superimposed on a simulated image of Earth. The color code of the X-ray arcs represent brightness, with maximum brightness shown in red. Distance from the North pole to the black circle is . Observation dates: 10 pointings between 16 December 2003 ‚Äì 13 April 2004. Instrument: HRC. } The first picture of the Earth in X-rays was taken in March 1996, with the orbiting Polar satellite. Energetically charged particles from the Sun cause aurora and energize electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere. These electrons move along the Earth's magnetic field and eventually strike the Earth's ionosphere, producing the X-ray emission.

United States Traditionally, each family member is entitled to an allotment of welfare benefits. If a family had a child while receiving welfare assistance the grant amount would increase moderately. However, that changed in 1992 with New Jersey being the first state to implement a family cap. Currently, about 23 states have implemented some type of a family cap or child exclusion. Federal government Under the 1996 federal welfare reform, states have discretion to implement a family cap policy. States no longer need waivers, unlike before, to do so.  Criticisms  Opponents argue that the policy negatively affects children's poverty levels and health and also increases abortion rates. Abortion There are conflicting studies on the abortion issue. A 1998 study conducted in New Jersey found that for new welfare recipients there was an increase of 14% in the abortion rate, but for ongoing cases of recipients, there was no significant difference in abortion rates cause by the policy. Between October 1992 and December 1996, the New Jersey family cap averted 14,000 births and caused 1,400 abortions that otherwise would not have occurred.publications/excluded_children.pdf The policy is thus criticised by the New Jersey Catholic Conference, pro-life organizations, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Organization for Women.New Jersey \\"family cap\\" increases abortion rate However, in 2001, another study found that family caps are inconclusive regarding reductions of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, or the size of welfare caseloads. In contrast, a study in Arkansas and Arizona found that there was no significant difference in birth rates. If in fact these policies correlate with a reduction in birth rates, the question remains whether they are caused by abortions or increased use of contraceptives. Child poverty and health Critics argue that the child exclusion policy keeps children in poverty by denying them the critical supports they need at a young age to become self-sufficient in adulthood. A decrease in family wealth usually leads to negative effects on children.familyincome/childpoverty/basicfacts.aspx Specifically, family caps were found to increase the poverty rate of children by 13.1%. Also, critics argue that the costs of child exclusion exceed the savings. Nationally, the costs associated with child poverty total about $500 billion a year, the equivalent of 4% of the GDP.[Testimony of Professor Harry Holzer, Associate Dean at Georgetown Public Policy Institute, in front of the House Ways and Means Committee, ‚ÄúThe Costs of Childhood Poverty‚Äù (2007).] The effect child poverty on health also raises concerns. Children living in poverty are 3.6 times more likely to have poor health and 5 times more likely to die from an infectious disease than children that are not poor. In the area of welfare sanctions, such as family caps, a termination or a reduction in benefits translates into a 50% higher risk of lacking nutritionally-adequate food, a 30% greater risk of hospitalizations for infants and toddlers than those whose assistance were not decreased, and a 90% higher risk of being admitted to the hospital during an emergency room visit.http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/welfare_7_02.pdf Also, the increased need for medical treatment is felt by the children and by society‚Äôs health expenditures. Currently, there is an estimate of 108,000 families affected by the family cap in the United States. Advantages Proponents of family caps argue that the policy serves as an economic incentive to reduce birth rates and encourage personal responsibility. Reduced birth rates Proponents argue that the policy would help improve contraceptive practices or increase abstinence from intercourse. However, as mentioned above, the effects on childbirth have been inconclusive. A New Jersey study found that there was an estimated reduction of 14,000 births. However, a 2001 study found that the effects of the family cap policies were inconclusive, without any finding of a reduction on out-of-wedlock birth, welfare caseload, or abortions. Personal responsibility States support the policy because family caps could limit the number of out-of-wedlock births and strengthen families by limiting the births of additional children. Other benefits of the policy, as mentioned by the Governor of Mississippi, include a reduction of crime levels caused by fewer births from teenage mothers.http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/jcpr/workingpapers/wpfiles/Gais_WPedi1-31.pdf References Social security in the United States Parenting Child poverty ","title":"Family cap"},{"id":"25101444","text":"Craig Atkins (born 29 May 1966) was an Australian cricketer.

Dreicer is a curatorial strategist, historian of technology, experience designer, exhibition developer, curator, and museum manager. Dreicer's multidisciplinary projects, which engage audiences in discovering and exploring everyday environments, have led public discussion on issues including infrastructure, architecture, city planning, community identity, preservation, livability, design, and sustainability. Dreicer's work is known for innovative strategies in project conception and design that create memorable experiences. Public History and Museums Dreicer's exhibition projects, through their multidisciplinary focus on story, identity, and place, emphasize the indivisible nature of natural, built, and social environments. He has developed projects for organizations including the Vancouver Public Library, Museum of Vancouver, National Building Museum, Museum of the City of New York, and the Smithsonian Institution Museum on Main Street program. At the Museum of Vancouver, Dreicer developed an institutional vision based on social connection. At the Chicago Architecture Foundation, Dreicer developed the institutional thematic framework, was responsible for the creation of the master plan for a new facility, and developed a large-scale model of Chicago that made the CAF facility a destination. His projects have focused on issues including fences and land use; water supply systems; lighting and city life; preservation; livable communities; energy efficiency; and skyscraper engineering and architecture. Scholarship Dreicer's scholarly research and publications investigate building as a process, rather than buildings as objects. His work, focused on the early development in the United States and Europe of building processes and long-span and high-rise design, demonstrates the crucial role of construction in the history of industrialization. This transnational investigation of design in action demonstrates how the fundamental ideas that shape understandings of technology‚Äînationalism, evolutionism, and progress‚Äîare entwined in the process of invention itself. In articles such as \\"Nouvelles inventions: l‚Äôinterchangeabilit√© et le g√©nie national\\" in Culture Technique and \\"Influence and Intercultural Exchange: the Case of Engineering Schools and Civil Engineering Works in the Nineteenth Century\\" in History and Technology, Dreicer explores invention as a process of exchange between cultures while emphasizing the thinking behind the history of architecture and building. In articles such as \\"Building Myths: The ‚ÄòEvolution‚Äô from Wood to Iron in the Construction of Bridges and Nations\\" in Perspecta, Dreicer explores the impact of evolutionary metaphors and nationalism on understandings of technology. In \\"Building Bridges and Boundaries: The Lattice and the Tube, 1820-1860\\" in Technology and Culture he analyzes the relationship between the construction of engineering infrastructure and national identity. Education and Academic Career Dreicer completed a PhD in Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University and a Masters in Historic Preservation at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Dreicer's post- doctoral academic positions include a Senior Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, a Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and a fellowship at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. Dreicer has taught at the Parsons School of Design and MIT School of Architecture and Planning. He previously worked in New York City as an architectural conservator specializing in the restoration and repair of high-rise building facades.

Bis(chloro)cyclodiphosphazanes, (cis-[ClP(Œº-NR)]2) are important starting compounds for synthesizing a variety of cyclodiphosphazane derivatives by nucleophilic substitution reactions; are prepared by reaction of phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) with a primary amine (RNH2) or amine hydrochlorides (RNH3Cl). Organic substituents on nitrogen play an important role in formation of cyclic phosphazane compounds. The cyclic tetramers and trimer are formed with methyl and ethyl substituents on nitrogen, whereas formation of cyclic dimers (cis-[ClP(Œº-NR)]2) have been observed exclusively with more sterically demanding primary amines such as tert-butylamine and aniline. Coordination Chemistry Cyclodiphosphazanes are excellent ligand systems for metallosupramolecular chemistry. The cis-oriented lone pair on phosphorus in cyclodiphosphazane are projected away from each other, so chelation to metal center is not possible. This bridging coordination of cyclodiphosphazane allows formation of metallomacrocycles containing four rhodium and gold centers and metallopolymers CuX, AgX. Chiral cyclodiphosphazanes have found use as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. Gade et al. employed them in enantioselective transition-metal mediated catalysis, while Goldfuss et al. employed di-amino substituted chiral variants in hydrogen bonding catalysis. Cyclodiphosphazanes have also been found to have a high ability to bind anions via hydrogen bonding - specifically halides - in both their monomeric and macrocyclic forms. They are competitive to or better than comparable bifurcated anion binding structural motifs such as (thio)urea and squaramide.

The foundation's primary mission is to alleviate problems associated with poverty by improving housing and living conditions in low-income districts: the ‚Äúbottom of the pyramid.‚Äù FPVS's projects involve primarily microfinance and infrastructure development. Based in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina, FPVS focuses its efforts in the northwestern sector of the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area and currently has projects in the districts of Jos√© C. Paz, Malvinas Argentinas, Merlo, Moreno, and San Miguel. A large proportion of the neighborhoods in these outer, second and third \\"belts\\" of Buenos Aires suffer from high levels of poverty. Within this area of approximately 1,650,000 people (as of 2001), 64% live below Argentina's poverty level. In general, this population lacks urban infrastructure (sidewalks, paved roads, drainage systems), has little access to utilities (gas, water, electricity), and experiences high levels of health problems associated with poor living conditions. Although there is a high demand for goods and services within this area, there is a general lack of companies willing to do business there because of the perceived investment risks. Similarly, many of these families find it difficult to acquire credit in formal markets. As a result, it is extremely difficult for the poor in Buenos Aires to improve their quality of life on their own. Within this context, FPVS works to ameliorate the discrepancy between supply and demand in poor areas. FPVS's strategies focus on creating incentives for private businesses to invest in poor communities and helping the local population borrow money so that they can afford to purchase necessary goods and services. right Current projects Microcredit Program: \\"El Solidarios\\" The Solidarios project aims to provide microcredit for housing improvements to low income families who are excluded from the formal credit market due to being profiled as ‚Äúhigh risk.‚Äù The project lends to groups of families, who indemnify one another's loans, at comparatively low interest rates. This strengthens the solidarity between families as well as each individual family's capability to improve their standard of living. To date, the Solidarios project has provided more than 8,500 families with the credit needed to make improvements to the infrastructure of their homes. Integral Gasification right The foundation's gasification projects were created as a result of a 1999 study undertaken to assess basic needs of families living in the Moreno district of Greater Buenos Aires. Many of the neighborhoods in this area lack natural gas connections and rely on propane cylinders for cooking and heating in the home. The use of cylinders is not only inconvenient, but also costs substantially more than would an in-home gas connection. Since 2000, the foundation has worked with local community associations to bring gas lines to their neighborhoods by providing loans for the up-front construction costs of gas infrastructure. This project is supported by a trust fund financed by FONCAP and the World Bank and administered by FPVS with the help of community partners. These loans are repaid from the savings generated by switching from cylinder to in-home connections.UN Global Compact With a net investment of US$1,720,000, the program benefits around 3,600 families. This investment has allowed for the creation of 70,000 meters of external piping and 2,600 internal home connections in four years. Savings from fuel substitution have cut costs by a factor of four, as each neighbor now spends approximately US$45 as opposed to US$200 on gas per year. After the initial investments are repaid, this saving has a direct impact on family budgets. It is estimated that the savings generated will increase real incomes in the neighborhood by a full seven percent. The project also has an important impact on health and wellness by decreasing respiratory diseases and increasing the quality of cooked food. Bathroom and Kitchen Improvement The Bathroom and Kitchen Improvement project is the product of an alliance between FPVS and Ferrum F.V., Argentina's leading provider of kitchen and bath accessories. This partnership with private business is a model of an inclusive business and serves to provide materials and technical support to poor communities for improvements to bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry facilities, including modules to bring access to water into their homes. Neighborhood Development Observatory The Observatory initiative began in 2006 with the help of a local university, Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and allows FPVS to measure the impact of its projects on socioeconomic factors such as housing configuration, occupation, health, education, income, consumption, diet, security, social characteristics, and living conditions. The survey helps identify the priorities of the residents and provides useful information about these populations to the private and public sectors. This information also allows FPVS to identify successful strategies that can be used in other locations. Future Projects Local Development right The \\"Local Development\\" project will take place in the Cruce Derqui area on the periphery of northeastern Buenos Aires. The project's primary goal is to improve the quality of the local infrastructure and increase the availability of public services. Because the demographics of this area are similar to those in other needy neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, FPVS hopes that the Cruce Derequi project can be used as a model of local development that can be replicated in other areas. Water Networks right The \\"Water Networks\\" project seeks to address the widespread lack of clean drinking water and adequate sewage disposal in the second belt of Buenos Aires. FPVS aims to expand and improve the water infrastructure and sewer networks in the Cuartel V district (with a pilot project involving approximately 750 homes), with the intention that it will be replicated in similar areas. FPVS hopes that this will greatly improve sanitation and the long-term health of the residents. The project is also designed to create a capacity in the community to organize around common problems and work towards solutions together. The project's main components will be: (1) utilization of inter-sector financing for the construction of the water purification network; (2) training programs for community leaders about environmental sustainability; and (3) systematized monitoring efforts to measure the impact of the program and to replicate its model in other areas. This project is innovative because it aims to solve community problems by articulating the supply and demand in such a way as to guarantee the sustainability of the program in the long run. Traditionally, water development projects have paid little attention to the economic and social realities of the beneficiaries of the service. Most projects have also failed to strengthen community ties in the development process, and consequently, many development efforts have proved to be unsustainable. This project, in contrast, will be developed in close cooperation with the community. Another innovative aspect of the project lies in its potential use Certified Emission Reduction credits. Preliminary studies suggest that the Alem water project may result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions via improvements in sewage treatment. If these reductions can be realized, FPVS will seek to partly finance the project by selling its reduction credits through the Kyoto Protocol‚Äôs Clean Development Mechanism. This will not only provide an important source of financing but will benefit the local environment as well. Training and Education The objective of this project is to create a forum where the local development processes used by FPVS can be organized and disseminated. To this end, the \\"Training and Education\\" project will create a Community Leaders Training Center. The center will bring together different community resources in a collaborative environment. The center will thus serve as place where problems facing the community can be discussed and analyzed. FPVS hopes that the center will integrate existing community resources and put them to use in improving living conditions and catalyzing necessary social developments. Program of Ownership Formalization It is an unfortunate reality in Buenos Aires that many poor people are unable to fully realize their property rights because of irregularities in the chain of their home's title. This not only impedes subsequent land transfers but also prevents poor people from using their homes as collateral for much-needed loans. Nearly 70% of the poor families in the Greater Buenos Aires area lack adequate legal titles to their homes because final mortgage payments are frequently not accompanied by a proper deed. Most often, the organizations responsible for granting deeds often go bankrupt or stop operating for other reasons. The \\"Ownership Formalization\\" project is designed to address this problem by assisting poor people in asserting their rights granted by Law 24.374. This statute allows persons who can prove public, peaceful, and continuous use of a residence for a period of three years prior to January 1, 1992, to request to take formal title to their property through a declaration of law. The law thus allows families currently without title to formalize their ownership. FPVS will work to increase awareness of the law and will provide assistance in filling out the necessary paperwork. Impact Following the implementation of the first gas project, nearly 3,000 families in the Moreno district of Greater Buenos Aires now have in-home gas connections, 1,000 of which have already finished repayment to the trust fund. The community members who acted as leaders and promoters for the project have formed a formal public services cooperative in order to independently continue improving their neighborhood. The gas company that decided to collaborate, Gas Natural Ban, has changed its perception of the poorest economic sectors as ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù into one of viable clients, thus incorporating an inclusive business model. The microcredit program for housing improvements has reached over 8,000 families in 5 years with an investment of US$12 million. Awards FPVS has been the recipient of numerous awards for its work including:  Development Marketplace Award from the World Bank in 2002  Banking on Social Change Award from Ashoka in 2008  Microfinance, Innovation, and Sustainability Award from the Giordano Dell'Amore Foundation in 2009  Leveraging Business for Social Change Award from the Ashoka Organization in 2010 Fundraising FPVS receives financial support from a number of different sources including (1) contributions from local and international philanthropies, (2) public resources to support specific projects, (3) low interest loans from banks oriented towards social investment, (4) donations from individuals, and (5) internal resources. In addition, FPVS has formed alliances with private businesses who provide technical expertise, below- market products and services, and financial support. Some of the primary supporters in the private sector are Gas Natural BAN, FERRUM/FV, the Ford Foundation, the Inter-American Foundation, and Supervielle Banco. Aside from business sponsors, FPVS receives significant support from individuals. The fund accepts monetary donations online as well as material donations such as office equipment. Volunteer Program FPVS has a large and well established volunteer internship program. Internships are intended primarily for international visitors and students in Buenos Aires who wish to contribute their abilities to further FPVS's work. Interns work in the downtown Buenos Aires office in any of the following departments: Institutional Relations; Investigation and Development; and Monitoring, Systematization and Transference. There are also volunteer opportunities in the Moreno office.

Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [849].Old Book of Tang, vol. 174.), courtesy name Wenrao (), formally the Duke of Wei (), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of brothers Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Wuzong and (briefly) their uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong. He was the leader of the so-called Li Faction in the decades-long Niu-Li Factional Struggles, and was particularly powerful during Emperor Wuzong's reign, dominating the court scene and guiding policies during the campaigns against the crumbling Huigu Khanate and against the warlord Liu Zhen. After Emperor Wuzong's death, Emperor XuƒÅnzong, who had long despised him for his hold on power, had him demoted and banished, where he died in exile.  Background  Li Deyu was born in 787, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. His grandfather Li Qiyun () served as the chief imperial censor, and his father Li Jifu would eventually serve as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong. It was said that Li Deyu was ambitious in his youth and was studious, particularly concentrating on the Book of Han and the Zuo Zhuan. He, however, did not want to submit to imperial examinations. During Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785-805), when Li Jifu was in exile, Li Deyu accompanied his father and did not seek an official career.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  During the reign of Emperor Xianzong, Li Jifu became chancellor, and it was said that because Li Deyu wanted to avoid appearance of impropriety, he did not serve at the office of the imperial censors or one of the three main bureaus of the imperial government. Rather, he served on the staff of various regional governors. In 816, after the chancellor Zhang Hongjing left the chancellor post and became the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Zhang invited Li Deyu to serve as a secretary. In 819, when Zhang returned to the capital Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor and subsequently remained at Chang'an, Li Deyu was made an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi ().  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. Emperor Muzong made Li Deyu, in addition to his imperial censor position, an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi) as well. It was said that because Emperor Muzong had long heard about Li Jifu while he was crown prince, he had respect for Li Deyu. Soon thereafter, Li Deyu was made Tuntian Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu), and continued to be imperial scholar. It was said that because Li Deyu saw that at the time, the imperial relatives were becoming influential and making improper requests, he submitted a petition that requested that imperial relatives be required to meet the chancellors at the Office of the Chancellors, rather than at private homes. Li Deyu was then promoted to be Kaogong Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and put in charge of drafting edicts. In 821, Li Deyu was involved in an incident that was considered one of the precipitating incidents of the coming Niu-Li Factional Struggles. At that time, both Li Deyu and Yuan Zhen were involved in power struggles with Yuan's fellow Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫, mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) Li Zongmin, particularly since Li Deyu had long resented Li Zongmin and Niu Sengru for what appeared to be harsh criticism against Li Jifu while Li Jifu was chancellor in the third year of Yuanhe ÂÖÉÂíå (803). Meanwhile, Li Zongmin's junior colleague at the legislative bureau, Yang Rushi () and the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang) Qian Hui () were in charge of overseeing the imperial examinations. The military governor Duan Wenchang (a former chancellor) and the imperial scholar Li Shen both made secret pleas to Qian for certain examinees. However, when the results were announced, the examinees that Duan and Li Shen recommended were not given passing results, while among those passing the examinations were Zheng Lang, the brother of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) official Zheng Tan; Pei Zhuan () the son of the military governor Pei Du (also a former chancellor); Li Zongmin's son-in-law Su Chao (); and Yang Rushi's brother Yang Yinshi (). This thus brought a popular uproar, and Duan submitted a report accusing Yang Rushi and Qian of being unfair. When Emperor Muzong requested opinions from the imperial scholars, Li Deyu, Yuan, and Li Shen all agreed with Duan's opinion. Emperor Muzong thus ordered Li Zongmin's colleague Wang Qi () to conduct a re- examination, while demoting Qian, Li Zongmin, and Yang Rushi to be prefectural prefects and deposing 10 of the examinees selected by Qian and Yang Rushi. This was said to be the start of some 30 years of struggles between Li Deyu and his associates (known as the Li Faction) and Li Zongmin and his associates (known as the Niu Faction, named after Niu). In 822, Li Deyu was himself made a Zhongshu Sheren, and continued to serve as imperial scholar. He was considered a possible chancellor candidate, as well as Niu. In 823, Emperor Muzong made a chancellor, while Li Deyu was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). Li Deyu believed that this was the machination by then- chancellor Li Fengji to squeeze him out so that Niu could be made chancellor, and thereafter resented Niu and Li Fengji even more.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. At the time that Li Deyu was made the governor of Zhexi, Zhexi had just suffered through a plot by the officer Wang Guoqing () to overthrow Li Deyu's predecessor Dou Yizhi, and it was said that after the plot was over, Dou exhausted the circuit treasury trying to placate the soldiers. It was said that Li Deyu lived frugally, and gave the remainder of his own expense budget to the soldiers, such that while he did not give them all that much, they were satisfied, and that two years after his commission, the treasury was full again. It was also said that he sought to change the ways of the circuit's people, to eliminate customs that were harmful to them. For example, the people of the circuit were superstitious and fearful of evil spirits, such that if close family members were ill, they would abandon their family members. Li Deyu taught the knowledgeable among the people that this was undue superstition, and further punished those who abandoned family members, such that within a few years, this custom was gone. He also catalogued the various temples in the circuit ‚Äî such that only those that worshipped good historical figures were allowed to remain, while he destroyed 1,010 other temples. He further destroyed 1,460 houses in the mountains so that they could not be used by bandits as operation bases.  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  Emperor Muzong died in 824 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Jingzong. The young Emperor Jingzong was said to be wasteful in his living style, and later in 824 he ordered that Zhexi Circuit submit a number of silver vessels for palace use. Li Deyu petitioned that the order to set aside due to the expenses involved for the circuit. He received no response on his petition, although his subsequent petition to set aside an order for submitting silk was granted. Also in late 824, Wang Zhixing the military governor (Jiedushi) of nearby Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), requested permission for him to let people take tonsure (i.e., to become Buddhist monks) at Si Prefecture (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), to seek divine favors for Emperor Jingzong. Emperor Jingzong initially agreed. As a result, people were rushing to Si Prefecture to take tonsure, to avoid taxes. Li Deyu submitted an objection and pointed out that if this continued, Zhexi and its Zhedong (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) and Fujian (Á¶èÂª∫, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) would lose some 600,000 battle-capable young men, Emperor Jingzong ordered a stop to the practice. In 825, Li Deyu submitted a six-part petition urging Emperor Jingzong to change his ways entitled the Six Maxims of the Red Screen (), written in six poems with 12 four-character lines each, pointing out the emperor's inappropriate behavior in six areas and hoping that he would change: * That he was late to meetings with imperial officials and did not hold them often enough. * That he was wearing inappropriate clothing. * That he was requesting too many tributes. * That he was taking honest counsel lightly. * That he was close to scoundrels. * That he was seeking for pleasures in too many places. Emperor Jingzong issued an edict thanking and praising Li Deyu. It was said that Li Deyu hoped that this would catch Emperor Jingzong's attention and recall him to Chang'an, but Li Fengji, who was still chancellor, prevented that possibility.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign   Prior to chancellorship  Around new year 827, Emperor Jingzong was assassinated and succeeded by his younger brother Emperor Wenzong. In 829, Emperor Wenzong recalled Li Deyu to Chang'an and made him deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang). The senior chancellor Pei Du recommended Li Deyu to Emperor Wenzong to be chancellor, but Li Zongmin, who was then deputy minister of civil service affairs, was named chancellor over Li Deyu due to assistance of eunuchs. Thereafter, because Li Zongmin viewed Li Deyu as a threat, Li Deyu was sent out of Chang'an again to serve as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). Subsequently, under Li Zongmin's recommendation, Niu, who was the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) at that point, was recalled to be chancellor in 830, and it was said that Li Zongmin and Niu worked together to eject Li Deyu's allies out of Chang'an; even Pei was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. Later in 830, Li Deyu was moved from Yicheng to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), which had recently suffered from a Nanzhao incursion in 829 and was said to be weak in its defenses. Upon Li Deyu's arrival in Xichuan, he consulted with many old soldiers and officers of Xichuan to quickly familiarize himself with the fronts with Nanzhao and Tufan. He also sought reinforcements, pointing out that Xichuan's forces had been severely weakened. After his requests were granted, Li Deyu also trained the soldiers, built up the defenses of the border forts, and stored emergency food supplies, and it was said that the people of Xichuan, who were previously fearful of another Nanzhao invasion, were pacified. In 831, Li Deyu sent messengers to Nanzhao to request that Nanzhao return some of the Xichuan people whom Nanzhao had seized during the 829 invasion, and Nanzhao returned 4,000 people. Late in 831, Li Deyu reported that Xidamou (), the Tufan officer in charge of Wei Prefecture (Á∂≠Â∑û, in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan), surrendered Wei Prefecture, which Tufan had captured from Tang decades earlier, to him. Li Deyu advocated accepting the surrender and using Wei Prefecture as a launch pad for a major campaign against Tufan. Niu opposed, arguing that this was a violation of the peace treaty between Tang and Tufan and that, should a war start, Tufan forces could reach Chang'an easily. Emperor Wenzong accepted his argument and ordered that Li Deyu return Wei Prefecture, as well as Xidamou and his soldiers, to Tufan. Tufan had Xidamou and his soldiers massacred. The massacre brought much popular sentiment against Niu, and was commonly viewed at the time to be the result of the conflict between Niu/Li Zongmin and Li Deyu. It was said that this incident caused Li Deyu to resent Niu even more. In 832, with Emperor Wenzong regretting his decision in the Xidamou matter, Niu resigned and was made the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Li Deyu was recalled to Chang'an to serve as minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu) and was expected by popular sentiment to be chancellor next. This caused Li Zongmin much apprehension, and he, under the advice of Du Cong, was initially trying to broker a peace with Li Deyu by recommending Li Deyu to be chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu). However, Li Zongmin subsequently changed his mind under opposition by another associate, Yang Yuqing ().  Chancellorship  In 833, Li Deyu was made chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). When he met with Emperor Wenzong to thank Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Wenzong discussed with him the matter of partisanship within the imperial government, and Li Deyu, seeing that Emperor Wenzong disliked partisanship, opined that one third of the imperial officials were engaging in partisanship ‚Äî and then proceeded to use Emperor Wenzong's dislike of partisanship to eject people he disliked from the government, including Yan Yuqing and Yang's associates Zhang Yuanfu () and Xiao Huan (). He was also soon butting heads with Li Zongmin on a number of matters, such as Yang's demotion and Li Zongmin's public derogation of the talents of Zheng Tan and Yin You (). Later in the year, Li Zongmin was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (). Also in 833, when Yang Yuanqing () the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) was ill and discussion was made regarding Yang's successor, Li Deyu suggested moving Liu Congjian the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), to Xuanwu ‚Äî as the Liu family had been entrenched at Zhaoyi since Liu's father Liu Wu, to eliminate the entrenchment. Emperor Wenzong, believing that it was not yet time to confront Liu Congjian, did not follow Li Deyu's suggestion and instead made former chancellor Li Cheng the military governor of Xuanwu. Meanwhile, at Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wenzong issued a decree that, in addition to creating his son Li Yong crown prince, also ordered that the imperial princes (who had been restricted to living inside the palace complex since the time of Emperor Xuanzong) be allowed to live outside the palace and be given commissions as local officials; that their daughters be married in a prompt manner; and that the imperial examinations no longer test on poetry. (However, the imperial princes' moving out of the palace complex was not implemented due to a dispute over what kind of commissions they would receive.) However, as of 834, Li Deyu began to incur Emperor Wenzong's displeasure by opposing commissions for Emperor Wenzong's close associate Li Zhongyan, which also offended another associate of Emperor Wenzong's, Zheng Zhu, as well as the eunuch Wang Shoucheng, who had recommended Zheng and Li Zhongyan to Emperor Wenzong. Wang, Zheng, and Li Zhongyan, in order to fight against Li Deyu, had Li Zongmin recalled from Shannan West to again serve as chancellor. Soon thereafter, Li Deyu was himself commissioned to be the military governor of Shannan West, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. Li Deyu then met with Emperor Wenzong and requested to stay at Chang'an. Initially, Emperor Wenzong agreed, and allowed him to remain at Chang'an to serve as the minister of defense. However, after Li Zongmin objected that this should not be a matter up for Li Deyu to decide, Emperor Wenzong sent Li Deyu out to Zhenghai Circuit (i.e., Zhexi) to serve as military governor, and further did not allow him to retain the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245.  After chancellorship  However, Zheng Zhu continued to attack Li Deyu. In 835, Zheng's associates Wang Fan () and Li Han () accused Li Deyu of associating with Du Zhongyang () the wet nurse of Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Cou, formerly the Prince of Zhang (who had, by this point been demoted to be the Duke of Chao County), in order to support Li Cou against Emperor Wenzong. Emperor Wenzong, in anger, summoned a meeting with the chancellors, Zheng, Wang, and Li Han. Li Deyu's colleague as chancellor, Lu Sui, spoke in his defense, so initially, the only consequence that Li Deyu suffered was that he was made Taizi Binke (), a member of Li Yong's staff ‚Äî but sent to have his office at the eastern capital Luoyang, making the title entirely honorary. Subsequently, Lu was himself stripped of his chancellor title and made the military governor of Zhenghai on account of his defending Li Deyu. After Lu's demotion, Li Deyu was further demoted to be the secretary general of Yuan Prefecture (Ë¢ÅÂ∑û, in modern Yichun, Jiangxi), on charges that he did not visit Emperor Wenzong when Emperor Wenzong was ill and that his tax collection at Xichuan caused the people trouble. When, subsequently, Li Zongmin also incurred Emperor Wenzong's wrath and was exiled as well, Zheng and Li Zhongyan (whose name had been changed to Li Xun at this point) were able to use the opportunity to accuse any imperial official they disliked of being an associate of Li Zongmin or Li Deyu, and those accused were often exiled or demoted. Late in 835, a plot by Emperor Wenzong, Zheng, and Li Xun to slaughter the powerful eunuchs (later known as the Ganlu Incident) failed, leading to the eunuchs' slaughtering of the imperial officials, including Zheng, Li Xun (who had been made a chancellor by that point), and Li Xun's fellow chancellors Wang Ya, Jia Su, and Shu Yuanyu. After the failure of the plot, in spring 836, Li Deyu was slightly promoted, to be the prefect of Chu Prefecture (ÊªÅÊ¥≤, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), and it was said that those officials previously exiled or demoted on account of being Li Zongmin's or Li Deyu's associates were beginning to be promoted as well. Soon thereafter, Li Deyu himself was again made the governor of Zhexi. In 837, Li Deyu was made the deputy military governor of Huainan, to act as military governor, replacing Niu Sengru. When Niu heard that Li Deyu was to succeed him, he entrusted the matters to his deputy Zhang Lu () and immediately left the circuit. When Li Deyu arrived, he submitted a report stating that the circuit treasury had only half as much as the wealth as Niu reported, and that Zhang had spent half of the wealth in Niu's absence. Niu submitted a petition defending himself and Zhang and requested that Li Deyu be ordered to recount the treasury reserves. After the recount, Niu's report was deemed correct. Li Deyu submitted an apology, stating that he was ill when first arriving at Huainan and had been lied to by his subordinates, requesting punishment. Emperor Wenzong did not punish Li Deyu, however. While at Huainan, there was a time when the eunuch monitor of the circuit, Yang Qinyi (), was recalled to Chang'an, and there was expectation that he would become one of the directors of palace communications ‚Äî one of the highest possible positions for a eunuch. Li Deyu, while not publicly showing deference to Yang, invited Yang to a feast and gave him great amounts of treasure as gifts. However, when Yang reached Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, in modern Kaifeng), Emperor Wenzong changed his order and had him return to Huainan. When Yang returned to Huainan, he, distressed, returned the gifts to Li Deyu, but Li Deyu responded, \\"These are not worth much,\\" and had Yang keep the gifts, thus establishing a strong relationship with Yang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246.  During Emperor Wuzong's reign   Before the Huigu campaign  In 840, Emperor Wenzong died and was succeeded by his younger brother, Emperor Wuzong ‚Äî who was not the choice of Emperor Wenzong (who wanted their nephew Li Chengmei to succeed him) or the chancellors Yang Sifu (whom Emperor Wuzong later believed had supported another brother of his, Li Rong the Prince of An) and Li Jue (whom Emperor Wuzong later believed had supported Li Chengmei), both of whom were considered Niu Faction leaders by later historiansE.g., Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59 [839]. ‚Äî but was chosen by the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (). As Emperor Wuzong did not trust Yang or Li Jue, he removed them from their chancellor posts, and, as Yang Qinyi had recommended Li Deyu, he decided to recall Li Deyu from Huainan to serve as chancellor. Upon Li Deyu's arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Wuzong made him Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau, and chancellor again with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. When meeting Emperor Wuzong to thank him, Li Deyu emphasized the importance of entrusting the chancellors with the affairs of state, as well as openness between the emperor and his officials, both points that Emperor Wuzong agreed with. Soon after Li Deyu became chancellor again, officials considered Yang Sifu's associates, such as Pei Yizhi () and Li Zhongmin () were ejected from the imperial government. Nevertheless, in 841, when Emperor Wuzong, still resentful over how Yang and Li Jue did not support him, sent eunuchs to order Yang and Li Jue to commit suicide, with Du Cong pointing out to Li Deyu that he should not encourage Emperor Wuzong to be in the mode of killing officials, Li Deyu, along with fellow chancellors Cui Gong, Cui Dan, and Chen Yixing, interceded on Yang's and Li Jue's behalf, and after much pleading from them, Yang, Li Jue, as well as Pei, were further demoted, but spared of their lives.  The Huigu campaign  Meanwhile, in 840, the Tang ally Huigu's khan Yaoluoge Hesa () and its prime minister Jueluowu () were killed in a major Xiajiasi, and the remaining Huigu forces were thrown into a state of confusion. In the confusion, one group of Huigu nobles supported Yaoluoge Wuxi () as the new khan (as Wujie Khan), while Yaoluoge Hesa's brother Wamosi took another group of Huigu nobles to the border city of Tiande (Â§©Âæ∑, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia) and offered to submit to Tang. In 841, Tiande's commander Tian Mou () and eunuch monitor Wei Zhongping (), wanting to be credited with victories, suggested not to accept the surrender ‚Äî arguing that Wamosi was a traitor as far as Wujie Khan was concerned ‚Äî and to attack. Li Deyu pointed out that Wamosi was no traitor ‚Äî as he offered to submit before Wujie Khan had even claimed khan title ‚Äî and that based on the prior Tang-Huigu alliance, distressed Huigu people, such as the people under Wamosi's command, should be accepted. Emperor Wuzong agreed and accepted Wamosi's submission. Wamosi subsequently requested emergency food relief for the Huigu people, which Li Deyu suggested that Emperor Wuzong accept. At a subsequent meeting called by Emperor Wenzong, Chen Yixing vehemently opposed, arguing that this would be, in effect, aiding the enemy. Li Deyu pointed out regardless of whether Wamosi remained submissive, his people would have to be fed ‚Äî or otherwise, with Tang forces not ready for combat at that point, Tiande would fall under an attack. Chen did not dare to oppose further, and Emperor Wuzong approved the sending of emergency food supplies to Wamosi's people. Also under Li Deyu's advice, Emperor Wuzong issued an edict to Wamosi asking him to seek out and return Emperor Xianzong's daughter (and thus, Emperor Wuzong's aunt) Princess Taihe, whom Emperor Muzong had married to a prior khan, Chongde Khan, as part of a heqin (marriage alliance) marriage, whom Emperor Wuzong's court had lost contact with since the crushing defeat that Xiajiasi forces inflicted against the Huigu forces. (Unknown to Emperor Wuzong (and Li Deyu) at this point, Princess Taihe had initially been captured by Xiajiasi's khan Are (), who claimed to be distantly related to Tang's imperial Li clan and who treated her with respect. Are sent a convoy to escort her back to Tang territory, but the convoy was intercepted and destroyed by Wujie Khan, who subsequently took Princess Taihe hostage.) Meanwhile, one of the circuits on the Huigu border ‚Äî Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), which had long been only nominally under imperial control ‚Äî was going through internal turmoils of its own, as early in 841, there had been a mutiny that killed the military governor Shi Yuanzhong. The soldiers initially supported the officer Chen Xingtai () to take over the circuit. Emperor Wuzong, under Li Deyu's advice, declined to take immediate action on petitions submitted on Chen's behalf for Chen to become military governor. Soon thereafter, Chen himself was assassinated, and the soldiers supported another officer, Zhang Jiang () to be their leader. Emperor Wuzong similarly declined to act on petitions on Zhang's behalf. Thereafter, when Lulong officer Zhang Zhongwu, who was then the commander of Xiongwu Base (ÈõÑÊ≠¶Ëªç, in modern Chengde, Hebei), requested imperial commission and permission to attack Zhang Jiang, Emperor Wuzong, again under Li Deyu's advice, agreed, and Zhang Zhongwu soon captured Lulong's capital You Prefecture () and took over the circuit. Also in 841, when a flood damaged Xiang Prefecture (), the capital of Shannan East Circuit, which Niu Sengru was then the military governor of, Li Deyu used the opportunity to blame the destruction on Niu and had him stripped of his authorities. In spring 842, there was another event that the later Song Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing pointed out showed the partisan side of Li Deyu.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59 [842]. The official Liu Gongquan was friendly with Li Deyu, but when Cui Gong recommended Liu to be an imperial scholar to be in charge of Jixian Institute (), Li Deyu was displeased because this recommendation was not made by him. He therefore found an excuse to have Liu made Taizi Zhanshi () ‚Äî an entirely honorary post with no authorities. Also in 842, at Li Deyu's advice, Emperor Wuzong ordered Tian to stop engaging the Huigu irregulars, but instead entice them with food supplies and send them to Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) (so that they would not remain at Tiande and be disruptive). Also under Li Deyu's recommendation, the general Shi Xiong was sent to Tiande to assist Tian in defending against Huigu raids. Meanwhile, Qiu had become very jealous of Li Deyu's hold on power as well. When Emperor Wuzong was planning to issue a general pardon, rumors got to Qiu that, as part of the edict, the chancellors and the director of finances were planning to reduce Shence Army's clothing and food stipends, Qiu publicly declared, \\"If this occurred, when the pardon is declared, the soldiers will gather in front of Danfeng Tower [(‰∏πÈ≥≥Ê®ì, the tower from which emperors declared pardons)] and demonstrate!\\" Emperor Wuzong, angered by the remarks, sent eunuchs to rebuke Qiu and the other Shence Army officers for spreading rumors, and Qiu apologized. By summer 842, Wujie Khan was openly attacking Tang border regions. Emperor Wuzong put Li Deyu in charge of drafting various rebukes against Wujie Khan and his advisors, urging them to reconsider their attacks. Also, with Wujie Khan forcing Princess Taihe to submit requests to allow Huigu to borrow Tiande as an operation base, Emperor Wuzong had Li Deyu write her a response back, stating: Under Li Deyu's advice, Emperor Wuzong subsequently sent Wamosi (who had by this point been granted the Tang imperial name of Li Sizhong) and the general Li Zhongshun () to the border to fight against Wujie Khan. Meanwhile, in a surprise attack, in spring 843, Shi inflicted great losses on Wujie Khan's forces and rescued Princess Taihe, after which Wujie Khan fled and would no longer be a threat to Tang. Subsequently, when Emperor Wuzong considered asking Xiajiasi to return Anxi (ÂÆâË•ø, formerly headquartered in modern Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang) and Beiting (ÂåóÂ∫≠, formerly headquartered in modern Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang) Circuits ‚Äî which were formerly under Tang control but which had been lost for decades ‚Äî Li Deyu opposed, pointing out that it would be a logistical nightmare to place garrisons at Anxi and Beiting and supply them. Emperor Wuzong agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. With the Huigu campaign over, Li Deyu sought to revisit the Xidamou incident, which had occurred 12 years earlier ‚Äî submitting a petition that painted Niu as jealous of him and causing a great injustice, and also arguing that Wei Prefecture would have served as a forward attack point against Tufan. At Li Deyu's urging, Emperor Wuzong posthumously honored Xidamou as a general. (It was believed by the modern historian Zhu Gui () that Li Deyu was intending to use the revisiting of the Xidamou incident to carry out his vengeance against Niu and Li Zongmin, but that subsequent events ‚Äî the Zhaoyi campaign ‚Äî gave Li Deyu even greater ammunition.)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59 [843].  The Zhaoyi campaign  = Events of 843 = In summer 843, Liu Congjian was growing ill, and he wanted his adoptive son and biological nephew Liu Zhen to succeed him as the military governor of Zhaoyi. Liu Congjian soon died, but Liu Zhen did not announce his death and had petitions written in Liu Congjian's name requesting that Liu Zhen be made military governor. The chancellors largely believed that a campaign against Zhaoyi would be difficult to wage and therefore suggested that the request be granted. Li Deyu, however, argued that Zhaoyi, unlike Lulong and two other circuits north of the Yellow River ‚Äî Weibo (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) and Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) ‚Äî did not have a tradition of defying the imperial government, and therefore suggested that Liu Congjian's petition be denied, pointing out that allowing the Liu family to continue to hold Zhaoyi would cause other military governors to want to follow suit. He further suggested that, in order to make sure that Weibo's military governor He Hongjing and Chengde's military governor Wang Yuankui would not assist Liu Zhen, explicit promises be made to He Hongjing and Wang that their circuits would not be interfered with, and that they would be responsible for capturing three of Zhaoyi's five prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains, thus making sure that imperial forces would not operate close to Weibo or Chengde. Emperor Wuzong agreed, and imperial messengers were dispatched to Weibo and Chengde; He Hongjing and Wang agreed to follow imperial orders. (Meanwhile, Li Deyu used the opportunity to strike at Li Zongmin ‚Äî by accusing Li Zongmin of being an associate of Liu Congjian's ‚Äî and had Li Zongmin sent out of Luoyang to be the prefect of Hu Prefecture (ÊπñÂ∑û, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). After Liu Zhen finally announced Liu Congjian's death, Emperor Wuzong publicly posthumously honored Liu Congjian, but ordered that Liu Zhen escort Liu Congjian's casket to Luoyang, and further met with Liu Zhen's biological father Liu Congsu (), telling him to persuade Liu Zhen to accept the order. Liu Zhen refused, and Emperor Wuzong ordered a general campaign against Zhaoyi. At Li Deyu's suggestion, the military governors were ordered to have specific targets to capture within Zhaoyi (to prevent them from waging minor battles and then sitting on the front without truly engaging Zhaoyi forces) ‚Äî with Wang targeting Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), He Hongjing targeting Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan), Wang Maoyuan () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) targeting Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), and LI Yanzuo () the military governor of Wuning Circuit and Liu Mian () the military governor of Hedong Circuit targeting Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (). When Li Yanzuo subsequently delayed on the way to the front, at Li Deyu's advice, Emperor Wuzong issued harshly worded edicts to push him to proceed, and also made Shi Xiong his deputy to eventually have Shi take over Li Yanzuo's troops. Soon, Shi took over Li Yanzuo's troops and immediately launched attacks against Zhaoyi. Meanwhile, Wang Yuankui and He Hongjing, on Zhaoyi's eastern front, were having disagreements, with Wang secretly accusing that He Hongjing was purposefully delaying attacks on Zhaoyi. At Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wuzong had Wang Zai the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) lead additional troops to attack Zhaoyi's eastern prefectures ‚Äî which would take Zhongwu troops through Weibo. This surprised He Hongjing, who thus felt pressured to attack Zhaoyi, and he finally launched his troops. As soon as He Hongjing launched his troops, Wang Zai's orders were then changed to aid Heyang Circuit, which Liu Zhen was attacking in an effort to force the imperial government into a truce and which Wang Maoyuan could not protect due to his own illness. After Wang Maoyuan died thereafter, at Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wuzong put the Heyang troops under Wang Zai's command as well, but did not make him the military governor of Heyang. While the campaign was going on, there was a Dangxiang uprising, which attacked Yan Prefecture (ÈπΩÂ∑û, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Li Deyu pointed out that the nomadic Dangxiang were roving pillagers who were not taken seriously by border officials because the border officials wanted to acquire camels and horses from them, and suggested that a command structure be imposed over the six circuits where the Dangxiang resided, with an imperial prince in nominal command. Emperor Wuzong agreed and nominally made his son Li Qi () the Prince of Yan be the supreme commander of the six circuits and chief comforter of the Dangxiang, and made the official Li Hui Li Qi's deputy, in actual supervision of the Dangxiang situation. With Wang Zai getting victories over Zhaoyi forces (but unable to capture Ze Prefecture immediately), Liu Zhen had a letter from Li Tian () the prefect of Ming Prefecture, a cousin to Li Shi, a former chancellor who was by this point the military governor of Hedong, sent to Li Shi, suggesting that Liu was willing to surrender. Li Deyu suggested, and Emperor Wuzong agreed, that no action be taken on the offer immediately, and ordered Li Shi reply in a harsh manner, indicating that surrender would only be accepted if Liu and his family members had themselves bound and taken to the border between Zhaoyi and Hedong; only then would Li Shi agree to escort them to Chang'an. = Events of 844 = Meanwhile, the Hedong forces, under the command of the officer Wang Feng (), were stationed at Yushe (Ê¶ÜÁ§æ, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), and Wang sought reinforcements. Hedong headquarters, however, were out of troops, so Li Shi summoned 1,500 soldiers from the northern front, that Liu Mian had previously placed at Hengshui Fence (Ê©´Ê∞¥Êüµ, in modern Datong, Shanxi) during the Huige campaign, under the command of the officer Yang Bian (), back to Taiyuan, so that he could send them to reinforce Wang. Three days before the Chinese New Year, the Hengshui Fence soldiers arrived, but as the circuit treasury was empty, Li Shi could not give them the silk rewards that the soldiers being sent on a campaign were accustomed to receive; rather, he had to take silk out of his own personal wealth, but was only able to pay half as much. Further, the eunuch monitor L√º Yizhong (), then with Wang, was sending messages forcing the soldiers to get underway without staying at Taiyuan for New Year. The soldiers were angry and distressed, and Yang took this opportunity to start an uprising. He had the soldiers pillage the city and take control of the city of Taiyuan. Li Shi was forced to flee to Fen Prefecture (Ê±æÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Yang subsequently entered into an alliance with Liu Zhen In light of Yang's uprising, there were immediate calls among the imperial officials to stop the campaign against Zhaoyi, and even Wang Zai was calling for accepting Liu's surrender. Li Deyu opposed, and again reiterated that Liu's surrender should only be accepted if he and his family bound themselves. Under further advice by Li Deyu, who argued that Yang's uprising could not be tolerated, Emperor Wuzong ordered that the focus of the campaign be shifted, to concentrate on Yang first. To those ends, he ordered Li Shi and L√º to gather troops from nearby prefectures and try to recapture Taiyuan, while ordering Wang Feng to leave Hedong troops at Yushe and instead take troops previously sent by Yiwu (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Xuanwu, and Yanhai (ÂÖóÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) Circuits to head toward Taiyuan. He also ordered Wang Yuankui to divert troops toward Taiyuan as well. This set a panic into the Hedong soldiers at Yushe, who were fearful that the soldiers from other circuits would slaughter their families if Taiyuan fell, so they volunteered to attack Yang with L√º as their commander. In less than a month after Yang took over Taiyuan, the Hedong troops under L√º recaptured the city and arrested Yang, who was subsequently delivered to Chang'an and executed. Meanwhile, Li Deyu came to believe that, and he informed Emperor Wuzong that, Wang Zai was not putting more pressure on Ze Prefecture for two reasons ‚Äî because Shi Xiong had been falsely accused by Wang Zai's father Wang Zhixing previously and therefore there was an enmity between the two men (and therefore, Wang Zai was concerned that attacking Ze Prefecture harder would allow Shi to take the chance to capture Lu Prefecture); and that Wang Zai's biological son Wang Yanshi (), whom Wang Zhixing had adopted as a son and therefore was legally Wang Zai's brother, was the prefect of one of the Zhaoyi prefectures, Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan) and had been detained by Liu. Emperor Wuzong thus sent Wang Zai an edict in which he again ordered him to advance, and further pressured Wang Zai by moving Liu Mian, who was then the military governor of Yiwu, to Heyang. Around the same time, Emperor Wuzong had begun to favor a Taoist monk, Zhao Guizhen (), despite the advisory officials' advice against it. Emperor Wuzong had to assure Li Deyu that he would not be affected in his policy decisions by Zhao. Meanwhile, Li Deyu was also gaining intelligence information from Zhaoyi officers who surrendered, and was directing Wang Zai, Wang Feng, and He Hongjing in their tactics.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. By this point, the Zhaoyi soldiers at Xing, Ming, and Ci Prefectures had been tired out by the war and enraged with Liu Zhen's trusted officer Liu Xi (), who was collecting taxes even from the soldiers' family members, against the pleas by Liu Congjian's brother-in-law Pei Wen (), whom Liu Zhen had put in charge of the three prefectures. Pei, also angered by Liu Xi and believing the situation to be hopeless, surrendered along with Wang Zhao () to Wang Yuankui and He Hongjing. At Li Deyu's urging, Emperor Wuzong quickly sent the imperially-commissioned military governor Lu Jun () to take over the three prefectures, before Wang Yuankui and He Hongjing could consider asking that the three prefectures be annexed to their circuits. Upon the news of the three prefectures' surrender's arrival in Lu Prefecture, the people of Lu Prefecture became fearful. A group of officers, led by Liu Zhen's trusted officer Guo Yi (), persuaded Liu that the only way that the Liu clan could be saved was for him to allow them to kill him, present his head to the imperial government, and surrender. Liu thus allowed them to kill him without a fight ‚Äî and Guo and his followers then nevertheless slaughtered the Liu clan and surrendered to the imperial government.  After the Zhaoyi campaign  Emperor Wuzong immediately inquired of Li Deyu what his opinion was as to how to deal with Guo Yi. Li Deyu argued that Guo was untrustworthy ‚Äî having been a major advocate of Liu Zhen's resistance of the imperial regime and then eventually betraying Liu ‚Äî and Emperor Wuzong agreed, despite misgivings by Du Cong, then also chancellor. Emperor Wuzong thus ordered Shi Xiong to enter Lu Prefecture and, under guise that he was going to distribute commissions to Guo and the other officers involved in Liu's death at a feast, had them rounded up and arrested. Guo and the other officers were subsequently delivered to Chang'an and executed. Also under Emperor Wuzong's orders, Shi exhumed Liu Congjian's body and had it publicly displayed then cut into pieces. For Li Deyu's contributions, Emperor Wuzong created him the Duke of Zhao and gave him the honorary title of Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies). (Subsequently, Li Deyu requested a different creation because Li Jifu also carried the title of Duke of Zhao, and he was not Li Jifu's oldest son, suggesting that he would prefer the title of Duke of Wei. Emperor Wuzong agreed and change his title accordingly.)New Book of Tang, vol. 180. After the Zhaoyi campaign, Li Deyu was becoming even more powerful in Emperor Wuzong's government, but he was also drawing resentment for his harshness. For example, after the end of the campaign, he had Emperor Wuzong issue an edict announcing that the family members of Li Xun, Wang Ya, and Jia Su, who had previously been sheltered by Liu Congjian and Liu Zhen after fleeing to Zhaoyi but whom Guo then executed, had been executed, referring to them as the family members of traitors. He further had the Zhaoyi officers who had previously surrendered list Liu Zhen's collaborators and were slaughtering them in large numbers, even though Lu Jun was arguing that too many people were being innocently killed. He further carried out reprisals against Li Zongmin and Niu Sengru, accusing them of having been in communications with Liu Congjian and Liu Zhen despite the lack of evidence ‚Äî going as far as having Liu Congjian's secretary Zheng Qing () claim that whenever Liu Congjian received letters from Li Zongmin or Niu, he would read them and burn them. Emperor Wuzong, believing Li Deyu's accusations, had Li Zongmin and Niu demoted and exiled several times, eventually with Niu being made the secretary general of Xun Prefecture (Âæ™Â∑û, in modern Huizhou, Guangdong), and Li Zongmin stripped of all offices and exiled to Feng Prefecture (Â∞ÅÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong). In 845, Li Shen, then the military governor of Huainan, accused one of his subordinates, the magistrate of Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou), Wu Xiang (), whose uncle Wu Wuling () had long had an adversarial relationship with Li Deyu, of embezzlement and forcibly marrying the daughter of a commoner, Yan Yue (). Many advisory officials pointed out that the evidence against Wu Xiang was weak, and Emperor Wuzong sent the censors Cui Yuanzao () and Li Chou () to review the case. Cui and Li Chou reported that Wu Xiang did embezzle funds, but that his father-in-law Yan was not a commoner, nor was the marriage forced. Li Deyu, despite Cui's and Li Chou's report, nevertheless had Wu Xiang executed, and further, retaliating against Cui and Li Chou for their contrary reports, had them demoted and exiled. Also in 845, apparently with Li Deyu's support, Emperor Wuzong ordered a general reduction in Buddhist and other temples, including those of Zoroastrian, only leaving two temples each at Chang'an and Luoyang, while each circuit and five large prefectures were allowed to retain one temple each. All other temples were destroyed, and the monks and nuns ordered to return to civilian life. The temples' lands were confiscated, while the building material used for the buildings, statues, and bells were seized to build governmental properties and mint money. (This was the third of the Three Disasters of Wu ‚Äî major persecutions against Buddhism in Chinese history.)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [845]. Later in 845, at Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wuzong established a special treasury for the purpose of border defense, setting aside funds for that purpose. Also, when Emperor Wuzong wanted to create his favorite concubine Consort Wang empress, Li Deyu opposed on the grounds that Consort Wang was of low birth and was sonless, so Emperor Wuzong did not do so. It was said that by this point, as Du Cong and Cui Xuan were no longer chancellors, Li Deyu wielded all the chancellor powers, such that even the eunuchs and Emperor Wuzong were becoming displeased with him. When the imperial attendant Wei Hongzhi () suggested that Li Deyu, as chancellor, should not further be in control of the imperial treasury, Li Deyu submitted a defense of himself and had Wei demoted, further angering other officials. In spring 846, Emperor Wuzong, suffering from the effects of alchemists' pills designing to lead to immortality, became seriously ill, and the eunuchs decided on having Emperor Wuzong's uncle (Emperor Muzong's younger brother) Li Yi the Prince of Guang, who had been considered to be unintelligent, succeed Emperor Wuzong, and thus issued an edict in Emperor Wuzong's name creating Li Yi crown prince and changing Li Yi's name to Li Chen. When Emperor Wuzong thereafter died, Li Chen became emperor (as Emperor XuƒÅnzong), and during the period of mourning, Li Deyu served as regent.  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  Emperor XuƒÅnzong, however, was far from unintelligent, and had long resented Li Deyu's hold on power. On the day of his enthronement, Li Deyu served as the ceremonial presenter of the congratulatory notes from the imperial officials. After the ceremony was complete, Emperor XuƒÅnzong stated to his attendants: \\"Was the person approaching me the Taiwei? Whenever he looked at me, my hairs were raised.\\" The day after the mourning period was over, Emperor XuƒÅnzong sent Li Deyu out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. It was said that given how long Li Deyu had been in power, it came as a complete shock to all involved that he would be sent out of the capital. Emperor XuƒÅnzong subsequently also had a number of Li Deyu's associates sent out of the capital. Later in the year, the five former chancellors that Emperor Wuzong had exiled ‚Äî Niu Sengru, Li Zongmin, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue ‚Äî were gradually moved closer to Chang'an (although Li Zongmin died before he could be moved). Li Deyu was subsequently made the defender of Luoyang, and no longer carried the honorary title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. In 847, under the further accusations by Li Deyu's successor as chancellor, Bai Minzhong, Li Deyu was made a senior advisor to the crown prince ‚Äî an entirely honorary title since there was no crown prince at the time ‚Äî and ordered to have his office at Luoyang. In fall 847, Wu Xiang's brother Wu Runa () submitted a petition arguing that Wu Xiang was improperly executed and accusing Li Shen and Li Deyu of causing the improper execution. Emperor XuƒÅnzong recalled Cui Yuanzao from exile and had him give an account of the case to the Office of the Imperial Censors, which subsequently submitted a report agreeing that Wu Xiang was improperly executed. As a result, Li Deyu was further demoted and exiled to be the military advisor to the prefect of Chao Prefecture (ÊΩÆÂ∑û, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong). In fall 848, Li Deyu was further demoted to be the census officer at Yai Prefecture (Â¥ñÂ∑û, in modern Haikou, Hainan), where Li Deyu died around the new year 850. It was said that his casket was allowed to be returned to be Chang'an and buried there only after intercession by the chancellor Linghu Tao ‚Äî who had dreamed of Li Deyu's pleading with him to do so. However, Li Deyu's titles were only posthumously restored in 860, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Emperor Yizong, at the urging of the official Liu Ye.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. Posthumous perception The lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, the Later Jin chancellor Liu Xu, had this to say about Li Deyu: On the island of Hainan, Li Deyu has been commemorated in the Temple of Five Lords since the time of the Ming Dynasty. In fiction Played by Lau Dan, a fictionalized version of Li Deyu was portrayed in 2009 Hong Kong's TVB television series, Beyond the Realm of Conscience.

At about , it will be the largest park developed in New York City since the 19th century. Its construction began in October 2008 and is slated to continue in phases for at least 30 years. When fully developed by 2035-37,\\"Freshkills Park\\" New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Freshkills Park will be the second-largest park in New York City and almost three times the size of Central Park in Manhattan.Freshkills Park Vision, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation The park is envisioned as a regional destination that integrates 2,200 acres of open grasslands, waterways and engineered structures into one cohesive and dynamic unit that will host a variety of public spaces and facilities for social, cultural and physical activity, learning and play.Sections of the park will be connected by a circulation system for vehicles and a network of paths for bicyclists and pedestrians. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) is managing the project with the New York City Department of Sanitation. History Landfill The landfill opened in 1948 in what was then a salt marsh in a rural agricultural area. The subsoil was clay, with a layer of sand and silt on top. There were tidal wetlands, forests, and freshwater wetlands. The area was considered prime for development because the value of wetlands in buffering storm surges and filtering water was not understood at the time. The initial plan was to raise the elevation of the land by filling for three years and then redevelop it as a multi-use area with residential, recreational, and industrial components. However, three years turned into fifty years. NYC‚Äôs population was growing and generating more garbage and it was easy to expand the filling operation on Staten Island, especially for people living in the other four boroughs. The landfill accepted garbage from 1948 through 2001. By 1955, the landfill was the largest in the world. At the peak of its operation, the contents of twenty barges ‚Äì each carrying 650 tons of garbage ‚Äì were added to the site every day. Staten Islanders tried many times to close operations at the landfill and were finally successful in 1996 when regulations were passed to close the landfill by 2001. In 2001 it was estimated that, if kept open, the landfill would have eventually become the highest point on the East Coast. Under strong community pressure and with support of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the landfill site was closed on March 22, 2001, but it had to be reopened after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan. Virtually all the materials from the World Trade Center site were sent to the temporarily reopened landfill for examination. Thousands of detectives and forensic evidence specialists worked for over 1.7 million hours at Fresh Kills Landfill to try to recover the remains of people killed in the attacks. A final count of 4,257 human remains were recovered; the City's Chief Medical Examiner retains custody of all still-unidentified materials at a facility within the National 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan. The remaining materials at Fresh Kills were then buried in a 40-acre (160,000 m2) portion of the landfill that will be known as West Mound. Afterward, the landfill facility was closed permanently, in anticipation of the park on the site. International design competitions In 2001, the New York City Department of City Planning (NYCDCP) held an international design competition following the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a landscape architecture firm to develop a master plan for the park. The competition's first round was open to all participants, and in August 2001, six landscape architecture proposals were chosen as finalists. These proposals came from: James Corner Field Operations, Hargreaves Associates, Mathur/da Cunha, Tom Leader Studio, John McAslan + Partners, RIOS Associates, Inc., and Sasaki Associates. In 2003, James Corner Field Operations was selected as the winner of the competition and was hired to prepare a draft master plan to guide long-term development of the Park. The Draft Master Plan was prepared over the following years and released in March 2006. In 2006, NYC Parks became the lead agency overseeing the park development process. In 2011, the Land Art Generator Initiative announced Freshkills Park as the site for a design competition, LAGI-NYC 2012. Although construction of the winning design was not guaranteed, the initiative hoped to bring international attention to the aesthetic potential of renewable energy infrastructure. Planning The Freshkills Park site from above Draft Master Plan The 2006 Draft Master Plan for Freshkills Park envisioned the site as five parks in one, each with a distinct character and programming approach.Draft Master Plan Overview , New York City Department of City Planning (DCP), Draft Master Plan. Accessed January 7, 2010. The Plan was developed with input gathered in meetings and workshops between the project team and Staten Islanders, nonprofit groups, and government officials. Goals emerging from the outreach efforts included: roads to ease traffic congestion surrounding the Freshkills Park site; active recreational uses such as kayaking, horseback riding, and sports fields; and projects generating and using renewable sources of energy.Fresh Kills Park Project , New York City Department of City Planning (DCP), Community Input. Accessed November 30, 2009. The planning process also included the input of a community advisory group consisting of local leaders and stakeholders. The five areas envisioned in the draft plan are described below: *North Park: The 223-acre (0.90 km2) North Park will retain much of its natural character in order to expand the neighboring habitat of the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. North Park will largely be devoted to wildlife and passive recreation, though trails for biking, walking, and hiking will also be included *South Park: Like North Park, South Park contains a significant amount of natural woodland and wetland, but also contains ample flat, non-wetland space for more active recreational uses. The draft master plan for this 425-acre (1.72 km2) site envisioned tennis courts, trails, athletic facilities, and an equestrian center. *East Park: At 482 acres (1.95 km2), meadows, trails, playing fields and picnic areas were proposed for East Park. A golf course was also suggested as a means to generate revenue for operations. A road system connecting Richmond Avenue and the West Shore Expressway has also been proposed for East Park.Plan for East Park , DCP Draft Master Plan. 2006. Accessed November 2009. *West Park: After the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center, about 1,200,000 short tons (1,100,000 long tons) of materials were brought to the West Park site where it was carefully screened and sifted. The search effort did not end until all discernible materials were removed and taken to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York for identification and safekeeping. The Department of Sanitation is still in the process of capping and closing this mound and no formal planning has been undertaken by Parks for this area. *The Confluence: Located at the meeting point of the site‚Äôs two creeks is a 70 acre (280,000 m2) area planned as the center of the park. The Confluence will host visitor and information centers, restaurants, a marina, event spaces and landscapes for passive recreation. Waterborne access to the area has been proposed via the waterways that previously permitted barge deliveries to the landfill.Plan for the Confluence , DCP Draft Master Plan for Freshkills Park. 2006. Accessed November 2009.  Capital Projects  Capital projects entail a complex and lengthy design and permitting process, involving both City and State agencies, to ensure that all landfill infrastructure as well as the developing ecological resources are adequately protected. NYC Parks started park development around the outer edges of the park both to show the City‚Äôs commitment to transforming the former landfill to local neighborhoods and because permitting was easier. Those projects include: ‚óè Schmul Park: The first project in the Travis neighborhood, the renovation of Schmul Park was completed in 2012. Formerly an asphalt and chain-link fence playground, it was converted into a park with new play surfaces, basketball and handball courts, permeable substrate and concrete, and native plantings. ‚óè Owl Hollow Soccer Fields: DPR then undertook the construction of the Owl Hollow Soccer Fields, on the southeastern side of the Park. This project included four new AstroTurf fields located near the intersection of Arden Avenue and Arthur Kill Road. Two of the fields are lit at night for extended, a circular path and parking. The project was completed in 2013. ‚óè New Springville Greenway: In 2015, NYC Parks completed the construction of the New Springville Greenway- a new bike and pedestrian path that runs along the edge of Richmond Avenue. ‚óè North Park Phase 1: In 2017, NYC Parks broke ground for North Park Phase 1, a 21 acre arc path that begins at the park entrance and takes visitors along the side of north mound to expansive views of the creeks and will include a composting comfort station, a bird tower and a wetland overlook deck. This park also has a path connecting it to Schmul Park. This project will be complete in 2021. ‚óè South Park Anchor Park: In 2016, $30 million in funding was allocated to Freshkills Park as part of the city's Anchor Parks program. The South Park Anchor Park project is in design and includes walking paths, two multi-purpose fields, a comfort station and parking. Design is anticipated to be complete in November 2020. Solar array In March of 2012, NYC released A Request for Proposals for the construction of solar and/or wind energy facilities. The project for the construction of solar arrays was awarded to SunEdison in November 2013. NYC was in contractual negotiations with SunEdison when the company went bankrupt in 2016. No further work has been done with respect to siting of renewable energy at Freshkills Park since that time. Wildlife The in-construction park is home to a diverse array of wildlife; a 2015 BioBlitz recorded 320 species of plants and animals in a 24-hr period. Ongoing ecological research projects are tracking some of the changes in wildlife as the site transforms from industrial space to green space. Current projects include fish population monitoring, grassland habitat characterization, migratory bird banding, grassland bird monitoring, and bat population monitoring. Over 200 species of birds have been seen at the park either nesting, migrating, hunting, or foraging. Freshkills Park is now home to the largest nesting colony of Grasshopper Sparrows in New York State‚Äìa NYS Species of Special Concern which began nesting on-site in 2015. Common wildlife species at Freshkills Park include Red-winged Blackbirds, American Goldfinches, Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Osprey, Ring-necked Pheasants, Tree Swallows, Turkey Vultures, Northern Harriers, Savannah Sparrows, American Woodcock, white- tailed deer, muskrat, red foxes, northern snapping turtles and diamondback terrapins. Programs While Freshkills Park continues its development, NYC Parks and the Freshkills Park Alliance have hosted events and programs including active recreation on- site, in areas generally closed to the public. The park is open to the public on bi-annual Discovery Days in the spring and fall, when visitors have the opportunity to kayak, bike, hike, and fly kites on a closed section of the park. The Freshkills Park Alliance runs educational and public programs in closed sections of the park, including kayaking, cycling and running events, citizen science, art projects, tours, and field trips. Beginning in 2020, Freshkills Park began offering virtual field trips and programming. The Freshkills Park office regularly partners with cultural and academic organizations on Staten Island and in NYC for these programs. Landfill operations and state regulations The Fresh Kills Landfill actively received New York City‚Äôs municipal waste from 1947 to 2001. Two of the four mounds at the site‚Äîthe mounds referred to as North and South‚Äîwere capped let‚Äôs say the exact years in the late 1990s with an impermeable cover separating waste from the environment.Freshkills Landfill Turns a New Leaf Monica Ashford. Scienceline. September 19, 2008. Accessed December 14, 2009. Capping of the East Mound, which will become East Park, began in 2007 and was completed in 2011. Capping of the West Mound began in 2011 and is currently scheduled to be complete in 2022. The Department of Sanitation works with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to meet regulations for environmentally sound landfill closure; it will also maintain operating responsibility for on‚Äìsite environmental monitoring and control systems after capping. NYC Parks must also meet NYSDEC‚Äôs regulations‚Äîno area of the park is permitted to open to public access until it meets state standards for public access.Public Health & Safety NYC Parks. 2009.

It is the most heavily branched and most compact of the many octane isomers, the only one with a butane (C4) backbone. Because of its highly symmetrical structure, it has a very high melting point and a short liquid range; in fact, it is the smallest saturated acyclic hydrocarbon that appears as a solid at a room temperature of 25 ¬∞C. (Among cyclic hydrocarbons, cubane, C8H8 is even smaller and is also solid at room temperature.) The compound can be obtained by reaction of Grignard reagent tert-butylmagnesium bromide with ethyl bromide, or of ethylmagnesium bromide with tert-butyl bromide in the presence of manganese(II) ions. This transformation is believed to go through the dimerization of two tert-butyl radicals, which are generated by decomposition of the organomanganese compounds generated in situ. The full IUPAC name of the compound is 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, but the numbers are superfluous in this case because there is no other possible arrangement of \\"tetramethylbutane\\".

A son of Diotimus, Strombichides was appointed to command the eight ships which the Athenians sent to the coast of Asia Minor, following the news of the revolt of Chios in 412 BC. On his arrival at Samos he added a Samian trireme to his squadron and sailed to Teos to check on the rebellion there. But soon after, he was compelled to flee to Samos from a superior Peloponnesian fleet, under Chalcideus and Alcibiades and, as a result, Teos revolted. Not long after this Strombichides seems to have returned to Athens, and later in the same year he was one of three commanders who were sent to the Athenians at Samos with a reinforcement of thirty-five ships, which increased their whole force to 104. This they now divided, retaining the greater part of the fleet at Samos to command the sea, and to carry on the war against Miletus, while Strombichides and two others were despatched to Chios with thirty triremes. On their way they lost three of their vessels in a storm. However, with the rest of the fleet they proceeded to Lesbos, and made preparations for the Siege of Chios, to which island they then crossed over, fortified a strong post named Delphinium, and reduced, for a time, the population of Chios to great extremities. In 411 BC, following the revolt of Abydos and Lampsacus, Strombichides sailed from Chios with twenty four ships and recovered Lampsacus, but was unable either to persuade or compel Abydos to return to its allegiance. Accordingly he crossed over to Sestus, and there established a garrison to command the whole of the Hellespont. Soon after this, he was summoned to reinforce the Athenians at Samos, who were unable, before his arrival, to make headway against the superior force of the Peloponnesians under Astyochus. LysiasLysias c. Agor. pp. 130‚Äî133) regarded Strombichides as was one of the friends of democracy who expressed their indignation at the terms of the peace with which Theramenes and his fellow- ambassadors returned to Athens from Lacedaemon in 404 BC. Having thus made himself an enemy of the oligarchs, he was involved with the other prominent men of his party, in the accusation brought against them by Agoratus before the council, of a conspiracy to oppose the peace. They were all accordingly thrown into prison, and not long after were put to death following a mockery of a trial under the government of the Thirty. Strombichides is believed to have been the father of the Athenian statesman, Autocles. With Strombichides' father, Diotimus, being head of the fleet as Nauarch, himself being a Taxiarch, and his son, Autocles rising to lead the army as Strategos, this family from the southern Deme of Euonymeia was one of the most influential of Athenian politics and military hierarchy.

The California Supreme Court had ruled on February 17, 1972, that capital punishment was contrary to the state constitution. Proposition 17 amended the Constitution of California in order to overturn that decision. It was submitted to a referendum by means of the initiative process, and approved by voters on November 7 with 67.5% of the vote. Background People v. Anderson The court ruled in People v. Anderson that capital punishment was contrary to Article 1, Section 6 of the state constitution,This provision has since moved to Article 1, Section 17. which forbade \\"cruel or unusual punishment\\", and was held to be more strict than the similarly worded provision of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that says \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". Proposition 17 amended the state constitution by adding Article 1, Section 27, which reads: People v. Frierson In 1979, it was argued before the California Supreme Court (in People v. Frierson) that Proposition 17 was unconstitutional, as it amounted to a \\"revision\\" rather than an \\"amendment\\" of the state constitution, and a revision may not be enacted by an initiative. The court rejected this argument. Justice Stanley Mosk filed a concurring opinion in which he reluctantly agreed with the judgment of the court, but also expressed his dismay at the response of the electorate to Anderson: Aftermath Despite Proposition 17, no executions were carried out in California until 1992. This was due to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the same year in Furman v. Georgia (which temporarily halted capital punishment in the United States) and to extensive litigation that occurred thereafter.  See also  * Capital punishment in California * People v.

Sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and officially recognized in both 2009 and 2010 through Senate resolutions, The National Day of Journalism asks Americans to consider the role in writing in everyday life. Journalism Day is considered a fun holiday that appreciates and corresponds with journalists and writers all over. In correlation with the National Day on Writing, NCTE created the National Gallery of Writing so that writers of all kinds can share their work publicly. As of 2017, the holiday is now celebrated on October 20th. According to the NCTE website, the holiday exists to: :1. highlight the remarkable variety of writing we engage in today; :2. provide a collection for research on whether writing today has risen to new highs or sunk to new lows; and :3. help us help others to write better. Celebration and reception Campuses and communities around the nation celebrated the National Day on Writing with webcasts, writing marathons, exhibitions of local writing, and even a seven-word memoir challenge. National press coverage of the event celebrated local writers' contributions to the National Gallery of Writing. National Gallery of Writing NCTE describes the National Gallery of Writing as a \\"living archive\\" of contemporary American writing practices. The Gallery opened on October 20, 2009, in honor of the National Day on Writing, and continued to accept submissions until June 1, 2011. Visitors could view the Gallery until June 30, 2011. Viewers could browse the Gallery to learn about the many ways Americans incorporated writing in their daily lives. Submissions included short stories, scholarly research, poetry, blogs, multimedia compositions, and even informal writing such as recipes or text messages. This rich sample of writing proved useful for researchers who wished to better understand real-world contemporary writing practices. The NCTE website notes that nearly 18,000 compositions had been submitted thus far to the Gallery, although their goal is to have 100,000 contributions added by the Gallery's closing in June 2011.

It was built by miners from St. Andreasberg in the years 1715 to 1722 and, today, is an important component of the water supply network known as the Upper Harz Water Regale (Oberharzer Wasserregal). Moreover, for 170 years, from the time it was completed to the end of the 19th century, the Oderteich had the largest dam in Germany.Der Oderteich at www.harzlife.de. Accessed on 16 Nov 09. The dam lies at a height of by the B 242 federal highway, about a kilometre west of its intersection with the B 4\\\\. Purpose The Oderteich was built in order to be able to deliver a reliable supply of water to the water wheels of the St. Andreasberg mine via the Rehberg Ditch, even during times of drought. Its capacity of 1.7 million cubic metres was, far and away, the largest of all the Upper Harz reservoirs at that time and was enough to cope with periods of low precipitation of up to three months. Today the water of the Oderteich still drives several hydropower stations within its own valley, at the Samson Pit and in the Sperrlutter valley. The dam also serves to prevent the regular flooding that happened each year in spring before the dam was built. History In 1703 the new Rehberg Ditch was completed, diverting water from the river Oder'Oder' here refers to the smaller river Oder in the Harz, not the major central European river forming part of Germany's border with Poland. and bringing it to St. Andreasberg. This was initially a great improvement in the supply of water power for the mines there, but the Oder could still not deliver enough water during a period of extended drought. So the call for a water reservoir quickly became shrill. A glance at the Upper Harz 'ponds' (Teiche) near Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Hahnenklee suggested a solution. At that time there must have been 50 to 60 small reservoirs in operation. Their design, however, could not simply be copied, because there was nowhere in the vicinity of the Oderteich to cut grass sods like those used to seal the dams of the Upper Harz reservoirs. In the meantime, the Rehberg Ditch, which had initially only been made of wooden channels (Holzgefludern), was being 'walled'; in other words the wooden conduits were being replaced by a considerably more durable artificial ditch made of earth embankments and dry stone walls. In doing so it was realised that the sand resulting from the weathering of granite, so-called granitgrus, if it was thoroughly tramped down, produced a very good seal. The Oderteich in winter. Right: the control hut (Striegelhaus) on the dam In 1712, the deputy chief miner (Vizebergmeister), Caspar Dannenberger, wrote two letters to the Clausthal Mining Office, in which he proposed the construction of the Oderteich dam, sealed with granitic sand, as well as two embankments made of granite blocks.Dannenberger, Caspar. Letters to the Clausthal Mining Office (Bergamt Clausthal) dated 24 December 1712 and 27 February 1713, Nieders√§chsisches Bergarchiv Clausthal. This proposal was duly taken up, but Caspar Dannenberger, the father of the Oderteich dams, did not survive to see it completed. He died on 23 April 1713. Planning was carried out in 1714 and, on 14 September, King George Louis authorised the construction of the Oderteich dam in a most gracious special decree and made the available the sum estimated for the project: a total of 3048 thalers and 27 gl. The construction phase actually started in early 1715. Initially a core trench was excavated into which the dam was embedded. The building material for this was excavated from the land earmarked for the future reservoir. Granite blocks needed for the up- and downstream sides of the dam were cut from small quarries; this also provided a supply of granitic sand. The mining of material for the dam enabled the future reservoir capacity to be further enlarged. The work took until 1722. Because excess water could neither be drained through the relatively small bottom outlet during the construction period nor be impounded, a spillway had to be continuously available whilst the dam was being built. This spillway had to be laid higher and higher as the dam grew in size. Shortly after work on the dam had started there were discussions about raising it even higher than originally planned. In 1717 it was agreed to increase its height from the initial seven LachterA unit of length used in mining in Germany that equate to the distance of a man's outstretched arms, i.e. about 1.9‚Äì2.1 metres. to nine Lachter (roughly equating to just under 18 metres). This resulted in an increase in the dam volume of around 55 percent and a doubling of the reservoir capacity to 1.67 million cubic metres. The cost of construction rose considerably during the build phase, not just as a result of the increase in dam height, but also other factors: in the end the Oderteich dam cost around 11,700 Reichstalers, almost four times the originally estimated and approved cost. Because the structure was so convincing, however, subsequent requests and approvals for the additional extra funding were not a problem. The three chief miners (Bergmeister) and excavation engineers (Grabensteiger) were rewarded in 1724 with bonuses ranging from 12 to 100 Talers. The Sankt Andreasberg mine ground to a standstill in 1913. From then on the water of the Oderteich was used to generate electricity instead. It was now routed to Sankt Andreasberg itself, where it was used in several power stations and especially the Samson Pit. The water is still used for this purpose today and guarantees the economic operation and maintenance of the Oderteich and Rehberg Ditch. In the late 1920s the Harzwasserwerke planned a further significant increase in the height of the Oderteich Dam. The dam and the geology of the surrounding area were thoroughly examined. Digging exposed the seal of granitgrus and it was confirmed that this could not easily be worked with clay picks.Wasserrechtsantrag (Water rights application) by the Forstamt St. Andreasberg, 15 January 1965, unpublished. These plans were later shelved for reasons that are not clear, although it is likely that the project was not seen as economical. Design Southwest side, including the little control hut Interior of the control hut The dam on the Oderteich differs considerably from the other dams in the Upper Harz Water Regale. The structure is clearly higher and the reservoir capacity just under three times the volume of the largest ponds around Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Hahnenklee. In addition completely different construction materials were employed. Dam structure In the middle of the dam is a core, up to 11.5 metres thick, made of firmly tamped down, granitic sand. Left and right of that apparently 'normal' dam fill material was used. The up- and downstream sides were given cyclopean stonework walls made of large blocks of granite with a slope of 1:0.5. On the downstream side the dam measures about 19 m from its base. The dam wall has proved to be a very durable structure and, like the entire reservoir, is still virtually in its original condition. Fundamentally it is not quite clear whether the Oderteich dam structure is an earth-fill dam or a masonry dam. It is probably a combination of the two. Outlet The tendency for the Oderteich to use particularly long-lasting materials is best demonstrated in the design of the bottom outlet. At the lowest point in the valley, a shaft was let into the dam, that had a cross-section of about 1.10 √ó 1.20 m. This shaft is edged with large, hewn granite blocks and descends to the natural floor of the valley. From the bottom of the shaft runs a tunnel, 0.75 metres wide and 0.90 metres high into the reservoir. This tunnel enables the water in the reservoir to equalise with the water level in the shaft. From the bottom of the shaft, two wooden chutes (Holzgerenne) lead to the downstream side of the dam base. These chutes, made of oak, have a right-angled cross-section of about 25 √ó 25 cm and feature a valve on the bottom of the shaft that operates in a similar way to the type of bathplug that is closed from below. This valve can be pushed up or pulled shut using a rod operated from the control hut or Striegelhaus positioned above the shaft. The oak chute is designed in such a way that, even when the valve is shut, it remains submerged in water and so does not rot. This explains why the oak chutes fitted in 1715 are still being used. The entire bottom outlet design is known in the Upper Harz as a Striegel. Spillway The chute of the Gro√üer Ausflut The lower section of the Gro√üer Ausflut Granite posts in front of the outlet. Behind: the upstream side of the cyclopean stone wall at low water Every reservoir needs a spillway which ensures that even under conditions of exceptionally high water, the water does not rise to an uncontrollably high level, possibly even pouring over the dam crest. On the Oderteich the spillway is located at the left hand (eastern) end of the dam. In the reservoir in front of the outlet are several stone columns, like standing stones in appearance, about 2.50 metres high and made of granite. They serve to keep ice floes away from the spillway, because these could jam the channel. The old outlet is clearly identifiable by a weir, which was built in 1895 by the Royal Central Smithy in Clausthal K√∂niglichen Centralschmiede Clausthal.Plate on the weir which disappeared in the 1980s. This weir enables the maximum storage level to be raised by a metre or so. Originally the spillway ran for almost a 100 metres in a straight line southwards before the water dropped into the valley. This course is still visible in the terrain to the experienced eye. But when towards the end of the construction phase in there were still not enough stones to complete the dam wall, a steep, 80-metre-long Gro√üe Ausflut (\\"large spillway\\") was blasted out of the rock roughly 60 metres below the weir at right angles to the original spillway. Perhaps it was hoped that this would increase the hydraulic capacity of the outlet. The channel carved out of the rock is very impressive especially on the spillway. To begin with the spillway was not large enough: in December 1760 water overspilled the dam during a period of exceptional high water. Damage was limited, which said something, especially about the stable design of the dam. In response to this incident the dam was raised by about a metre, which has probably merely compensated for the subsidence of the dam since that time. In 1886/87, however it appears that the conclusion was reached that the capacity of the spillway needed to be increased. To achieve this another spillway was built a few metres east of the existing one. It had an inlet breadth of 12 metres and its crest was about a metre higher than that of the old, main spillway. This outlet crosses under the B 242 parallel to the main one and merges with the main spillway shortly before the high-water marker and its adjoining chute (Schussrinne). This additional spillway enables the discharge capacity during times of flood to be increased by about 50%. Coffer dam in the reservoir When the Oderteich is fully emptied the remains of coffer dam can be seen about 200 metres above the main dam. This was built in 1898 when the Oderteich Reservoir was empty in order to reduce the water flow whilst repairs were carried out to the bottom outlet. The coffer dam must have been demolished immediately after this repair had been completed. Operation  Capacity  As a result of the use of water for electricity generation the Rehberg Ditch drew 200 to 300 litres of water per second continuously from the Oderteich. When the inflow of water is less than its outflow, the water level in the reservoir drops. If there are several months of drought in succession, the reservoir can become empty. This happens about every five to ten years, the last occasions being in 1991, 1999 and 2003. The surcharge capacity of the Oderteich is very small. Its reservoir can only store 14% of its annual discharge. This results in unusually high fluctuations in the water level of the reservoir, which can even change from being largely empty to overflowing within a few hours. This explains why the Oderteich overflows several times a year. Water quality There is no fishway at the Oderteich. The relatively acidic condition of the water is probably not a good habitat for fish. Most of the water comes from areas of raised bog and is rich in humic acid. Humic acid also causes its brown coloration. In addition, it reduces surface tension, something which causes conspicuous white horses such as occur in the turbulence at the intakes and outlets of the reservoir. Largest dam in Germany The Oderteich is frequently reported as the \\"oldest dam and reservoir in Germany\\".Oderteich at www.oberharz.de. Retrieved on 16 Nov 09. This accolade is disputed, however, because in the early 18th century in the area of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Buntenbock and Hahnenklee there was already a large number of 'reservoirs' (Talsperren) as defined by the German industrial norm, DIN 19700-11. What is true is that from its completion in 1722 to the end of the 19th century, a period of 170 years, it had the largest dam in Germany. Not until the Eschbach Dam in the Bergisches Land was finished in 1891 with a height of 23 m was there a higher dam than the Oderteich. Recreation  Waterside footpath  Start of the Rehberg Ditch from the bottom outlet of the Oderteich. In the background is the downstream side of the dam In the middle of the 1990s, the operators of the Oderteich, the Harzwasserwerke, laid out a waterside footpath (the WasserWanderWeg) as an educational trail. This runs along the dam crest to the two spillways, past the two additional basins and via the overspill marker then downhill alongside the Gro√üer Ausflut and its chute to the downstream foot of the dam, from where there is an impressive view of the stonework on this side of the dam and where the bottom outlet and start of the Rehberg Ditch can be seen. Information boards along the path explain the various structures. Other recreational uses The Oderteich lies in the centre of the Harz National Park. Swimming is allowed in the southern third of the reservoir and in the vicinity of the dam. The northern area is barred to swimmers in the summer by a chain and is meant to be exclusively reserved as a biotope. There is a roughly 4.5 km long circular walk around the reservoir, for which good walking boots are recommended. This path is routed along board walks in places because of the terrain which resembles that of a raised bog. Winter sports, such as skating, on the reservoir in winter are not recommended, because the large variations in the water level make the formation of a stable ice surface difficult, especially near the shores. Dam keeper's building Until the 1960s there was a dam keeper's house at the western end of the dam, which was used latterly as a restaurant. It was demolished when it was deemed unnecessary to have a dam keeper permanently presence on the site. The foundations of the old building can be made out behind the present day National Park bus shelter. In addition there is the former MTV Goslar ski lodge, built at the end of the 1940s and now partly hidden and which can also be booked today as accommodation for self-catering groups.

The movement had its genesis during the revolutions of 1848. Allied with the Silesian People's Party, it dissolved in 1924 but has influenced the present-day Silesian Autonomy Movement. Co-founder Ewald Latacz, around 1930 Origins The movement was founded by the Upper Silesian Committee (; ) on November 27, 1918 in Rybnik, Poland by three Catholics: attorney and Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski Workers Council chairman Ewald Latacz; Thomas Reginek, a priest from Mikulczyce (present-day Zabrze), and educator and Racib√≥rz Workers' and Soldiers' Council chairman Jan Reginek. The Rybnik Upper Silesian Committee demanded an \\"independent political stance\\" from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany and guaranteed neutrality similar to that in Switzerland and Belgium. The committee had little structure, and no political programme.Andrea Schmidt-R√∂sler, \\"Autonomie und Separatismusbestrebungen in Oberschlesien 1918-1922\\" in Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung Heft 1 (1999). On December 5, 1918 a German-language brochure, \\"Oberschlesien ‚Äì ein Selbst√§ndiger Freistaat\\" (\\"Upper Silesia ‚Äì independent/autonomous free state\\", probably written by Thomas Reginek) was published by the Committee for the Creation of the Upper Silesian Free State in Katowice (). The brochure was an Upper Silesian Committee appeal to Silesians to take the lead in political, economic and social questions and create an independent state similar to Switzerland, where all linguistic groups would have equal rights. Its author predicted that the incorporation of Upper Silesia into Poland would be an economic catastrophe for the region; Upper Silesia would be \\"a source of income and taxes\\" for the Polish state, and Silesians would be treated as \\"second-category citizens\\" by Polish officials.Piotr Dobrowolski, Ugrupowania i kierunki separatystyczne na G√≥rnym ≈ölƒÖsku i w Cieszy≈Ñskiem w latach 1918-1939, Warszawa i Krak√≥w (1972).  Kƒôdzierzyn conference  A conference of Upper Silesian political parties was organized by German Catholic Centre Party leader Carl Ulitzka and held on 9 December 1918 in Kƒôdzierzyn. Representatives of the Upper Silesian communists (KPOS), the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and Wojciech Korfanty's Polish party did not attend. At the conference, Upper Silesian Committee chairman Ewald Latacz spoke about the creation of an independent, neutral Upper Silesian republic. The attendees formed the Silesian Commission, with the Centre Party's Hans Lukaschek its chairman. The commission implemented the Upper Silesian Committee, with a mandate \\"to direct and expand the separatist vision in Upper Silesia\\".Guido Hitze, Carl Ulitzka (1873-1953), Oder Oberschlesien zwischen den Weltkriegen. D√ºsseldorf (2002).  Negotiations with neighbours  In December, leaders of the Upper Silesian Committee (G√≥rno≈õlƒÖskiego) travelled to Czechoslovakia, Poland and Germany to sound out the countries' positions on Upper Silesian independence. Only in Prague did officials inform Upper Silesian Committee representatives Ewald Latacz, Thomas Reginek, Jan Reginek and Fritz Wenske that the Western allies would consider the creation of an independent Upper Silesian state. Jan Reginek, representative of the Upper Silesian councils, requested recognition for the new status in Berlin. However, only two politicians (Hugo Haase and Helmuth von Gerlach) favoured independence for Upper Silesia. Thomas Reginek went to Pozna≈Ñ, the seat of the Polish People's Council, where he failed to persuade Kazimierz Czapla (the Upper Silesian representative in Poland) to support Upper Silesian independence. Another unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Germans was made by Thomas Reginek, Ewald Latacz and a representative of Upper Silesian industrialists.Edmund Klein, Miarodajne czynniki niemieckie a sprawa G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska w grudniu 1918 roku, \\"Studia ≈ölƒÖskie\\" tom XIII, Opole, 1968.Andrea Schmidt-R√∂sler, Autonomie und Separatismusbestrebungen in Oberschlesien 1918-1922, \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa\\" Forschung 1999, Heft 1. On 19‚Äì20 December 1918 the Upper Silesian Committee published a bilingual brochure, \\"Appeal for the Creation of an Upper Silesian Free State\\", as a supplement in two popular Catholic Centre Party newspapers. There were 294 editions of Oberschlesischer Kurier published in Chorz√≥w and 293 editions of Oberschlesische Zeitung published in Bytom, edited by brothers.Edmund Klein, Niemieckie plany separatystyczne w listopadzie i grudniu 1918, \\"Prawo XXXIV\\", Wroc≈Çaw, 1971. On 19 December 1920 the Poles broke up a meeting in Rubnik which had been organised by Ewald Latacz with the agenda, \\"Upper Silesia for Upper Silesians\\". Organisers of the meeting were beaten, and the Poles described it as \\"propaganda\\".Gazeta Opolska, nr. 5 z 8.01.1919.Alojzy Targ, Opolszczyzna pod rzƒÖdami Lukaschka i Wagnera, Katowice, 1958.J.

Activity The political belief that Silesians should be a separate nation was not new in Prussian Upper Silesia; it dated back to the revolutions of 1848. In April 1849 painter and poet Jan Gajda published an appeal \\"to the Upper Silesian people\\" in the Polish-language newspaper Dziennik G√≥rno≈õlƒÖski (Upper Silesian Journal) that the time had come when Silesians would count \\"to enlightened nations\\", supporting the creation of a Silesian League \\"to support Silesian nationality\\". At meetings organised by J√≥zef Szafranek were chants of \\"Long live Silesian nationality\\", and calls were made to unite Prussian Upper Silesia and Austrian Silesia. These aspirations were also held by the Silesian People's Party in Cieszyn Silesia in 1909.Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, Historia Narodu ≈ölƒÖskiego (History of the Silesian Nation), second edition (implemented and corrected), Zabrze, 2006. According to a 31 December 1918 decree by the president of the Regency of Opole, supporters of an independent Upper Silesian republic were guilty of high treason; Section 96 of the act forbade public meetings about Upper Silesian independence. German authorities suspended the activity of the Union of Upper Silesians, arresting its leaders. Latacz and Jan Reginek became political prisoners, and Joseph Musiol was granted immunity by the Prussian parliament. Thomas Reginek escaped to Paris via Berlin and Pozna≈Ñ with a Polish passport; there, the leader of the Polish National Party informed him that France supported Polish opposition to Upper Silesian independence. Latacz, thanks to his broad connections to German politicians in Upper Silesia, was released on probation in spring 1919 and forbidden any \\"verbal and written\\" support of Upper Silesian independence. Against this prohibition, the leader of the Upper Silesians, published the anonime edited German-language brochure Oberschlesien auf Subhasta!, in which it premised the shrinking German majority at the time a plebiscite and showed the need for the creation of an independent Upper Silesian state with the argument that Upper Silesian nation is homogeneous people about mixed blood.[Ewald Latacz], G√≥rny ≈ölƒÖsk dosta≈Ç siƒô na subhastƒô, Bytom G.≈ö. 1920 In spring 1919, after negotiations in Paris, London and Rome, Upper Silesian Catholic People's Party (Katholische Volkspartei) chairman Carl Ulitzka rejected Upper Silesian independence as a \\"utopia impossible to realise\\". Ulitzka began a campaign to incorporate Prussian Upper Silesia into Germany, demanding its exclusion from Prussia and its establishment as a free state of Germany (such as Bavaria). He was supported by four members of the Catholic People's Party and opposed by Joseph Musiol and Heinrich Skowronek.Guido Hitze, Carl Ulitzka (1873-1953), Oder Oberschlesien zwischen den Weltkriegen, D√ºsseldorf (2002).  Western allies  In the final conditions of the Paris Peace Conference for the German delegation on 16 June 1919, the Western allies assigned southern Racib√≥rz county to Czechoslovakia. In summer 1919, the Union of Upper Silesians sent a petition to the Paris Peace Conference criticising the treaty for its limitations on Upper Silesian plebiscite options to Poland and Germany. In the name of \\"many hundred thousands of Upper Silesians\\", the union demanded to change article 88 of the treaty so an Upper Silesian plebiscite would have the \\"option of [a] neutral free state\\". According to the petition, \\"Upper Silesian nation, in majority with oneself, indivisibility and independence of Upper Silesia\\".Andrea Schmidt-R√∂sler, Autonomie und Separatismusbestrebungen in Oberschlesien 1918-1922, \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa\\" Forschung 1999, Heft 1. In late 1919 the United States, influenced by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, organised the creation of a \\"coal and steel state\\" under international protection which included the Upper Silesian Industrial Circle (Oberschlesische Industriebezirk) and the Ostrava-Karvin√° basin in the former Austrian Silesia.Jan Przew≈Çocki, Czechos≈Çowacja wobec problemu G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska w latach 1919-1921, \\"Zaranie ≈ölƒÖskie\\", stycze≈Ñ‚Äìmarzec 1968. Because of French opposition, the United States withdrew from supporting a Silesian state. In fall 1919 the Reginek brothers accepted autonomy for Silesian lands which would be included into Poland, left the Union of Upper Silesians and joined the Polish Plebiscite Commission. At the time the chairman of the Union of Upper Silesians was Ewald Latacz, assisted by Joseph Musiol.  Silesian People's Party  J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ in 1923 In the winter of 1920 Latacz went to Cieszyn to attend a meeting of the Silesian People's Party and delegates from German parties to create an independent Silesian state, or autonomy in Czechoslovakia. Because of the Slavic-Germanic Silesian people and a similar industrial structure in Cieszyn Silesia, its demands to unite with Prussian Upper Silesia encouraged Latacz to hope for an economically-strong, united Silesian state similar to Belgium.Rudolf Vogel, Deutsche Presse und Propaganda des Abstimmungkampfes in Oberschlesien, Beuthen O.S. 1931. At the meeting, Silesian People's Party chairman J√≥zef Ko≈ºdo≈Ñ advised the chairman of the Union of Upper Silesians. On 17 March 1920 editor Georg Cibis in Bytom began publishing the bilingual ≈ölƒÖzak (Silesian), the Silesian People's Party newspaper. Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek was sympathetic to the Silesian People's Party. The article \\"Free Upper Silesian state, the midpoint of all world policy\\" said, \\"The Upper Silesian people in large majority demand independence and indivisibility of their own country and connection with brothers in Austrian Silesia separated from it over 150 years ago ... The Upper Silesian people are strongly connected for hundreds of years by culture, employment and Slavic-Germanic blood ... almost three million souls, of whom 600,000 are in Austria\\".Maksymilian Harden, \\"Wolne pa≈Ñstwo g√≥rno≈õlƒÖskie punktem ≈õrodkowym polityki wszech≈õwiatowej\\", Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek, no. 20, 1.08.1920.  Freedom fighters  On 18 August 1920, 68 member of the Union of Upper Silesians (ZwiƒÖzku G√≥rno≈õlƒÖzak√≥w-Bund der Oberschlesier) met at its headquarters in Bytom. In attendance were chairman Joseph Musiol from Bytom, secretary Hugo Kotulla from Tarnowskie G√≥ry and two aldermen, one from Bytom and one from Mikulczyce. On 17 November 1920, 300 representatives of 175 local groups of the Union of Upper Silesia (representing about 300,000 members) met in Bytom.G√ºnther Doose, Die separatistische Bewegung in Oberschlesien nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg (1918-1922), Wiesbaden (1987). The conference was led by Latacz, from Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski; Joseph Musiol from Bytom; Wiktor Durynek from Tarnowskie G√≥ry, and Hubert Kraft (Count Strachwitz) from LƒÖdek Zdr√≥j. The Upper Silesian national symbol and the national emblem of the Upper Silesian Republic was agreed as the coat of arms of the Upper Silesian line of the Piast dynasty: a golden eagle on a blue shield. This became part of the headlines of the weekly bilingual newspaper Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek, with a circulation of 20,000 copies in 1920, 40,000 copies in winter 1921 and several hundred thousand copies in 1921. The union was the most influential Silesian organisation of its time; in February 1921, it had 198 local chapters with 400,000 members. In the fall of 1920 editor Georg Cibis moved from the Union of Upper Silesians to the German Plebiscite Commission, succeeded at Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek by Wiktor Durynek.  After the plebiscite  In the 20 March 1921 plebiscite, Germany won with 59.6 percent of the vote. Ewald Latacz published an appeal: \\"Upper Silesians!! Upper Silesia stay undivided! ... Who wants to chop our country to pieces to inherit something from us. But we want to live; we Polish- and German-speaking Upper Silesians want to live together in peace and lead our country to prosperity. This is possible only when Upper Silesia is undivided. We demand a plebiscite on whether Upper Silesia will be divided or not ... Korfanty says that he will defend it to his last drop of blood. Upper Silesians, we warn you. You don't change your homeland in a desert. If there is bloodshed, it will not be Upper Silesian blood and not in Upper Silesia. Upper Silesians don't resort to terrorist acts; terrorism must be nipped in the bud. Upper Silesians, remember that we are a homogeneous, fraternal nation. Let's shake hands with ourselves, let's live in a peaceful, free and undivided Upper Silesia ... and celebrate our resurrection as free citizens in the Upper Silesian State\\".Ewald Latacz, \\"G√≥rno≈õlƒÖzacy!! G√≥rny ≈ölƒÖsk zostaje niepodzielny\\", Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek, nr. 13, 27.03.1921; Latacz, \\"Dla niepodzielnego G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska\\", Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek, nr. 14, 3.04.1921. On 2 May 1921 the third Polish uprising, a bloody civil war, erupted. Leaders of the uprising demanded the \\"proclamation of a sovereign Silesian state\\" from Wojciech Korfanty,Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, Historia Narodu ≈ölƒÖskiego, wyd. II (uzupe≈Çnione i poprawione), Zabrze, 2006 which he rejected. Upper Silesia was divided, which was advantageous for Poland. In the weekly Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek appeared in bold type, \\"Every Upper Silesian is an open or secret member of the Union of Upper Silesians\\". According to the union, in fall 1921 it numbered about 500,000 members.Andrea Schmidt-R√∂sler, Autonomie und Separatismusbestrebungen in Oberschlesien 1918-1922, \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa\\" Forschung 1999, Heft 1. In April 1921 Joseph Musiol, Heinrich Skowronek and Wiktor Durynek demanded independence for Upper Silesia, and Adam Napieralski negotiated on behalf of Poland. Ewald Latacz met with German Interior Minister Georg Gradnauer and Chancellor Joseph Wirth on 4 September 1921.Stefan Pioskowik, Ewald Latacz (1885-1953). Ein Politiker in der Abstimmungzeit, Confinium ‚Äì materia≈Çy do historii G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska, 2/2007.  End of activity  In November 1921, Wiktor Durynek resigned as editor of Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek and retired from political activity. He was succeeded by Joseph Musiol and architect Bruno Petzel, a former member of the Polish People's Council. On 4 December 1921 Ewald Latacz resigned from the Union of Upper Silesians and retired from politics at the organisation's meeting in Chorz√≥w, and was succeeded by Musiol. Upper Silesian industrialists withdrew their support; in March 1922 the weekly Der Bund ‚Äì ZwiƒÖzek began to be published irregularly; two months later it ceased publication, with a final circulation of 40,000 copies.Andrea Schmidt-R√∂sler, \\"Autonomie und Separatismusbestrebungen in Oberschlesien 1918-1922\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa Forschung 1999, Heft 1. The following November, Heinrich Skowronek stood for election to the regional assembly of Upper Silesian Province (Provinziallandtag). Instead of the Union of Upper Silesians, his election list was named for the Upper Silesian Catholic People's Party (, ). A Catholic Silesian party, opposing Catholic German and Polish parties, was doomed to failure without support and Joseph Musiol did not stand for election. With little support for Skowronek's list, his candidates returned to the Catholic People's Party ( and the German Centre Party.Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, ≈ölƒÖski ruch narodowy, Zabrze (2006). After the election Adam Napieralski, editor of Polish-language newspaper Katolik (The Catholic), established a law office to defend Polish-speaking Upper Silesians in German Upper Silesia. The office was managed by Joseph Musiol, chairman of the Union of Upper Silesians and former deputy of the Prussian parliament (who had just lost his seat). He represented the Catholic People's Party, after being expelled from the German Centre Party in April 1921 for his independence activities. Musiol sent questionnaires about discrimination against Polish-speaking Upper Silesians on behalf of the Union of Upper Silesians and was its chairman until 1924, when it dissolved. After the Union of Upper Silesians, the idea of Upper Silesian independence remained; in 1925 the chief of police in Gliwice told Alfons Proske, president of the province of Upper Silesia, \\"The idea of a free state is still alive in German Upper Silesia\\". In areas bordering Poland, former members of the Union of Upper Silesians returned to political parties‚Äîprimarily the Catholic People's Party (), which said that it represented Germans and \\"German-disposed Silesians\\" in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship with the slogan \\"Upper Silesia for Upper Silesians\\". The Union of Upper Silesian Defence was founded in 1925 by former Polish activists, with Jan Kustos its chairman.Dariusz Jerczy≈Ñski, ≈ölƒÖski ruch narodowy, Zabrze (2006).

Biography  Kupka's childhood was spent in Marklowitz (Marklowice), where he and his family (brothers Paul, Johann and Joseph and sister Paula) were active in the Polish-Catholic Association. He married his wife, Apolonia in Lipiny and lived with her in Beuthen. An official at a coal mine, he was put forward by Wojciech Korfanty to take over the management of the Organization Division of the Polish Plebiscite Commission in Beuthen. When Kupka became aware of its secret activities, Korfanty demanded that he change the direction and methods of plebiscite agitation. Afraid of a break, Korfanty expelled Kupka from the Commission. Along with Kupka left other Silesian officials such as Cysarz, Zmuda, Gemander, Szymura, Pietruszka. This diminished Korfanty's support. In September 1920 Theofil Kupka founded the Upper Silesian Plebiscite Committee (Das Oberschlesische Plebiszit-Komitee) in Beuthen. Initially this committee aimed for \\"free-state autonomy\\" (independence) of Upper Silesia and opposed the \\"corruption\\" of the Polish Plebiscite Commission. Soon Theofil Kupka recognized that independence for Upper Silesia was unrealistic and therefore broke his cooperation with the Union of Upper Silesians and made contact with Kurt Urbanek, the German plebiscite commissioner. Afterwards, in November 1920, Kupka edited the first edition of the bilingual weekly Wola Ludu ‚Äì Der Wille des Volkes (The Will of the People). On November 20, 1920 at about five o‚Äôclock in the evening, two members of the Boj√≥wka Polska (Polish Paramilitary Unit) named Myrcik and Jendrzej came to Kupka‚Äôs house under the pretext of seeking jobs in the mine where he worked as an official. Once inside, they killed him with eight revolver shots to the head and chest in front of Kupka‚Äôs pregnant wife and five children.

It was initially located in the then City of Saint-Leonard and then later in the City of Montreal. Its sports teams competed as the Vikings. The team colours were black and grey. History The school was opened by the Commission scolaire J√©r√¥me Le Royer for the 1972-73 school year in a rented building at the corner of Aim√©-Renaud Street and Metropolitan Boulevard. The students attending were there for secondary II and III (Grades 8 and 9) although there were some secondary I (Grade 7) students some years. The school was a feeder school for Laurier Macdonald High School, a senior high school. The building had been previously used as a French high school by the same school board since 1967. It was called √âcole Aim√©-Renaud. It was supposed to have changed from a French high school into an English high school for the 1968-9 school year. Parents and students of the school organised an occupation of the school for 10 days. Several prominent separatist groups participated. Eventually, the school board gave in, and the school remained a French school.Mathieu No√´l, Language Conflict in Quebec http://www.mccord- museum.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&elementid;=103__true&tableid;=11&tablename;=theme&contentlong;Marc W.

Since the school was located in what was supposed to be a temporary rented facility, conditions were less than ideal. The school board was trying to find a better solution. For the 1981-2 school year, the school moved to a vacant building that belonged to Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal (PSBGM), which had been built as Dunton High School, a Protestant high school. When Dunton was closed, the PSBGM leased the school building to the Montreal Catholic School Commission, which used it as Doran High School for several years. When Doran closed in 1980, the Commission scolaire J√©r√¥me Le Royer saw an opportunity to get some proper facilities and leased the building from the PSBGM. The school was technically in the City of Montreal, but since it was right on the border of the City of Anjou, many students and parents mistakingly though that the school was in Anjou. Even though the address is on de Boucherville Street, that of the street is actually the service road of Quebec Autouroute 25. The Dunton building was a great improvement for Aime Renaud, as it had been built as a proper high school facility, with an auditorium, a real gymnasium, science labs, a music room, a library and a football field. It was close to Honor√© Beaugrand station on the Montreal metro and was across the expressway from a shopping centre, Place Versailles. The Commission scolaire J√©r√¥me Le Royer opened another junior high school in Saint-Leonard, John-Paul I High School in September 1979. It ran both schools as junior high schools and eventually closed Aime Renaud High School in 1998, when the student population had declined.

It describes one family member in a dysfunctional family who expresses the family's authentic inner conflicts. Usually, the \\"designated patient\\" expresses their physical symptoms unconsciously, unaware they are making overt dysfunctional family dynamics that have been covert and which no one can talk about at home. Occasionally, the identified patient is partly conscious of why and how they have become the focus of concern in the family system. As a family systems dynamic, the overt symptoms of identified patient draw attention away from the \\"elephants in the living room no one can talk about\\" which need to be discussed, such as a pending separation or divorce. If covert abuse occurs between family members, the overt symptoms can draw attention away from the perpetrator(s). The identified patient is a kind of diversion and a kind of scapegoat. Often a child, this is \\"the split-off false carrier of a breakdown in the entire family system,\\" which may be a transgenerational disturbance or trauma.Peter L. Rudnytsky, Reading Psychoanalysis (2002) p. 44 In organizational management The term is also used in analyzing dysfunction in businesses where an individual becomes the carrier of a group problem. Origins and characteristics The term emerged from the work of the Bateson Project on family homeostasis, as a way of identifying a largely unconscious pattern of behavior whereby an excess of painful feelings in a family lead to one member being identified as the cause of all the difficulties ‚Äì a scapegoating of the IP.Robin Skynner/John Cleese, Families and how to survive them (London 1994) p. 103 The identified patient ‚Äì also called the \\"symptom-bearer\\" or \\"presenting problem\\" ‚Äì may display unexplainable emotional or physical symptoms, and is often the first person to seek help, perhaps at the request of the family.\\"Dysfunctional family\\", Encyclopedia of Psychology, April 6, 2001, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2699/is_0004/ai_2699000448/ However, while family members will typically express concern over the IP's problems, they may instinctively react to any improvement on the identified patient's part by attempting to reinstate the status quo.Cooper, p. 17 Virginia Satir the wellspring of family systems theory, who knew Bateson, viewed the identified patient as a way of both concealing and revealing a family's secret agendas.Sara E. Cooper, The Ties that Bind (2004) p. 17 Conjoint family therapy stressed accordingly the importance in group therapy of bringing not only the identified patient but the extended family in which their problems arose into the therapyEric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (Penguin 1976) p. 295 ‚Äì with the ultimate goal of relieving the IP of the broader family feelings he or she has been carrying.Skynner/Cleese, Families p. 104 In such circumstances, not only the IP but their siblings as well may end up feeling the benefits.Berne, p. 295 R. D. Laing saw the IP as a function of the family nexus: \\"the person who gets diagnosed is part of a wider network of extremely disturbed and disturbing patterns of communication.\\"R. D. Laing, The Politics of Experience (Penguin 1984) p. 94 Later formulations suggest that the patient may be an \\"emissary\\" of sorts from the family to the wider world, in an implicit familial call for help,S.

For example, the child may exhibit some irrational problem requiring the constant care and attention of the parents. * In Dibs, an account of a child therapy, Virginia Axline considered that perhaps the parents, \\"quite unconsciously...chose to see Dibs as a mental defective rather than as an intensified personification of their own emotional and social inadequacy\\".Virginia Axline, Dibs In Search of Self (Penguin 1975) page 80 * Gregory Bateson considered sometimes \\"the identified patient sacrifices himself to maintain the sacred illusion that what the parent says makes sense\\", and that \\"the identified patient exhibits behavior which is almost a caricature of that loss of identity which is characteristic of all the family members\\".Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972) p. 237 and p. 243  Criticism  Extending the original concept of the identified patient, the anti-psychiatry movement went on to argue it is the family who is chiefly mad, rather than the individual the family identifies as 'sick'Jenny Diski, The Sixties (London 2009) p. 126 ‚Äì positing also that the latter might in fact be the least disturbed member of the family nexus.Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke, Mary Barnes Penguin 1974) p. 84 Literary and biographical * T.

It is characterized by long antennae, long. Distribution The species is found in Eastern and Gulf Coast of the United States. Ecology Girdled pecan twig Twig Girdler on pecan twig This beetle is widely known for the damage it causes to pecan plantations, but also to lumber trees such as hickory, oak, poplar and elm. In late summer and fall, the adult female girdles small branches, diameter, with its mandibles, cutting through the bark and into the wood. The resulting effect looks almost as if it were cut with a small saw. The female lays her eggs singularly in a separate cut into the wood, above the girdled section. Shortly after the twig is girdled and inserted with eggs, it will die and fall from the tree to the ground. The white, legless larva overwinters in the twig, then eats its way through woody tissue to the girdled point in the dead twig, and eventually closes itself in the twig with shredded wood fibers, then pupates over 12 to 14 days. The adult emerges and mates in the summer, feeding off tender woody shoots. This concludes the beetle's single yearly generation. Twig girdlers create a difficult infestation in plantations, as they occur late in the season close to nut harvesting. Collecting and burning dead twigs during the winter is key to fighting infestations. They can result in significant crop decreases in the following year, and can also result in the structural problems inherent to inexpert pruning.

The goal is to reduce emissions, energy use, and water use, while creating an atmosphere where students can be healthy and learn. Universities across the country are building to green standards set forth by the USGBC, United States Green Building Council. The USGBC is a non-profit organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed and built. This organization created the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, which is a certification process that provides verification that a building is environmentally sustainable. In the United States, commercial and residential buildings account for 70 percent of the electricity use and over 38 percent of emissions. Because of these huge statistics regarding resource usage and emissions, the room for more efficient building practices is dramatic. Since college campuses are where the world's future leaders are being taught, colleges are choosing to construct new buildings to green standards in order to promote environmental stewardship to their students. Colleges across the United States have taken leading roles in the construction of green building in order to reduce resource consumption, save money in the long run, and instill the importance on environmental sustainability on their students. It is a better way to motivate new generation to live a sustainable life. Benefits of Green Building on Campuses Green buildings on college campuses provide benefits to the campus in several different ways. Campuses can benefit from the short and long term economic benefits. Initially, federal and state governments will sometimes provide tax incentives for buildings constructed that surpass the standards set by the government. There are also long term savings. According to the USGBC, with an upfront investment of 2% in green building design, the resulting life savings is 20% of the total construction costs. With many universities lacking funding, this kind of savings could dramatically help the yearly budget. Along with this increase in monetary savings, green building and architecture has been proven to make the occupants more productive. Studies have shown a link between improved lighting design and a 27% reduction in the incidence of headaches. Also, students with the most daylighting in their classrooms progressed 20% faster on math tests and 26% faster on reading tests in one year than those with less daylighting. Both of these studies show that better lighting conditions, which are one of the main features of green buildings, can increase the productivity of its occupants. Students at colleges where green buildings are being used will benefit by increasing their potential to gain knowledge. The last important benefit of green buildings on college campuses is having the university seen as environmentally sustainable. Students are becoming increasingly aware of the issues the Earth faces with carbon emissions and increased consumption. These students want to attend universities that are striving to reduce their environmental impact. Universities participating in sustainable initiatives, like constructing green buildings, will attract more highly qualified students. Green buildings on campuses benefit both the school as well as the students. LEED Rating System Many institutions in the United States are administering the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System. The development of the LEED Rating System has been nationally recognized as the leading method to construct green buildings. The rating system incorporates the design, construction, and maintenance of the building. LEED promotes a cradle-to-cradle approach in regards to construction and design materials. The rating system is composed of six sections: Site Planning, Water Management, Energy Management, Material Use, Indoor Air Quality, and the Innovation & Design Process. Each section is composed of credits and points, which ultimately determine how \\"green\\" the building is constructed, designed, and maintained. LEED Certification Levels LEED has four different levels of certification. All depending on how many credits and points were obtained through the LEED Rating System. There are 100 possible base points plus an additional 6 points for Innovation in Design and 4 points for Regional Priority. Buildings can qualify for 4 types of certification: *Certified: 40-49 Points *Silver: 50-59 Points *Gold: 60-79 Points *Platinum: 80 points and above LEED - NC Application Guide for Multiple Buildings and On-Campus Building Projects (AGMBC) The USGBC has issued an application guide for administration of LEED Rating System on college, corporate, or government installations that include multiple buildings. This application is designed for projects where several buildings will be constructed at once, in phases, or a single building is constructed in a setting of existing buildings with common ownership. Note, however, that the AGMBC applies to LEED Rating System Versions 2.1 and 2.2. The methods described still apply to new construction on campuses. =Issues with AGMBC= The sustainable sites category is the most challenging category, and it is the most detailed section in the AGMBC. *Campus settings sometimes have established property lines through campus, but share a common infrastructure between areas. (Examples include street lighting may encroach on another building, storm water routes may go into same retention areas) *One overall sign for LEED certification, may not appeal to college trying to market LEED dedication. =Multi-Building Certification Methods= #Certifying a new building within a setting of existing buildings that are considered a campus, i.e. there is one owner or common property management and control. Use of a retention pond not on \\"site\\" but on campus, would still qualify for LEED credit. #Certifying a group of new buildings as a package where the entire building set will be rated as a package and only one rating received. These buildings may constitute the entire campus or be a subset of an existing campus. #Certifying new buildings where each new building is constructed to a set of standards but will receive an independent rating based on achievement of credits beyond the standards specific to that building. These buildings may constitute the entire campus or be subset of an existing campus. Required LEED Levels for Select Colleges These are 10 colleges all around the US determined to build for a sustainable future. Each college outlines their commitment in Campus Sustainability Initiatives and Mission statements. United States Green Building Council LEED Rating System *Brown University - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver\\" *California Polytechnic State University - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Certified.\\" *Georgia Institute of Technology - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Certified.\\" *Harvard University  Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver.\\" *Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver.\\" *Northwestern University - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Certified.\\" *Princeton University - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver.\\" *University of Florida  Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Gold.\\" *University of North Texas - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver.\\" *University of Oregon - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Certified.\\" *University of Vermont - Requires a minimum of all new construction be at least \\"Silver.\\" *University of Florida is only college committed to a minimum of LEED \\"Gold\\" Certification Campus Green Building Techniques The following methods are becoming more prevalent on campuses around the nation. Because of the large scale of college campuses, the impact of these methods are truly praise for energy savings and enhanced occupants' comfort. *Green roofs - Living, vegetative roofing alternatives; a solution to the heat island effect associated with buildings. *Low-VOC paints - Drastically limits any odorous, harmful, or irritating emissions and enhance the occupants' comfort. *Compact fluorescent bulbs - Uses less energy and give off less heat; will save energy used to cool the building. *Using recycled content *Buying and using local materials - Local materials have lower transportation costs because of the lower amount of energy needed to move materials. *Tree preservation and relocation *Low flow plumbing fixtures - Uses less water per flush. *Alternative transportation - Campuses utilize bike transportation, rapid bus transit, and safe pedestrian walkways. Zipcar is also becoming popular on many college campuses. Sustainable Materials used in Green Building The following are some examples of sustainable products used in green building. These materials are less harmful to the environment. Now-a-days many materials have a \\"green\\" substitute. Division 3: Concrete *PS 4000 Flat Wall Form: Improved tongue-and-groove design simplifies installation on the job and minimizes the problems associated with concrete spillage at the top of the wall. The unique design provides strength, fire resistance, and dimensional stability Provides you with a superior construction technology that delivers cost-effect, high-performance structures that are safer, quieter, comfortable, energy efficient, and more structurally secure and environmentally responsible building system available on the market today. *Fly Ash Because fly ash use displaces Portland cement use, it also reduces the need for cement production, which is a major energy user and a leading source of \\"greenhouse gas\\" emissions. Better performance without increase in cost. It can replace up to 30% by mass of Portland cement, and can add to the concrete's final strength and increase its chemical resistance and durability. Division 4: Masonry *Cavclear Masonry Mat A fluid-conducting, non-absorbent polymer mesh made from 100% recycled plastic that is installed full-height in the airspace. It prevents mortar from bridging the airspace and results in a continuous area for drainage and ventilation. Ensures water management. Reduces building's life-cycle costs. *Sealtech Block Certified \\"Green\\" with 10% recycled high-strength plastic powder. Non-porous surface means decreased permeability, making it water-resistant. Stronger than standard concrete block yet 10% lighter, translating into reduced shipping and labor costs. Division 5: Metals *Maze nails Made from recycled steel. The scrap steel generated while making nail heads goes right back to the steel mill for re-melting. Nails are galvanized with a dual Zinc coating for durability assurance. *Cold-formed metal framing Lightweight, and dimensionally stable. Contains 20-25% recycled material (10-15% post-consumer content, though some manufactures have in excess of 90% of recycled content.) Steel studs can even be recycled at end of building's life. Division 6: Woods, Plastics, and Composites This dining hall uses wood recycled from local barns. *Ecosurfaces Made from recycled tires. Slip-resistant. Weather resistant, able to withstand extreme temperatures *Reclaimed lumber If not reused, wood would be burned or chipped Old growth forests are protected Durable and aesthetically pleasing. The wood has become stabilized over time, which prevents changes due to humidity. *Engineered wood, Gluecam Provide a significant environmental advantage over solid wood by utilizing fast-growing, small diameter trees effectively. *Plastic lumber Makes use of recycled plastic and is an effective replacement for pressure-treated lumber, which also protects timber resources. Will not rot, absorb water, splinter, or crack Resistant to oil, salt, and chemicals Division 7: Thermal and Moisture Protection *Concrete roof tiles Made from an approximate mix of 3 parts sand to 1 part cement and 10% water. Limited maintenance is necessary. Concrete tiles are wind resistant. Can last up to 100 years. Division 8: Openings *Greenscreen PVC-free fabrics PVC-Free construction of polyurethane and specially designed, pre-stretched polyester core. 5 different levels of visibility: 3%, 5%, 10%, and 25%. Elimination of PVC content in production of GreenScreen fabrics mean shades contain no VOC's and does not \\"offgas\\" during the life of the product. PVC-content makes it easier and quicker to recycle GreenScreen fabrics and divert them from landfills. Division 9: Finishes *Marmoleum Flooring Raw materials and energy are used efficiently, waste is recycled wherever possible, and emissions are kept to an absolute minimum. Life-cycle analysis shows that these linoleum products are ecologically preferred floor covering. Linoleum is produced from renewable materials: linseed oil, wood flour, jute and ecologically responsible pigments. Organic product. *Cork floating floor Highly compressible and resilient. Excellent sound and thermal insulator. Lightweight and buoyant. Natural fire retardant, hypoallergenic, and insect resistant. *Australian Chestnut flooring LEED Qualification: MR 7-Certified Wood Product is certified according to the principles & criteria of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), adhering to strict environmental and social standards Easily meets E-1 Standard for Indoor Air Quality *Bamboo flooring Bamboo is not wood, but rather a type of grass. Quick renewable resource, can be harvested in as little as 5 years. Very strong and stable, more so than many hardwoods Less likely to swell or shrink Division 12: Furnishings *Climatex upholstery fabrics used for climate control seating Climatex is a mixture of three fibers to provide seating comfort. *Pure wool, which is excellent for heat conservation and great for moisture absorption. *Polyester, which allows for a fast humidity transport. *Ramie, which offers a cooling effect and great moisture transport.

International Campus Sustainability  Organizations  =International Sustainable Campus Network= Universities have a leadership role in advancing knowledge, technology and tools to create a sustainable future. To fulfill this role effectively and with high credibility, they need to include a focus on sustainability also in their own operations and facilities. Campus projects, be they educational or corporate campus developments, present interesting sustainability challenges and opportunities. Firstly, their size is at the borderline between single building projects and small towns, a fruitful scale for innovative energy and transport solutions. And secondly, they are to a certain degree one-purpose neighborhoods focused on education, research, development or distribution of new ideas, products or services. * Goal 1: sustainable construction, renovation, and operation * Goal 2. sustainable master planning and development, mobility, and community integration * Goal 3. linking facilities, research and education for sustainable development Partners: Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Australian National University, Berkeley University, City of Zurich, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Harvard University, HEEPI, Hosei University, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Los Angeles Community College District, National University of Singapore, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Stanford University, The Sustainability Forum, Tongji University, University of Applied Sciences of Trier-Birkenfeld, University of Copenhagen, University of Zurich ‚Äì CCRS, University of Gothenburg, University of Luxembourg and Yale University. =International Green Construction Code= The International Green Construction Code is a part of the International Code Council (ICC). As part of its commitment to green and sustainable safety concepts, the Code Council is excited to develop a new set of green codes under the multi-year initiative called \\"IGCC: Safe and Sustainable by the Book.\\" This initiative will include collaboration from the Council's closest allies and pre-eminent thought leaders in green building, as well as outreach and feedback from our members and the general public. The International Green Construction Code is committed to developing an effective and efficient code that will continue our long tradition of international code guidance.https://www.achrnews.com/articles/135565-uhealth-fitness-and- wellness-center =World Green Building Council= The World Green Building Council is an international organization that facilitates the green building councils of many developed and developing nations. The Council started in 1999 with its first meeting in California. Eight members attended the first meeting: U.S. Green Building Council, Green Building Council of Australia, Spain Green Building Council, United Kingdom Green Building Council, Japan Green Building Council, United Arab Emirates, Russia and Canada. THE WorldGBC incorporated in 2002 and operates from Toronto, Canada. There are currently over 15 established GBCs and 35 emerging and prospective countries with GBCs. Campus Green Building Case Studies  United States  =Stanford University: Knight Management Center= Stanford is a leading university in the green movement and the school is striving to achieve a LEED Platinum certification for their new graduate school of business, the Knight Management Center. The goal for this building is to open in the winter of 2011. The center will have eight buildings around three quadrangles with of interior space. According to the principal architect, Stan Boles of Boora Architects in Portland, Oregon, \\"The orientation of the buildings is narrow in the north- south dimension. They are designed for optimum daylighting, ventilation, and for shading of one another. The exterior walls are designed so that areas of glass are created but shaded by exterior screens to prevent excessive heat gain.\\" This project aims to: *Reduce overall water usage by at least 40%. *Exceed current energy efficiency standards by at least 40%. *Generate at least 12% electricity on site through solar energy. *Use rainwater or re- circulated gray water to reduce potable water use for building sewage conveyance by 80%. *Recycle or salvage 50% to 70% of non-hazardous construction debris. *Use low- or non-volatile organic compound-emitting materials to ensure exceptional indoor air quality. Stanford's president, John L. Hennessy, said, \\"One of the biggest global challenges facing us today is the sustainable use of our planets natural resources. The Graduate School of Business will play a key role in helping us address these challenges by leading the way in its sustainable development of this new campus.\\" Stanford University is taking an active role in constructing green buildings on their campus and the Knight Management Center will be a great example of how a building can be sustainable. =University of California at Santa Barbara: Donald Bren School of Environmental Science & Management= The Donald Bren School of Environmental Science & Management is located at the University of California, Santa Barbara, California. The academic laboratory and classroom facility demonstrates cost-effective, energy-efficient technologies and operations. The concrete and steel frame structure was complete in 2002 and cost approximately $27,500,000. Donald Bren Hall was the first laboratory to receive LEED Platinum accreditation, the highest rating achievable through the US Green Building Council's national rating system, with the following building design features: *Site Protection: Since Donald Bren Hall is located adjacent to the ocean, a strict site protection plan was developed and implemented to ensure all storm water is retained onsite to prevent contamination of local waterways. *Water Efficiency: A separate reclaimed water system was installed to furnish greywater to flush toilets and irrigate the landscape. Waterless urinals were also installed and it is estimated that each waterless urinal will save approximately 45,000 gallons of water per year. *Energy Efficiency: Design includes a 40 KW rooftop photovoltaic system, natural ventilation linked with a window interlock system for heating, daylighting controls, energy-efficient lighting, high efficiency boiler, and chiller integrated into a virtual chilled water loop. These energy efficiency measures assisted the building to exceed Title 24 (1998 Standards) by 31%. *Materials Efficiency: 93% of the construction waste generated onsite was diverted from the landfill. Recycled-content products include 12-20% flyash in the concrete, glass tiles and countertops, 100% postconsumer recycled content carpet, and tire-derived rubber flooring. Other environmentally preferable products for the interior surface materials included linoleum and natural cork flooring, bamboo cabinetry, and stained concrete flooring. According to Great Buildings, \\"The Donald Bren School at the University of California, Santa Barbara takes advantage of a beautiful setting near the Pacific Ocean to become a green building that embraces its environment not only for efficiency, but for experience. With a striking open courtyard, it provides ample opportunity for social interaction that makes the transition between indoors and outdoors much smoother and ephemeral than most buildings. Building Bren Hall with sustainable materials and methods is estimated to have added only 2% to the building cost, which will easily be offset over time by energy savings.\\" =University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: Botanical Gardens Education Center= The Education Center is located at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The building consists of three major sections connected by covered breezeways. The central wing welcomes visitors to the education center as they enter the garden through a large breezeway. The east wing offers classrooms for students enrolled in workshops and classrooms, and the west wing features the Reeves Auditorium. This large multipurpose space is used for lectures, conferences, and special events. The Education Center plans to achieve a LEED Platinum rating, most likely the first ever in North Carolina, with these features: *Site Selection and Design: The Education center was located with an efficient solar orientation. Also, during the construction process, there was minimal disturbance to grade, and existing vegetation was well protected. *Water Efficiency: The building uses water- efficient native landscaping and low-flow plumbing. Stormwater is conserved and re-used. Rainwater cisterns, gardens, and retention swales are also methods being used. *Energy Efficiency: Geothermal wells for efficient heating and air-conditioning are used. Photovoltaic and solar cells have been installed on the building, and natural lighting is used very effectively along with day sensors that automatically dim lights when daylight is too strong. *Materials Efficiency: To minimize transportation costs and carbon dioxide emissions, and to stimulate local economies, all materials were locally and sustainably produced. No wood came from old-growth trees; all the wood came from certified sustainable forests. At least 75% of the construction waste was recycled, and there was no non-toxic or off-gassing. The new Education Center expresses a sense of place and celebrates relationships between humans and nature through the integration of indoor and outdoor spaces. Open breezeways, comfortable porches, natural light in every room, beautiful native plant landscaping, and educational exhibits inform, delight, and invite visitors to the Conservation Garden. Most of all, the building is a center of learning, teaching both the science and the enjoyment of plants and nature. =University of Florida: James W. Heavener Football Complex= The University of Florida‚Äôs new football complex, the James W. Heavener Football Complex, was completed in 2008 and received LEED Platinum rating for the environmental sustainability of the building. The facility contractor was PPI Construction Management and the architect was RDG Planning and Design. The building includes offices, conference rooms, an atrium to display the football teams accomplishments, and a weight training facility. The LEED rated the complex 52 out of the 69 available points for the certification, which gave the building the Platinum rating. This facility is the first platinum athletic facility in the United States as well as the first platinum rated building in the state of Florida. The $28 million building exceeded the original goal of obtaining a LEED Silver rating. This building has many features that helped it to achieve the Platinum level. The features dealing with water usage reduce the buildings indoor water use by 40 percent. Due to all of the facility‚Äôs energy saving features the building has exceeded the state and national energy requirements by 35 percent. Another interesting fact about the construction of this building is that most of the material used in the construction came from within 500 miles of the University of Florida, which reduce the emissions created form transporting the material. Also 78 percent of the building debris was recycled. The assistant director of LEED at UF, Bahar Armaghani, said, \\"Green Buildings are not exclusively concerned with saving money through more efficient technology. They are also investments for the well-being of the people and environment.\\" The University of Florida has taken on an initiative to have all new construction be LEED Gold certified or higher and with the construction of this facility the school has surpassed their own requirements by achieving the Platinum rating. Key Features of the Heavener Football Complex: *Occupancy sensors to control lighting *Organic carpet *Paint and flooring made out of recycled materials *Low-flow water fixture and water saving shower heads *Dual-flush toilets *Low-e glazing, insulation, and reflective material on glass *Green roof on weight room *100% reclaimed water for irrigation =High Point University School of Education= High Point University, located in High Point, North Carolina, has a LEED-Certified building that houses the School of Education.

Montagna was born in Vicenza, the son of the leading painter of the city, Bartolomeo Montagna, with whom he trained and perhaps continued to work. His approximately 53 engravings seem to have been produced in the period from about 1500 until his father died in 1523 and he inherited the workshop; in these years he was \\"the most prolific engraver of his generation in northern Italy\\".Richardson He ran the workshop into at least the 1540s, but his paintings fell behind the development of Italian styles as they largely follow his father's style, less successfully. Many do not survive. His prints are generally found more significant by art historians.Sheehan, 307, 311; Zucker, 82 ( \\"pictures of no great merit\\"); Richardson (\\"As a painter, he is of merely local significance. His style is based on his father‚Äôs, with some admixture from contemporaries such as Moretto, Pordenone and Domenico Campagnola. He is more important, however, as an engraver\\"); BM He engraved primarily subjects from classical mythology, with a middle period with many religious subjects in about 1506‚Äì12.Hind, 68; Sheehan, 309, 318; Richardson Life St Paul the Hermit sees the death of St Anthony the Abbot, engraving He was given a power of attorney for his father in 1504, suggesting a birth date around 1480. His father was paid in 1517 for some painting Benedetto did in the Palazzo del Podest√†, Vicenza, seat of the chief magistrate;Richardson Vicenza had long been a territory of the Venetian Republic. Otherwise, his earliest documented works are frescos, which have not survived, for a chapel in Padua, painted in 1522. His father's wills of 1521 and 1523 reveal that he was not then married but had an illegitimate son. When his father died in 1523, Benedetto took over the workshop. He may already have ceased to make engravings by this point. His last documented painting is from 1541, Sheehan, 307 and he had certainly died by 4 April 1558.Benezit A statue of the Madonna and Child in the Louvre has been attributed to him.Sheehan, 307 The painter Giovanni Speranza, briefly mentioned by Vasari, was a collaborator, who was perhaps some years older. In 2004 there was an exhibition on the work of the two Montagnas, father and son, held in Palladio's Villa Caldogno near Vicenza.See further reading for the catalogue Prints His prints are mostly relatively small,Hind, 68 with the longest side rarely more than about 200 mm or 8 inches. The figures are often smaller relative to the overall size than in other contemporary Italian prints. Most of his prints are prominently signed with his full name, unlike the initials or monograms used by many printmakers of this period. Like Giulio Campagnola, the obtrusive signatures reveal \\"a remarkable willingness to intrude upon an image for the sake of self-promotion\\".Landau, 102 In all, 47 of his prints are signed or carry his initials.Richardson Many of his prints borrow elements from the work of his father, or other artists, mostly via their prints. Like other Italian printmakers in this period, his technique and especially his landscape backgrounds are heavily influenced by Albrecht D√ºrer. These influences are apparent throughout the development of his prints, whose rough chronological sequence is agreed, and some prints are direct copies of their works, or nearly so. As his style develops, influences from Giulio Campagnola, Girolamo Mocetto, and Marcantonio Raimondi appear. In turn, Montagna influenced Mocetto, Nicoletto da Modena and Giovanni Antonio da Brescia.Sheehan, 307‚Äì311; Zucker, 82‚Äì83; Richardson; Hind, 68; BM His prints include seven, from about 1515‚Äì20, that are close reworkings of some of the woodcut illustrations in an edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses in Italian published in Venice in 1497.Zucker, 83; Sheehan, 328‚Äì332 The Birth of Adonis (see gallery) is an eighth Ovidian print not using this source;Sheehan, 328 as in many prints with mythological subjects, the two women wear essentially contemporary dress (compare the figures in the print of Europa).

The school is a result of a merger of Bedford High School and Dame Alice Harpur School, and is operated by the Harpur Trust. The school became fully operational in September 2012. History The Harpur Trust had a long history of providing education for boys in Bedford, and in 1882 it opened two schools for girls, Bedford High School and Bedford Girls' Modern School (later renamed Dame Alice Harpur School), on the same site at Bromham Road, Bedford. While Bedford High School remained at the site, the Girls' Modern School moved to Bedford town centre by the end of the 19th century, and then in 1938 it relocated to Cardington Road, where new buildings were built on part of the playing fields the school already owned there.Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Volume 46 (1938), p. 137: \\"The old Bedford Girls' Modern School in the centre of the town became too cramped for its purpose, and it was necessary to move out and rebuild. The school already owned playing fields on the outskirts of the town, and it was decided to build...\\" In 1946 it changed its name to Dame Alice Harpur School, in honour of the wife of the founder of the Harpur Trust. In July 2009, the Harpur Trust announced its intention to merge Bedford High School and Dame Alice Harpur School, a decision arrived at because both schools had seen a fall in pupil numbers over the previous twenty years: In 1990 more than 2,000 girls had been on the rolls of the two schools, while in 2009 there were only 1,500. The trust estimated that once started, it would take three to five years to merge the schools. In November 2009, the trust released further details of the merger. It was announced that the new merged school would be called Bedford Girls' School and would be located on the current site of Dame Alice Harpur School. It would offer the International Baccalaureate as part of its curriculum, but would not offer boarding facilities for pupils. In December 2009, Jo MacKenzie was appointed as the first head of the Bedford Girls' School. Miss MacKenzie assumed her post over Easter 2010. The junior department of the school opened in September 2010, when the junior schools of Bedford High and Dame Alice Harper merged on the Cardington Road site. The senior department of the school opened in September 2011, with the full merger of the old schools, including the sixth form departments completed in September 2012. Sport Rowing The school has an active rowing club called the Bedford Girls' School Rowing Club which is based on the River Great Ouse at the Harpur Trust Boathouse in Bedford The club is affiliated to British Rowing.

Malcolm Greany Conservation photography is the active use of the photographic process and its products, within the parameters of photojournalism, to advocate for conservation outcomes. Conservation photography combines nature photography with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of documentary photography as an agent for protecting nature and improving the biosphere and natural environment. Conservation Photography furthers environmental conservation, wildlife conservation, habitat conservation or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action. History Carleton E. Watkins (1829‚Äì1916) of Mt. Broderick and Nevada Fall (700 ft.) at Yosemite Valley in 1861 Photo by Ansel Adams of Yosemite Half Dome, Apple Orchard, trees with snow on branches in April 1933 Photography has developed as a powerful medium to empower conservation. Photography has served this role since the 1860s, although not widely acknowledged as such. A notable example are the powerful images of Carleton Watkins which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of Yosemite National Park in 1864 and William Henry Jackson and Ansel Adams who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park. Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused environmental crisis, recognizing that the global pattern of ecosystem degradation was not sustainable. The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the International League of Conservation Photographers by photographer Cristina Mittermeier, during the 8th World Wilderness Congress in Anchorage, Alaska. Prior to 2005 \\"conservation photography\\" was not widely recognized as a discipline. Definition Photo of a vendor in Tanzania in 2000 selling to tourists threatened species seashells which have been taken alive from the sea, killing the animal inside. Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation. According to the acclaimed photographer, Joel Sartore, ‚Äúthe typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.‚Äù The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change. Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable: *The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort. *The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture. Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people‚Äôs hearts and minds. Applications Photo of Greenpeace protest against Esso /ExxonMobil in 2003 True-colour satellite image showing flooding in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani Provinces in Central Thailand (right), compared to before the flooding (left) in 2011 In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including internet activism and sometimes serve as Investigative journalism evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in protected areas, can be important as legal evidence against the activity. ;Specialty fields Several specialty fields benefit from their use of conservation photography, these include: * Conservation movement, to protect animals, fungi, plants and their habitats  Conservation biology, the science of the protection and management of biodiversity  Conservation genetics - \\"an interdisciplinary science that aims to apply genetic methods to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity.\\"  Conservation (ethic), an ethic of resource use, allocation, and protection, especially of the natural environment  Conservation organization typically an environmental organization  Conservationist, a person who advocates for conservation of animals, fungi, plants and their habitats  Energy conservation, the reduction of non-renewable energy consumption  Habitat conservation, a land management practice that seeks to conserve, protect and restore, habitat areas for wild animals, fungi and plants  Water conservation, reducing the use of water to protect the environment  Wetland conservation, protecting wetlands to conserve their ecological processes  Wildlife management, multidisciplinary practices, including conservation of species and their habitats  Conservation authority (Canada)  Marine conservation, the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas  Soil conservation, management strategies for prevention of soil being eroded from the earth‚Äôs surface or becoming chemically altered * Conservation-restoration, the profession devoted to the preservation of cultural resources  Art conservation, protecting works of art  Photograph conservation  Architectural conservation ;Subjects Some subjects of conservation photography include: Photo of Illegal logging in Thailand was taken from the roadside in Chiang Mai Province in 2011 *Destruction/construction activity inside a protected area. *Commercial activity in ecologically sensitive zones (ESZs) ‚Äì the areas immediately bordering national parks and reserves *Illegal logging or mining activity *Habitat fragmentation or destruction, ranging from individual tree felling to land clearing for a large hydroelectric project. *Forest fires. *Cattle / goats inside protected areas. *New roads inside or near a protected area.

Most commonly, it refers to only being released on a specific video game console or through a specific vendor's platforms‚Äîeither permanently, or for a definite period of time. Exclusivity is a topic used in discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of rival vendors in the video game market, and one which is used for marketing by vendors involved. Industry analysts generally agree that there is a correlation between availability of exclusive titles, and hardware sales. Usage in the video game industry A video game's exclusivity to specific hardware may either be permanent, or timed‚Äîthe latter case allowing a game to be released on different console platforms and/or PCs after a specific timeframe lapses. Permanent exclusives are often developed (first-party title), published or heavily-funded by the console manufacturer. In some cases, the exclusivity may only apply to a game's console release, either for games being ported from PC to console (such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, whose console release was a timed Xbox One exclusive), or games being released on PC along with a single console. Games may also include features and content that are exclusive to specific consoles, such as features that leverage a specific platform's distinguishing features, or appearances by characters from the platform's first-party franchises (such as Banjo and Kazooie being playable characters on the Xbox 360 version of Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, and Fox McCloud from Nintendo's Star Fox series being playable in special content on the Nintendo Switch version of Starlink: Battle for Atlas). Timed exclusivity may also apply to downloadable content for an otherwise multi-platform game, such as Activision's exclusivity agreements with Sony Interactive Entertainment (which cover the Call of Duty franchise). Exclusives are typically at the forefront of promotional efforts during gaming conferences such as E3, in order to help drive sales of hardware, as a consumer choosing between options may be swayed by the different range of games available on each different console. Analysts have stated that sales figures in the past have indicated that there is a relation between hardware sales, and the release of software specifically for that hardware. They state that there is also data which shows that during holiday periods, when consumer spending is generally higher, hardware with a list of exclusive releases generally outsell those with a smaller selection. Correlations have also been drawn between the sales of software, and the sales of relevant hardware, as in late 2009 the Wii dominated both the hardware and software charts. A console manufacturer may invest in or acquire other video game developers so that their expertise can be leveraged for first-party titles, such as Microsoft's acquisitions of Lionhead Studios (Fable) and Rare (which, up until then, had been strongly-aligned with, and minority-owned by Nintendo), and Sony's acquisitions of Naughty Dog (which had already been strongly-aligned with PlayStation for existing titles), and Insomniac Games (which had also been strongly-aligned with PlayStation, and had worked on Sony-published games such as the Ratchet & Clank franchise and Spider-Man). There have begun to be exceptions to the practice: Microsoft Studios-published exclusive Ori and the Blind Forest was given a Nintendo Switch port in 2019 (although this was part of a larger pattern of collaboration with the company, including cross-platform multiplayer support between the Switch and Xbox versions of Minecraft, and inclusion of the title duo from the Rare-developed Nintendo 64 game Banjo-Kazooie as a downloadable character for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate). Microsoft stated that it would honor the multi-platform release plans for games from several studios that it had recently acquired (including Obsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds, whose publishing rights had already been sold to Take-Two Interactive prior to Microsoft's purchase of the studio), but that they would focus on Xbox platform exclusives in the future. In December 2019, Sony announced plans to transition its first-party MLB: The Show franchise to multi-platform releases \\"as early as 2021\\".  Exclusivity in PC gaming  In the PC gaming market, a form of platform exclusivity has emerged involving digital distribution, whereby an online retailer acquires exclusive rights to distribute a game by means of either vertical integration between a publisher and a co-owned distribution platform, or through a financial arrangement between a publisher and a third-party distributor. Microsoft Studios employed this strategy on certain first-party releases by making them exclusive to Microsoft Store (formerly Windows Store), including cross-buy support with Xbox One. This also made the games, such as Quantum Break, exclusive to the Windows 10 operating system, due to the use of Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Games on the UWP architecture also included technical and compatibility limitations that critics and consumers considered unfavorable and contrary to norms (such as locked frame rates and incompatibility with third-party tools). However, Microsoft would later re- release Quantum Break on Steam with support for Windows 7 and newer, and announced in May 2019 that it would begin to offer more of its flagship first- party titles on third-party platforms such as Steam to widen their availability, and in Win32 architecture to remove the limitations of UWP. Epic Games Store has faced criticism for employing this strategy. One prominent case was that of Metro: Exodus, which was abruptly announced as being an Epic Games Store exclusive only shortly before its release, even after taking pre- orders on Steam. Its owner Valve criticized the move as being unfair to consumers, but stated that it would still fulfill and support the game for those who had purchased it prior to the exclusivity deal. Justification for these complaints have included allegations that the store client is spyware, sinophobia (due to minority shares in the company being owned by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, allegedly subjecting it to Chinese government influence and possible espionage), lacking features in comparison to the market-leading Steam (such as per-game communities and cloud saves), and subjection of the PC gaming industry to exclusivity deals reminiscent of those seen on consoles. Epic Games states that its store is more favorable to publishers by taking only a 12% share of revenue in comparison to Steam (30%). Epic Games Store also waives the separate 5% royalty on games that license Unreal Engine. In response to the criticism, Epic Games stated that it would be less aggressive in seeking exclusivity deals if Valve reduced its revenue cut, and that it would try to avoid repeating the \\"pushback\\" associated with the Metro controversy. Impact of exclusivity on sales In addition to sales data supporting the relation of hardware sales to software titles, CNET stated that \\"one of the biggest decisions when choosing a video game system has to be the exclusive games\\". The focus of E3 on exclusive titles at each manufacturer's press event also reflects the marketing power of exclusive titles, in addition to exclusive hardware. Many media reports include exclusive hardware and software as points of consideration for consumers. They also draw attention to the relevance of such exclusive titles for the developer, as there may be a potential for greater sales volume when releasing on multiple platforms. Console makers such as Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo also use exclusive titles to their advantage in order to create marketing strategies. Microsoft claimed that the Halo series, specifically Halo 3, was a key \\"payoff\\" in their strategy when entering the console market with the Xbox and Xbox 360. The Wii's dominance during the seventh generation of consoles was credited primarily to Nintendo's focus on targeting a wider audience, rather than competing with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on hardware fidelity and the core market. The console distinguished itself on-launch with its innovative Wii Remote motion controller, as well as family-friendly games that were intuitive and accessible to audiences not typically associated with video gaming. These goals were exemplified by Wii Sports‚Äîan exclusive title which was bundled with the console, as well as other Wii series games designed with a similar positioning. By July 2007, it was reported that the Wii had outsold the PlayStation 3 six-to-one, with analysts citing a lack of \\"killer\\" exclusives for the platform as affecting market share. In Japan, Microsoft attempted to use the first-party exclusive Blue Dragon‚Äîa game by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi‚Äîto bolster the local release of the Xbox 360. Several other third-party titles, including Dead or Alive 4, The Idolmaster, Tales of Vesperia, The Last Remnant, and Vampire Rain, also chose to initially target the 360 exclusively. A developer of Vampire Rain stated that Microsoft was providing stronger support for developers on Xbox 360 than Sony was for PS3, but when the 360's lack of long-term success in the market became more apparent, they began making ports of the games for PS3 with additional exclusive content to recuperate development costs. By contrast, the Wii's eighth generation successor, the Wii U, was hampered by a weak lineup of launch titles, an unclear vision for its Wii U GamePad peripheral, and a resulting lack of third-party support. Nintendo relied primarily on exclusives from its first-party franchises‚Äîsuch as Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and the new IP Splatoon‚Äîin order to grow the fledgling console's market share. The Wii U never reached the same market share as its competitors, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and manufacturing was discontinued in 2017. Some writers did note that in terms of critical reception, the Wii U did have a stronger library of exclusive titles than its competitors at the time. As of March 2016, the Wii U had more exclusive titles with aggregate scores on Metacritic within the \\"Good\\" (75-89) and \\"Amazing\\" (89-100) ranking tiers than PS4 and Xbox One combined, and the most within the \\"Amazing\\" category (Bayonetta 2, Super Mario 3D World, and Super Smash Bros.; the PS4 only had one \\"Amazing\\"-ranked game, Bloodborne, and Xbox One had none). The eighth generation of consoles has been dominated primarily by the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Microsoft's Xbox One console has faced criticism for not having as many \\"compelling\\" exclusives, with critics citing Microsoft's weaker array of first-party studios as a factor. Microsoft has also increasingly preferred dual releases on Microsoft Windows and Xbox One over full Xbox console exclusivity, and deals for console ports of existing PC games to be timed exclusives to Xbox One.

The comic follows a group of soldiers fighting groteque monsters on an alien planet and has a pronounced war-theme. Death-Day was published online in episodic form since 2009, and the first of four graphic novels was published in September 2010. The comic was well-received because of its detailed art. Synopsis Lauren Davis, writing for Comics Alliance, summed Death-Day up as \\"military science fiction filled with unnerving biomechanical creations. Death-Day is about a group of soldiers stranded on an exotic planet, where they have to defend themselves against grotesque monsters while attempting to find a way back to Earth. Max Sparber of MinnPost pointed out that the comic has a near-total lack of exposition, as most context of the story is left untold. It is unclear why a war is taking place between humanity and the enormous six-limbed monsters or on what world the characters are stationed. All that is clear is the mission of the military team: to destroy some sort of black orb behind enemy lines. Development Established comics creator Sam Hiti got the inspiration to create Death-Day after the September 11 attacks and the wars that followed shortly after the collapse of the World Trade Center. As a child, Hiti did not know what the letter D in \\"D-Day\\" stood for, and concluded that it must stand for \\"death\\" due to all the deceased people that are shown on television on the anniversary of the Normandy landings. Later in life, Hiti decided that if he were ever to write a story about war, \\"Death-Day\\" would make a great title. Hiti created Death-Day in collaboration with Joseph \\"Joe\\" Midthun, who took on the role of editor. Midthun lived in the same apartment building as Hiti and studied film in college, which got the two talking about comics. As Hiti \\"respected what he had to say,\\" he showed Midthun an early draft of Death-Day, after which he slowly became part of the creation process. The development of Death-Day took multiple years: though Midthun considered the art to be of high quality, the two had difficulty figuring out an ending for the comic. Hiti and Midthun went through a process of moving art around and changing the format of the story, but to no avail. After a few years, this version of the story was scrapped and the two started from scratch. Hiti has said that he has \\"4-foot[sic] high stack of pages\\" that will probably never be released. According to Hiti, communication between him and Midthun was poor during the development process, but Hiti \\"respected [Midthun's] intelligence enough\\" to try and work through it. Hiti stated that Midthun \\"challenged [him] technically, creatively, and internally.\\" Midthun similarly stated that the collaboration it was difficult at first, and that though his background in film gave him experience in working with other people, creating an independent comic was very different. Content Death-Day was initially created in a more \\"spiritual setting\\" and Hiti has stated that the comic turned out \\"more science fiction\\" than he had originally planned. Hiti wanted the comic to be set in a world which the reader can relate to, and felt adding science fiction elements helped in this regard. He said that the purpose of both science and spirituality is to answer deep philosophical questions, and Midthun added that Death-Day is \\"just fiction ... a reflection of reality.\\" Midthun said that, through Death-Day, the two are trying to make a statement both about comics and about life itself. Hiti let himself be influenced by things he visually ingested as a child, such as cartoons and old war and science fiction films. Furthermore, Hiti was inspired by a quote from C.S. Lewis he heard at a conference in 2005, which made him focus more on writing a \\"good story\\" rather than writing what he believed in: Release Midthun and Hiti released the first Death-Day graphic novel in September 2010. Hiti and Midthun first released Death-Day in the form of a webcomic on his own website, before publishing the series in the form of graphic novels. Death-Day consists of twenty \\"episodes\\", each approximately 30 pages in length. The first episode was released on Hiti's personal website on October 31, 2009, which got 8,000 unique views in ten days. The second episode was released one month after the first. Each five episodes would eventually be compiled into one graphic novel, resulting in four books. The first graphic novel was published by La Luz Comics in September 2010. In May 2015, Sam Hiti announced that he would retire his comics career entirely, possibly because of a series of unfortunate setbacks or due to ill health. Hiti has not responded to any inquiries regarding the future of his comics. Reception The first graphic novel of Death-Day was positively received after its release. Sparber of MinnPost liked the vagueness of the comic, stating that the unexplained nature of the war works well with the highly-detailed science fiction setting. Sparber also stated that the artwork is the finest aspect of the comic, praising the crowded frames filled with details and extensive shading, and declaring that some panels \\"must have taken hours to complete.\\" Sparber also noticed a \\"deliberate sloppiness\\" to Hiti's style, as all lines seem to sway and shading is not perfectly executed, resulting in a \\"sense of frenzy.\\" Cecilia Johnson of the Star Tribune also praised Hiti's \\"bold, expressive\\" artwork for its high level of detail. Writing for Comic Book Resources, Michael May applauded Death-Days slowly paced story and densely packed artwork, saying that he \\"couldn‚Äôt help feeling satisfied\\" despite the fact that the story was still incomplete. May praised the comic highly because, according to him, \\"the world is so whole, the concept is so thorough [and] the characters are so well-rounded.\\" References External links Death-Day on Blogspot American webcomics 2000s webcomics 2010 graphic novels Biopunk comics 2009 webcomic debuts ","title":"Death-Day"},{"id":"25102233","text":"P.T.

The raid in August 1840 by Penateka Comanches, led by war chief Buffalo Hump, on Victoria and the Port of Linnville, on Lavaca Bay, Texas, is said to be the largest raid by American Indians on cities in U.S. history (Texas was at the time still a republic). Linnville was sacked and burned by the Comanches, and the port was never rebuilt. Citizens of Linnville escaped to safety by taking to small boats and a schooner in the waters off the bay, watching as their town was burned to the ground. The raid on Victoria and Linnville was one in a sequence of strikes and counter-strikes in Republic of Texas history that defined bitter relations between Comanches and Texans. Events began with the Council House Fight in San Antonio, March 1840 in which Republic of Texas officials attempted to capture and take prisoner a large number of Comanche chiefs who had come to negotiate a peace treaty, killing them together with dozens of their family and followers. In revenge, the Comanche conducted the raid on Victoria and Linnville in August 1840. The Battle of Plum Creek, near Lockhart Texas, shortly after the raid on Linnville, was Texans' retaliation against Comanches in their retreat from Linnville. And finally, an expedition commanded by Colonel John Henry Moore against a Comanche village in October 1840, was revenge by Texans for the raid on Victoria and Linnville by striking Penateka Comanches in their homeland near what is now Colorado City.

In 1940, he was one of the first U.S. firefighters to parachute from a plane onto a wildfire. Cooley went on to train others to fight fires by smokejumping. After his retirement from the USFS, he set up the National Smokejumper Association, of which he was president from 1993 to 1995.  Early life  Cooley was born in Hardin, Montana in 1911. He was one of 11 children and grew up running through the woods and playing just like a normal kid. Hunting, trapping, and fishing were big parts of his life. He loved anything to do with the outdoors. When he was just a 12-year-old boy, his father suffered a substantial financial setback. (NYTimes). He dropped out of school to help support his family. He relied on his abilities to hunt, fish, trap, and farm in order to help earn money. Education He went back to high school and graduated from the class of 1930. After graduation, he went on to attend and graduate from the forestry school at the University of Montana. Career In 1937, Cooley started his career with the Forest Service. The agency was looking for ways to improve the methods used to fight fires. Terrain in the mountains in the 1930s was almost inaccessible, and the roads almost nonexistent. (Bramwell). The challenge became focused on finding a way to get to the fire faster. The agency came up with an idea on attaching ‚Äúwater bombs‚Äù to a plane to drop on the fire. Although the idea was tested several times, it proved ineffective and was cancelled. (NY times) Cooley thought he could do something with the plane and brought up the idea of smokejumping ‚Äì parachuting out of an airplane into a fire to get it under control. This had been tried and appeared to prove true in other countries including Russia and Germany. (Bramwell) Many American pilots were unsure about the idea of dropping firefighters into a fire from the air. There are many factors that can go wrong and they were reluctant and hesitant at the idea. Cooley and a partner by the name of Rufus Robinson began to toil with the notion. On July 12, 1940, Cooley and Robinson got their chance to test their idea. The twenty- eight-year-old who had been building roads, towers, and various other structures for the service was ready for the challenge. A forest fire had sprung up along Martin Creek in the Naz Perce National Forest. Robinson jumped first followed by Cooley. (Bushey) Their supplies were dropped on the planes‚Äô next pass. (NY times) The next day when the four-man crew reached them, they had the fire under control. They turned around and hiked the 28 miles back to camp. (Bushey). After the service set up the smokejumpers, Cooley began training other young men on how to do exactly the same thing he did. He trained men for what the National Service called ‚Äú10‚Äôo clock men‚Äù. The idea was that they could have the fire put out by 10‚Äôo clock the next morning after being dispatched. (Bramwell) Mann Gulch Fire On August 15, 1949, a fire broke out inside of a gulch in Helena National Forest in Montana. The Canyon, which had cliffs that reached 1,250 at times on both sides, made access for ground crews almost impossible. (Maclean) Cooley was not actually one of the men who jumped on this run. Instead, he was the spotter. His job was to wait for the plane to fly over the spot previously decided by the incident planning team, and give the men the signal of when to jump. He laid on the floor, next to the open door, with his foreman across from him. Cooley had to take information from the foreman, the pilot, the ground crews, and from what he could see from the air. After denying a few spots, and debating another with the foreman Wag Dodge, he finally decided on the spot he felt would be best to drop the men. (Maclean) The men lined up in groups and he gave them the signal. After four passes, all the jumpers were safely on the ground. After the jumpers landed, the plane made one more pass dumping their equipment on to the ground. They gathered it up and went to meet the ground men who were to meet them. The ground men were not where they were supposed to be. The jumpers were on their own. They continued to move on with the task at hand. As they moved along the gulch, they began to angle downward towards the fire. The fire shifted in what is known as a blow-up and turned on the men. The men panicked them tried to outrun the fire. They were quickly overtaken by the flames. There were only three survivors. (Maclean) This news effected Cooley harshly. He ensured that every body from his crew was recovered before he went home. Fourteen men were killed, just from his jumpers. This doesn't include all the other men who died trying to stop the fire. This is still known as the biggest smokejumper tragedy. When later inquired about the Mann Gulch fire, Cooley said ‚ÄúI am sure I did the right thing that day, but I still look at that map and have thought about it every day since then.‚Äù (NYTimes) After the fire, he went with local rangers to see placement of stone and concrete crosses placed on the spots at which each of the men died. It has been said that until his eighties, he would often take trips to ensure the crosses and various plaques, markers, and memorials were still standing. The majority of information on the infamous Mann Gulch fire can be found in Norman Maclean's Young Men and Fire. Maclean sat down with Cooley and the survivors and wrote down the details of this event. The National Forestry service also has the incident investigation with interviews from Cooley and the three survivors within their archives. Legacy Cooley continued to serve and protect people with the service of smokejumping. He went on to train countless jumpers to go into the fire and to get it extinguished quickly. Along with many others whose job is specifically that of studying fire behavior, he worked tirelessly to continually change and evolve the way these men fought the fires. His goal was to learn something from each jump to make the job safer and more efficient. He served as base superintendent at the jump base in Missoula, Montana until 1975, when he finally retired from the Forestry service Cooley went on to establish the National Smokejumping Association in 1989, of which he served as president from 1993 to 1995, after which he retired from the service all together. He passed away November 9, 2009 at his home from pneumonia.

Queally (born 8 October 1984 in Dungarvan, County Waterford, Ireland) is a Thoroughbred horse racing jockey. He is best known as the regular jockey of Frankel. He was first jockey to leading trainer Sir Henry Cecil. Queally is best known for his association with the Cecil-trained pair Midday and Frankel. Background The son of Declan Queally, who trains a small string of Thoroughbreds in County Waterford, Queally was raised in Modeligo and attended to Dungarvan Christian Brothers School. He earned his first win on 13 April 2000 at Ireland's Clonmel Racecourse. 2009 was Tom Queally's breakthrough year, in which he won his first of five Group One races aboard Art Connoisseur in the Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. By 1 August, aboard Midday, he was winning his fourth Group One event, the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood; and on 7 November he again rode Midday to victory in the richest win of his career, the US$2 million Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita in California. Riding career Apprenticeship The son of Irish trainer Declan Queally, the young Thomas was a southern area pony racing champion in Ireland and, aged 15, recorded his first win as a jockey on Larifaari at Clonmel on 13 April 2000. After finishing his education, Queally joined the yard of the leading Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, for whom he had been riding out at weekends whilst still at school. A shock win in the 2003 renewal of the Group 3 Ballysax Stakes on Balestrini (beating O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs supposed first-string, the Derby hope Alberto Giacometti) could have been the springboard to success, however with only 11 winners on the board at a strike- rate of just 3% by late 2003, Queally informed O‚ÄôBrien that he would look to try to further his career abroad. Queally had ridden a winner for trainer David Elsworth when in England for a few weeks in January 2003 and his return to the UK (after a stint as a work rider both in the United States and New Zealand) was an instant success as, attached to the yard of legendary gambler and trainer Barney Curley, he took the apprentice title in his first full season in the UK in 2004 with 59 winners (66 in the calendar year). Association with Henry Cecil After riding 59 and 88 winners in 2006 and 2007 respectively, Queally recorded his maiden century in 2008, a year that also saw the beginning of his association with Newmarket-based trainer Sir Henry Cecil. Queally rode more winners for Cecil (18) than for any other trainer in 2008 and, having seemingly been second jockey (behind Ted Durcan) to the trainer throughout the year, he was given the ride on Twice Over in the Champion Stakes, a move that appeared to herald a change in the pecking order, as the horse had been ridden by Durcan on four of his previous five starts that season. Though never under contract as a stable jockey, Queally became first jockey to Cecil in 2009. He won three Group 1 races for Cecil that season, though his first two successes at the highest level came for other trainers. Firstly, Art Connoisseur for Michael Bell in the Group 1 Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June 2009, a ride which he came in for due to the unavailability of Bell‚Äôs two principal riders through suspension (Jamie Spencer) and injury (Hayley Turner), and then Fleeting Spirit for Jeremy Noseda in the Group 1 July Cup at Ascot the following month. Queally‚Äôs association with Midday (who had finished a close 2nd in the Oaks the previous year) and Twice Over continued in 2010, with the horses providing Queally with five Group 1 victories, though Midday finished 2nd when bidding for a second win in the Filly and Mare Turf on her return to the Breeders‚Äô Cup. By then, the two-year-old Frankel had burst on to the scene, winning his first three starts (including the Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot) before running away with the Group 1 Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket, part of a Group 1 double on the card for Queally and Cecil - the first for the trainer in his 40-year career - with Twice Over winning the Champion Stakes. Immediately after the race, Frankel was shortened to odds-on favourite for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket the following May, with Queally labelling him \\"A superstar‚Ä¶very special\\". After winning easily on his comeback race at Newbury on 16 April 2011 (the Group 3 Greenham Stakes), Frankel was sent off an odds-on favourite to win the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket a fortnight later. Having been expected to take a lead off his pacemaker in the race, Queally made all on Frankel to win by six lengths, the widest margin of victory since Tudor Minstrel in 1947. Speaking after his first Classic win, Queally said, \\"\\"He‚Äôs made a show of them. The one thing this horse does is gallop - I didn't want to disappoint him, I wanted him to do what he enjoys and he showed them. The first thing you think is what speed are we going, because to him it feels like a cruising canter. He quickened up and went away.\\" However, the plaudits for his tactics at Newmarket turned to criticism after Frankel‚Äôs next start at Ascot, in the St James's Palace Stakes, where despite initially settling behind a strong pace set by his stablemate Rerouted, Queally sent Frankel to the lead well before the home turn and only just hung on to win. Both trainer and jockey professed their surprise publicly at the criticism, with Queally dismissing claims the horse was tiring due to the unusual race tactics. \\"He was starting to get a little fed up as he just does it so easily. He's growing up all the time.\\" Cecil confirmed he was satisfied with the ride given by Queally, stating, \\"The plan was to go before the bend and he sprinted away, but now he's getting wiser and when he thought he had the race won, he thought he'd done enough\\". After the controversial tactics that led to the narrow victory at Ascot, Frankel was ridden to victory from the front in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, though Queally played down his role in the win, saying, \\"He was amazing and I‚Äôm just very fortunate to be playing a small part in it.\\" Further Group 1 victories for Queally and Cecil followed (Timepiece in the Falmouth Stakes and the evergreen Midday winning a third Nassau at Goodwood); but in the aftermath of Frankel‚Äôs easy win in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (British Champion Mile), in which the horse lived up to his billing as the star attraction of the inaugural QIPCO British Champions Day, Queally was in no doubt about what had made his year, saying, \\"This is the people¬¥s horse now. If someone asked me to sum up my season, it would be one word, Frankel.\\" Queally finished 2011 with 100 winners and over ¬£2,500,000 in prize-money. In June 2012, Queally rode Frankel to the second and most devastating of his five Group One successes of the year: the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, again over one mile, by 11 lengths. Stepped up to ten furlongs, Frankel cemented his reputation as one of the best racehorses of all time, in the International Stakes at York (22 August) and completed his career by winning the Champion Stakes. Queally enjoyed one other Group One triumph during 2012, riding Chachamaidee for Cecil to victory in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown (8 September). After the retirement of Frankel at the end of the 2012 season, and following Cecil's death in the spring of 2013, Queally continued to ride for the stable, led by the trainer's widow Lady Jane Cecil. For her he rode the winner of the Ebor Handicap at York (24 August). Subsequent years have proved difficult for Queally. Wins on The Tin Man in the 2016 British Champions Sprint and 2017 Diamond Jubilee Stakes were rare top level victories. 2017 was the least prolific season of his time in Britain.

He spent most of his academic career at University College London (UCL), from 1948 to 1984. Early life He was born in Preston, Lancashire, to John Reid Christie and his wife, Gladys Lilian Whatley.J. H. Burns, 'Ian Ralph Christie, 1919‚Äì1998', Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume 105 (2000), pp. 365‚Äì366. He was educated at home as he was unable to attend school due to glandular fever and a bronchial illness. After his recovery, he moved to Worcester to live with an aunt and was educated at Worcester Royal Grammar School (1931‚Äì38). He was senior prefect in his last year and his chosen sixth-form subjects were history and English literature.Burns, pp. 367‚Äì68. He represented Worcester Grammar at the 1937 Empire Rally and was impressed with Stanley Baldwin's speech. However, he was opposed to appeasement, regarded Nazism as barbarism and treated left-wing opposition to rearmament with contempt.Burns, p. 368. He went to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1938 to study modern history.Burns, p. 369. In 1940 C. S. Lewis taught him political theory but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War, where he volunteered for non-combatant duties (due to ill- health) in the Royal Air Force. He served in the equipment branch from August 1940 to April 1946 and ended as a commissioned officer. He later regarded his war service as the most important thing he had done in his life.Burns, pp. 370‚Äì71. He spent periods of inactivity reading political theory, including Bertrand Russell's Power: A New Social Analysis and R. G. Collingwood's New Leviathan.Burns, p. 371. He returned to Oxford in April 1946, where his history tutors were K. B. McFarlane and A. J. P. Taylor. Christie later wrote that he had \\"greatly enjoyed\\" Taylor's tutorials because he displayed his \\"iconoclastic thinking in a period of later modern British history which greatly interested me\\".Burns, p. 372. In 1948 his father died and he graduated later in the year with second class honours.Negley Harte, 'Obituary: Professor Ian R. Christie', The Independent (5 December 1998), retrieved 12 January 2020.Burns, p. 373. Academic career In 1948, whilst still at Oxford, J. E. Neale offered Christie an assistant lectureship in history at University College London. Christie accepted Neale's offer and replied: \\"Mr A. J. P. Taylor here has said he will procure me an introduction to Professor Namier in order that I may get advice on my proposed subject for research\\". Christie adopted Namier's historical method and his first work, The End of North's Ministry (1958), was the second volume in Namier's series, England in the Age of the American Revolution.Burns p. 374. Christie paid tribute to Namier in the book's preface: > To Sir Lewis Namier I owe many thanks: first, when I had only met him in his > books, for prompting in me a strong desire to know whether his picture of > politics and party structure at the accession of George III was still valid > for the period some twenty years later, when the political system was under > strain as a result of defeat in the American War of Independence; and, since > this study began, for his guidance and encouragement.I. R. Christie, The End > of North's Ministry, 1780‚Äì82 (London: Macmillan, 1958), p. v. A. J. P. Taylor, who had quarrelled with Namier a year before, said in his review of The End of North's Ministry that Christie had demonstrated that Namier's ideas about eighteenth century politics had been proved wrong by one of his leading disciples. Christie later wrote that Taylor's review had demonstrated \\"utter ignorance of the whole general thrust of my book\\".Burns, p. 375. He dedicated his last book, British ‚Äònon-√©lite‚Äô MPs, 1715‚Äì1820 (1995), to Namier.Burns, p. 377. Christie held the assistant lectureship in history until 1951, when he was promoted to lecturer, a post he held until 1960. He was then appointed reader (1960-66) before being promoted to professor (1966-79), Dean of Arts (1971-73), chairman of the history department (1975-79) and Astor Professor of British History (1979-84). In 1964 he became joint literary director (with Geoffrey Barrow) of the Royal Historical Society, which they held for six years.Burns, p. 376. According to Negley Harte, Christie told him that he had become an historian \\"because he wanted to understand why for centuries intelligent people had believed in Christianity\\". However, Christie said in his unpublished autobiography that he had tried at Oxford to steer clear of topics involving \\"the to me wearisome wranglings of past generations over religious issues\\". In his second work, Wilkes, Wyvill and Reform: The Parliamentary Reform Movement in British Politics, 1760‚Äì1785 (1962), Christie explored the movement for parliamentary reform that was led by John Wilkes and Christopher Wyvill. Christie said of the Unreformed House of Commons: \\"[B]y and large this extraordinary system worked not unsuccessfully\\" and was \\"appropriate to the Britain of its day\\".John Cannon, 'Review: Wilkes, Wyvil and Reform by Ian Christie', History, Vol. 49, No. 165 (1964), p. 83. John B. Owen called it an excellent general survey that superseded G. S. Veitch's The Genesis of Parliamentary Reform.John B. Owen, 'Review: Wilkes, Wyvil and Reform by Ian R. Christie', The English Historical Review, Vol. 79, No. 313 (Oct., 1964), pp. 861-862. His third book, Crisis of Empire, was a scholarly narrative of the relationship between Britain and the American colonies between 1754 and 1783.George C. Rogers, Jr., 'Review: Crisis of Empire: Great Britain and the American Colonies, 1754-1783 by I. R. Christie', The English Historical Review, Vol. 83, No. 326 (Jan., 1968), pp. 190-191. Christie wrote a considerable number of biographies for The History of Parliaments volume, The House of Commons, 1754‚Äì1790 (1964) but in 1969 he turned down the editorship of the 1790‚Äì1820 volumes due to his work at UCL. From 1973 until 1996 he was a member of the editorial board of the History of Parliament Trust. Christie also edited the third volume of Jeremy Bentham's correspondence for UCL's The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham. He learnt Russian for this purpose, as Bentham had visited Catherine the Great in the hope that she would become an enlightened ruler. He became a Fellow of the British Academy in 1977. When Anthony Blunt's treason was exposed in 1979, Christie said he would have resigned from the Academy if Blunt had not been expelled or resigned. This led to a breach with his former tutor, A. J. P. Taylor, who resigned from the Academy in protest against the treatment of Blunt.Burns, p. 378. In 1983 he delivered the Ford Lectures at Oxford, on the reasons why Britain avoided revolution, which were subsequently published by Oxford University Press as Stress and Stability in Late Eighteenth-Century Britain (1984). Christie argued that eighteenth century Britain was a country where \\"oligarchical government stood foursquare on its foundations in the tacit consent of the people\\" and that \\"there was no danger of revolution in Britain in the 1790s\\".Burns, pp. 382‚Äì83. What defeated revolutionary forces in Britain, Christie asserted, was \\"a deep-rooted pragmatism\\" rooted in \\"the slow evolution of the English common law\\".Burns, p. 383‚Äì84. He ended the work by quoting John of Gaunt's \\"sceptred isle\\" speech from William Shakespeare's Richard II.Burns, p. 384. J. C. D. Clark said that Christie's theme in his Ford Lectures of a \\"deeply-shared sense of national identity\\" was perhaps \\"an unwelcome message to some of his audience\\", whose reaction was \\"often extremely cool\\".Burns, p. 384 + n. 35. P. D. G. Thomas argued that Christie's \\"convincing synthesis\\" refuted E. P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class and that \\"Christie's characteristically subtle and systematic analysis is clinched by the imaginative flourish that British prejudice against foreigners was an antidote to the contagion of revolution\\".P. D. G. Thomas, 'Review: Stress and Stability in Late Eighteenth-Century Britain', History, Vol. 71, No. 231 (February 1986), p. 164. In his retirement speech, Christie provoked controversy when he said that when he joined the department in 1948 there were great men in it, and that he was confident that one day there would be again. Christie was also opposed to the revisionist history of the Second World War: when Maurice Cowling published an article in the Sunday Telegraph on the 50th anniversary of the war that questioned whether Britain should have fought Germany in 1939, Christie drafted a long letter to the paper's editor (with an even longer covering letter to Cowling), in which he defended the necessity of a war in defence of civilisation and vigorously denounced the Holocaust. Personal life In 1992 he married Ann Hastings.

Family Richard Scrope, born about 1350, was the third son of Henry Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Masham, and his wife, Joan, whose surname is unknown. He had four brothers and two sisters:. * Sir Geoffrey Scrope (c.1342‚Äì1362), who married Eleanor Neville, the daughter of Ralph de Neville, 2nd Baron Neville, by Alice, daughter of Hugh de Audley, and was slain at the siege of the Castle of Piskre in Lithuania in 1362, dying without issue.. * Stephen Scrope (c.1345 ‚Äì 25 January 1406), 2nd Baron Scrope of Masham * Henry Scrope (1359 - 1425), 4th Lord FitzHugh, 3rd Baron of Ravensworth, who married Lady Elizabeth DeGrey (1365 - 1427) * Sir John Scrope, who married Elizabeth Strathbogie. * Joan Scrope, who married Henry FitzHugh, 2nd Baron FitzHugh * Isabel Scrope, who married Sir Robert Plumpton. Career His father had had a distinguished career as a soldier and administrator, and according to McNiven, Richard's Scrope's first preferments in the church probably owed a great deal to family influence.. Scrope was rector of Ainderby Steeple near Northallerton in 1368, warden of the free chapel of Tickhill Castle, and in 1375 official to Thomas Arundel, Bishop of Ely. He was ordained deacon on 20 September 1376, and priest on 14 March 1377. During this time he studied arts at Oxford, and by 1375 became licentiate in civil law. By 1383 he had earned doctorates of canon and civil law at Cambridge, and in 1378 was Chancellor of the University.; ; . From 1382 to 1386 Scrope was at Rome, serving as a papal chaplain and an auditor of the Curia. In 1382 he was instituted Dean of Chichester. Although his election as Bishop of Chichester in September 1385 was blocked by King Richard II, Scrope was made Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield on 18 August 1386, and consecrated by Pope Urban VI at Genoa on the following day.; ; . Scrope made a profession of obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 March 1387, and was enthroned in his cathedral on 29 June 1387. Scrope combined his ecclesiastical duties with involvement in secular matters. In 1378 and 1392 he was sent on diplomatic missions to Scotland, and went to Rome in 1397 to further Richard II's proposal for the canonisation of King Edward II.; . While in Rome he was translated to York between 27 February 1398 and 15 March 1398, and granted the temporalities on 23 June 1398.; . Although he did not participate in the factional strife which led up to King Richard II's deposition, on 29 September 1399 Scrope and John Trefnant (d.1404), Bishop of Hereford, headed the commission which received the King's ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô abdication at the Tower. Scrope announced the abdication to a quasi- parliamentary assembly on the following day, and together with Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, escorted Henry Bolingbroke to the vacant throne.; . Rebellion As McNiven notes, the dominance of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland, in the north of England, and the family's pivotal role in putting Henry IV on the throne, as well as family alliances (Richard Scrope's elder brother, John Scrope, had married the widow of the Earl of Northumberland's second son, Thomas Percy,. and his sister, Isabel Scrope, had married Sir Robert Plumpton,. a tenant of the Percys), meant that Richard Scrope, as Archbishop of York, was bound to become involved with the Percys. However his loyalty was untested until the Percys revolted in the summer of 1403. Even then, although the chronicler John Hardyng, a Percy retainer, claimed that Scrope encouraged the Percys to rebel, there is no other evidence that he did so.; . The Percys suffered defeat at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, at which Northumberland's son and heir, Henry 'Hotspur' Percy, was slain. Richard Scrope continued in his ecclesiastic duties as Archbishop of York. He, assisted by the Bishops of Durham and Carlisle Cathedrals, officiated at a solemn translation of Saint John of Bridlington, 11 March 1404, de mandato Domini Papae. In 1405 Northumberland, joined by Lord Bardolf, again took up arms against the King. The rising was doomed from the start because of Northumberland's failure to capture Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. Scrope, together with Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Scrope's nephew, Sir William Plumpton, had assembled a force of some 8000 men on Shipton Moor on 27 May, but instead of giving battle Scrope parleyed with Westmorland, and was tricked into believing that his demands would be accepted and his personal safety guaranteed. Once their army had disbanded on 29 May, Scrope and Mowbray were arrested and taken to Pontefract Castle to await the King, who arrived at York on 3 June. Trial and death The King denied the rebel leaders trial by jury, and a commission headed by the Earl of Arundel and Sir Thomas Beaufort sat in judgment on the Archbishop, Mowbray and Plumpton in Scrope's own hall at his manor of Bishopthorpe , some three miles south of York. The Chief Justice, Sir William Gascoigne, refused to participate in such irregular proceedings and to pronounce judgment on a Prince of the Church, and it was thus left to the lawyer Sir William Fulthorpe to condemn Scrope to death for high treason. Scrope, Mowbray and Plumpton were taken to a field belonging to the nunnery of Clementhorpe which lay just under the walls of York, and before a great crowd were beheaded on 8 June 1405. Archbishop Scrope requesting the executioner to deal him five blows in remembrance of the Five Wounds of Christ, which was a popular devotion in Catholic England. After his execution, Archbishop Richard Scrope was buried in York Minster.; ; . Legacy Although Scrope's participation in the Percy rebellion of 1405 is usually attributed to his opposition to the King's proposal to temporarily confiscate the clergy's landed wealth, his motive for taking an active military role in the rising continues to puzzle historians.; . Pope Innocent VII excommunicated all those involved in Archbishop Scrope's \\"trial\\" and execution. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, refused to publish the Pope's decree in England, and in 1407 King Henry IV was pardoned by Pope Gregory XII.. Despite his having been executed for political reasons, Archbishop Scrope was viewed by many in England as a Saint and a martyr. According to historian Eamon Duffy, pictures of the Archbishop are often found in Pre-Reformation English prayerbooks. Duffy (2006), Marking the Hours: English People and their Prayers, Yale University Press. Page 15 Shakespeare and Scrope Scrope's parley with Westmorland at Shipton Moor, Westmorland's treachery, and Scrope's arrest after the dispersal of his army are depicted in Act IV of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2. In the play, the King's agents are shown persuading the Archbishop and the other rebel leaders to disband their army by promising that their demands will be met and then arresting them for high treason. Every member of their army is then executed without trial. According to historian John Julius Norwich, the actions of the King's agents continue to outrage audiences who watch the play being performed.

Founding and History Linton Chamber Music grew out of a special concert in March, 1977 to reward members of Cincinnati's historic First Unitarian Church for a successful fund-raising canvass. That concert, by the Trio d'Accordo (violinist Jorja Fleezanis, cellist Yizhak Schotten, cellist Karen Andrie) with harpsichordist Nina Johnson and flutist Rebecca Maag, prompted clarinetist Richard Waller, violinist Rosemary Waller and members of the Church to launch a chamber music series on Sunday afternoons in the Church sanctuary. It was named Linton after the street on which the Church is located in Cincinnati's Avondale neighborhood. Waller, principal clarinetist of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, became artistic director. The Linton Chamber Music Series proper began in 1978-79, with concerts in October, November, March and April. The October, 1978 inaugural was performed by Trio d'Accordo joined by CSO principal flutist George Hambrecht. The second concert, on November 12, 1978, featured pianist Andre-Michel Schub, Waller and CSO principal cellist Peter Wiley.Chute, James. \\"Chamber Music is a Hit,\\" Cincinnati Post. November 13, 1978. Schub, guest artist with the CSO that weekend, set a pattern for the Linton Series, which typically presents at least one CSO guest each season. The Sunday Linton Chamber Music Series of six concert programs takes place at the First Unitarian Church, just north of downtown. The Encore! Linton Series features five of the programs presented on the Sunday series but is on Mondays in a northern suburban location, Congregation Beth Adam. The hallmark of the Linton Series from its beginning has been presenting ad hoc rather than established ensembles, making it somewhat akin to the 19th-century house concert. Unique ensembles of classical music‚Äôs finest artists from across the world, country, and region, including musicians of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra as well as CSO guest artists are featured. CSO guests appear under a special arrangement with Linton, whereby soloists contracted by the orchestra are permitted to perform on Linton concerts during their visits to Cincinnati.Cooklis, Ray. \\"Linton Reluctant to Tamper with Success,\\" Cincinnati Enquirer. September 30, 1984. Various combinations of instruments and players bring a fresh approach and energy to performing and programming that inspires both audiences and artists. Artists also connect with audiences by sharing their musical perspectives from the stage. Performances are in intimate and acoustically warm settings where audiences surround the musicians, creating a remarkable atmosphere. In 1993, Linton Music Series was one of six national grantees of the Chamber Music America Presenter Expansion Program, enabling it to hire its first full-time administrative director. Linton was incorporated in 1994, earning its 501(c) (3) designation in 1995. Concerts are recorded and broadcast by Cincinnati public radio station WGUC-FM. In April 2009, Waller stepped down as Linton artistic director and was succeeded by artistic directors Jaime Laredo and Sharon Robinson.Gelfand, Janelle. \\"Linton Series Passed to Eager New Hands,\\" Cincinnati Enquirer.

Heading the administrative staff is executive director Julie Montgomery. In addition to Jaime Laredo and Sharon Robinson, as its Artistic Directors, Michael Chertock serves as its Associate Artistic Director. Educational Concerts Linton's educational wing, \\"Peanut Butter and Jam Sessions\\", an early childhood educational concert series was created in 1994. The 40-minute programs, presented by small ensembles on Saturday mornings in churches and community centers, introduce musical concepts and instruments and tell stories through music. Audience participation is encouraged, and children are invited to meet the musicians, touch their instruments and ask questions afterward. In addition to its Saturday programs, several free concerts are offered each season to provide access to families not otherwise able to attend. In 1999, \\"Peanut Butter and Jam Sessions\\" received a Post-Corbett Award for Excellence in Arts Education and Outreach from the Scripps Howard Foundation.

Vincent planned and carried out daring offensive air tactics in China, forming the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon which staged out of forward airfields to attack the enemy unexpectedly. The successful concept was twinned and reorganized by Chennault into two mixed- aircraft groups, with Vincent commanding one of them, the 68th Composite Wing. A string of Allied victories throughout 1943 caused the Japanese to plan a major retaliatory move. Beginning in May 1944, the airmen were hit repeatedly and forced into retreat as the Japanese implemented Operation Ichi-Go. Vincent's men demolished their valuable airbases and fell back to Chennault's stronghold at Kunming. Vincent returned to the U.S. afterward, his tour of duty complete. Back home, Vincent was put in command of a training wing and in 1946 was asked to teach at the Air War College. Following this, he held the position of second-in-command of the Western Air Defense Force. Vincent died of a heart attack in 1955. The United States Air Force (USAF) named an air base after him in 1956: the Vincent Air Force Base in Yuma, Arizona. The airfield was turned over to the Marines in 1962, and is today the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (Vincent Field).

After excelling in high school, Vincent was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, becoming a cadet on July 1, 1932. Vincent graduated on June 12, 1936, and became a second lieutenant. Vincent transferred to the Air Corps and took primary flight training at Randolph Field in Texas, about from his parents back home. In January 1937, during his primary training, his mother died in Natchez at the age of 65. Following primary, Vincent took the attack course in advanced flying at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas. During a dance held at the officer's club, he met Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Hennessey, a young woman with an infant daughter, and fell in love.McClure, 1975, p. 15 In November 1937, he was posted operations officer for the 19th Pursuit Squadron at Wheeler Field near Pearl Harbor. Hennessey traveled to Hawaii to be with him, and on February 10, 1938, they married‚Äîthe couple celebrated the birth of a daughter named Thayer on December 17. The young father rose in rank to first lieutenant in June 1939, then was promoted to captain on October 7, 1940. In November 1940, Vincent transferred to the newly formed 35th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field in Northern California where he served as squadron commander. The Group trained in several fighter aircraft types, including Seversky P-35s, P-36 Hawks, P-39 Airacobras and P-40 Warhawks. Vincent advanced to group operations officer, then executive officer, then in December 1941 was made group commander. On December 5, two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Vincent's wife pinned the gold leaves of a major on his shoulders. That evening, the 35th Pursuit Group shipped out for overseas duty in Manila, to join the group's 21st and 34th Squadrons already there.McClure, 1975, pp. 16‚Äì18 The next day Peggy Vincent began to drive her two daughters to San Antonio to be with family. On December 7 when Hawaii was attacked by Japanese naval forces, the unarmed ship carrying Vincent, traveling with no escort, was ordered to return immediately to San Francisco Bay. Vincent remained in California for another month, joined by his wife and daughter, during which time he learned that Manila had fallen, and that fellow Group pilot Sam Marrett, a friend from West Point, had died in its defense. On January 12, 1942, the USS Mariposa sailed in convoy with Vincent aboard, headed for the Far East. China Vincent arrived in Melbourne, Australia, in early February, then sailed in a different convoy to Perth. In March, he sailed to Karachi, India, and was posted to Karachi American Air Base, one of the more distant ports that supplied The Hump. There, Vincent served as Director of Pursuit Training for the Tenth Air Force at the rank of lieutenant colonel. Wishing for a combat post, in November 1942 he was ordered by Clayton Bissell, commander Tenth Air Force, to transfer to China to join General Claire Chennault and his China Air Task Force (CATF), a group formed from the Flying Tigers. Bissell's orders specified Vincent take the position of Chennault's executive officer, to apply a dose of West Point regimen to the haphazard CATF paperwork, but Chennault, irked at this maneuver by his distant superior, instead assigned Vincent operations officer.McClure, 1975, pp. 53‚Äì57 Three days into the new job, Vincent wrote in his diary, \\"Any similarity between the China Air Task Force and a military organization is purely accidental.\\" He observed that administrative procedures were poor. \\"...the Group just runs by itself. All Colonel Scott (Robert Lee Scott, Jr.) cares about is fighting‚Äîand he is good at that!\\" Vincent cared little what title he served under‚Äîhe just wanted to fly in combat. After instituting procedural changes regarding the format of official reports originating from CATF, he assigned himself his first air combat flight on November 22, escorting bombers against the harbor of Haiphong on the coast of French Indochina, during which he dropped a bomb from his fighter into the harbor's dock area. Five days later, he scored his first aerial victory: a fixed-undercarriage Japanese fighter he encountered during an attack on Canton in which 10 B-25s and 22 P-40s downed some 16 to 22 enemy aircraft. Vincent noted that he was effectively serving three desk jobs‚ÄîExec', 'Intelligence', and 'Operations‚Äîbut that Chennault was pleased to find his new administrator a skilled pilot eager to fight. In the final weeks of 1942, the CATF was often grounded by bad weather. Vincent flew combat in Peggy I on December 12, but two days later he was ordered by Chennault, at Bissell's insistence, to refrain from flying a mission he had planned.McClure, 1975, pp. 58‚Äì69 Another pilot took Peggy I on that mission but belly-landed the aircraft on a road. Vincent borrowed a different aircraft to fly reconnaissance missions on December 17 and 19, but stayed on the ground again during a short visit by Bissell, to satisfy his expectations. General Joseph Stilwell flew in on December 22 to award Chennault the Distinguished Service Medal, and to take him to Chungking, the provisional wartime capital of China. Left in charge of CATF for the rest of December, Vincent led the combat missions he put together. On December 24 he was awarded the Silver Star for his combat performance.CBI Roundup, Volume I, Number 17, January 7, 1943. \\"DFCs, Silver Stars, Purple Heart Given.\\" Retrieved on November 18, 2009.

On January 24, Albert \\"Ajax\\" Baumler flew a captured and repaired Mitsubishi A6M Zero from Kweilin, and Vincent put it through its paces to become one of only five pilots in the \\"Zero Club\\"‚ÄîChina-based U.S. pilots who test-flew this particular aircraft. Starved of fuel and supplies in February, the CATF mounted few missions; during the same period, Commanding General of the USAAF Henry H.

Colonel \\"Casey\\" Vincent meets with cartoonist Milton Caniff in 1943 Meanwhile, back home in San Antonio, Texas in early 1943, Peggy Vincent wrote to cartoonist Milton Caniff to tell him that her husband was working under Chennault in China, much like the characters in Caniff's comic strip Terry and the Pirates. Peggy Vincent sent Caniff photographs of her husband and told the cartoonist about his flying exploits. Caniff worked the flier into his comic strip as \\"Colonel Vince Casey\\" around March 1943. In September and October 1943, Vincent was rotated back home on leave during which he met Caniff. Nine months after the visit, a second daughter was born to the Vincents, named Patricia.McClure, 1975, p. 173 Upon his return to CBI, Vincent was informed that reconnaissance flights over Formosa (Taiwan) showed a growing concentration of Japanese aircraft. To Vincent, they appeared vulnerable to attack from advance bases, so he and Hill planned a long-range mission. On Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1943, Vincent sent Hill in command of a mixed force of eight early Allison-engined P-51 Mustangs, eight P-38 Lightnings and fourteen B-25 Mitchells against 100 bombers and 112 fighters at Hsinchu Air Base‚Äîthe attackers destroyed 15 of 20 defending fighters as well as 27 enemy bombers on the ground without loss to themselves.Samson, 2005, p. 203. Four days later flying escort to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, Vincent led the 23d Fighter Group against Tien Ho airdrome at Canton‚Äîthe group shot down 13 of 20 defending fighters.Samson, 2005, p. 195. The Formosa attack was one of the most devastating in the CBI Theater‚Äîit catalyzed the Japanese to lay plans to invade and seize the advance airfields Vincent had developed in east China. These plans became one of the two primary goals of Operation Ichi-Go, Japan's 1944 invasion of east China. Vincent receives from Major General Claire Chennault the oak leaf cluster to his Air Medal in December 1944 As an expansion of the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon, the 68th Composite Wing was formed in December 1943. Vincent commanded the 68th for its first year. The mixed unit was composed of fighters, fighter bombers and medium bombers, flown by both American and Chinese airmen. Vincent flew a B-25 Mitchell bomber to lead his men in some of the bombing raids. More than 500,000 tons of Japanese shipping were sunk by Vincent's airmen, and the Japanese air power was greatly reduced south of the Yangtze River.White, Thunder Out of China, pp. 156‚Äì157. On June 2, 1944, Vincent was promoted to temporary brigadier general, the second youngest general officer in the USAAF. It had taken him only seven years to rise from second lieutenant to general. An article about the meteoric rise of young military officers was printed in Time on June 19, 1944. Among other officers mentioned, Vincent was described as tall, , a six-kill ace and the prototype for the cartoon character Vince Casey. Of Vincent, Caniff said that he \\"picked his brain\\" about living and fighting conditions in China. Vincent commanded the 68th Composite Group with Tex Hill as his deputy during the whole of the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go of 1944. The Americans in their advance bases were thrown on the defensive. In late June, Vincent ordered the evacuation of the base built at Hengyang, destroying it with explosives so that the Japanese could not make use of the buildings or the airstrip.Cornelius, 2005, pp. 424‚Äì425. Directly afterward, Vincent was called to attend a formal dinner with American and Chinese generals and ambassadors, honoring Vice President Henry A. Wallace who was on a fact-finding mission. Meeting after dinner in his office, Vincent told Wallace \\"the unvarnished truth‚Äîthat, barring a miracle, the Japanese will have all of east China by July 15!\\"Samson, 2005, p. 236. Japanese supply problems in east China were as critical as American ones, and the Japanese advance was slowed until September when Vincent was forced to retreat and destroy his advance base at Tanchuk. The same treatment befell his own headquarters at Kweilin in October. As he circled Kweilin one final time in his command B-25, he said to Time magazine writer Theodore H. White (who was evacuating as well), \\"I'm going to write a book about this campaign. I'm going to call it Fire and Fall Back.\\"White, Thunder Out of China, p. 184. A month later, Vincent's HQ, relocated to Liuchow, was abandoned, with the 68th retreating to the 14th Air Force stronghold at Kunming.Cornelius, 2005, p. 456. On December 13, 1944, both Hill and Vincent completed their tours of duty and left China, Vincent to command the 30th Training Wing at Turner Field in Georgia. Postwar career In 1946, Vincent reverted to the permanent rank of captain and began teaching at the Air War College. During this time, the United States Air Force (USAF) was formed from the USAAF. From 1949 to 1955, Vincent rose in rank, reaching temporary brigadier general once again in 1951. A son was born to him, named Clinton D. Vincent, Jr., nicknamed Casey Junior.McClure, 1975, p. 218 In 1951 Caniff, who started a new comic strip entitled Steve Canyon four years earlier, used Vincent as a model for a new character, this time making him the youthful \\"Brigadier General P.G. 'Shanty' Town\\". Caniff made General Town into a hard-working peacetime general, concerned with the defense of America. The first EC-121 Warning Star radar search aircraft In 1953, Vincent was placed second in command under Major General Walter E. Todd, Commander Western Air Defense Force. Todd's station was at Hamilton Air Force Base near San Francisco. As Vice Commander, Vincent took an active role in defense developments such as the EC-121 Warning Star, a large radar-equipped aircraft that held a rotating crew of 31 for extended flights, used to detect the approach of enemy aircraft and to coordinate fighter interception. Vincent held the position until mid-1955.United States Civil Service Commission. Official Register of the United States, 1955, p. 222. May 1, 1955. Death and legacy In 1955, Vincent was ordered to Ent Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado where he was to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations of the Continental Air Command. On July 5 at the age of 40, after one full day at his new post, Vincent went to bed at his residence on the air base and died of a heart attack in his sleep. His wife, three daughters and one son were still at their residence on Hamilton AFB in California, preparing to move, when they received word.McClure, 1975, p. 219 Caniff responded to the tragic news by having his character General Town die from overwork.

It is significant as it allows the diversification of Turkmenistan's gas export routes, doubling the nation's export of gas to Iran. For Iran, the pipeline allows the country to deal with gas shortages in its northern regions, and to improve its reputation as a trade partner in the Caspian region. Gas began pumping on 3 January 2010, and the pipeline was inaugurated in a ceremony in Turkmenistan on 6 January 2010. History and inauguration The decision to build the pipeline was made in July 2009. The pipeline was completed in October 2009, and was inaugurated on 6 January 2010, by presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow at a ceremony held at the border village of Salyp Yar, Serakhs in Ahal Province, Turkmenistan. At the inauguration, Ahmadinejad said, \\"These two are not just economic projects, but are indications of the two nations' profound bonds and interest as well as the two countries' fair relations in the region ... This pipeline will be a good stimulus for energy co-operation between Turkmenistan and Iran, as well as for delivery of Turkmen gas to the Persian Gulf and the world market.\\" The ceremony was also attended by Taner Yƒ±ldƒ±z, the minister of energy and natural resources of Turkey, and Ahmed Mohammed Ali Al-Madani, president of the Islamic Development Bank.

It runs to Sarakhs, where it crosses the Iran‚ÄìTurkmenistan border. From there, the long section transports gas to the Shahid Hasheminejad (Khangiran) Gas Refinery in Khangiran, Khorasan Province. Later the pipeline will be extended to Sangbast area. The pipeline has an initial capacity of 6 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year, which later will be increased up to 12 bcm. Combined with the other, smaller, Turkmenistan‚ÄìIran pipeline, the Korpezhe‚ÄìKurt Kui pipeline, Turkmenistan will have the capacity to transport up to 20 bcm of gas.

It is a hydrocarbon with formula C5H6 or C2(CH2)3. The molecular structure consists of three rings of three carbon atoms each, sharing one C‚ÄìC bond. [1.1.1]Propellane is a highly strained molecule. The bonds of the two central carbon atoms have an inverted tetrahedral geometry, and the length of the central bond is 160 pm. The strength of that bond is disputed; estimates vary from 59‚Äì65 kcal/mol to no strength at all. The energy of the biradical state (with no central bond at all) is calculated to be 80 kcal/mol higher. At 114 ¬∞C it will spontaneously isomerize to 3-methylidenecyclobutene with a half-life of 5 minutes. Its strain energy is estimated to be 102 kcal/mol (427 kJ/mol). Surprisingly, [1.1.1]propellane is persistent at room temperature and is somewhat less susceptible to thermal decomposition than the less strained (90 kcal/mol) [2.2.2]propellane system, which has an estimated half-life of only about 1 h at 25 ¬∞C. This unusual stability is attributed to delocalisation of electron density from the bond between the central carbon atoms onto the bridging carbon atoms. The type of bonding in this molecule has been explained in terms of charge-shift bonding. Synthesis [1.1.1]Propellane was first reported by K. Wiberg and F. Walker in 1982. The synthesis commences with cyclopropanation of 1,1-bis(chloromethyl)ethylene, according to the following scheme: :Scheme 1. Synthesis of [1.1.1]propellane Synthesis begins with conversion of the 1,3-di- carboxylic acid of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane 1 in a Hunsdiecker reaction to the corresponding dibromide 2 followed by a coupling reaction with n-butyllithium. The final product 3 was isolated by column chromatography at ‚àí30 ¬∞C. However, a much simplified synthesis was published by Szeimies. It starts with dibromocarbene addition to the alkene bond of 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)propene 6 followed by deprotonation by methyllithium and nucleophilic displacements in 7 not isolated but kept in solution at ‚àí196 ¬∞C. Reactions  Acetic acid addition  [1.1.1]Propellane spontaneously reacts with acetic acid to yield a methylidenecyclobutane ester (4 above).  Polymerization  [1.1.1]Propellane undergoes a polymerization reaction where the central C‚ÄìC bond is split and connected to adjacent monomer units, resulting the so-called staffanes. :Scheme 2. Synthesis of [n]staffane. A radical polymerization initiated by methyl formate and benzoyl peroxide results in a distribution of oligomers. An anionic addition polymerization with n-butyllithium results in a fully polymerized product. X-ray diffraction of the polymer shows that the connecting C‚ÄìC bonds have bond lengths of only 148 pm. The compound 1,3-dehydroadamantane, which can be viewed as a bridged [1.3.3]propellane, also polymerizes in a similar way.

(2007), pp. 375‚Äì403 The concept was first proposed by Johndan Johnson-Eilola (author of Datacloud) and Stuart Selber in the journal Computers & Composition in 2007. The notion of assemblages builds on remix and remix practices, which blur distinctions between invented and borrowed work. This idea predates modernism, with the quote by Edgar Allan Poe, \\"There is no greater mistake than the supposition that a true originality is a mere matter of impulse or inspiration. To originate, is carefully, patiently, and understandingly to combine.\\" https://www.eapoe.org/works/harrison/jah14e05.htm In composition Johnson- Eilola and Selber write that assemblage is influenced by intertextuality and postmodernism. The authors discuss the intertextual nature of writing and assert that participation in existing discourse necessarily means that composition cannot occur separate from that discourse. They state that \\"productive participation involves appropriation and re-appropriation of the familiar\\" in a manner that conforms to existing discourse and audience expectations. In reference to intertextuality, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite The Social Life of Information by John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid.Brown, John Seely, & Duguid, Paul. (2000). The social life of information. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press. In this book Brown and Duguid state that the meaning of and use for a text is directly influenced both by its source texts and the broader textual context in which it participates. Building upon this notion, Johnson-Eilola and Selber position assemblage as a style of composition situated within postmodernism. They state that \\"in a general sense, postmodern theories, and following them, cultural studies, offer a useful way of understanding assemblages (and the related process of remixing) as simultaneously social and textual structures.\\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber suggest that texts should always be treated as assemblages since composition is often highly intertextual. Johnson-Eilola and Selber believe that composition should be undertaken as a problem solving activity rather than a demonstration of original ideas. They write that \\"writing situations are, at base, problem-solving situations in one way or another,\\" and offer assemblage as a form of problem solving that can be used alongside the creation of original text. Michael J. Michaud writes that \\"assemblages are ubiquitous in contemporary workplaces\\" where problem solving is paramount because assemblage allows authors to \\"meet discursive needs and to get work done.\\"Michaud, Michael J, The 'Reverse Commute: Adult Students and the Transition from Professional to Academic Literacy, Teaching English in the Two Year College, Vol. 38, No. 4. (2011), pp. 244‚Äì257. He further argues that students with workplace experience often transfer assemblage writing into the composition classroom. Assemblage allows such authors to alter existing texts and combine them with original work in order to meet the demands of a writing situation or problem. Assemblage and remix The idea of assemblages is closely tied to the practice of remix. Remix, originally referring to a reworked song, has been extended to describe any significant alteration of media, most commonly film and literature. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that remix \\"can aid invention, leverage intellectual and physical resources, and dramatize the social dimensions of composing.\\" However, they also recognize that \\"remixing as a form of composition inhabits a contested terrain of creativity, intellectual property, authorship, corporate ownership, and power.\\" While the practice of remixing is often marked by legal issues, the authors acknowledge that remix is nevertheless becoming an increasingly common creative form. While assemblage is closely tied to remix, there are distinctions between the two. In discussing models of writing, Liane Robertson, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey describe remix models of writing as \\"prior knowledge revised synthetically to incorporate new concepts and practices into the prior model of writing.\\"Robertson, Liane, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey, Notes Towards a Theory of Prior Knowledge and Its Role in College Composers' Transfer of Knowledge and Practice, Composition Forum, Vol. 26. (2012), np. http://compositionforum.com/issue/26/prior-knowledge-transfer.php In contrast, they define assemblage models as ‚Äúgrafting...isolated ‚Äòbits‚Äô of learning onto [a] prior structure without either recognition of differences between prior and current writing conceptions and tasks or synthesis of them.\\" While a remix is a synthesis or incorporation of elements, an assemblage is a combination in which there are recognizable boundaries between elements. Assemblage and remix are also related to articulation. The sociological practice of articulation, as described by Antonio Gramsci and Stuart Hall, among others, refers to the appropriation of elements of culture by various social groups.Hall, Stuart. (1986). On postmodernism and articulation: An interview with Stuart Hall (Lawrence Grossberg, Ed.) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 5, 35‚Äì60. Rpt. in Stuart Hall: Critical dialogues in cultural studies. (1996). David Morley & Kuan-Hsing Chen (Eds.). London: Routledge. Johnson-Eilola and Selber connect assemblage, remix, and articulation as examples of meaning being situated in a specific material and social context. Assemblage and plagiarism A central characteristic of assemblages is the challenge to established notions of originality. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that the traditional distinction between original and plagiarized work is that original work is superior in terms of creative effort and is not derivative. They further assert that such a distinction is based upon outdated notions of \\"the lone genius\\" and is no longer practical in an academic setting. While they concede that \\"teachers no longer evaluate writing completely as an isolated, decontextualized artifact,\\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber maintain \\"at least one set of social forces suggests to students that using citations and quotations from source materials will be valued less than their own original text, a situation that may encourage them to conceal their sources.\\" While the current system of academic evaluation allows, and actually calls, for citation of source materials, Johnson-Eilola and Selber find that the placement of value on original work encourages students to hide sources in an attempt to demonstrate original thought. The emphasis on original work, according to Johnson-Eilola and Selber, may actually contribute to plagiarism. The authors believe that the emphasis on original work is unnecessary because \\"rhetorical purposes can be addressed in context by either original or borrowed/quoted texts without a hierarchy of distinction between the two.\\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber assert that despite shifting attitudes in academia, work produced by students at the scholastic and collegiate level is still evaluated in terms of its originality. They find fault with the current evaluative process for two reasons. First, the authors find that evaluating students for their originality is \\"increasingly unrealistic in our postmodern age\\" as this method is based on antiquated ideas of creativity. Second, they treat the idea of isolating a student's unique composition from the inspiring source materials as unrealistic and futile. For Johnson-Eilola and Selber, the ability to effectively contribute to academic or social discourse is what makes an assemblage valuable, not its \\"originality.\\" Rather than claiming originality is not to be valued, the authors see it as fundamentally problematic and misleading as an evaluative concept. They suggest that academic evaluation be reconsidered with a new emphasis on affect: \\"What if the 'final' product a student produces‚Äîa text‚Äîis not concerned with original words or images on a page or screen but concerned primarily with assemblages of parts? Importantly, in this reconception, the assemblages do not distinguish primarily between which parts are supposed to be original and which have been found and gathered from someplace else; assemblages are interested in what works, what has social effects.\\" In this model, the role of intertextuality is recognized as central to the composition of \\"new\\" material. In support for their argument against the traditional view of plagiarism, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite current critiques from other scholars. They refer to Price, who argued that plagiarism cannot be defined as a single concept, but is dependent upon the cultural practice and conventions in a given situation.Price, Margaret. (2002). Beyond ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô: Situating plagiarism in policy and pedagogy. College Composition and Communication, 54, 88‚Äì115. They also acknowledge a presentation given by James Porter in 2006 at CCCC. In his presentation Porter described how plagiarism is sometimes encouraged in the academic community, offering examples of \\"ways teachers plagiarize all the time‚Äîamong them, sharing syllabi (with plagiarized plagiarism statements!), using boilerplate text for administrative documents, and failing to acknowledge the bibliographic work of others.\\"Porter, James E. (2006). Forget plagiarism, teach filesharing and fair use. Paper presented at the convention of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, Chicago, IL. Johnson-Eilola and Selber also refer to a 1993 article by Rebecca Moore Howard on \\"patchwriting,\\" which describes a technique used by new authors. Patchwriting \\"involves copying from a source text then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-to-one synonym- substitutes.\\"Howard, Rebecca Moore. (2000). Sexuality, textuality: The cultural work of plagiarism. College English, 62, 37‚Äì55 This technique can traditionally be viewed as a form of plagiarism, but it is also considered useful for learning how to communicate within expert discourse. Johson-Eilola and Selber reference patchwriting in an attempt to demonstrate the practical uses of otherwise \\"plagiaristic\\" practices, not to establish a connection between patchwriting and assemblage. While patchwriting can be a useful learning tool, it is completely distinct from assemblage. Assemblage is more than the systematic replacement of like terms and is closer to the artistic style of collage. Examples Paradox, a cut up collage assembled from words and phrases cut from magazines and glued together to form a picture of Abraham Lincoln being assassinated at Ford's Theater.

He has been involved in the design of some nightclubs, with the majority of his completed projects being UK based. Dave Parry lives between New Delhi, India and London, UK, where he owns and runs his own company Most Technical, which provides a design and specification service for nightclub design and production. Dave Parry's work is primarily driven by the desire to link all of the club elements into one complete experience (sound, lighting, video and body kinetic dancefloor). He has found similarities in his artistic goals as famous Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky, who was also driven by an interest in how the experience of various types of art could have the power to collectively affect all of the human senses. Early Life and beginning career Dave Parry first started work in UK club venues by controlling the famous lighting rig at seminal rave spot The Camden Palace (now called Koko (venue)) in 1982, later citing it as the 'best lighting rig he'd ever worked with'. Soon after, at Ministry of Sound, he was taken on by Hector Dewar around the time he had just formed his lighting and sound design company, \\"Most Technical\\". It was here Parry designed his original and award winning lighting scheme. During his time working here he formed a bond with Dave Hayden from Outboard Electronics, whom he would later go on to work with on the design of one of the world's most advanced night clubbing arenas, matter. As well as the bigger projects he is most famous for, he also designed Rehab in Leeds for Chris Edwards and worked with Mike Greive and Paul Crawford to design the Sub Club in Glasgow. European venues Through his work at major UK clubs such Fabric (club), Ministry of Sound and more recently matter as well as India's first superclub, Elevate in New Delhi, he has made a career from bringing nightclubbing into the realms of a full blown sensory experience. At fabric Dave Parry worked closely with owner Keith Reilly to ensure that the club could offer visitors something they'd never experienced before. The most notable developments Dave introduced was the first body kinetic dance floor (which became an infamous feature of the venue) as well as a timax 3d sound system. The club was since voted the best club in the world for 9 years running. At matter matter Dave worked alongside Dave Green, owner of Pixel Addicts, where together they brought pixel mapping (tiling and texture mapping of images) to the venue. matter also boasts a 75,000W BodyKinetic dancefloor from Djenerate, Martin Audio and Void Acoustics sound systems and master control via an Avolites desk. Dave also pioneered the sound and lighting system at Wagg Club in Paris, which is restaurateur Terence Conran's first club, found under his Paris-based restaurant Alcazar. Current projects His skills in sound and lighting design have taken him to India, where he has set up Most Technical India. Dave pioneered lighting and sound design at Elevate in New Delhi, India's first super club. Few years later Shroom, Agni, Kitty Su followed. In December 2011, Dave worked alongside Blacksheep Design on Liverpool's newest club: The Playground featured in the E4 reality serie 'Desperate Scousewife'. Personal life Dave Parry lives with his longtime girlfriend in UK after having spent a year in New Delhi, India. He is also a regular on the growing social society and party scene in India. Accolades Dave Parry's light and sound design work has attracted him media attention - including being featured in The Face (magazine), The Sunday Times Magazine, The Daily Telegraph. He was also featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World program talking about the world beating sound system he designed at fabric. Elevate has been voted best nightclub by the [2] 5 years in a row. in 2009 Night Magazine declared Dave Parry to be the most important club innovator of the decade. Night Magazine have also awarded B.E.D.A awards to every nightclub Dave Parry has designed.

In Britain, the Primitive Methodist Church always allowed the ordination of women. In Britain the Primitive Methodist Church had full equal roles for men and women, but the Wesleyan Methodist Church only ordained its first deaconess in 1890, and after Methodist Union, the Methodist Church only started to ordain women again in 1974. Today some Methodist denominations practice the ordination of women, such as in the American United Methodist Church (UMC), in which the ordination of women has occurred since its creation in 1968, as well as in the American Free Methodist Church (FMC), which ordained its first woman deacon in 1911. In the USA the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, which ordained its first female elder in 1853, as well as the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, which has always ordained women to the presbyterate and diaconate. Other Methodist denominations do not ordain women, such as the Southern Methodist Church (SMC), Evangelical Methodist Church of America, Fundamental Methodist Conference, Evangelical Wesleyan Church, and Primitive Methodist Church (PMC), the latter two of which do not ordain women as elders nor do they license them as pastors or local preachers; the EWC and PMC do, however, consecrate women as deaconesses. Independent Methodist parishes that are registered with the Association of Independent Methodists do not permit the ordination of women to holy orders. Some of the groups that later became part of the United Methodist Church started ordaining women in the late 19th century, but the largest group, the Methodist Church, did not grant women full clergy rights until 1956. History John Wesley's views on women Mary Bosanquet Fletcher, who convinced John Wesley to allow all women to preach in Methodism John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, was the first within his movement to authorize a woman to preach. In 1761, he granted a license to preach to Sarah Crosby. Mary Bosanquet was responsible for Wesley formally allowing all women to preach. In the summer of 1771, Bosanquet wrote to John Wesley to defend hers and Crosby's work preaching at her orphanage, Cross Hall. Bosanquet's letter to Wesley is considered to be the first full and true defense of women's preaching in Methodism. Her argument was that women should be able to preach when they experienced an \\"extraordinary call\\", or when given permission by God. Wesley accepted this idea, and formally began to allow women to preach in Methodism. Later, Wesley also licensed other women as preachers, including Grace Murray, Sarah Taft, Hannah Ball and Elizabeth Ritchie. Wesley's appreciation for the importance of women in the church has been credited to his mother, Susanna Wesley. It is said that she instilled in him, and in his brother Charles Wesley, a fellow preacher in the movement, a deep appreciation for the intellectual and spiritual qualities of women. Susanna Wesley and other women in the early Methodist movement helped to evangelize and were active members in Methodist activities ranging from band classes to raising funds for the continuation of Methodism and managing educational institutions. John Wesley's views on women can be found in his 1786 sermon \\"On Visiting the Sick\\". In the sermon, he attacks the requirement of submissiveness that was often imposed on women of the time: Previous to this sermon, John Wesley had also removed the word \\"obey\\" from the marriage rite he sent to North America in 1784.World Methodist Book, Page 218 Methodism After John Wesley's death in 1791, several splits happened within the Methodist movement. The Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1828 and, later in 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South split, leaving a separate Methodist Episcopal Church of the north. The Methodist Episcopal Church previously saw schism, with the departure of some individuals in 1841 resulting in the formation of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, out of which the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches was created in 1968. The Methodist Episcopal Church, South also gave rise to other denominations that split from it, such as the Congregational Methodist Church in 1852 and the Southern Methodist Church in 1940. Anna Oliver Wesley's death also marked a shift in the view on women in the church. Some denominations continued to officially sanction the status of women. In 1866, for example, Helenor Davidson was a circuit rider for the Methodist Protestant Church in Jasper County, Indiana. She later became the first ordained minister of any Methodist denomination. Starting at the end of the 19th century, the Methodist Protestant Church had not only begun to ordain women, but had also granted them full rights as clergy. This was not the case for all denominations. During the next decades, the Methodist Episcopal Church reversed many practices, and publicly emphasized the domestic role of women, refusing to acknowledge their more public role as church leaders and preachers. In 1880, despite support from the Alumni of the Theological School of Boston University, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church refused to ordain many of the female graduates. Some of the reasons given for this refusal were: # Theological objections that interpreted First Corinthians 14:34‚Äì35 to mean that women should be silent in church.http://www.WomenInMinistryEpilogue.com # Socio- cultural objections including the status of both white women and women of color in Western society, the home and workplace # Church politics, when Bishop Edward G. Andrews of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church of New England said ordination of women was \\"unlawful.\\" In his opinion, the law of the church did not authorize the ordination of women.Kenneth Cracknell and Susan J. White, An Introduction to World Methodism, Cambridge Press University, 2005, p. 218‚Äì219 It was for the latter reason that Anna Oliver was not ordained in 1880 despite the fact she had graduated from Boston University School of Theology in 1876, and had served two churches with obvious success. In response, Anna Oliver and her supporters lobbied the General Conference to have all distinctions on the basis of gender removed from the Book of Discipline regarding status for ordination. Anna Oliver prepared pamphlets in which she outlined the reasons to remove the gender basis for ordination; such as the natural gifts and fruit of women to pastor, the sacramental needs of the mission field, the demands of charity, the Golden Rule and appeals to what John Wesley would do. In response, the General Conference not only denied the motion to remove the gender basis from ordination in the Book of Discipline, they revoked the licenses to preach of all those women who currently held them.An Introduction to World Methodism; p. 219 Anna Shaw Two years later, Anna Howard Shaw, who received her theological degree in 1878, was denied ordination on the grounds that \\"there is no place for women in the ordained ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\\" She left the church and was ordained in the Methodist Protestant Church that same year. She later went to be an activist in women's suffrage, and it was due in large part to her leadership that women were eventually granted the right to vote. Margaret Newton Van Cott, an American Methodist preacher born in 1830, devoted her life to evangelism and holding revival meetings across the country. In 1924 The Methodist Episcopal Church granted women the right to be ordained as local deacons and elders. In 1939, the Methodist Protestant Church (with the exception of the Mississippi Conference that continued the Methodist Protestant Church), the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South merged, forming the Methodist Church. In the Methodist Church, women from the Methodist Episcopal Church- South gained the right to ordination, while the Methodist Protestant women gave up full clergy rights in the merger. The politics used to justify this were said to be that the new denomination already faced sufficient problems. The Louisiana Conference, for example, had five women who had recently been ordained, Fern Cook, Nettie Mae Cook, Lea Joyner, Elaine Willett, and Anna Ruth Nuttall. The newly formed Methodist Church recognized their ordination and accepted them into the conference, yet offered only a few actual appointments. By 1945, only 3 remained in the conference. One of these women, Lea Joyner, was never given an official appointment. She was told, \\"no church will have you.\\" She was given a vacant lot and $5,000 and told to start her own church in Monroe, Louisiana. When she died in 1985, she held the distinction of having the longest pastorate in the Louisiana conference, and the largest Methodist church in the world pastored by a woman. The church she started in 1952 had over 2,200 members.http://www.iscuo.org.clergy.women.htm In 1942, the Fundamental Methodist Conference split from the Methodist Church and it does not ordain women. The Evangelical Methodist Church split from the Methodist Church in 1945 and does ordain women as elders. On May 4, 1956, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the General Conference of the Methodist Church approved full clergy rights for women. This was done by adding one sentence to the Book of Discipline: \\"All foregoing paragraphs, chapters and sections of Part III [of the Book of Discipline] shall apply to women as well as to men.\\" Bishops were now required to appoint every pastor in good standing, regardless of gender. Maud Jensen was the first woman to be granted full clergy rights after this decision, in what is now the Central Pennsylvania Annual Conference.http://www.religioustolerance.org.femclrg1.htm Grace Huck was another woman accepted into probationary status as part of this historic vote, and she was received into full connection in 1958. She recalls the resistance to her ministry by a male member of her church in one of her early appointments. She has been quoted as saying that when the district superintendent told the congregation he was appointing a woman minister, one man shouted, \\"there will be no skirts in this pulpit while I'm alive.\\" She also noted that he later became one of her best supporters. Evangelical United Brethren Church The Church of the United Brethren in Christ started ordaining women with full clergy rights in 1889. In 1946, the Church of the United Brethren in Christ united with Evangelical Church to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Evangelical Church had never ordained women. The Bishops from both churches agreed to not ordain women in the newly formed church, but there was never a vote on it at annual conference. Many churches continued to ordain women with full clergy rights.http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp Denominational positions - UK Primitive Methodist Church The original Primitive Methodist Church in Britain allowed female preachers and ministers until Methodist Union in 1932, and also those Primitive Methodist churches which did not join the Union. Wesleyan Methodist Church As late as 1890, women were first ordained as deaconesses in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Methodist Church of Great Britain In On 2 July 1974, the Methodist Conference in Bristol ordained 17 women as presbyters (ministers). The number of women ministers has grown to roughly equal male ministers. In 1993, Kathleen Richardson was the first woman to be elected President of the Methodist Conference (leader of the Methodist Church in Britain). Current denominational positions - USA Primitive Methodist Church Although the original Primitive Methodist Church in Britain allowed female preachers and ministers, the current American branch of the Primitive Methodist Church does not ordain women as elders nor does it license them as pastors or local preachers; the PMC does, however, consecrate women as deaconesses. Free Methodist Church In 1861, the American Free Methodist Church reported the fact that women served as preachers and in 1864, the General Conference of the Free Methodist Church created a class of lay non-pastoral ministers known as evangelists, who were both men and women. In 1911, the Free Methodist Church started ordaining women as deacons and in 1974, the FMC started ordaining women as elders. United Methodist Church In 1968, when the worldwide United Methodist Church was formed from the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, Methodist women clergy were afforded the right of full connection. In 1980, the first woman, Marjorie Matthews, was elected and consecrated as a bishop within the United Methodist Church. In 1984, the first African-American woman, Leontine T. Kelly was elected and consecrated as a bishop.United Methodist Bishop Firsts In 2005, Rosemarie Wenner was the first woman to be elected bishop outside the United States. She was elected by the Germany Central Conference. Over 12,000 women serve as United Methodist clergy at all levels, from bishops to local pastors. 16 women had been elected as bishops. To try to address the lack of women of color in faculty positions at United Methodist Seminaries, the Board of Higher Education and Ministry created a scholarship program, which has over 40 participants and more than 22 graduates with doctorate degrees in theology. Evangelical Wesleyan Church The 2015 Discipline of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church stipulates: \\"Women may be received on rial and into full connection and be ordained deacon, on the same conditions as men, provided always that this shall not be regarded as a step toward ordination as elder.\\" Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection In the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, Antoinette Brown was ordained an elder by Luther Lee in 1853, becoming the first woman to receive holy orders in that denomination (then the Wesleyan Methodist Church).

Other publications in the Apex Media stable include the annual, 'Business Directory and Tribute. Apex also does occasional projects such as the Map of Oman, Apex Map of Muscat, The Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque coffee table book etc. Apex Media was founded in 1980 by Omani businessman Saleh Zakwani, who is also the current Executive Chairman of the company. The newspaper celebrated its first anniversary on October 13. Muscat Daily is accessible online at muscatdaily.com. Content Editorial content is generated by an in-house team of reporters and writers in the case of Oman news. International news is sourced from a variety of newswires including The New York Times Syndicate and News Service, BBC, dpa, TMS Features, IANS, Asian News Network. The paper runs crosswords provided by The Guardian. Sections The newspaper is organized in two sections. Section 1 is the main section with 12 pages containing Oman (National) news, Regional and World news, Op-Ed and Sports. Section 2 is 8 pages, and carries Business news, Crosswords, Sudoku puzzles, quiz questions and a Features section. On Wednesdays, TheWeek newspaper is delivered free to Muscat Daily subscribers as weekend reading. Design and style The newspaper which features a bright tulip orange and black theme in a seven column format. The design has received favorable reviews at design workshops run by WAN-IFRA the biggest association of publishers in the world. Muscat Daily is printed at the company's own printing centre on the outskirts of Muscat and also carries out contract printing operations. In February 2010, parent company, then Apex Press and Publishing, announced that they had signed an agreement to purchase a Goss Community SSC Press with a rated speed of 35,000 copies per hour from the American printing press manufacturer. Despite the relative young age of the newspaper, the circulation quickly picked up and the paper went on to become the largest selling English-language daily in the Sultanate of Oman by mid-2010. The main reason quoted by industry analysts for this was the low annual subscription fees of the newspaper in a market which traditionally had fewer than 1,000 residential subscribers for English dailies before the entry of Muscat Daily. An annual subscription to Muscat Daily cost OMR 50 (about $130) compared to the OMR 72 ($186) of competitors likes Times of Oman, Oman Tribune and Oman Daily Observer. Political persuasion overall Muscat Daily has been described by analysts as having a centrist liberal bias on most issues. Overall, the stated mission of the paper and its management is to report and not sensationalise or editorialise matters. Other controversies Muscat Daily has been criticized as being a late entry into the newspaper arena in Oman at a time when newspaper subscriptions are falling in the West. In a scathing critique, Eliott Beer posted on AdNation Middle East's website, \\"Apparently no-one's told the guys in Oman about the demise of traditional print media (it's dead, you know) - some publisher's only gone and started up another newspaper.\\" However, parent company Apex Media says that newspaper circulations are increasing in emerging markets and since the penetration of broadband in Oman is still only about 12% of the total population, it does not see any threat to its print business. Muscat Daily was launched as a direct competitor to other English language dailies in Oman including the Times of Oman, Oman Tribune and the government-run Oman Daily Observer. Muscat Daily in international media The role that Muscat Daily has played in pushing the boundaries of media freedom and censorship in 'the sleepy sultanate' has been recognized by world media, particularly those that work in markets where media freedom is guaranteed. An article in Christian Science Monitor on the protests and media freedom in Oman said: \\"The fact that Oman's first civil unrest in 40 years left at least one person dead in a northern port city here was big news. But it was even bigger news that the English- language Muscat Daily declared \\"Black Sunday in Sohar\\" on its front page and carried a half-page photograph showing smoke filling the sky above a roundabout seized by protesters.\\" The article was subsequently carried in other prominent newspapers and publications across the world including Gulf News, Yahoo News, MinnPost According to an article in The Economist in early March 2011, \\"Newspapers such as the Muscat Daily have begun to cover the protests in a way that would have been unthinkable even a week ago.\\" Among other international media, Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s has quoted Muscat Daily in its coverage of the 2011 Omani protests and the related action by the government and other actors in the 2011 protests. Talking about the reforms instituted by Sultan Qaboos, in the wake of the protests it said: \\"Seg√∫n datos recabados por el Muscat Daily, la medida beneficia a 130.000 ciudadanos, el 73% de todos los que trabajan ese sector.\\" (Translation: According to data compiled by Muscat Daily, the new measures will benefit about 130,000 people or about 73% of those working in the private sector.)

The season was headed by the series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who served as executive producers along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the fictional Colorado mountain town of South Park. The season was the second of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date. Parker was the director and writer for all episodes in the fourteenth season. The season lampooned various topics, including the legalization of medical marijuana and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The season also parodied various cultural touchstones, such as The Catcher in the Rye, Tron, Facebook, Jersey Shore, Hoarders, and Inception. The parody of celebrities, a South Park tradition, continued in the fourteenth season, with depictions of Tiger Woods, Kim, Kourtney and Khlo√© Kardashian, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the devotion of the entire episodes of \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" to past celebrities suing the town of South Park for defamation. The original broadcasts of \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were altered to censor depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, to protect from threats delivered by radical Islamic extremists, which resulted in strong criticism against Comedy Central. The fourteenth season received mixed to positive reviews, with some reviewers deeming it as an important season in the series' history, and others regarding it as progressively weak and stale. The season maintained the average Nielsen rating viewership for the series, around 3 million viewers per episode, with a slight decline in the latter half of the season. The episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were nominated for the 2010 Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). Blackwater spoof To promote the new season, the show aired commercials showing Cartman attempting to purchase 500 Ak-47s.Blackwater‚Äôs South Park DebutYoutube Clip The commercial aired after it was reveled that members of the \\"private security firm Blackwater had diverted hundreds of AK-47s and pistols from a U.S. weapons bunker in Afghanistan to Afghan policemen.

He named the \\"Coon\\" three-parter as a highlight, admitting, \\"The arc wasn't exactly the most hilarious stuff the show has ever produced, but it did have some brilliant ideas that were executed very well.\\" Many other reviewers found the show dipped in consistency during its fourteen season. Slants Kris King gave the season a very mixed review, attributing it to the show's \\"forced social commentary,\\" lamenting, \\"At what point did the creators of South Park stop being the sharp voices of a younger generation and start sounding like ornery parents?\\" Another Slant reviewer, Chris Cabin, commented that \\"the amount of laughs overall has negligibly diminished [...] the show's durability isn't exactly what it used to be.\\" He believed that the fourteenth season stood as a strong display of the technical advancements the show has undergone since its premiere.  Ratings  The fourteenth season of South Park generally maintained the average Nielsen rating viewership for the series, around 3 million viewers per episode, with a slight drop-off in the second half of the season. The season premiere, \\"Sexual Healing\\", was seen in 3.74 million households, the largest audience for South Park since the third season premiere \\"Rainforest Shmainforest\\" in 1999. \\"Sexual Healing\\" proved to be the most-watched episode of the season, and the night of its premiere heralded the highest ratings of the entire year for Comedy Central. The two-part episode \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" also received high ratings (at 3.33 and 3:50 million viewers, respectively), perhaps due in part to their high controversy. \\"Crippled Summer\\", the follow- up episode, featured the second-highest ratings of the season, at 3.55 million viewers. When the series returned for the second half of season fourteen in the fall, \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" received the highest ratings, at 3.25 million viewers. The fourteenth season of South Park received its lowest viewership in the episodes \\"Cr√®me Fraiche\\", seen in 2.49 million households; \\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\", seen in 2.76 million households; and \\"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\\", seen in 2.79 million households. The ratings of \\"Crippled Summer\\" outperformed those of several primetime network shows the evening of its original broadcast.  Controversy  An image of the Muslim prophet Muhammad was shown in the 2001 episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", but was later banned from the 2006 episode \\"Cartoon Wars\\" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers. This contradiction is mocked in the season fourteen episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\". \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" celebrate the series' arrival at two hundred episodes, and, as a result feature a heavy degree of reference to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies. The episodes attempt to feature a depiction of the prophet Muhammed, which Parker and Stone attempted to feature in the season ten (2006) two-parter \\"Cartoon Wars\\", but were censored. Shortly after \\"200\\" original broadcast, the website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they \\"will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\\" Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamic extremist in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. Posted by Zachary Adam Chesser (who preferred to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee), several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat. The following week, \\"201\\" faced a heavy degree of publicity. Before \\"201\\" aired, the New York City Police Department increased security at the Comedy Central headquarters in direct response to the threats. Law enforcement officials said Revolution Muslim itself was \\"all talk\\" and had never engaged in any actual violence but they were concerned that the website post could inspire violence from others. During the episode's first and only broadcast, all references to Muhammad's name were replaced by audio bleeps. Several other portions of dialogue were also censored, including almost the entirety of a monologue spoken by Kyle at the end regarding the moral of the episode (reportedly about \\"intimidation and fear.\\") Muhammad's name appeared in the previous episode, \\"200\\", without any such censorship. Both episodes obscured all images of what was apparently Muhammad with a black \\"CENSORED\\" box. Immediately after the episode \\"201\\" aired, the series website South Park Studios posted a notice that said Comedy Central had inserted \\"numerous additional bleeps throughout the episode\\" after Parker and Stone submitted their final cut to the network. The network later confirmed they were responsible for the audio censorship, as well as obscuring images of Muhammad. \\"201\\" has not aired since its original debut as South Park would usually repeat during the week, and episodes from earlier in the season were shown instead. Although South Park Studios generally makes unexpurgated versions of their episodes immediately available to view, the notice indicated Parker and Stone did not have network approval to show their original version, and thus no version of \\"201\\" could be seen on the website. The Canadian Comedy Network aired \\"201\\" on April 25, 2010, though the episode was censored as the American broadcast was, breaking the network's multi-year practice of airing South Park completely uncensored. In addition, \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" were not broadcast in the Netherlands, or Sweden. The censorship of \\"201\\" brought strong criticism to Comedy Central. Some commentators suggested because Comedy Central responded to Revolution Muslim's warnings by censoring depictions of Muhammad, the Muslim extremists scored a significant public victory. As a result of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, which also resulted in major criticism and controversy. Chesser was arrested in July 2010 after attempting to board a flight to Somalia to join terrorist organization Al-Shabaab, and, in October, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for communicating threats to Parker and Stone, soliciting violent jihadists to desensitize law enforcement, and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. On January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version of \\"201\\" was illegally leaked online without the approval of Comedy Central. The speech at the end was, appropriately, a deadpan statement that making threats is an effective way to get what you want; essentially \\"terrorism works.\\"  Dutch spinoff prank  In February 2010, it was announced that Comedy Central Netherlands would begin airing a live-action spin-off of the show called The Real South Park in April 2010. The show was said to feature a cast of Dutch children reprising the roles of Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, with American actors providing English voice-overs. However, this turned out to be an elaborate April Fools' Day joke, with a Dutch television magazine reporting on the filming of the series in Amsterdam being in on the joke. Broadcast on April 1, it showed a short skit of the four boys traveling to Amsterdam and visiting the red-light district, ending with Kenny being hit and killed by a passing tram. The texts \\"1 april\\" and \\"there is only one real South Park\\" then appeared on screen, after which the first episode of season 14 started.  Award nominations  Episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\", from season fourteen were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010, but lost to the ABC animated Christmas special, Prep & Landing.  Home release  Season fourteen was released by Paramount Home Entertainment in the United States on April 26, 2011 on both DVD (as a three-disc set) and Blu-ray (as a two-disc set). Each set includes all fourteen episodes in 1080p video and Dolby TrueHD, as well as brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The set also includes the season thirteen episode \\"The Coon\\", as a special \\"bonus episode\\". While twelve of the episodes are uncensored, episode \\"200\\" has the image of Muhammad censored, and the controversial episode \\"201\\" is shown in its original broadcast version, preceded by a disclaimer including a statement released by Trey Parker and Matt Stone on April 22, 2010.

Kolmogorov's three-series theorem, combined with Kronecker's lemma, can be used to give a relatively easy proof of the Strong Law of Large Numbers.Durrett, Rick. \\"Probability: Theory and Examples.\\" Duxbury advanced series, Third Edition, Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005, Section 1.8, pp. 60‚Äì69.  Statement of the theorem  Let (X_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} be independent random variables. The random series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty X_n converges almost surely in \\\\mathbb{R} if the following conditions hold for some A > 0, and only if the following conditions hold for any A > 0: , then \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathbb{E}[Y_n], the series of expected values of Y_n, converges.  \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathrm{var}(Y_n) converges. }}  Proof   Sufficiency of conditions (\\"if\\")  Condition (i) and Borel‚ÄìCantelli give that X_n = Y_n for n large, almost surely. Hence \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}X_n converges if and only if \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}Y_n converges. Conditions (ii)-(iii) and Kolmogorov's Two-Series Theorem give the almost sure convergence of \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}Y_n.  Necessity of conditions (\\"only if\\")  Suppose that \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}X_n converges almost surely. Without condition (i), by Borel‚ÄìCantelli there would exist some A > 0 such that \\\\\\\\{X_n \\\\ge A\\\\\\\\} for infinitely many n, almost surely. But then the series would diverge. Therefore, we must have condition (i). We see that condition (iii) implies condition (ii): Kolmogorov's two-series theorem along with condition (i) applied to the case A = 1 gives the convergence of \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}(Y_n - \\\\mathbb{E}[Y_n]). So given the convergence of \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}Y_n, we have \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathbb{E}[Y_n] converges, so condition (ii) is implied. Thus, it only remains to demonstrate the necessity of condition (iii), and we will have obtained the full result. It is equivalent to check condition (iii) for the series \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}Z_n = \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}(Y_n - Y'_n) where for each n, Y_n and Y'_n are IID‚Äîthat is, to employ the assumption that \\\\mathbb{E}[Y_n] = 0, since Z_n is a sequence of random variables bounded by 2, converging almost surely, and with \\\\mathrm{var}(Z_n) = 2\\\\mathrm{var}(Y_n). So we wish to check that if \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}Z_n converges, then \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathrm{var}(Z_n) converges as well. This is a special case of a more general result from martingale theory with summands equal to the increments of a martingale sequence and the same conditions (\\\\mathbb{E}[Z_n] = 0; the series of the variances is converging; and the summands are bounded).Sun, Rongfeng. Lecture notes. http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matsr/ProbI/Lecture4.pdf M. Lo√®ve, \\"Probability theory\\", Princeton Univ. Press (1963) pp. Sect. 16.3W. Feller, \\"An introduction to probability theory and its applications\\", 2, Wiley (1971) pp. Sect. IX.9  Example  As an illustration of the theorem, consider the example of the harmonic series with random signs: : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{n}. Here, \\"\\\\pm\\" means that each term 1/n is taken with a random sign that is either 1 or -1 with respective probabilities 1/2,\\\\ 1/2, and all random signs are chosen independently. Let X_n in the theorem denote a random variable that takes the values 1/n and -1/n with equal probabilities. With A=2 the summands of the first two series are identically zero and var(Yn)=n^{-2}. The conditions of the theorem are then satisfied, so it follows that the harmonic series with random signs converges almost surely. On the other hand, the analogous series of (for example) square root reciprocals with random signs, namely : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}, diverges almost surely, since condition (3) in the theorem is not satisfied. Note that this is different from the behavior of the analogous series with alternating signs, \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^n/\\\\sqrt{n}, which does converge.

Life Born in San Francisco, Charles Upton grew up in Marin County, California. He attended Catholic schools through high school. He attended UC Davis for four days. Career In San Francisco, he met the poet Lew Welch, who became his mentor. Although much younger than most of the Beat poets, Upton's first two volumes of poetry were also published by City Lights. It was associated with many of the earlier Beat poets. After his first two volumes of poems were published, Upton became involved with the Sanctuary Movement for Central American refugees. He produced and distributed a video, Through the Needle‚Äôs Eye, containing testimonies of refugees. In the late 1980s he was briefly involved with the \\"magical populism\\" of the New Age peace movement. He studied group dreamwork and dream networking. In 1988 he joined a traditional Sufi order. Under his wife's influence, Upton became interested in the metaphysics of the Traditionalist or Perennialist School (the followers of Rene Guenon, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon). He continues to be partly identified with this school. His papers are held at University of Connecticut. Activism In 2013 Charles Upton conceived of The Covenants Initiative, based on the book The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World by his colleague Dr. John Andrew Morrow. The Covenants Initiative urges Muslims to abide by the covenants concluded between Muhammad and the Christian communities of his time: http://www.covenantsoftheprophet.com. In November, 2018, The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World was cited at length by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in their decision to acquit the Christian woman Asia Bibi on charges of blasphemy.

He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 5 August 1941. He was the brother of the Hero of the Soviet Union Pyotr Ilyich Lizyukov. Russian Civil War and inter-war years Lizyukov joined the Red Army in April 1919, and fought in the Russian Civil War against the White Guard as an artillery officer. He saw action in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, as well as during the Tambov Rebellion. Between 1924 and 1927 Lizyukov was educated at the Frunze Military Academy, and taught armour tactics courses at KUVNAS. In the 1930s he commanded the 3rd Tank Battalion at Naro-Fominsk in the Moscow Military District. Great Patriotic War Since March 1941, Colonel Lizyukov was the deputy commander of the 17th Mechanized Corps (commanded by Major General M. P. Petrov) of the 36th Tank Division in the Western Special Military District, which became the Western Front on 22 June 1941, and was initially command by General D. G. Pavlov. On 22 June 1941, at the start of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, Lizyukov's 17th Mechanized Corps was stationed near Slonim, and was opposed by the German Army Group Center. Borisov and Smolensk (1941) On 26 June 1941, Colonel Lizyukov arrived in Borisov, where he participated in the defense of the city until 8 July 1941, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for courage and bravery. In early August 1941, after the death of Major General of Tank Forces Ilya Alekseyenko on 2 August 1941, Colonel Lizyukov took command of the remnants of 5th Mechanized Corps, and held open the narrow Solov'evo and Ratchino corridors across the Dnieper river south of Iartsevo during the Battle of Smolensk (1941), allowing elements of the 16th Army and 20th Army to escape encirclement.Glantz (2010), 3842. For courage in action, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, with a Gold Star, on 5 August 1941, along with the Order of Lenin, in lieu of the award of the Order of the Red Banner. In August 1941, Colonel Lizyukov took command of the 1st Moscow Motor Rifle Division, and was assigned the defense of the Vop River northeast of Iartsevo. In early September 1941, this division drove its German enemy from the east side across the river and established a bridgehead, and the division was converted into the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division. Moscow (1941) From 30 September 1941 until 10 October 1941, Colonel Lizyukov's 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division participated in a holding action around the town of Sumy as part of the mechanized cavalry group of the 21st Army, in some of the first action of the First Battle of Kharkov. On 6 October 1941, Southwestern Front decided to attempt to attack into the German right flank, resulting in the collapse of the defensive line and the breakthrough of the German 29th Infantry Division into Sumy on 10 October 1041. The division was subsequently withdrawn into the reserve around Moscow. Now part of 33rd Army, which covered the Naro-Fominsk area southwest of Moscow, the division was tasked with taking the offensive to the south and west of Naro-Fominsk. It ran squarely into elements of the German 4th Army on 22 October 1941, and was pushed back into the city, and was involved in running street battles between 23 and 25 October, losing about 70% of its strength. On 26 October, the division retrenched on the left bank of the Nara River and stopped the German advance. On 28 October, Lizyukov was ordered to assault the city, but was pushed back amidst heavy losses. In November, Colonel Lizyukov was recalled to Moscow, and was replaced by Colonel Timofey Novikov. On November 27, 1941, Colonel Lizyukov was named deputy commander of the newly re-formed 20th Army, under the command of General A. A. Vlasov. The 20th Army was tasked on 2 December 1941 to defend Moscow on the Leningrad highway to the northeast of Moscow, and was ordered to counter-attack against the advancing German troops. On 12 December, a brigade under the command of A. I. Lizyukov liberated Solnechnogorsk. Demyansk Pocket (1942) On 10 January 1942 Colonel Lizyukov was awarded the rank of Major-General, and was appointed commander of the 2nd Guards Rifle Corps, which was assigned to the Northwestern Front in the Kalinin region. 2nd Guards Rifle Corps, along with 1st Guards Rifle Corps, 34th Army, and 1st Shock Army, were tasked with cutting the main communications line of the Leningrad-Volkhov elements of the enemy in the Pskov area. By the end of February 1941, 2nd Guards Rifle Corps had moved from Staraya Russa to the west of the Demyansk Pocket to encircle about 95,000 German troops. Major-General Lizyukov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions. In mid-April 1942 Major-General Lizyukov was ordered to form the 2nd Tank Corps, which was subsequently included in the setup of the 5th Tank Army, and in June 1942, Major-General Lizyukov was appointed its commander. 5th Tank Army was deployed in the Bryansk Front, first in the area south-west of Yelets and then north-west of Yefremov. Battle of Voronezh (1942) During the early stages of the Battle of Voronezh (1942), the command of the Bryansk Front selected 5th Tank Army under Major-General Lizyukov to organize a counter-attack on the flank and rear of the German troops advancing on Voronezh. On 5 July 1942 the army was ordered to immediately break through to the Don River at Voronezh. Given the scattered locations of his corps and the tight schedule of the order, Lizyukov started his movements without the ability to fully concentrate his forces, but sent the 7th Tank Corps on 6 July, followed by the other units on 7 and 10 July 1942. In addition, instead of cutting into the flanks of the enemy, 5th Army faced 24th Panzer Division frontally, as this unit had moved south instead of east in accordance to the planning for Case Blue, and not as expected by the Stavka. By the time the counter-offensive ended, the 5th Tank Army only had 27% of its tanks still operational, and had suffered nearly 8,000 casualties, and Major General Lizyukov was demoted on 15 July 1942 to command the 2nd Tank Corps, after the Stavka disbanded 5th Tank Army. On 23 July 1942 Major General Lizyukov received orders from General Chibisov to locate and to counter-attack with his corps' two tank brigades. He commandeered a KV tank to rescue his two brigades from encirclement, but was immobilized just short of the German prepared defensive positions, and was killed in action.

Work Though his work has been described as crime fiction, including by Jahn himself (\\"It revolved around a crime, so that seemed to be what it was\\"),http://crimesquad.com/fresh-blood.asp?year=2009&month;=11 he has cited writers as diverse as Raymond Carver, Ernest Hemingway, and Stephen King as influences. His first novel, Acts of Violence, takes place over a period of three hours and revolves around the murder of Katrina Marino, a bar manager stabbed in the courtyard outside her apartment block. Her murder is witnessed by several people, none of whom call the police or try to help, as each denies responsibility, an example of the bystander effect. Though inspired by the murder of Catherine Genovese, the case that first spurred research into the diffusion of responsibility, Jahn has said he wasn't interested in writing a didactic work. \\"I didn't want to create symbols; I wanted the story to be inhabited by people.\\"http://crimesquad.com/fresh-blood.asp?year=2009&month;=11 Upon release in 2009 it was both praised as \\"compassionate and authentic,\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/crime-novels-choice- laura-wilson and criticized for containing \\"relentless, near-pornographic brutality,\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/acts-of-violence- ryan-david-jahn though overall critical reception was positive,http://www.list.co.uk/article/21865-ryan-david-jahn-acts-of- violence/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article6912685.ecehttp://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article6895772.ece and it won a Crime Writers' Association John Creasey Dagger for best first novel. Jahn's second novel, Low Life, was released on 2 July 2010. He has said in interview that \\"it's about a payroll accountant who lives a lonely, friendless life. One night while he's asleep in bed someone breaks into his apartment and tries to murder him. During the altercation he ends up killing his assailant, and rather than calling the police, he puts the body on ice in his bathtub and tries to find out who wanted him dead and why.\\"http://needlecity.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/45/ His third novel, The Dispatcher, was released in June 2011, and was listed as one of the Financial Times' top ten crime novels of the year, as well as being long-listed for the Crime Writers' Association Ian Fleming Steel Dagger. It was inspired, in part, by the kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard, though the details of the novel bear no relation to the facts of the case, with characters, events and locations being entirely fictional. It concerns the kidnapping of a seven-year-old girl and her father's attempts to rescue her, when, seven years later, months after she has been declared dead, he learns that she is still alive. His fourth, The Last Tomorrow, was released in July 2012. Set in 1952, it concerns political corruption, censorship, and drug addiction. The story revolves around a man falsely accused of murder attempting to clear his name. His fifth, The Gentle Assassin, was released in September 2014.

It began airing on November 9, 2009, via TC Televisi√≥n in Ecuador at 22:00. It was released in Venezuela on August 25, 2010 at 3pm by the original channel Venevision. Univision began airing the telenovela on May 3, 2010 at the 12pm/11c timeslot. It has since aired in Colombia, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Bulgaria. Pecadora is a remake of Como en el Cine and is written by the original writer, Ver√≥nica Su√°rez. In turn Como en el Cine is apparently a spin-off of a movie entitled \\"Coyote Ugly\\" wherein dancers danced on a bar counter. Eduardo Capetillo, Litzy Dominguez, and Marjorie de Sousa are the main stars alongside Daniel Elbittar, Maritza Bustamante, Ariel L√≥pez Padilla, Silvana Arias, and others. Plot The plot sort of inches along slowly with a multitude of repetitive discussions by various characters about what some plan to do and about what has already happened, along with flash-backs. Much time is spent filming girls dancing on the bar with the audience reactions. To the eyes of the world, Luz Mar√≠a is a successful psychologist who makes enough money to take care of her family and to pay for a luxurious boarding school education for her younger sister, though the story did not develop the psychology practice to any significant extent. The audience sees Luz fake being a psychologist only briefly. In reality, Luz Mar√≠a makes her living as a dancer in a nightclub, though really most of the time it is other girls the audience sees dancing and not Luz Mar√≠a. Although she did study psychology at university, she was forced to leave school at the death of her father, and she left it in charge of her brothers. The story line about Luz Mar√≠a is weakly developed (her role being almost a MacGuffin rolehttp://borgus.com/hitch/macguffins.htm) while the role of the antagonist, Samantha, is much developed. Ashamed to admit her true occupation, Luz Mar√≠a has arranged things to deceive everyone, maintaining a low profile and keeping few close friends. But when she meets Bruno, her secret becomes a heavy load that threatens to destroy her happiness. Bruno, an honest industrialist who belongs to a prominent family, thinks that he has fallen in love not only with the perfect woman, but besides that, due to her academic preparation, she can help him deal with the trauma generated by the disappearance of his twin brother many years ago. What he never imagines is the surprise he will receive related to that ideal woman that he thinks he has found. The writer or production did not choose to give many scenes of Luz doing psychotherapy (like having Bruno on a couch). Samantha, Bruno's former fianc√©e, jealous and bitter because he broke off their relationship when he met Luz Mar√≠a, conspires with her malicious father, Genaro, and with Bruno's mother Angela -who wasted the fortune she inherited from her husband and who wants to see Bruno married to Samantha- to do everything possible to separate Luz Mar√≠a and Bruno. After submitting Luz Mar√≠a to countless humiliations, they manage to discover her true job, and cruelly they reveal the secret to Bruno, making her sound deceitful... and sinful. From that moment, Luz Mar√≠a must fight the hardest battle of her life: to convince Bruno that she is not the calculating gold-digger he thinks she is, and that her love is true. To complicate things even more, Bruno's twin brother -whom everyone thinks is dead- appears in Luz Mar√≠a's life as a regular at the nightclub, and he also falls in love with her. Bernardo (Bernie), who remembers neither his past nor his true last name, only knows and loves her as ‚ÄúLucecita‚Äù the dancer. The story of the twin brother becomes a story within the story as the mafia is out to kill Bernie. The twin brother is much more vivacious than Bruno, who is rather straight. Despite the above, what really becomes the story (for a while) is the story of Samantha, who gets in a struggle over a gun with another woman, who is shot and dies. The disposal of the body and legal fall out over the death of that woman takes over the story for a while. In the end, Samantha replaces Luz Mar√≠a as the star dancer and singer in the bar, and Samantha becomes a sympathetic character at the end. While Luz Mar√≠a never is shown singing a song through without interruption or bar hub-bub obscuring her song, Samantha gets to sing a beautiful song at the end of the story, song sung without interruption. The story is told with a number of stock, well- used, telenovela conventions like unknown/mistaken parentage, two brothers after one woman, twins played by one actor (twins who look exactly alike), rich evil novia with whom the male protagonist fornicates, older ally of the evil rich novia, characters who lie most of the way through the story, fake wedding, and the end of the telenovela with a wedding.

Elwood Morris Wherry (1843‚Äì1927) was an American Presbyterian missionary to India where he spent forty years of his life (between 1868 and 1923). He was keenly interested in \\"Muslim controversy,\\" or apologetics, making contributions to Christian-Muslim relations as an Islamic scholar and Christian ecumenist. Biography Wherry was born in South Bend, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania on 26 March 1843. He graduated from Jefferson College in 1862, followed by two years as Principal of Waynesburg Academy in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Two years later he became a member of the Waynesburg Presbyterian Church, the same year that he entered Princeton Theological Seminary. When he graduated in April 1867, he was ordained by the Old School Presbytery of Donegal.Matthew Ebenezer, \\"American Presbyterians and Islam in India 1855-1923: A Critical Evaluation of the Contributions of Isidor Loewenthal (1826-1864) & Elwood Morris Wherry (1843-1927)\\" (Ph.D Dissertation, Westminster Theological Seminary, 1998), 218-224. On April 8, 1867, Wherry was appointed to be a missionary by the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, by whom he would be sent to India. Before his journey began, Wherry married Clara Maria Buchanan on July 17, 1867 with whom he had a total of eight children. His first two children would die during his time in India, as there were epidemics of cholera and dysentery during the Wherry's stay.Our Missions in India, 1834-1924, E.M.Wherry He and his new wife set sail from Boston on October 18, 1867, reaching Kolkata on March 10, 1868. He was stationed at Rawalpindi in the Punjab for the remainder of that year; the following year would see him transferred to Ludhiana. For 5 years (1883-1888) Wherry taught Old Testament literature and church history as professor at the theological seminary in Saharanpur. His contributions there included translating textbooks into the vernacular, engaging in debates, and giving lectures. In 1888 Wherry resigned from the Mission Press of which he was in charge, and the family returned to the United States for his family's education, as his six children ranged from five to sixteen years of age at this time. He spent from 1889-1896 as the district secretary of the American Tract Society in Chicago. He wouldn't return to India until 1898, where he would remain until 1923, teaching and debating during his village tours. Wherry suffered from diabetes and rheumatic gout, and so retired, returning from his active missionary service to spend the last 4 years of his life in Cincinnati, Ohio. He died of heart failure on October 5, 1927.  Contributions to Christian-Muslim relations  The theology that Wherry developed at Princeton Theological Seminary was one that stressed Biblical authority.Alan M. Guenther, \\"The Image of the Prophet as Found in Missionary Writings of the Late Nineteenth Century,\\" The Muslim World 90 (Spring 2000): 57. His textual focus led him to produce a Roman Urdu edition of the Qur'an, intended for use by missionaries. In a paper read at the Semi Centennial Celebration of the American Presbyterian Mission in India held in Lodiana from December 3‚Äì7, 1884, J.J. Lucas observed \\"In 1876 Mr. Wherry issued an edition of the Quran in Roman Urdu, which contains ... a very full and complete index in Urdu by Mr. Wherry. ... To the preacher among Muhammadans, this elaborate index is simply invaluable.\\"J.J. Lucas, \\"Literary Work of the American Presbyterian Mission, North India, Including Bible Translation and Revision, and Circulation of Religious Books and Tracts,\\" Indian Evangelical Review 13 (July 1886): 43-63. Another major contribution that Wherry offered was his production of a commentary of the Qur'an, a four- volume series completed in 1886. Wherry's leadership at the theological seminary in Saharanpur produced pastoral leadership to north Indian churches, whom he exhorted to take part in evangelistic activities. His affinity for \\"controversy\\" with Muslims was evident in his tutelage, as his students would often engage in interreligious dialogue in bazaars and village itinerations.

Generally, trademark infringement is based on the likelihood of confusion for a consumer in the marketplace. This likelihood is typically determined using a multi-factor test that includes factors like the strength of the mark and evidence of any actual confusion. However, trademark infringement that relies on Initial Interest Confusion does not require a likelihood of confusion at the time of sale; the mark must only capture the consumer's initial attention. A famous hypothetical example of Initial Interest Confusion, first discussed in Brookfield v West Coast Entertainment,Brookfield Communications Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corporation, 174 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 1999). involves two video stores. West Coast Video's competitor, Blockbuster Video, puts a billboard on a stretch of highway advertising a West Coast Video at an upcoming exit. In reality, there is no West Coast Video at this exit; it is a Blockbuster Video instead. The consumer, expecting to find a West Coast Video store, sees the Blockbuster Video and decides to patronize the suitable replacement. Even though the confusion has been dispelled, Blockbuster is still misappropriating the acquired goodwill of West Coast Video's trademark. History The Initial Interest Confusion doctrine has been applied by U.S. courts as early as 1975. However, with the appearance of the World Wide Web, Initial Interest Confusion claims have increased from 10 cases relying on the doctrine before 1990 to more than 100 between 1990 and 2005.Rothman, Jennifer E., Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads of Trademark Law, 27 Cardozo Law Review 105 (2005). Origin =Grotrian v Steinway & Sons= The first judgment involving Initial Interest Confusion was in Grotrian, Helfferich, Schults., Th. Steinweg Nachf. v Steinway & Sons,(2d Cir. 1975) although that exact expression is never used. At the time of the dispute, Grotrian, Helfferich, Schultz., Th. Steinweg Nachf. (also referred to as \\"Grotrian\\") was importing into the United States pianos labeled \\"Grotrian-Steinweg\\" and advertised under the name \\"Steinweg\\". Consequently, Steinway & Sons filled a trademark infringement suit against Grotrian. The parties are historically linkedthe founder of Steinway & Sons, Henry E. Steinway, who had Anglicised his name from Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg after migrating to New York in 1850, had initially made pianos in Germany branded Steinweg, and his son partnered with Grotrian. When Steinweg/Steinway left for America, the German business was sold to the three employees, Grotrian, Helfferich and Schulz, with permission to use the \\"Steinweg\\" name. On appeal, 2nd Circuit Judge W. H. Timbers confirmed the opinion of Judge L. F. MacMahon that \\"misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway.\\"Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway & Sons, 365 F. Supp. 707, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1973). The Appellate Court, however, recognized the likelihood of confusion may not exist at the time of purchase, because those who buy expensive pianos can be considered to be well informed. Instead, the Court held that actual or potential confusion at the time of purchase did not need to be demonstrated in this case. The motivation behind that decision was that \\"the Grotrian-Steinweg name would attract potential customers based on the reputation built up by Steinway in [the United States] for many years\\". The Court concluded that Grotrian was attempting to increase their sales based on the strength of the name of \\"Steinway\\" and that \\"such initial confusion works an injury to Steinway\\". =Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp.= The next significant decision relying on Initial Interest Confusion was Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp..Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp., 818 F.2d 254 (2d Cir. 1987). In this case, Mobil sued Pegasus Petroleum, an oil trading company founded in 1981, on the basis of a trademark infringement concerning the \\"Pegasus\\" name. Mobil is the holder of a registered trademark in both the flying horse symbol representing the Greek mythological figure of Pegasus, and the name \\"Pegasus\\" itself. However, the logo of Pegasus Petroleum did not represent any sort of flying horse and solely consisted of two interlocking letters \\"P\\". At the first trial, Judge L. F. MacMahon concluded that \\"there is a sufficient likelihood of confusion between Mobil's flying horse symbol and Pegasus Petroleum's use of the 'Pegasus' mark to grant Mobil relief under the Lanham Act.\\" While finding the decision \\"not clearly erroneous\\", the 2nd Circuit Court clarified on Appeal that the likelihood of confusion had to be understood as a \\"likelihood that Pegasus Petroleum would gain crucial credibility during the initial phases of a deal\\". The Court concluded that Pegasus Petroleum was misleading potential customers because of their initial interest suggested by the Pegasus mark and holds that this initial confusion alone constitutes a sufficient trademark injury. The Internet Era Initial Interest Confusion has become much more visible in the Internet age. Courts have upheld trademark infringement claims in domain names (cybersquatting), meta-tags that influence search engine results, and advertising keywords using the Initial Interest Confusion doctrine. =Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.= In Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., the 9th Circuit embraces the Initial Interest Confusion doctrine which has previously been developed in the 2nd Circuit, and directly addresses the question whether registered trademark terms can be used as meta tags on web pages of non-trademark holders. Brookfield developed a software, named MovieBuff, which consisted of a searchable database of past, current and upcoming films, their box office reviews, schedules, and other data. A federal trademark registration for \\"MovieBuff\\" was issued in 1998, covering both goods and services. In order to sell the MovieBuff software, Brookfield registered two domain names: moviebuffonline.com and brookfieldcomm.com in 1996. He also placed a version of the database online at inhollywood.com. Brookfield was not able to register the domain moviebuff.com at the time because West Coast has previously registered it. West Coast, one of the nation's largest video rental store chains, subsequently launched on moviebuff.com an online movie database service similar to the one Brookfield had deployed. Furthermore, both this web site and westcoastvideo.com, the legitimate domain of West Coast, contained the meta keywords \\"moviebuff\\" and \\"moviebuff.com\\". These meta keywords were intended to be indexed by search engines, so that a consumer searching for \\"moviebuff\\" could find the page. While this was a common way to increase visibility in earlier search engines, most modern search engines do not rely on meta keywords for ranking results. Although the 9th Circuit admitted that there was no likelihood of confusion between the two products, the Court nonetheless held West Coast liable for trademark infringement because the \\"moviebuff\\" trademark, as well as \\"moviebuff.com\\", appeared in the metatags of westcoastvideo.com, the non-infringing domain used by West Coast. The Court states \\"although there is no source confusion in the sense that consumers know they are patronizing West Coast rather than Brookfield, there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the sense that, by using moviebuff.com or MovieBuff to divert people looking for MovieBuff to its web site, West Coast improperly benefits from the goodwill that Brookfield developed in its trademark.\\" =Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.= In Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.,Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., 354 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2004). Playboy charged Netscape (along with Excite) for selling banner ads keyed on trademarked terms \\"playboy\\" and \\"playmate\\". A district court dismissed the case, citing fair use and other arguments. However, the Ninth Circuit drew comparisons to Brookfield v West Coast, and came to the conclusion that \\"analogies to Brookfield suggest that PEI will be able to show a likelihood of confusion sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The Court held that Playboy was likely to show that consumers may be attracted to competitors' products by free riding Playboy's reputation when using the trademarks \\"playboy\\" and \\"playmate\\", even if the consumers are well aware that they are not buying services from Playboy. Controversy Several people have criticized the doctrine of Initial Interest Confusion. One concern is that Initial Interest Confusion \\"lacks a rigorous definition\\".Goldman, Eric, Deregulating Relevancy in Internet Trademark Law, 54 Emory Law Journal 559 (2005). Others have said that, absent a coherent conception of damage to the trademark holder, initial interest confusion makes actionable not \\"actual damage incurred by the trademark holder\\" but something more like \\"brand indignation.\\" Coleman, Ronald, De Minimis Confusion on the Internet: Compounding the Error of Initial Interest, 3 Journal of Internet Law (October 2003). Additionally, some state that because Initial Interest Confusion can be found without the multi-factor analysis of likelihood of confusion, it represents \\"a short-cut to infringement, like a judicial game of 'Chutes and Ladders'\\" Pink, Jonathan, Initial Interest Confusion Doctrine , IP Frontline (Jul. 6, 2005). Another concern is the lack of consensus among courts about the applicability of Initial Interest Confusion.Kravitz, Jason C., Initial Interest Confusion: Dispelling Some of the Confusion, Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly (Aug. 23, 2004). Judge Berzon of the Ninth Circuit, in a concurring opinion in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., asked whether the court wanted \\"to continue to apply an insupportable rule\\", referring to Initial Interest Confusion as discussed in Brookfield.

The Azerbaijani section is also known as the Kazi Magomed‚ÄìNovo Filya or Baku‚ÄìNovo Filya, and it connects Baku with the Novo Filya gas metering utility on the Russian side of the Azerbaijan-Russia border. The pipeline will be used for transportation of Azerbaijani gas to Russia starting from 1 January 2010. History In 1970‚Äì1979, Southern Caucasus republics of the Soviet Union were supplied by natural gas from Iran. After Iranian Revolution Iranian supplies were cut off. To replace Iranian gas supplies from Western Siberia and Orenburg through Novopskov were planned. For this purpose, the North Caucasus‚ÄìMoscow line was reversed and expanded further south by construction of the Mozdok‚ÄìMakhachkala‚ÄìKazi Magomed and Mozdok‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìKazi Magomed pipelines. The Mozdok‚ÄìMakhachkala‚ÄìKazi Magomed pipeline was completed in 1983. In 2007, Azerbaijan started its own gas production and the pipeline between Russia and Azerbaijan became largely inactive. In the summer of 2008, Gasprom started negotiations with State Oil Company of Azerbaijan on buying natural gas from Azerbaijan at market prices based on long term agreement between two countries. It had been announced earlier that Russia was willing to diversify its imports and purchase natural gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas field. On 29 June 2009, during an official visit of the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Azerbaijan, governments of both countries signed a deal on exports of Azerbaijani gas to Russia. As per agreement, Russia would be paying Azerbaijan $350 per thousand cubic meters while paying only $300 per thousand cubic meters for Uzbek and Turkmen gas. Under the terms of the deal, Azerbaijan is to sell Russia 0.5 billion cubic meters annually with a possibility of increase of the volume to 1.5 in the future. On 14 October 2009, President of State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, Rovnag Abdullayev and CEO of Gasprom, Alexei Miller, finalized the deal. The agreement oversees the exports for 2010-2014 with a potential for extension. Azerbaijani natural gas would be transported via the Baku-Novo Filya pipeline, which was previously used for transporting of natural gas from Russian to Azerbaijan, until 2007, when the shipments were stopped by Azerbaijan as a result of internal self- sufficient production. On January 21, during the meeting between Alexey Miller and Rovnag Abdullayev Gasprom expressed its willingness to purchase more gas from Azerbaijan. The parties agreed to double the amount of gas to be transport during 2010 from initially planned 500 million cm to 1 billion cm and yet increase the amount to 2 billion cm in 2011. Starting from 2007, Azerbaijan became exporter of natural gas by starting its shipments to Georgia and Turkey. Technical features The overall length of the pipeline is , of which in Azerbaijan. The pipe diameter is and it had original capacity of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. The operating capacity is around 5 bcm. It has a gas metering station in ≈ûirvanovka, built in 2003. In Mozdok, the pipeline is connected with North Caucasus‚ÄìMoscow line. Political perspective Experts argue that the significance of the deal is high both for Azerbaijan and Russia. Russia will be paying Azerbaijan an estimated $350 per thousand cubic meters which is the highest price Russia had ever paid for gas imports from Caucasus and Central Asia (compare to $300 per tcm for Uzbek and Turkmen gas), thus hoping to decrease prospects of other potential gas export projects from or through Azerbaijan such as Nabucco or White Stream. Controlling flows of natural gas to Europe is at the forefront of Russian foreign policy and whether the gas exported to Europe is produced in Russia or is coming from elsewhere through Russia, Russia likes to keep an economic control over Europe thus exerting political pressure on the continent and the West as whole through vital energy exports. Russia's production of natural gas in 2008 equalled to 602 billion cubic meters and 154 bcm of it was exported to Europe and Turkey. A much smaller amount of gas to be received from Azerbaijan at higher prices through the Baku-Novo Filya pipeline and the notion that Russia is charging European importers $280 per thousand cubic meters (much lower than it's willing to pay Azerbaijan), proves Russia's ambitious long term intentions. Up to 2007, Azerbaijan was a Russian gas importer until country's production of 10.3 bcm per year brought self-sufficiency for internal demand of 8.3 bcm. Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz field is to produce approximately 9 bcm per year, whilst Shah Deniz II is believed to produce 10-12 bcm per year when it becomes operational.  Security  During the 1990s‚Äì2000s, the pipeline was attacked several times in Chechenya and Dagestan. On 12 January 2010, the pipeline was targeted at its 496th kilometer by a bomb blast on the branch line supplying Derbent and surrounding regions in Dagestan, causing fire and leaving 214,000 people without gas supply. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan by the main trunk line continued by reduced volume.

It opened in 1977 and closed in 2006, reopening after its redevelopment in 2008. History Beginnings Highlands Mall came to fruition after Crown American had decided to expand its shopping center along Freeport Road in the Harrison Township village of Natrona Heights. The center, which opened in 1972, up to that point, had housed only two tenants, which were actually one and the same. Johnstown-based Gee Bee Department Stores, operated a discount department store in one half of the building, and a grocery store in the other half. Because this location was one of the regional chain's more profitable stores, the concept of the mall came in tandem with a proposed expansion of Gee Bee. For this time period, there was no indoor shopping mall serving the Alle-Kiski Valley region. The closest malls up to this point in time were the Butler Mall in Butler, Pennsylvania; Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania; Greengate Mall in Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Northway Mall in Ross Township; and Eastland Mall in North Versailles. Gee Bee served as the mall's anchor tenant, with the mall being constructed on the north end of the shopping center, which housed the department store half of Gee Bee. The mall opened in the fall of 1977 with the following tenants: a new Gee Bee furniture store, Pearle Vision, First Federal of Pittsburgh, J&S; Pizza, General Nutrition Center, National Record Mart, Waldenbooks, and Hallmark. The mall also featured a game room with coin-operated video games and pinball machines, pay toilets, a courtyard wishing well fountain, and a snack stand featuring hot pretzels. Decline The earliest signs of decline of Highlands Mall came with the decline of business for Gee Bee. The retailer closed its grocery business around 1985-1986 and the supermarket half of the store was replaced when Penn-Traffic opened a Bi-Lo Supermarket in this location. Because the supermarket was separately owned, a former common entrance between both the co-owned supermarket and department store was sealed. At around this same time, Gee Bee had sold its mall furniture store business to Freight Liquidators, but as the transition in business was relatively seamless, it went unnoticed. Towards the conclusion of the 1980s, Heights Plaza, the mall's competitor which had been operating since the 1950s, underwent a major facelift in an attempt to attract new tenants, and as an incentive, offered those already in the Highlands Mall a cheaper rate. The first tenants to pack up were National Record Mart and Radio Shack, two of the mall's more popular stores. In 1990, Gee Bee, citing a decline from more powerful national competitors, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The retailer successfully emerged from bankruptcy, and in May 1992, was sold to Value City. Value City operated at the Highlands Mall location until 2001, when it finally closed its doors citing a lack of business justifying it to keep the doors open. With no anchor tenant for the first time in over 30 years, other businesses at the mall continued to close, leaving the mall a shadow of its former self. Some smaller tenants rented former store space for offices, but the mall now offered very little in the way of choices for retail shoppers. Because of few cars outside the mall, it was assumed during the mall's last few years that it had been closed for some time. Demolition Michael Joseph Development purchased the mall property in early 2005. They announced later that year that the mall would be demolished and redeveloped, though it would still retain its original name. The new Highlands Mall features stores such as Wal-Mart, Roomful Express Furniture (the succeeding company of Freight Liquidators) and some smaller arcade style stores. Demolition began on Wednesday, February 22, 2006, and Roomful Express, the first store at the newly redeveloped site, opened in January 2008. Roomful Express closed its doors in 2010. As of June 2019, Freedom Square Diner, Dunham's Sports, Wines and Spirits, GameStop, The Gold Buyers of Pittsburgh, Sally Beauty, GNC, and Walmart are occupying the mall. Residing in front of the mall are a Tractor Supply, Taco Bell, O'Reilly Auto Parts, First Commonwealth Bank, and a Goodwill.

He is most noted for winning both the British and the British Empire featherweight boxing titles in 1915 and for an outstanding winning record with a nearly 50% knockout ratio. He took the Australian lightweight title against Herb McCoy in 1916.  Early life and boxing career  Born in Llynclys, Shropshire, England, in 1884, he was raised on a Shropshire farm in England's West Midlands. Edwards' boxing career didn‚Äôt begin until he moved Southeast to South Wales in the Rhondda Valley where he began his professional boxing career around 1913 at the age of twenty-seven in his new hometown of Porth, Wales. One of his earliest opponents was Billy Phillips, an average Welsh bantamweight who fell to Edwards in April and January of 1913 in Porth and Tonypandy in two eight round points decisions. Featherweight Jim DriscollBritain's 1910 featherweight champion Jim Driscoll, a fellow Welsh boxer from nearby Cardiff, acted as a mentor to Edwards in his career. Driscoll fought many of the same boxers, particularly Owen Moran for the British Empire featherweight title. Driscoll was twelve years older and able to share his boxing experience with his friend and fellow Welshman Edwards. His stellar boxing career was over in 1913, just as Edwards's was beginning his career and already showing remarkable potential. Welsh boxers;Edwards front row right, and Driscoll, immediately behind and left, Jimmy Wilde immediate left Edwards was soon traveling North to thriving Liverpool and later East to London to face opponents such as Lancashire resident Harold Walker, a competent featherweight just short of contender status, whom he defeated handily in a seventh round technical knockout at Liverpool Stadium on 26 March 1913. Edwards defeated featherweight contender Alec Lambert in a seventh round knockout on 4 May 1914 at London's prestigious National Sporting Club at Covent Gardens. In pre-fight publicity, mentor Jim Driscoll accurately touted Edwards as the next British featherweight champion, though it would take Edwards another year to achieve the title. Lambert boxed in the traditional, upstanding British style and kept a light leading left typical of amateurs, but he had developed a strong punch as a professional. Edwards expertly evaded Lambert's fierce swings and uppercuts with a superior defense characteristic of his future style. He boxed at a great pace and Lambert had no answer for his repeated short left that stopped him consistently. Edwards's footwork, another characteristic strength, gave him better leverage in his punches and Lambert was down twice for six and eight second counts in the seventh. As their boxer was unable to resume the fight shortly after a devastating hook in the chest, Lambert's handlers stopped the bout.\\"LLew Edwards V. Alec Lambert\\", The Times, Greater London, England, pg. 10, 5 May 1914 The Welsh boxer, as a rising star, began a winning streak on September 22, 1913 that continued nearly uninterrupted until 13 May 1915, when he next met Owen Moran for the title.  Taking the British and British Empire featherweight title, Owen Moran, 1915  Owen Moran In early 1915, Edwards fought at the prestigious Covent Garden in London to challenge for the British and British Empire Featherweight title, left vacant by Ted \\"Kid\\" Lewis. Edwards first defeated Young Joe Brooks, and then Seaman Arthur Hayes in a first round TKO in the British featherweight title eliminator at London's Covent Garden on April 5, 1915. These wins allowed him to face the exceptional British champion Owen Moran in the title match on 31 May 1915 at Covent Garden's National Sporting Club, the most prestigious boxing venue in London. The incomparable Moran was a former British and world bantamweight champion, and the most accomplished opponent of Edwards's career. With one hundred wins already in his record, the Cincinnati Enquirer, picked Edwards to become the new British champion, and he handily achieved the feat after Moran was disqualified in the tenth round for repeatedly punching low. It was the prime of his career and Edwards's greatest victory. One week earlier, he had stunned a sizable audience by knocking out featherweight contender Harold Walker in one round at the West London Stadium.\\"Veteran Ring Expert Picks\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 39, 30 May 1915 Having married earlier in June, Edwards sailed for Australia in July, where he had eleven fights arranged with guaranteed earnings of ¬£2,500.  Vacating the British title to box in Australia, 1915-1916  Edwards took criticism from his countrymen for leaving Great Britain in 1915 and choosing to continue his boxing career rather than return to Britain and volunteer for military service during WWI. His British and British Empire featherweight title was vacated in 1916, with Edwards out of the country and no longer defending it in his homeland. Edwards then spent the majority of his boxing career in Australia, fighting for a while in the Philippines and then in the United States. He did not return to the United Kingdom to fight until nearing the end of his professional career in 1920. His decision to avoid military service cost him in popularity and denied him a shot at the world feather or lightweight titles during the war years when he was at the peak of his career. On 24 April 1916, he knocked out Frank Thorn in the third round before a large house at Australia's Brisbane Stadium. Edwards landed a right hand punch to the chin that knocked out Thorn.\\"Three Fights\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 22, 9 June 1916  British featherweight title defenses against Jimmy Hill, Sydney Stadium  Edwards successfully defended his featherweight British Empire title against former Australian champion and native Jimmy Hill, in a 13th round TKO on 18 December, 1915, at Sydney Stadium, when Hill's corner threw in the towel after their fighter was knocked down for the eighth time during the bout. He soundly defeated Hill again in a fifth round knockout at Sydney Stadium on July 15, 1916, and again in a sixth round knockout on November 27, 1918 in Sydney. George Taylor fell to Edwards on 1 January 1916 in a seventh round knockout at Australia's Brisbane Stadium. Edwards' display was considered by one reporter, \\"the most vigorous lightweight fighting ever seen in Brisbane\\".\\"Darcy and Edwards Lead\\", Honolulu Star, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 10, 20 January 1916 On 13 May 1916, Bert Spargo, of Victoria, whom Edwards had lost to in April, fell to Edwards in a fourteenth round knockout at Melbourne Stadium. Edwards's rise to the Australian lightweight championship looked imminent.  Taking the Australian lightweight title, Herb McCoy, 1916  He first met Australian lightweight champion Herb McCoy in a non-title 20 round win on points on 27 May 1916 in Sydney Stadium. Edwards fought for the Australian lightweight title against McCoy on 1 July 1916, but the bout resulted in a draw. The two met again on 11 November at West Melbourne Stadium with Edwards winning in a twenty round points decision, and taking the lightweight title. Sydney Stadium, 1913 He successfully defended the Australian lightweight title for the last time against McCoy on 10 February 1917 in an eighteenth round knockout at Sydney Stadium, and after relinquishing the title, regained it on 12 January 1920 with a second-round knockout of Frank Brogan in Sydney's Hippodrome.  Boxing in the Philippines, 1919  Edwards sailed to the Philippines and boxed from 22 February, until 9 August 1919 at the Olympic Stadium in Manilla, and met with considerable success. On 5 April, he took the Orient Lightweight Title in a ten round points decision against Dencio Cabanella. Cabanella took the first, fifth, and seventh, but Edwards took the remaining seven rounds against his lighter opponent and \\"pounded Cabanella all over the ring in round ten, having him at his mercy when the final bell rang\\". He had previously knocked out Edward Duarte on March 26, in a third round sweep, with vicious one-twos, and two rights to the body that sent his opponent to his knees where he was counted out. In his last fight in the Philippines, on 9 August 1919, Edwards defeated Iron Bux, in a convincing ninth round TKO. According to the Manila Daily Bulletin, Edwards handed Bux \\"the worst licking that he had ever received. Although the Iron Man was never off his feet, he was battered badly, and suffered eyecuts that rendered him nearly helpless by the time that the fight was halted. Edwards was as effective at long range as he had already proved to be at infighting. He showed a clever defense against Bux's attacks.\\" Edwards returned to Australia on August 27. For a period in the Philippines, Edwards acted as a boxing advisor to International Boxing Hall of Famer and world flyweight champion Francisco Guilledo (1901-1925), a 5' 1\\" Filipino, better known under his boxing name Pancho Villa.‚Äù Guilledo was never knocked out, and found fame when he won his world flyweight title in America in 1922.  Boxing decline during brief trip to America  On 26 February 1920, a taller, younger, and stronger Richie Mitchell knocked down Edwards in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the sixth and his handlers threw in the towel before the bell for the seventh. In all, Mitchell floored him for a nine count in the second and sixth, and for a count of two in the third. Though showing his best efforts in the fourth, Edwards could do no damage.\\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\\", The Capital Times, pg. 20, 27 February 1920 = Brief return to Britain to box = Returning briefly to Britain on 28 May 1920, Edwards faced Johnny Regan at Carbrook, Yorkshire, reversing his loss against Mitchell and winning in the third of twenty rounds. Regrettably for his fans, who had dwindled in his absence during the war, it would be his last British bout. Returning to America on September 3, 1920, Edwards won a ten round newspaper decision against Johnny Noye at Minneapolis's Nicolete Park. Edwards won with only a slight lead over Noye, a boxer he would have beaten convincingly five years earlier.\\"Lllew Edwards Wallops Noye\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 9, 5 September 1920 Edwards faced Jack Lawler on 30 July 1920, in Milwaukee, winning in a ten round newspaper decision. In the pre-flight publicity, Edwards was praised for his determination, and for being \\"of the sort who keeps tearing in. Despite the fact that he was dropped several times by Ritchie Mitchell in their previous bout, Llew arose each time and with a bull-like rush started after the Milwaukee blonde(Mitchell). He is a game ringster.\\" Lawler was described as a mauler, but he showed little of it against Edwards.\\"Star Boxing Bell Offered\\", The Journal Times, Racine, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 30 July 1920 The bout was described as a slow and uninteresting affair, but after a string of recent fights, both boxers may have been feeling each other out and wary of the other's skills. Lawler was said to stall until the ninth and tenth rounds. In a close bout, Edwards was given the third, fourth, and seventh, with Lawler the fifth and ninth with the rest even. Edwards took the lead throughout the bout, and though he had many of his punches blocked, he landed enough to take the bout.\\"Llew Edwards Trims Lawler\\", The Capital Times\\", Madison, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 31 July 1920 Edwards remained boxing in the United States through late 1920, when he lost to Clonie Tait at Nicolete Park on 12 November 1920 in a second round TKO. He was down eleven times before his manager threw in the towel. It appeared clear the Welsh boxer was outclassed, tiring, and facing a painful decline in his boxing career by the end of his American tour.\\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\\", The Capital Times, pg. 20, 27 February 1920 Edwards career was now clearly in decline but he was in need of cash and needed more fights.  Return to Australia and career decline  On his return to Australia, he defeated French-born Eugene Volaire in a twenty round points decision in Brisbane on 5 March 1921. On 4 April 1921, in a non-title bout, Edwards defeated Sid Godfrey, a highly rated future Australian lightweight title holder five years younger, in an important twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium. The Sydney Daily Telegraph called the match, \\"a contest full of fight with both men displaying a scientific knowledge above the ordinary, speed, punching power and tenacity.\\" Even near the end of his career Edwards could fight with style, but his decline would seem evident against more skilled American competitors on the rise like Harry Stone who had learned the game from tougher New York competitors. Ironically, the following month Godfrey would take the Australian lightweight title from Stone, a boxer with whom Edwards would never defeat again.\\"Leicester vs. Gloucester\\", The Times, London, England, 4 April 1921  Final loss of the Australian lightweight title to Harry Stone, 1921  Exceptional New York Lightweight, Harry Stone Edwards mounted a last defense of the Australian lightweight title before an impressive crowd of 9000 on 23 April 1921 in a twenty round bout in Melbourne, Australia, against frequent but dangerous rival New York Jewish boxer Harry Stone. Stone had boxed Edwards twice in 1917 in Melbourne and Brisbane with mixed results. Edwards was confused by Stone's ability to quickly retreat in his hopping style after he attacked\\"Stone Defeats Edwards\\", The Age, Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921 Their April 1921 title fight was described as an outstanding show of scientific boxing with both boxers well matched. In fact, both boxers were extremely close in height, reach, and age. Edwards may have suffered from recent travel.Crowd of 9000 in \\"Australian Boxing Championship\\", The Observer, London, Greater England, pg. 19, 24 April 1921 Recovering from earlier losses, Edwards seemed to look tired and a bit haggard during the bout, and suffered from a cut over his eye received in the fifth, though he fought with vitality and strength. He had the disadvantage of protecting his eye, which reduced his ability to take the offensive, particularly against Stone's signature left. Stone gained the advantage and was said to have his \\"hands, feet, and shoulders all working, while the manner in which he bore into his opponent was both interesting and effective\\". In the seventh, Edwards punished Stones's body against the ropes early in the bout and did better in the infighting, but Stone threw more punches. As late as the eleventh and thirteenth, Edwards landed a few telling blows, but Stone remained in calculated command, and landed more punches. Edwards needed stitches to lacerations in both eyelids later in his dressing room, but his right seemed to have taken the most punishment. The boxers split around 350 English pounds for their efforts.\\"Stone Defeats Edwards\\", The Age, Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921 The bout was a difficult loss and it would be the last title match of Edwards's career. On 12 November 1921, Edwards defeated Jack Suddington in an eleventh round disqualification at Sydney Stadium. Edwards rained blows on Suddington throughout the bout which left his opponent unperturbed, but in the eleventh with his head down and delivering punches to the body, Suddington was called for a foul from a low blow that ended the bout. Suddington, though capable of strong blows, fought very few well-rated opponents, and lacked a winning record.\\"Boxing\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, pg. 6, 14 November 1921, pg. 6 Edwards dreamed of, but never achieved a shot at the lightweight world title, held at the time by American Benny Leonard, who had wrenched it from fellow Welshman Freddy Welsh. Edwards's slowly fading career, beginning with his vacating the British Empire title, and accelerated by two losses in America, made it evident a shot at the title was unrealistic by 1920. His painful loss to Harry Stone for the Australian title in 1921 removed chances of a world lightweight title shot. Lacking the British title during the war years, when he was in his prime, may have most clearly denied him a shot at the world featherweight title. On 18 February 1922, Edwards lost to Stone again in a twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium. It would be Edwards's last bout, though it was against one of his best opponents. He died at 71 in Australia in 1965. After his death, he was inducted into the Welsh boxer's Hall of Fame.

This very thick smog occurs in cities and is derived from the smoke given off by the burning of soft coal for home heating and in industrial processes. Smog of this intensity is often lethal to vulnerable people such as the elderly, the very young and those with respiratory problems. The result of these phenomena was commonly known as a London particular or London fog; in a reversal of the idiom, \\"London particular\\" became the name for a thick pea and ham soup.

From the mid-1600s, in U.K. cities, especially London, the incidence of ill-health was attributed to coal smoke from both domestic and industrial chimneys combining with the mists and fogs of the Thames Valley. Luke Howard, a pioneer in urban climate studies, published The Climate of London in 1818‚Äì1820, in which he uses the term 'city fog' and describes the heat island effect which concentrated the accumulation of smog over the city.Landsberg, Helmut Erich (1981). The urban climate. Academic Press, New York, p.3. In 1880 Francis Albert Rollo Russell, son of the former Prime Minister Lord John Russell, published a leaflet that blamed home hearth smoke, rather than factories' smoke, for damaging the city's important buildings, depriving vegetation of sunlight, and increasing the expense and effort of laundering clothes. Furthermore, he charged the \\"perpetually present\\" sulphurous smoke with increasing bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. More than 2,000 Londoners had \\"literally choked to death\\", he wrote, on account of \\"a want of carefulness in preventing smoke in our domestic fires\\" which emitted coal smoke from \\"more than a million chimneys\\" that when combined with the prolonged fogs of late January and early February 1880, fatally aggravated pre-existing lung conditions and was \\"more fatal than the slaughter of many a great battle\\".F.

The most lethal incidence of this smog in London occurred in 1952 and resulted in the Clean Air Act 1956 and Clean Air Act 1968, both now repealed and consolidated into the Clean Air Act 1993 which were effective in largely removing sulphur dioxide and coal smoke, the causes of pea soup fog, though these have been replaced by less visible pollutants that derive from vehicles in urban areas.Brimblecombe, P.

By the 17th century London's pollution had become a serious problem, still due, in particular, to the burning of cheap, readily available sea coal.

He proposed the relocation of industry out of the city and the planting of massive gardens of \\"odiferous flowers\\" to \\"tinge the air\\" and thus mask the pollution. Clean Air Act The worst recorded instance was the Great Smog of 1952, when 4,000 deaths were reported in the city over a couple of days, and a subsequent 8,000 related deaths, leading to the passage of the Clean Air Act 1956, which banned the use of coal for domestic fires in some urban areas. The overall death toll from that incident is now believed to be around 12,000.\\"Counting the Cost of London's Killer Smog\\" Richard Stone Science 13 December 2002: Vol. 298, Issue 5601, pp. 2106-2107 DOI: 10.1126/science.298.5601.2106b Cultural references The term 'pea-soup fog' or 'pea-souper' in reference to London's notorious fogs appears to have origins early in the nineteenth century, coinciding with the Industrial Revolution. The following list tracks cultural references to it: * In Chapter XXXIV of Thomas Love Peacock's Melincourt (1817), the Reverend Mr. Portpipe tells his visitors that he has \\"good ale and a few bottles of London Particular\\". A footnote by David Garnett, editor of the 1948 edition, explains that this is \\"a Madeira wine imported for the London market and hence, from its colour, a London fog\\". * A first mention in fiction of 'pea-soup' as a description of fog appears in 1834: \\"On the occasion of which now I am to speak, there was any thing but gaiety and mirth. It was a wretched morning; there fell a mizzling rain through the peas-soup atmosphere of London, which chilled every living thing, while a sort of smoky misty, foggy vapour, hovering over the ground, made 'darkness only visible, from Theodore Edward Hook (1834). Maxwell: a novel. London R. Bentley, p. 10 * A second appears in 1839: \\"It was not, therefore, until he had left Italy, that Lord Cheveley felt his utter wretchedness and desolation: and London in December was not calculated to lessen it, as it only presents a pea-soup fog, which renders the necessary and natural process of respiration, almost what Dr. Johnson's idea of fine music ought to be, impossible!\\", in Lytton, Rosina Bulwer Lytton Baroness (1839). Chevely; or, The man of honour. E. Bull, London, Volume 2, page 106. * In Chapter 3 of Charles Dickens's Bleak House (1852), when Esther arrives in London, she asks of the person meeting her \\"whether there was a great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen. 'O, dear no, miss,' he said. 'This is a London particular.' I had never heard of such a thing. 'A fog, miss,' said the young gentleman.\\" * The London satirical journal 'Punch' (1860) outlines some venture capital schemes: \\"Besides a plan just set for making champagne out of cucumbers, a scheme has been devised for the extraction of pea-soup from London fog. When the foreigner remembers that our fogs are now so frequent that the clear blue sky in England is never clearly seen, he may form a faint conception of the work which is cut out for this Company of Soup Makers. The fog will daily furnish a lot of raw material, which English ingenuity will soon cook into a soup.\\" Various & Lemon, Mark [Editor] 'Facts for Foreigners', Punch, or the London Charivari, Volume XXXVIII, 18 February 1860. p. 71 * The Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories describe London fogs, but contrary to popular impression the phrase \\"pea-soup\\" is not used; A Study in Scarlet (1887) mentions that \\"a dun- coloured veil hung over the house-tops\\"; The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans (1912) describes \\"a dense yellow fog\\" that has settled down over London, and later notes \\"a greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops on the windowpane\\"; while in The Sign of Four (1890), Holmes soliloquises: \\"What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses\\"; and, later: \\"the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds hung over the muddy streets.\\" * In the phrase \\"pea-soup fog\\", the implied comparison may have been to yellow pea soup: \\"the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted\\" (Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess, 1892); \\"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes\\", (T. S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, 1917); \\"London had been reeking in a green- yellow fog\\" (Winston Churchill, A Traveller in War-Time, 1918); \\"the brown fog of a winter dawn\\" (T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land, 1922); \\"a faint yellow fog\\" (Stella Benson, This is the End).

Synopsis  Spain, early 17th century. A woman is found lifeless in Santesteban. All signs point to a murder committed by the Devil and his followers. The region is being scourged for months by the sorcerers, even though the prior year eleven people were burned alive in a sorcery trial. The people are scared. To appease them the Santo Oficio decides to promote a grace edict to forgive those who admit their agreements with the Devil. The severe inquisitor Alonso de Salazar y Fr√≠as is tasked with enforcing the edict by covering the region. But what nobody knows is that Salazar doesn't believe anymore in sorcery or spells and, even worse, he does not believe in the Devil anymore, because he has lost his faith. To reveal the mystery of the witches, Salazar will use the anatomy studies from Leonardo da Vinci, forensic technics he learned in Rome, apothecary knowledge to analyse magical ointments... he finally will base his investigation on verifiable facts to establish factual truths instead of suppositions. Meanwhile, a young woman called Mayo from Labastide-d'Armagnac, who was, following her birth statements, the bastard daughter of the Devil and a mortal woman, travels selling spells. Mayo lost her female companion because this one was arrested during the last auto-da-f√©, even if she wasn't condemned. To find her, Mayo decides to follow the steps of Salazar, whom she protects with her spells, even if he does not suspect anything about her beneficial actions. During their journey, both will face the diabolical powers which will obstruct their plans, the lack of faith and the death of those they love.  The spells  Every chapter's title in the novel refers to a spell or magical formula conceived to resolve a particular problem. Reading the book the reader progressively discovers love potions, invisibility techniques, solutions to lose the vellus hair, recipes to temporarily transform into animal shapes... all the remedies appearing in Ars Magica are a part of the Spanish lore, transmitted generation after generation, and draw their origins deep back in time. The spells and ritual magic were really used at that time, and nowadays some people still use them, even if they ignore their origin. Ars Magica (\\"the art of magic\\" in Latin) is then not only a novel but also a book of spells.  The actual story  In marked contrast to what happened in the rest of Europe, in Spain the Inquisition didn't show a particular interest on persecuting witchcraft. Nevertheless, on November the 6th 1610 was celebrated in Logro√±o what was called the auto de f√© de las brujas (\\"the witches' auto-da-f√©\\"), where eleven people in the Navarre region were condemned to burn. But this auto-da-f√© wasn't enough to appease the people's fears, who pretended to continue suffering about the Devil deeds. One of the inquisitors in charge of the case, Alonso de Salazar y Fr√≠as, was sent to the region a year after that auto-da-f√© with the intention to promulgate a grace edict which forgave the devil followers if they admitted their guilt. Salazar interrogated, investigated and compiled information about the sect. This information (for which he was later called \\"the witches' advocate\\") denied all what to the moment was thought about sorcerers, to the point that he even said there weren't sorcerers or bewitched until it was talked or written about them. The resulting file of his investigations took more than 5,000 sheets of paper, all of them bound in eight volumes which, incomprehensibly, never were published. So, this way, the innovative Salazar was almost forgotten for historical record. The documentation was put aside in a basement until it was discovered by American historian Henry Charles Lea. He mentioned then this documentation on his 1906 work about the Spanish Inquisition. Salazar became worldwide famous and in 1941 the Englishman Charles Williams dedicated his book Witchcraft to Salazar (to the immortal memory of Alonso de Salazar y Fr√≠as).  The witches  The Pope Gregory IX founded the inquisition courts in 1231. Dominicans and Franciscans were in charge of the organisation, conceived to maintain under control those who refused to live under the Catholic Church's rule. Unlike in other countries the Spanish Inquisition wasn't submitted to the direct authority of Rome. Rather than that it was ruled by a general inquisitor, designated by the King of Spain. This way the Spanish Inquisition became one of the organs of the state, serving it, and the clerics who directed this organ were also public servants. So the Spanish Inquisition didn't apply punishments, but decided about the punishment that the regular civil authority usually had to apply.

Also in the latter half of the 1800s, as the western frontier was settled and the continent no longer seemed limitless, and as children increasingly grew up in urbanized and polluted environments, interest in fostering a connection to nature grew. The conservation movement, fostered by well-known figures such as Henry David Thoreau (1817 ‚Äì 1862) and Theodore Roosevelt (1858 ‚Äì 1919), added an element of environmental preservation to the examination of nature characteristic of the Nature Study movement. Summer camps and the Scouting movement for boys and girls, both emerging in the late 1800s to early 1900s, also had exploration, study of, and appreciation for the outdoors as fundamental components.

In 1995, the Environmental Education and Training Partnership (EETAP) was established by a group of environmental education organizations, and received funding from the U.S. EPA.

In recent times, educational institutions are reporting greenhouse emissions as a means to measure sustainability. To become carbon neutral, universities are working to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, cut their use of energy, use more renewable energy, and emphasize the importance of sustainable energy sources. Universities that have committed to becoming carbon neutral have recognized the threat of global warming and are therefore committing to reverse the trend. Definitions * Carbon Neutral: a term that results or has no additional net of carbon dioxide emission or is inherently counterbalancing the carbon emissions with carbon offsets. This can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency and improving energy conservation, as well as by using renewable energy. * Carbon Offset: an emission reduction credit from an action or activity that results in less carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon offsets are usually measured in tons of CO2 and can be created by renewable energy projects, energy efficiency, and land use and agriculture based projects. In addition carbon offsets can be traded sold or bought as part of a bigger system to reduce pollutants. * Sustainable: a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged; of or relating to a lifestyle involving the use of sustainable methods . * Carbon Footprint: a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide that is put into the atmosphere as a result of an individual's actions; driving, flying, home heating and cooling, as well as electricity use are some of the common activities that add to your carbon footprint. * Carbon Calculator: measures an individual's or institution's impact on the climate by estimating how many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases an individual's choices create each year. More than 90% of U.S. colleges and universities, and many outside the US, use the UNH Campus Carbon Calculator‚Äîthe tool previously recommended by the U.S. EPA, the ACUPCC, and others‚Äîto do their greenhouse gas inventories and climate action plans. * Carbon Credit: a permit that allows the holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide; credits are awarded to countries or groups that have reduced their greenhouse gases below their emission quota. Agreements and organizations in the United States American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment The American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC or PCC) is a project of Second Nature and AASHE. The organization consists of the text of an institutional commitment and the supporting informational and marketing materials surrounding the commitment. The mission of the organization is to \\"provides a framework and support for America‚Äôs colleges and universities to implement comprehensive plans in pursuit of climate neutrality.\\" The ACUPCC grew from concept to text during late 2006, and by March 2007 consisted of 157 signatories. The organization was officially unveiled in June 2007, and currently numbers 677 signatories. =Summary of ACUPCC text= The ACUPCC text can be summarized in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, in accordance with the many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps signatory institutions should take \\"in pursuit of climate neutrality.\\" The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) for the express purpose of guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving climate neutrality. This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete climate neutrality, intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate climate neutrality and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to LEED Silver standards or greater, purchasing Energy Star products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation. Finally, the reporting section of the three-part plan requires signatory institutions to make the details of their plans, inventories, and progress publicly available through AASHE. The final one-sentence paragraph of the text mentions the need to spread the knowledge contained in the commitment and recruit more signatories through institutional diplomacy. The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education A partner with Second Nature, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), was established in 2006 as the first professional higher education association for the campus sustainability community. AASHE works with all sectors of a campus in integrating sustainability in with campus governance, education, and research. Professional development is also emphasized through conferences, workshops, and networking. Press releases, blogs, and awards are coordinated to promote carbon reduction and sustainable awareness. AASHE facilitates the reporting system for the ACUPCC, which documents all committed tangible actions and as well as greenhouse gas reports, climate action plans, and progress reports. Second Nature Second Nature is a nonprofit organization that works with higher education leaders to incorporate sustainability in with the foundation of curriculum and practice within colleges and universities. Second Nature was among the first professional associations in sustainability, established in 1993 in Boston, Massachusetts. It is the primary supporter for the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). Its involvement in ACUPCC includes coordinating cooperative action in developing a carbon offset protocol for universities, as well as coordinating outreach for new presidents to make the commitment to carbon neutrality. = American University = In 2011, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) awarded American University a gold rating, the highest possible, on their STARS scale for sustainability. In the same year American University's School of International Service building received the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification for its 70,000 square foot building that is renowned for sustainable design and \\"cradle-to-cradle\\" philosophy. In 2014, American University ranked #2 in the Sierra Club's list of the 'Top 10 Greenest Colleges'. In 2014, the university announced an ambitious project to build a solar farm in partnership with George Washington University. As of January 2016, the completed solar farm provides an equivalent of 50% of the university's energy. In 2018, American University became the first university in the United States to reach carbon neutral status. =Cornell University= Cornell University has signed the President's Climate Commitment and pledged that its Ithaca campus will have net zero carbon-based emissions by 2050. Cornell has already completed a CO2 emission inventory and estimated that its carbon footprint for the year 2008 was 319,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent. Cornell has created 19 initiatives to help it achieve its goal of net zero emissions which consist of five main categories: green development, energy conservation, alternative transportation, using renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, and offsetting CO2 emissions. As part of its green development plan, Cornell wants ‚Äúnew buildings design[ed] to limit energy usage to 50 percent of the industry standard baseline.‚Äù In addition, Cornell is planning on converting some of its built land back into open space and decreasing the distance vehicles on campus need to travel. The energy conservation part of the plan includes switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs which would ‚Äúreduce annual electrical usage for campus lighting by 25 percent.\\" The university also plans to reduce the amount of coal it uses by replacing its old steam line piping so that it is more efficient. In order to achieve greener transportation, Cornell wants to reduce its employee use of single-occupant vehicles by 25 percent within 15 years. It wants to achieve this goal by increasing bicycle and transit travel. Cornell also wants to reduce carbon emissions by having business meetings conducted via teleconferences instead of having employees travel for business. Cornell wants to increase its reliance on renewable energy so it can decrease its reliance on fossil fuels. Cornell wants to use wood to replace ‚Äú10 percent of the coal burned in the two main Cornell solid fuel boilers.‚Äù Cornell is planning to take steps to offset its carbon emissions in order to become net carbon neutral, but it views this measure as a last resort because it would rather focus on reducing the amount of carbon it produces. The university wants to contribute to afforestation by turning some of its unused cropland and pastures into forests that will absorb CO2. Cornell wants to turn per year into forest for the next 10 years, which it estimates to offset 3,800 metric tons of CO2 per year. Additionally, established at Cornell is the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, an organization focused on multidisciplinary research in energy issues, the environment and economic development. =University of Florida= In October 2006, University of Florida President Bernard Machen became the first college president to sign the President's Climate Commitment. By signing, the University of Florida committed to developing an action plan for carbon neutrality with the ultimate goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. In 2007, the University of Florida held the first carbon neutral college football game in NCAA history with the University of Florida versus Florida State rivalry game. To accomplish this feat, scientists calculated the carbon footprint of the game.\\" They then offset the carbon emissions by working with foresters to set aside of rural North Florida land and then manage the land as a pine plantation forest for the next ten years. In 2008, the University of Florida partnered with the Neutral Gator Initiative to offset the carbon emissions from all of the home football games. In 2009, the University upped the standard and set out to offset the entire athletics program in order to have a carbon neutral athletics program. Neutral Gator The Neutral Gator Initiative was created by the organization Earth Givers along with the University of Florida to educate game day fans about sustainability and carbon neutrality as well as to offset the carbon emissions of the University of Florida's entire athletic program. The goal of Neutral Gator is to help the University of Florida achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. Neutral Gator offsets the carbon emissions through various activities including compact fluorescent light bulb exchanges, weatherization efforts in low-income households, and local as well as regional natural area restoration projects. Climate action plan After signing the President's Climate Commitment, the University of Florida was required to create a climate action plan detailing the steps the university will take to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The plan focuses on the following:  Clean Air-Cool Planet Clean Air-Cool Planet (CA-CP) was a Northeast-based nonprofit organization that was created in 2001. It partnered with colleges and universities (as well as other civil society institutions) to support their efforts toward carbon footprint reductions and ultimately, carbon neutrality. Before the establishment of the ACUPCC, the presidents of a number of leading Northeast schools signed Memorandums of Understanding with CA-CP, committing themselves to 1) conducting campus-wide greenhouse gas inventories; 2) setting reduction targets and timelines; 3) creating climate action plans; 4) implementing the carbon reduction measures contained in their plans; and 5) communicating with their students, faculty, staff and community members to \\"institutionalize\\" a culture of sustainability on their campuses. These schools, many of which became leading members of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment when it was established in 2006 and/or have driven innovation and demonstrated international leadership on the issue of climate change in other ways. The CA-CP Campus Climate Action Toolkit ‚Äî which included the CA-CP Campus Carbon Calculator developed by CA-CP in partnership with the University of NH ‚Äî was made available to the public in 2004. The Campus Carbon Calculator was downloaded by users at thousands of different institutions, which include not only colleges and universities but also hospitals, science centers, museums and aquaria, government agencies, k-12 schools and businesses, many of which are actively working toward campus carbon neutrality. More than 90% of U.S. colleges and universities, and many outside the US, use the calculator to do their greenhouse gas inventories and create climate action plans. In 2014, the University of New Hampshire's Sustainability Institute took over operations of Clean Air-Cool Planet. The CA-CP Campus Carbon Calculator became a part of the Carbon Management and Analysis Platform, or CarbonMAP. CarbonMAP has many resources and tools to help organizations calculate and track their carbon use online. Although the UNHSI Campus Carbon Calculator is still a widely used tool for calculating a campus' carbon footprint, it has received critiques. Some researchers believe that using carbon emissions as a single metric for campus climate change impact is outdated. They suggest that UNHSI would benefit from combining their carbon calculator with a nitrogen footprint calculator to most precisely estimate a campus' climate impact.  Campus leaders and student groups University and college leaders have taken action to reduce campus carbon emissions in the following ways: purchasing renewable energy credits, installing micro-wind turbines, retro commissioning HVAC systems, install geothermal or solar hot water systems, building co-generation electrical plants on campus, upgrading lighting on campus, establishing campus green teams, providing free public transportation for students, staff, and faculty, providing financial incentives for carpooling, implementing car-sharing and/or bike-sharing programs, and implementing campus shuttle services. Student clubs and organizations are active in raising awareness in various aspects of carbon neutrality. Climate change, sustainability practice, natural resource conservation, clean energy, and environmental policy are common focuses of student groups working toward carbon neutrality. In April of 2019, New York had the first college campus, Colgate University, to get their carbon emissions to zero. (Matt Zalaznick  January 24, and Matt Zalaznick. ‚ÄúHow More Colleges Achieve Carbon Neutrality .‚Äù University Business Magazine, 21 Feb. 2020, universitybusiness.com/colleges-achieve-carbon-neutral-net-zero- sustainability/.) Endowments Institute The Sustainable Endowments Institute (SEI) is a nonprofit organization created in 2005 that supports sustainable development for campus operation and endowment policy. The SEI focuses its efforts on various climate change initiatives, such as the College Sustainability Report Card and the Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program. = Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program = The Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program was started by the SEI and 15 other sustainability organizations to encourage colleges and universities to invest in green revolving funds. The program requires that institutions involved collaborate and engage with other institutions in order to reach a collective $1 billion of investments. The funds are then reinvested in green initiatives in participating campuses. As of 2016, 60 institutions are participating in the Billion Dollar Green Challenge and have committed $76 million toward green revolving funds. =College Sustainability Report Card= From 2007-2011, SEI released the College Sustainability Report Card, which identified the leading campus sustainability efforts in the US and Canada. Three hundred thirty two campuses were assessed via independent research and voluntary surveys, which included 48 indicators in nine categories: administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, green building, student involvement, transportation, endowment transparency, investment priorities, and shareholder engagement. Each category was given a grade (A-F), and an overall grade was awarded to the school. Profiles of the colleges and universities were published on the report card website. Each profile includes the overall grade, categorical grades, and a description of efforts in each category. The website aimed to identify leading colleges and universities, as well as provide information for other schools to learn and adopt sustainability policies used elsewhere. The Green Report Card was a highly regarded metric for campus sustainability, being used by researchers to assess environmentally-friendly campuses. However, the Green Report Card also garnered some criticism for being redundant with other ratings of sustainability, specifically the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) by AASHE. In March 2012, the Sustainability Endowments Institute suspended the College Sustainability Report Card program to focus on the Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program. =Brown University= Brown University is a leader when it comes to both campus sustainability and carbon neutrality. The university was one of only 26 universities across the country to receive an A- on the College Sustainability Report Card.Brown University is working with the Sidney E. Frank Foundation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program, named Community Carbon Use Reduction at Brown has received $350,000 and will help to reduce local carbon emissions through projects that will help meet the needs of Providence, Rhode Island neighborhoods while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The projects are created with the goals of: ‚ÄúProviding vibrant opportunities for learning for all those involved, engage non-university groups in thinking about how to increase the sustainability of the greater Providence area and its neighborhoods in a way that is responsive to the needs of the community, and lead to a measurable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\\" Brown University also has a plan to achieve carbon neutrality on campus. This plan entails carbon offset projects to ‚Äúreduce greenhouse gas emissions in the local community and purchase carbon offset contracts.\\" Additionally, Brown‚Äôs Energy and Environmental Advisory Committee is working to retrofit lights, motors, and mechanical equipment in existing buildings in order to reduce the university‚Äôs environmental impact and its carbon emissions. The University is also a member of the Rhode Island Student Climate Coalition which comprises five universities and nine high schools within the state of Rhode Island. The coalition is working to have a bill passed that would enable an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by the year 2050. Other organizations There are many organizations in coordination with Second Nature and AASHE. Some work to establish carbon-neutral goals within colleges and universities. These include the Disciplinary Associations Network for Sustainability (DANS), the Higher Education Associations Sustainability Consortium, and the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development, and ecoAmerica. International legislation and agreements Reducing carbon emissions has received international attention due to the theory that these emissions are one of the causes of global warming. There are national and internationally binding laws to try to reduce such greenhouse gases. If it were not for this legislation, universities would probably not be pushing for carbon neutrality themselves. Therefore, it is important to understand some of the key legislation when looking at how schools are trying to contribute to the solution. The Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that requires countries to commit to reducing the greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere. The protocol was created in Kyoto, Japan on December 11, 1997 and put into practice on February 16, 2005. The protocol targets industrialized countries because they are the ones producing most of the greenhouse gases. Specific chemicals that it wants to reduce are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, Sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. Thirty-seven industrialized countries and parts of Europe have signed and are bound by the agreement. The United States is not one of them. The Kyoto Protocol allots a specific amount of greenhouse gas emissions that each country can produce, however, countries can also trade emissions with other countries, resulting in the cap and trade system. If one country has not used up all of its allotted emissions, it can sell them to other countries that have gone over their limit. The Montreal Protocol The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international agreement that seeks to phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer. The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992. The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to phase out chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to phase-out chlorofluorocarbons by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to phase out this chemical. Other chemicals that it wanted to phase out were halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and methyl bromide. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol The Greenhouse Gas Protocol was created by the Climate Registry to establish a common method of reporting and measuring greenhouse gas emissions. Thirty-four U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, and one American Indian tribe have joined. Mexico, for example, is using the protocol a guideline for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its three-step plan, Mexico will have voluntary emissions reporting, then it will have a greenhouse gas cap, and finally it will follow a cap- and-trade system. In addition, ‚Äúforty-two of the largest corporations follow GHG Protocol standards.‚Äù Talloires Declaration The Talloires Declaration is the first official statement of a commitment to environmental sustainability in higher education. The declaration was made in 1990 at an international conference in France. The Talloires Declaration is an action plan consisting of ten points that aim to incorporate sustainability and environmental literacy in teaching, research, operations and outreach at universities. It was written with the premise that universities play a major role in the process of addressing and reversing the current trends of environmental changes because they prepare most of society's leaders and are therefore uniquely positioned to influence the direction that society takes. By signing the Talloires Declaration, a university agrees to: Climate Neutral Network The Climate Neutral Network is ‚Äúan initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme to promote global action to de-carbonize our economies and societies.\\" The initiative involves universities, colleges, and other academic institutions worldwide and its aim is to work together in order to transform so that they can have a zero emission future. Like the Presidential Climate Commitment, the Climate Neutral Network is designed with the premise that colleges and universities are vital components in addressing climate change \\"because they can model climate neutrality on their campuses, and they can teach their students skills and knowledge they need to address the climate crisis.\\" =University of Malaga (Spain)= University of M√°laga (UMA) announced its participation in UNEP's Climate Neutral Network in July 2009. As an urban campus, Malaga University has focused on building infrastructure and facilities for renewable energy production and fostering low-impact transportation to further its goals of being carbon neutral. In the realm of transit, the University plans on completing a subway line between the local city center and the University center by 2012, as well as facilitating the growth of bicycle and pedestrian portions of traffic. UMA has also planned or constructed installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic generation on its campus, and is currently constructing a photovoltaic installation aimed to produce one megawatt of energy for the school. The school is also investing in co- and tri-generation technologies that incorporate fuel-burning generation and secondary heat capture aided by geothermal heat. The campus' immediate goal is to rely entirely on sustainable sources of power. =Tongji University (China)= Tongji University in Shanghai, China was one of the first six schools to join the Climate Neutral Network. Tongji is using technology, management, and education and participation to meet its goal of using fewer resources. Tongji is saving energy by using solar water heating and re-using waste water in its bath house. Additional steps are being taken to save energy in many of the university‚Äôs buildings, such as ‚Äúlow-E windows, architectural sun shading, roof greening, and energy-saving lighting.‚Äù The Wenyuan building, for example, uses ‚Äúgeo-heat pumps, thermal insulation systems, rainwater collection and recycling systems.‚Äù The Tongji Fuel Cell Vehicle Engineering Center is helping to create fuel cell vehicles. These fuel cell powered sedans can travel 150 miles per hour and can ‚Äúcover up to 300 miles after one hydrogen charging.‚Äù =University of the West of England (UK)= University of the West of England is part of the Climate Neutral Network and with this, it is committed to reducing climate change. This entails reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so to accomplish this, the university developed a carbon management plan in partnership with Carbon Trust. The aim of the university‚Äôs carbon management plan is ‚Äúto use energy more efficiently to progressively reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to achieving the UK target of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\\" The critical objectives of the plan are to: \\"reduce energy use in buildings, including residential buildings; implement an energy awareness campaign; implement 80 percent of the technical carbon saving measures detailed in the Carbon Management Plan; aim to achieve BREEAM rating of at least ‚ÄúVery Good‚Äù for energy aspects of new buildings; and to consider the procurement of a proportion of electricity from renewable sources where economic to do so.\\" Additionally, the University of the West of England is a member of the West of England Carbon Challenge. As a member, the university has pledged to reduce its emissions over the course of four years in order to have an overall 10 percent decrease in emissions by 2012.

Biography Grodecki studied with the film direction faculty in the National Film School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ under the supervision of Wojciech Jerzy Has. The first step of his international career was directing the 1985 movie Him, which was produced by the University of Minnesota Film Society in collaboration with producer Albert Milgrom. In 1994 he made a documentary film about male child prostitution in the Czech republic, Not Angels But Angels, followed by another one on the same theme, Body Without Soul. The two documentaries feature graphic, sexually explicit footage of underage minors and the dissection of a corpse shot on location in Prague. In 1997, he made Mandragora, which is a dramatic story about a young man exploring the world of prostitution, drugs and AIDS. The film won many awards and was seen by V√°clav Havel, who wrote a letter to congratulate Grodecki personally. The letter from Havel praising Grodecki was published by the Czech newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. In 2004 Grodecki filmed Insatiability based on the novel by St.I.Witkiewicz (Witkacy). The film starred Cezary Pazura in three different roles (Zypcio's Father, his seducer Tengier and his commander Kocmoluchowicz). Insatiability premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2004 (in the official section: Panorama Special), where it received excellent reviews.

Both times he resigned from his position in protest against al-Maliki's sectarian agenda and political interference. He was nominated to serve as Prime Minister of Iraq in February 2020, but withdrew his nomination after failing to win a vote of confidence in the Parliament.  Education  Allawi studied Architectural Engineering at Baghdad University, when he left mid-way through his studies as he was wanted by the government of Saddam Hussein. He went into exile and moved to Lebanon in 1977, where he completed his education and obtained a degree in Architecture from the American University of Beirut in 1980. He then moved to the United Kingdom, where he gained citizenship.  Business  While in higher education he co-founded the Tawfiq Allawi Cable & Electric Wire Factory which manufactured various raw materials including marble, concrete and PVC. His factories were confiscated by the Iraqi government in 1997. Allawi went on to found a cereal bar factory and a software company in England and to work in property development in Lebanon, Morocco and the real estate market in the UK.  Interfaith International  Allawi joined Interfaith International, a Swiss based NGO that supported the human rights of Muslim minorities during the Yugoslav Wars.  Politics  Allawi participated in the Salah Al-Din Conference of opposition parties in 1992 and the London Conference in 2002. He was elected to the Council of Representatives of Iraq in the Iraqi parliamentary election of January 2005. He is a cousin of Ayad Allawi who founded the opposition Iraqi National Accord and went on to be the interim Prime Minister of Iraq from 2004 to 2005. In May 2006, Allawi was appointed Minister of Communications in the Al Maliki government. After fifteen months he withdrew from the government, citing the Prime Minister's practice of making appointments on a sectarian basis.Three ministers to quit Iraqi Cabinet, Taipei Times, 2007-08-25, accessed on 26 August 2007 He rejoined parliament and remained in opposition for the remainder of the government's term.Iraq Telecoms 2009 speakers , Government of Iraq, 10 November 2009 He returned as Minister of Communications in the newly formed government in 2010, but also resigning after citing the interference of prime minister Nouri al-Maliki in his ministry. He has since remained as a public commentator on Iraqi political affairs, with a series of articles published in Iraqi media outlets and on his blog.  Minister of Communications  Allawi was twice minister of communications, from May 2006 until August 2007, and from 2010 to 2012. Both times he resigned from his position in protest against al-Maliki's sectarian agenda and political interference. One of Allawi's key policies was rooting out corruption. As communications minister, he implemented a policy that imposed strict anti-bribery terms on every company contracting with the ministry. These terms included that if the company was discovered to have paid a bribe to anyone in the ministry, a fine worth 30% of the contract would be imposed on the contracting company and the company would be blacklisted (preventing it from contracting with any government entity for three years). 2020 Prime Minister appointment Allawi was appointed prime minister of Iraq on 1 February 2020 in the context of the Iraqi protests of 2019‚Äì20, replacing Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who had remained as caretaker prime minister for two months after resigning in response to the protests. Allawi's appointment as prime minister came as a result of nearly 4 months of Iraqi protests which were marred by more than 600 deaths amongst unarmed peaceful protestors outcried by the Iraqi civil society & the international community alike. His appointment was met with a popular uproar amongst Iraqi protesters for his perceived affiliation with the same root causes that triggered the October 2019 Iraqi protests including ' dissatisfaction with the country's political elite's mismanagement of the Iraq's economy and multiple catastrophic security disasters over a 16 year span including the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and systemic widespread corruption which resulted in Iraq's rank as one of the most corrupt governments in the world for nearly 16 consecutive years. On 1 March 2020, Allawi withdrew his candidacy after parliament failed for the second time in a week to approve his cabinet. Personal life He is a cousin of Ayad Allawi.

He was the son of Elisha Cooke Sr. (1637‚Äì1715), a wealthy Massachusetts physician and politician who was elected Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1683. He graduated from Harvard University in 1697.https://archive.org/stream/thepoliticalcare00pyne/thepoliticalcare00pyne_djvu.txt Like his father, the junior Cooke was the leader of the \\"popular party\\", a faction in the Massachusetts House that resisted encroachment by royal officials on colonial rights embodied in the Massachusetts Charter. As such, he was involved in contentious disputes with several colonial governors. When the House selected Cooke as its Speaker in 1720, Governor Samuel Shute dissolved the House and called for new elections. Cooke and the House insisted on the right to choose their own Speaker, to no avail. Cooke was one of the richest men in the province, with an estate valued at his death in 1737 at ¬£63,000. He was a heavy drinker, and the owner of the Goat Tavern on King Street. There is strong evidence to suggest that the Boston Caucus was established around 1719 by Elisha Cooke Jr. According to Peter Oliver, the last chief justice of Massachusetts before the revolution, the caucus spent huge amounts of money on liquor to win elections in the 1720s. Cooke seems to also have had much influence in the marked relaxation in liquor licensing in the 1720s, which was popular with large numbers of voters. According to the historian G.B. Warden, Elisha Cooke Jr. \\"contributed more than anyone else to the public life of colonial Boston.\\" Cooke worked closely with Samuel Adams Sr. (1689‚Äì1748), whose son Samuel Adams would continue the struggle to defend colonial rights, ultimately leading to the American Revolution.

The company's sectors of interest include clean technology, software, semiconductors, medical technology, telecommunications, defence and aerospace. Today, the combined annual revenues of the companies established by Elron are approximately $5 billion. History Early years Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil, with the support of Dan Tolkowsky of the Discount Investment Corporation. Uzia Galil graduated from the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in 1947, and in 1948 joined the Israel Navy as an officer responsible for maintaining its Radio systems. In 1952 Uzia was sent to study for a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in the United States. During his studies in the United States, he worked at Motorola's research lab and was part of a team that developed of one of the world's first colour televisions. But in 1954 he had to return to Israel to complete another 4 years of service in Navy, which financed his studies. Founding Elron Uzia Galil short experience working for Motorola in the United States exposed him to the technology industry and he decided to establish Israel's first high tech Startup company. He started the company, while still serving in Navy, in a friend's (Benjamin Sandller) flat in Haifa, later joined by another friend (Gideon Kirshner), who was a teacher at the Haifa Technical High-School, and worked with them in his spare time. The company's first products were measurement instruments for medical and electronic applications. In 1958 Uzia left the Navy, however the company did not generate enough revenues and he got a job at the Physics laboratory of the Technion; while there Moshe Arens, who was Professor of Aeronautics at the time, introduced him to Dan Tolkowsky. Dan, who was fascinated by Uzia's ideas, managed to convince the board of Discount Investment Corporation to provide the capital required to properly fund the company. Elron was officially formed in 1962 with an initial capital of $US 160,000, and within 3 years generated annual revenues of $1 millions. First joint venture ‚Äì Elbit Computers Ltd. In 1966, Shimon Peres, who at the time was the deputy defence minister, visited Elron and Uzia convinced him to establish a new company that will develop minicomputers for defence applications. The new company, initially called Elbit Computers, was a joint venture with the Israel's Ministry of Defence and Elron (each holding 50% of the company). The company launched its first product in 1967 the Elbit-100 minicomputer. The company evolved through the years to become the multinational defence electronics company ‚Äì Elbit Systems (). Founding Elscint In 1969, Uzia convinced a talented engineer, Avraham Suhami, who just completed his PhD at the Technion, to join him and start a new company that will focus on the development of medical and scientific solutions, a new company - Elscint, a contraction of the words \\"electronic\\" and \\"scientific\\", was established again with the support of Dan Tolkowsky. The company developed medical imaging equipment, such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1972 Elscint was the first Israeli company to have an initial public offering on NASDAQ. By 1996, Elscint's revenues reached $311 million. Growth during the 1980s and 1990s In 1981 Elron was involved in the establishment of a company that will later become Orbotech () a manufacturer of equipment for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), TFT& LCD Display assembly industries. In 1983 Uzia met by chance, while waiting for a flight in the lounge of Ben Gurion International Airport, Levy Gerzberg an academic from Stanford University, who in 1981 founded Zoran Corporation (Zoran stands for \\"silicon\\" in Hebrew), which develops digital signal processing solutions. At the time Levy Gerzberg was looking for additional funding, which Elron was able to provide. In 1995, Zoran had an initial public offering on NASDAQ () and later was the leading provider of complete OEM solutions for consumer electronics products, such as DVD and digital cameras, with annual revenues of over $500 million in 2007. In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies: * Elbit Medical Imaging - during 1999 and 2000 both Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems, for approximately $600 million. * Elbit Systems ‚Äì Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit and had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ. * Elbit - which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator . In 2002 Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003-2006 for approximately $160 million. In 1998, Given Imaging (), a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics, was founded. 2000s During the 2000s, Elron started operating less as holding company and moved to act more as a venture capital fund, jointly investing in numerous start-up companies and realizing the investment by selling the companies or conducting an initial public offering. Notable investments and investment exits include: * Elron Software - a provider of spam, email and web filtering solutions, sold to Zix Corp. * Oren Semiconductor - a fabless integrated circuits manufacturer that designs and develops integrated circuits for the digital television and set-top box markets, sold to Zoran Corporation. * Galil Medical - a developer of cryotherapy solutions. * SELA Semiconductor Engineering Laboratories - a provider of automated sample preparation tools for semiconductor manufacturers, sold to Camtek Intelligent Imaging. * 3DV Systems - developers of the ZCam, a time-of-flight camera products for video applications, sold to Microsoft. Alt URL * Medingo - developer of a micro pump insulin delivery system consists of two parts: a semi-disposable insulin dispensing patch and a remote control, which allows for discreet personalised insulin delivery. The company was sold to Hoffmann-La Roche's subsidiary Roche Diagnostics for $160 million as well as up to $40 million in milestone payments. * Safend - a leading provider of endpoint data protection solutions was sold to Wave Systems. * Wavion - a provider of outdoor Wi-Fi applications for metro and rural areas, acquired by Alvarion. Current holdings In 2012, Elron celebrated its 50th anniversary and announced that it is refocusing solely on Medical Devices investment.

Life According to Houbraken, he learned to paint from his father Pieter van Bronckhorst, who died when he was thirteen. The young Bronckhorst was sent to work as a pastry baker for a cousin in Haarlem. He drew as a hobby, and it remained a hobby until he moved back to Hoorn to get married. Work He specialized in painting plants, birds, and insects.

The adult beetles are about 8 mm long and beetles in different regions can have different colour patterns on their elytra. Colour forms and host plants Beetles from different populations can be distinct in their biology, like coloration or behaviour. The larvae and adults from northern Europe (e.g. Finland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, and the Baltic states) feed and oviposit only on some willow species. The Central European populations, which are patchily distributed in Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, northern Italy and France, are mostly monophagous on birch. Development of the insect is impaired if beetles are reared on their non-natural host, that is beetles from northern Europe are fed with birch leaves, or beetles from Central Europe with willow leaves. The elytra colouration consists of red and black marks. Black marks predominate in the northern populations while in the central European population the colours red and black are about equally represented on the elytra. The darker forms heat up more quickly and might be an adaptation to the colder environment in northern Europe. Pest status In the Kola Peninsula of north-west Russia, outbreaks of Chrysomela lapponica resulted in severe defoliation of the willow species Salix borealis in August 1993 and then again in 1994 and 1995. Studies showed that plants stressed by defoliation the previous year were less favourable for the development of the leaf beetles. Therefore, the decline of the outbreaks appears to be linked to the development of resistance in the willow hosts. Natural enemies Like other insects, Chrysomela lapponica is attacked by a variety of natural enemies, mainly other types of insects which prey on or parasitize the larvae. Chrysomela lapponica has developed defenses against such natural enemies. The larvae possess defensive glands filled with volatile compounds which deter attacking natural enemies and have antimicrobial activity. There are also differences in the chemical composition of these defensive compounds among geographically separated populations, apparently linked to the host plant the beetles feed on. Although the defensive compounds are usually repellents, some natural enemies are actually attracted to them and use them to locate their prey or host. This has been shown for the predaceous hoverfly Parasyrphus nigritarsis and the phorid fly Megaselia opacicornis.

It is based on the true story of Mary Draper Ingles and her struggles during the French-Indian War. The film tells the story of Mary Draper Ingles and others in her settlement being taken captive to the Ohio Country by Shawnee Indian Warriors, and her journey home as she escaped from the tribe. Background The 7 Years War, better known as the French-Indian War, was a conflict between the French, British, and Native Americans over land. English land speculators encouraged people to move west and build farms. Mary Draper Ingles‚Äô family was one of many who were recruited to move west of the mountains. As more English settlers moved west towards their lands and hunting grounds; Native American tribes revolted. They invaded English settlements, including that of Mary Draper Ingles. Plot The movie begins in the summer of 1755, with a terrible attack on Drapers Meadow by the Shawnee Indian Warriors. Many people were killed in the attack, including Mary Draper Ingles‚Äô mother, and her sister-in-law‚Äôs baby whose head was bashed against the side of a house. Mary, her two boys, and her sister in law were taken captive by the Shawnee on a long journey west to Ohio Country. Mary tried to remember important landmarks along the way in case they had a chance to escape. She tied knots in her sash each day to keep track of how long they were gone. By the end of the second day of their journey, they reached the point where Indian Creek flows into the New River. The Shawnee had two canoes secreted at the riverbank, which they used to carry captives and stolen food. The Shawnee swam with the horses. That night they camped west of the New River. At this time Will and John, Mary‚Äôs husband and brother, were setting out to rescue the captives. Mary was pregnant during the time of the trip so she had to stop and give birth alongside the river. After, they continued their trip over Flat Top Mountain and along Paint Creek. The next stop they made was at a salt spring at Canal River to make salt. When they reached the Shawnee town which was by the Ohio and Scioto River, the warriors were welcomed home. There was a big celebration that lasted late into the night. The next morning all the captives except Mary were forced to run the gauntlet by the Shawnee. After the gauntlet, things got worse for the captives. Mary‚Äôs two boys and her sister in law were taken away. Mary had to give her baby to a caretaker named Sauwaseekau, so that she could work making shirts for the Shawnee. She was an excellent seamstress and was paid well. When Mary asked how much it would cost to get freedom for her children, she was told that she and her children were to become Shawnee. The Shawnee started sending Mary and an Old Dutch woman out on daily trips to look for berries. Because they were alone, Mary started thinking they could escape. In preparation, they stole a little extra food each day before the trip. Mary left her baby with Sauwaseekau because she knew the baby could not survive the long journey home. Mary and the old Dutch woman set out on the trip, knowing they could not return to the Shawnee or they would be facing death. Mary and the old Dutch woman navigated themselves by the rivers. Neither of them could swim, so they had to go around the rivers making their trip even longer. After a while, hunger took toll on them, and the old Dutch woman tried to eat Mary. Mary escaped from her and found a canoe buried under leaves alongside the river. She used it to cross the river and keep distance between her and the old Dutch woman. They continued on their journey and from time to time saw each other traveling on the other side of the river and encouraged each other to keep going. After 43 days and 800 miles, Mary had arrived home to her husband, brother, and friends. Theme We all should face troublesome times with faith, courage, and perseverance.

Jude became interested with the story of Mary Draper Ingles after the disaster on September 11th, and began writing the screenplay in 2002.

HFAP also accredits mental health and physical rehabilitation facilities and provides certification for primary stroke centers. HFAP was founded in 1943 by the American Osteopathic Association, a medical organization representing osteopathic physicians. History HFAP was established in 1943 by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and began surveying hospitals in 1945. Initially, HFAP provided osteopathic hospitals with accreditation ensuring osteopathic residents received appropriate training. In the mid-1960s the United States Congress decided that accredited hospitals would meet conditions set for participation, and thus automatically participated in newly established Medicare and Medicaid programs. HFAP quickly applied for and was granted said status in 1965. By 2012, HFAP accredited about 214 hospitals in the US. In 2015, ownership of HFAP moved from the AOA to the Accreditation Association for Hospitals/Health Systems (AAHHS).

This role was taken up by his son, Elisha Cooke Jr. Life Cooke was born in Boston, the son of Richard and Elizabeth Cook, from Gloucestershire, England. He graduated from Harvard College in 1657 at age 20, in a class of seven students. Cooke was trained and practiced as a physician, but he also became a politician. He was made freeman in 1673. He was elected to the colonial assembly representing Boston in 1681, serving until 1683. Cooke was elected to the commission of counsellors in May 1693; however, Governor Sir William Phips refused to ratify the choice, to exact revenge on Cooke's having opposed his appointment as chief magistrate. In 1695 Cooke was appointed Judge of the Superior Court, taking the place of John Richards, who had died, and in 1701 he became Judge of Probate. Cooke was a confidential adviser of Lord Bellomont, who became Governor of Massachusetts in 1699. He lost his judicial appointments in 1702 when Joseph Dudley became governor; Dudley took revenge on Cooke for being a member of the council which had committed him to prison in 1689. This had occurred after the 1689 Boston revolt, which deposed Sir Edmund Andros, governor of the Dominion of New England, and other officials (including Dudley). Cooke served on the rebel council that took power after the dominion's overthrow. Cooke married Elizabeth Leverett, the daughter of Governor John Leverett in June 1668. They had one son, Elisha Jr., who was born on December 20, 1678. Elizabeth died on July 21, 1715, and Cooke died shortly thereafter on October 31, 1715.

It is a hydrocarbon with formula C8H12, or C2(C2H4)3. Its molecule has three rings with four carbon atoms each, sharing one C‚ÄìC bond. This compound is unstable (although not as much as [1.1.1]propellane; however it is less persistent than [1.1.1]propellane). The bond angles on the shared carbons are considerably strained: three of them are close to 90¬∞, the other three to 120¬∞. The strain energy is estimated to be 93 kcal/mol (390 kJ/mol). Synthesis [2.2.2]Propellane was first synthesized in 1973 by the group of Philip Eaton (who had earlier obtained cubane), according to the following scheme: :Synthesis of the [2.2.2]propellane skeleton. The synthesis begins with photochemical [2+2]cycloaddition of ethylene on the cyclohexene derivative 1 to produce the bicyclic compound 2, followed by elimination reaction with potassium t-butoxide of acetic acid to cyclobutene 3, followed by another cycloaddition with ethylene to 4. This compound is converted to the diazo ketone 5 by deprotonation (using acetic acid and sodium methoxide) and reaction with tosyl azide. The ketone then undergoes Wolff rearrangement to ketene 6. Ozonolysis forms the ketone 7, another diazotation yields the diazo ketone 8, which undergoes Wolff rearrangement again to the ketene 9. Reaction with dimethylamine affords the [2.2.2]propellane backbone with a dimethylamide substituent 10. The final product 10 was found to spontaneously isomerize in solution to the monocyclic amide 11, with a half-life of 28 minutes at room temperature. Derivatives A highly fluorinated [2.2.0]propellane was also synthesized by the group of David Lemal.

In the episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents investigate the murders of several child molesters while a pair of mathematicians prepare to say goodbye to a friend. Stories about child molesters and his own experiences as a parent inspired series writer Don McGill to write the episode. \\"Killer Chat\\" also serves as the final episode of series regular Peter MacNicol before his stint on 24. As a way to send MacNicol's character, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt, off, producers and McGill sent his character into space and asked astronaut Buzz Aldrin to appear in the episode. Due to production constraints, director Chris Hardwell had to shoot one of Larry's first scenes in the episode as MacNicol's final scene. \\"Killer Chat\\" first aired in the United States on December 15, 2006. Fans and several members of the crew found themselves opposing the episode's gore. In contrast, critics gave the episode positive reviews. Plot summary Child molester John Santos (Ray Torres) is found tied to a chair and beaten to death in a vacant house up for sale, the third such victim in the past six weeks. Since a serial killer is suspected, the FBI is called in to assist with the investigation. Meanwhile, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) prepares for his upcoming mission to the International Space Station, which he learned some time earlier that he would be a participant in. Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Larry's friend and colleague, returns Larry's lucky t-shirt, which Larry had given to Charlie to keep during Larry's mission. FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) calls in Charlie and Larry for their assistance. The team learns that the three victims have been using a chat room to lure their victims and have all contacted the same chatter. FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) interview the first victim's wife, Mrs. Elaine Tillman (Robin Weigert), who denies any knowledge of her husband's online activities. Charlie suggests using a multi-attribute composition model to find the type of house that the killer would most likely use. While Charlie, Larry, and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's girlfriend and colleague, develop their model, Larry receives a phone call informing him that he is no longer a part of the mission. At Charlie's house, Charlie and Amita learn from Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, that a MIT professor had asked NASA to look into Larry's recent behavior. As a result of Larry's homelessness, NASA decided to pull Larry from the mission. FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) take Brendan McCrary (George Newbern), a frequent visitor in the chat room that the molesters used, into custody. When the team questions McCrary, they learn, and further investigation confirms, that McCrary joined an online group which attempts to peacefully catch child molesters after his daughter, Katie, was raped and murdered by one, and he has an alibi for two of the murders. While working on their model, Charlie tells Amita that he feels bad for being happy that Larry was not going to space, and Amita tells Charlie that he should not beat himself up over his emotions. Their analysis soon reveals that the killer's preferred houses are located in Megan's Law and Jessica's Law zones. David finds online videos of the molesters' confessions taped just before their murders. While attempting to trace the source of the videos, Charlie finds one uploading as the agents discuss the case and uses onion routing to trace the live feed. Unknown to Charlie, the killer piggybacked the system, causing Charlie to send the agents to an address two blocks from the site of the latest murder. Later, Charlie suggests using the syntax of the chats to determine if McCrary or any of his relatives, who would have similar syntax to McCrary, could have contacted the victims. Meanwhile, Larry expresses his disappointment about the mission to Megan, and Megan asks Charlie to help Larry fulfill his dream. While Megan brings the files containing the chats to Charlie, she and Amita overhear Charlie vouching for Larry to someone at the NSA. Larry later thanks Charlie for persuading NASA officials to allow Larry to be on the mission. Using the information from Charlie's analysis, Don visits the McCrary family. He learns that McCrary's son Matt (Johnny Simmons) thought that his family was not doing enough to stop molesters after what happened to his sister, so Matt contacted someone in an online support group for families affected by sexual predators to discuss non-violent ways of vengeance. He also gave them the names and contact information of predators that his father was investigating, but he swears that he didn't know they were going to be tortured and killed and is horrified that he was an accessory to murder. Megan interviews Mrs. Tillman again and realizes that her husband, Scott, molested their daughter. The team learns of a new victim and finds the house where he is being held. Inside, they find the victim being held hostage by Mrs. Tillman. Megan convinces Mrs. Tillman to surrender peacefully by promising that the molester will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, because there was enough evidence to convict him of his crimes, and the agents arrest both people. After the arrest, Charlie and the team say goodbye to Larry at the office. Megan and Larry say goodbye near the walkway, where Buzz Aldrin appears to escort Larry to the launch. On launch day, everyone gathers at the house to watch the launch, with both Eppes brothers toasting Larry seconds before liftoff. Production Casting While filming Numb3rs, series regular Peter MacNicol accepted a role on the television series 24. Since he only wanted to be on the show for half a season, he spent the first 11 episodes of Numb3rs filming both series. MacNicol left Numb3rs after 11 episodes to continue with his role on 24. When filming \\"Killer Chat\\", there was some question as to whether MacNicol would return to the series since he also wanted to produce a film during his absence from Numb3rs. To send off MacNicol's character, the creators and producers decided to ask a real astronaut to appear on the show. They asked Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Captain Jim Lovell, a fan of the show who had a previously scheduled event during \\"Killer Chat\\"'s filming schedule, to make the appearance. Upon hearing other people's reviews of the show, Aldrin agreed to make the appearance. His role was to escort Larry to the shuttle mission. Writing Series writer Don McGill wrote \\"Killer Chat\\". After reading about sex predators who were victimized by sexual molestation themselves, McGill wanted to explore the effects of molestation on the victims' and the predators' families. As a parent, he also wanted to demonstrate a balance between his feelings about sexual molestation and how the law treats the criminals. He asked series researcher Andrew Black to find chats where predators contacted children. Using the chats, McGill modified them to include leetspeak and included a part where Charlie discussed analyzing the texts to determine the identity of the suspected killer. Black and McGill also incorporated onion routing into the script. Originally, the technique was to be included in the previous episode \\"Brutus\\", but, due to the complexity of the topic, it never made it into the script. They instead decided to use onion routing in \\"Killer Chat\\". McGill wanted to use a \\"trawling algorithm\\", a way to catch an online identity that is hidden by Internet encryption. Black and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) computer science professor Steven Lowe developed a mathematical algorithm to stand in for McGill's trawling algorithm. For the metaphor to be used to describe how onion routing works, Lowe suggested comparing onion routing to nestled envelopes. During the early phases of writing the script, McGill told Black that Charlie was going to analyze crime scenes with no other commonalities between them other than they are empty houses. Black suggested using multi-attribute compositional modeling. Since \\"Killer Chat\\" also was MacNicol's last Numb3rs episode, McGill had to juxtaposition the crime with MacNicol's departure. The producers wanted a farewell that was fitting for Larry and that would allow for him to return. Knowing that Larry's dream was to go into space, the producers contacted NASA about the requirements of being an astronaut. The writers decided to send Larry off aboard the space shuttle. For Larry's final scene toward the end of the episode, series executive producer Barry Schindel suggested the Right Stuff-type scene. Filming Before he directed the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five weeks on the Numb3rs set watching the cast and crew film the series. While filming, he gave the writers some insight into his direction. Since series regular Diane Farr was five months pregnant at the time, Hardwell filmed around her belly. He also directed guest star Robin Weigert to act like the perfect housewife in order to disguise the plot twist. Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage. Due to production constraints, the first scene shot was the scene where the agents and Charlie said goodbye to Larry at the FBI office. MacNicol's last filmed scene was set toward the beginning of the episode when Charlie and Larry discussed using multi-attribute compositional modeling to determine the commonalities of the houses. For MacNicol and series regular David Krumholtz, filming became emotional as the episode paralleled real life. Prior to Numb3rs, they had developed a friendship when they worked together while filming the movie Addams Family Values. Reception Over 11.23 million people watched \\"Killer Chat\\". As it was a violent episode, fans protested the amount of gore featured. While filming, several people on the set questioned the amount of blood shown in the episode. Critically, the episode was very well received. Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict called the episode \\"well plotted, engaging\\". Donald Liebenson, an Amazon.com editor, stated that \\"Killer Chat\\" was \\"compelling\\". In their article \\"Pop CSI: How Science Conquered TV\\", Popular Science described how Andrew Black incorporated the math for the episode into Don McGill's script.

The 2005 production Feelings Struggle directed by Ashraf Ssemwogerere is credited with being the first Ugawood film. Many have asserted that this steadily growing film industry is derived from Hollywood, in the same manner as Nollywood and Bollywood. In a story that ran in a local newspaper in Uganda about the naming of the industry, filmmakers Kuddzu Isaac, Matt Bish and Usama Mukwaya were quoted as saying that Ugawood would be the most appropriate name for the industry. Audiences go to video halls where narrators called \\"video jokers\\" translate the dialogue and add their own commentary. Patrons also rent DVDs and watch feature films on prime- time TV. Some films are funded by NGOs through cultural grants. Other films are produced with DIY equipment and low production budgets. Despite low production budgets, Uganda's film industry is quite productive. Isaac Nabwana's Ramon Film Productions, based in Wakaliga near Kampala, has produced more than 40 low-budget action films over the last 10 years. The studio is best known for its 2010 film Who Killed Captain Alex?, which cost $85 to produce. The Industry also has a strong and acclaimed film player since 2013.

Early life William Richard Sutton was born in 1833 at London's Cheapside. Career Sutton founded the business of Sutton and Co., general carriers in 1861. He noted that the Royal Mail could carry letters from door to door, but they did not carry parcels; instead the sender had to arrange for delivery to a railway station, goods freight to a station near the destination, and then make separate arrangements for delivery to the final destination. Sutton Carriers would take care of all those stages. The railway companies obstructed this and Sutton took them to court with a case that lasted over seven years; the House of Lords ruled to break the railway companies' monopoly on pricing and allowed him to deliver packages door-to- door. At his death in 1900 his business had grown to 600 branches. Sutton Carriers was eventually nationalised in the 1950s. Sutton also had a partnership in Sutton, Carden and Co. which was a brewer, bottler, distiller, hotelier and merchant of wines, tea, coffee, and tobacco. Death and legacy Sutton died at his home in Adelaide Crescent, Hove, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. His will bequeathed almost all of his considerable wealth into philanthropic trusts for housing of the poor, although during his life he had held no public office and did no charity work. His will was disputed by his family and by existing large landlords, among them the London County Council, who were worried that these cheap and desirable dwellings would lead to lower rents. Nonetheless, his will was proved and The Sutton Model Dwellings Trust (now known as Clarion Housing Group) built estates for the poor across England, beginning in Bethnal Green, then Chelsea, Islington, Rotherhithe, Plymouth and Birmingham.

Paralleling the Warren Jeffs and David Koresh cases, the episode features Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and mathematicians attempting to locate and arrest the leader of a polygamist cult in which members marry young girls. Julie H√©bert, a series writer, incorporated slave quilts and Levy flight into her script. She also included two explosions in the script. The episode marked H√©bert's directorial debut. Although initially averse to the prospect of directing a script that she wrote, she agreed to direct it. The episode reunited her with actors Teri Polo and Joshua Malina, both with whom she had worked before. \\"Nine Wives\\" first aired in the United States on January 5, 2007. Critics gave the episode positive reviews. Plot summary A traveler finds an unconscious young girl beside a road. California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Agent Rachael Willions (Teri Polo) tells FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) that the girl is Josephine Kirtland (Alexandra Krosney), the 73rd wife of Abner Stone (W. Earl Brown), the leader of a polygamist cult called the Apostolic Saints. Drs. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Don's brother and a FBI math consultant, and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's girlfriend and colleague, receive Don's call for assistance while traveling to Stanford University to attend a mathematics conference. Charlie and Amita find six likely areas from where Josephine could have come. Using satellite photographs of the areas from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Don and FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) narrow the number of areas down to a tract of land with a trailer on it. When FBI Special Agent Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) and a FBI SWAT team go to the trailer, they find the trailer booby-trapped and empty, with the exception of a blanket with Aramaic characters and lines on it and a donation jar. Willions talks to Josephine at the hospital and finds Emmanueline Kirtland (Anne Dudek), Josephine's mother, there. Emmanueline expresses her displeasure of Josephine's preference of dating a young man who was no longer a part of the cult, Lee Brady (John Patrick Amedori), to being Stone's wife. Josephine leaves the hospital with Lee and calls the FBI 45 minutes later, reporting that her mother is missing and there is blood in the kitchen. The FBI is concerned Josephine and Lee may have done something to Emmanueline because of the length of time between when they left the hospital and when they called. Upon questioning at the FBI office, Lee insists that he and Josephine went out to get hamburgers and has the receipt to prove it. Josephine and Lee both insist they were planning on running away together, and that's why they left the hospital. Meanwhile, Don learns that Willions was a member of the cult for 6 years before leaving (from 13 to 19 years of age), explaining both her ability to communicate with the Kirtlands and her desire to capture Stone. Upon their arrival back in Los Angeles to see the results of their assistance, Charlie and Amita unintentionally interrupt Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Charlie and Don's father, and Dr. Millie Finch (Kathy Najimy)'s date at Charlie's house. After applying Wright's equation to their analysis, Charlie and Amita, along with Millie, who had suggested the equation while leaving the house, realize that Stone is revising his genealogy to remove any references to his sterility created by inbreeding within the cult. Charlie and Amita also realize that, since she is not biologically related to him, Stone's next potential wife is Emmanueline Kirtland, Josephine's mother and, as the analysis demonstrates, half-sister. Meanwhile, Stone kidnaps Emmanueline. A fellow cult member fatally shoots a California Highway Patrol officer who had stopped the van they are traveling in for a traffic violation. Megan breaks the news of Emmanueline's kidnapping to Josephine and Lee and asks them where Stone would likely take Emmanueline. They tell Megan that Stone wanted to build a new community in either California or Canada. Don gives Charlie a MP3 player that the FBI found at the scene of the shooting. While listening to Stone's podcasts to find a likely location, Charlie finds a location in Southern California and gives the information to Don. Stone gathers several members of the cult at the location and, upon the FBI's arrival at the site, orders a shootout. During the shootout, Willions is shot in the shoulder and is rescued. Don tries to negotiate with Stone. Stone instead walks out of the building with Emmanueline and sets fire to the house, killing the remaining people inside. Don and the team take Stone into custody and rescues Emmanueline. At the house, Alan and Charlie discuss the fact that Stone took advantage of people's spiritual searches to further his agenda. Depressed about the case's outcome, Don joins Alan and Charlie at the house. Production Writing Series writer/producer Julie H√©bert decided to base a script on the fundamentalist polygamous groups and cults found in 12 states. According to series creator/executive producer Cheryl Heuton, the case featured in the episode paralleled both the Warren Jeffs case and the Waco incident. The leader of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints (FLDS), a polygamous sect of the Mormons, Warren Jeffs was accused of raping two minors and of conspiracy to commit rape near Colorado City, Arizona, in 2002. In 2005, a grand jury in Mohave County, Arizona, indicted Jeffs on the charges, and the United States District Court in Flagstaff, Arizona, issued a federal arrest warrant 18 days after the indictment. H√©bert developed the story first and then asked researchers to find information about searches. One of the ideas the researchers found that she incorporated into the script was Levy flight. While others questioned whether the audience-vision, a graphical representation of the math used, was to be delivered by a man, H√©bert insisted on Amita delivering the audience- vision. H√©bert also incorporated slave quilts into the script. H√©bert designed the patterns, using large letters to indicate males and small stitches to indicate females. Casting notes Teri Polo, Joshua Molina, and W. Earl Brown guest starred in the episode. Polo and series regular Rob Morrow had worked together on Northern Exposure, and H√©bert worked with her on The West Wing. Casting director Mark Saks wanted Polo to be in the episode, but he was not sure if she was interested. Upon calling her, he learned that she was a fan of the series. Molina had been in the Numb3rs episode \\"Waste Not\\", which was also written by H√©bert. He and H√©bert had worked together on The West Wing. W. Earl Brown previously starred in Deadwood. Due to his appearance, he was cast as Abner Stone. Molina and Polo also appeared together in several episodes of the ABC show \\"Sports Night.\\" Filming H√©bert had written several scripts, including \\"Nine Wives\\", for Numb3rs. \\"Nine Wives\\" marked her directorial debut on the series. Although she was open to directing another writer's script, series executive producer Barry Schindel suggested that she directed the episode. For the scenes set in the Eppes' family garage, H√©bert removed the back wall of the garage to obtain a specific camera angle. She also had to rework the walls of the hospital set to facilitate movement through the hallways. To hide series regular Diane Farr's pregnancy, she used a folder and a bag made from a material that was not supposed to make a sound when folding it. Ironically, the bag did not stay folded during filming. During the writing of the episode, H√©bert consulted fellow series writer Robert Port for information about explosives and included two scenes in the episode. One was at a trailer in the wilderness near Santa Clarita, California. Using a bicycle and a shotgun, Tom Bellissimo, Numb3rs' special effects supervisor, built the booby trap for the explosion at the trailer. Christy Somner, California's first female pyrotechnician, assisted Bellissimo, and stunt coordinator Jim Vickers pulled the door to the trailer once filming was underway. Four cameras captured the scene, which took three to four takes to film. The other scene was shot at a compound that was built in the 1950s. Bellissimo used 60 explosives inside the house to set off the explosion. He also used propane to prevent a fire. The film crew filmed the indoor scenes first and then shot the outdoor scenes. To create the illusion that Stone and Emmanueline were closer to the house than they were, the crew used a long-lens camera to shoot the explosion. Reception Critically, the episode received positive reviews. IGN.com rated \\"Nine Wives\\" as the best episode of the week in their \\"Crime Time\\" countdown. Jeffrey Robinson, a reviewer for DVD Talk, highlighted \\"Nine Wives\\" as an excellent episode, stating that it \\"revisits a somewhat common cult theme to crime-dramas\\".

Description Neviusia cliftonii is an erect deciduous shrub reaching 2.5 meters in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are oval or heart shaped and lined with toothed lobes. The leaf blades reach 6 centimeters long and are borne on short petioles. The inflorescence is an umbel-like cluster of 3 to 5 flowers. The flower is a ball of about 50 long, whiskery white stamens each about half a centimeter long. There are rarely a single white petal basal to the stamens, although the petals are often absent. The fruit type is a soft-bodied achene a few millimeters long [anatomically the fruit is an achenetum].

Her husband was Karl Polanyi and her daughter is Kari Polanyi Levitt. Life In 1897, Ilona Duczynska was born near Vienna to a Hungarian mother and a Polish-Austrian father. In 1915, during the First World War, she became acquainted with anarcho-syndicalist revolutionary Ervin Szab√≥, who connected her with the work of the Galileo Circle. She became a revolutionary socialist. For her anti-war activities, she was expelled from school in 1915. She studied engineering at the Technical University of Zurich. There she was befriended by a community of representatives of the Russian Social Democratic Party opposed to the war, including Lenin, his wife Krupskaya, and Angelica Balabanoff. Together with delegations from Germany, France, and Britain, as well as other European Labour and Socialist parties, they met to draft a program of action against the war, known as the Zimmerwald Declaration (see Zimmerwald Conference). The 18-year-old Duczynska was entrusted to smuggle this call to action into Hungary. In Hungary, she took part in the early 1918 strikes that called successfully for workers' councils. During the Galilei trial, she was imprisoned. In the Aster Revolution, she and other revolutionaries were freed. On November 17, 1918, she married and soon after joined the Hungarian Communist Party. During the Hungarian Soviet Republic, she worked in the propaganda department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and she was a member of the Budapest Central Revolutionary Worker and Soldier Council. She fled to Vienna to escape the counter- revolution in Hungary. With an excellent education and knowledge of several languages, she was called to Moscow to serve as translator to Karl Radek in the preparations for the historic Second International Congress of Communist Parties. Ilona returned to Vienna in 1920, and subsequently was expelled from the party for \\"Luxembourgist deviations\\" and a publication in a journal edited by Paul Levi, who also fell into disfavor with the party. In 1922, she divorced Sug√°r. The next year she married Karl Polanyi and their only child Kari was born. From 1927, she edited the Der linke Sozialdemokrat and organized the left opposition in the Vienna branch of the Austrian Socialist Party. Her underground name in Vienna was Anna Novotny. In 1929, she returned to university, the Technical University of Vienna, studying technology, mechanics, mechanical drawing, electronics, and electric number theory. In 1933 Karl emigrated to England followed by Kari in 1934 and Ilona in 1936. Duczynska participated in the 1934 workers' uprising in Vienna. Following the destruction of the Austrian working class movement in February 1934, Duczynska rejoined the Communist Party in order to continue the struggle of the now- illegal Schutzbund, the military arm of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, until 1936 when she joined her family in London. Subsequently, she was expelled from the Austrian Communist Party in London on orders from Moscow. When she returned to England from Bennington, Vermont in 1942/3, she worked in the Political Intelligence department of Foreign Affairs. During World War II she also worked for the Royal Aircraft Establishment testing model aircraft in wind tunnels for a year or perhaps two. After World War II, the family moved to Canada. Due to her background as a former communist, Duczynska could not gain an entrance visa to the United States. Karl Polanyi began his teaching position at Columbia University. He commuted to New York City from Canada. In 1964, Karl Polanyi died. In the 1970s, Duczynska joined the widowed Countess Katalin (\\"Katus\\") K√°rolyi and J√∫lia Rajk, the widow of L√°szl√≥ Rajk, in the front row of the trial of the dissident poet and philosopher Mikl√≥s Haraszti. Their presence was probably responsible for his receiving a suspended sentence. By this time Duczynska was associated with many leading Hungarian writers and poets. She translated most of the novels and short stories of J√≥zsef Lengyel whom English critics named \\"the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn.\\" After Polanyi's death, she supervised the editing and publication of his posthumous works, and the translation of much of his oeuvre into Hungarian and several other languages.

Some sources quote the title as \\"The Proud and the Damned\\", which is not the original name. The actual title, \\"The Proud and Damned\\", is clearly displayed in the title text of the original film version in the opening of the movie. Some images erroneously use the title \\"The Proud and the Damned\\".  Plot  In 1870, ex-Confederate mercenaries and American Civil War veterans Sgt. Will Hansen (Chuck Connors), Ike (Aron Kincaid), Hank (Henry Caps), Jeb (Smokey Robards), and Billy (Peter Ford) have just emigrated from their home state of Texas to Colombia in South America. After their arrival, they are ambushed by Colombian soldiers who force them to come meet General Martinez, the evil, cold-hearted dictator of their country. Martinez sends them to San Carlos, a town where rebel forces are preparing to start a civil war against Martinez's army. The Texans are instructed to live among the rebels, and report back to Martinez what they know within the next couple of days. Martinez warns them that they'll be severely punished if they fail him. The next day, while on their way to San Carlos, Will's gang runs into a gypsy family who are on their way to the same town. Will escorts them to the town and takes an interest in the daughter, Mila. They all ride into San Carlos, meet the governor, and rent a cabin outside of town. Will and Mila sneak out to spend the night together. Mila's father is angry when he finds out and cuts off her ear. Will shoots Mila's father. Will and his men are detained over the killing and find themselves unable to report back to Martinez. Will and Mila are banished from the town because the townspeople are angry over Will killing Mila's father. Will and Mila are captured by Martinez, who hangs Will for disobeying his orders. Mila rides back to town to get Will's friends, who give him a funeral, and vow to avenge his murder. They join the rebels in a battle with Martinez's army and drive them back. They later ambush Martinez and the rest of his surviving soldiers in a canyon, joined by the rebel army's captain. They manage to kill Martinez, but all are gunned down by his soldiers except for Billy, who was unconscious after falling from his horse. The film ends with Billy riding off into the sunset.

The film was unusual for a Ferde Grofe production in that it was his first feature film production outside of the Philippines (not including the American International Pictures pictures High School Hellcats and Hot Rod Gang from which he had his name removed from their credits), and secondly that there was no pre-sale - the production was a huge financial gamble for him. George Montgomery is credited as a co-producer by virtue putting up $125,000 for Chuck Connors pay. Grofe was concerned about what he had heard of Connors' on-set reputation and insisted that Connors payment be placed in escrow and payment only made upon satisfactory completion of the film. In addition to the film's main stars, three smaller roles were filled by actors who would later appear in The Day of the Wolves: Andres Marquis, Smokey Roberds and Henry Capps.  Aftermath  Grofe was unable to distribute the film through his usual industry channels, and it would take another three years to sell the film to the Texan entity that eventually distributed the film. George Montgomery threatened to sue Grofe for the return of his funds once it became clear that there was no immediate film sale.

In thermodynamics, the limit of local stability with respect to small fluctuations is clearly defined by the condition that the second derivative of Gibbs free energy is zero. The locus of these points (the inflection point within a G-x or G-c curve, Gibbs free energy as a function of composition) is known as the spinodal curve.G. Astarita: Thermodynamics: An Advanced Textbook for Chemical Engineers (Springer 1990), chaps 4, 8, 9, 12.Sandler S. I., Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics. 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p 571.Koningsveld K., Stockmayer W. H., Nies, E., Polymer Phase Diagrams: A Textbook. 2001 Oxford, p 12. For compositions within this curve, infinitesimally small fluctuations in composition and density will lead to phase separation via spinodal decomposition. Outside of the curve, the solution will be at least metastable with respect to fluctuations. In other words, outside the spinodal curve some careful process may obtain a single phase system. Inside it, only processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium, such as physical vapor deposition, will enable one to prepare single phase compositions.P.H. Mayrhofer et al. Progress in Materials Science 51 (2006) 1032-1114 The local points of coexisting compositions, defined by the common tangent construction, are known as a binodal (coexistence) curve, which denotes the minimum-energy equilibrium state of the system. Increasing temperature results in a decreasing difference between mixing entropy and mixing enthalpy, and thus the coexisting compositions come closer. The binodal curve forms the basis for the miscibility gap in a phase diagram. The free energy of mixing changes with temperature and concentration, and the binodal and spinodal meet at the critical or consolute temperature and composition.Cahn RW, Haasen P. Physical metallurgy. 4th ed. Cambridge: Univ Press; 1996 Criterion For binary solutions, the thermodynamic criterion which defines the spinodal curve is that the second derivative of free energy with respect to density or some composition variable is zero.Sandler S. I., Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics. 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p 557. Critical point Extrema of the spinodal in a temperature vs composition plot coincide with those of the binodal curve, and are known as critical points.Koningsveld K., Stockmayer W.

From mild development issues to serious complications sometimes resulting in death, the Japanese dodder can cause a wide spectrum of effects on its plant host. Farmers in particular can be affected by this plant, as infection leads to less crops they are able to harvest.  Morphology  Cuscuta japonica shares a similar morphology to vines, displaying stems that are mostly yellow with bits of red along it. The Japanese dodder also exhibits small flowers that are \\"pale-yellow to cream\\" in color and contain one circular stigma. Any leaves it has are very small and \\"scale-like\\" in shape and texture. Fruit produced are small and capsule-like, only carrying a couple of seeds.  History  C. japonica can be found non- invasively in a variety of places on the continent of Asia.

The district was listed as a Michigan Historic Site and added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1982. This district comprises approximately , bordering the River Raisin on the south and North Monroe Street (M-125) on the west. The district extends to the north to East Lorain Street and to the east to North Macomb Street. Streets within the district also include Tremont, East Willow, East Vine, East Noble, Gee, Sackett, and Glendale. History Some of the houses in this district date back to 1820, when the district was first developed as houses were constructed along the river road (now Elm Avenue) near the Monroe Street bridge. Later in the 19th century, more suburban houses appeared north of Elm. The district was gradually platted over the next century as an exclusively residential zone. The area became a prestigious neighborhood due to its attractive topography and easy access to the downtown. By the 1920s, the area was completely built up. Description The district includes a wide array of Greek Revival, Federal, Second Empire, and Victorian architecture, as well as some twentieth century bungalows and Prairie-influenced houses. The majority of the properties in this district are privately owned houses and range from large mansions to lower-class dwellings and apartments, while small businesses line the stretch along North Monroe Street. The core of the district contains two 1836 plats, with a series of fine residential mansions along Elm Avenue. A few early suburban houses are still scattered north of Elm. The remainder of the district contains more modest houses built during the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century. The Governor Robert McClelland House, which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located within this district at 47 East Elm Street. Robert McClelland lived in this house briefly when he served as mayor of Monroe in 1841 before leaving to embark in national politics. The East Elm‚ÄìNorth Macomb Street Historic District is also located across North Monroe Street from the St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District and adjacent to the George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument.

Location The population is 28,966 inhabitants, though the 2010 estimate indicates a population of around 33 thousand. Owing to highly fertile land, the city is a flourishing agricultural hub and a base for two major agricultural companies: C. Vale and I. Rieddi. Another highlight of Palotina is the campus of the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR). There is also one private university, the UESPAR (Uni√£o de Ensino Superior do Paran√°). The municipality contains the S√£o Camilo State Park, a conservation unit originally created as a biological reserve in 1990. History Settlement in the area started in 1953 when Pinho e Terras started to colonize the area. The settlement began to grow and on July 25, 1960 attained the status of municipality. Pinho e Terras approach to colonization was called exemplary, but in the early 1960s the colonists were besieged by gunmen hired by the \\"new landowners\\" affiliated with state governor and Socialist Democratic Party boss Moises Lupion.Lupion, according to Foweraker, p. 108, practiced \\"double baptism\\" of land, awarding the title of already occupied farmland to the highest bidder. The federal government moved in a regiment of border guards to pacify the area and in 1963 re- nationalized the disputed lands. The colonists had to buy back their own land. Agriciltural economy of Palotina relies on production of corn, wheat and soybean. A 1969 survey placed Palotina in the cluster of most efficient agricultural communities in Brazil. According to authors of the study, higher productivity in this cluster stemmed from raising pigs, which accounts for 68% of its output. 82% of lands were allotted to fodder crops rather than traditional rice, bean and cotton.Foweraker, p 46. Nowadays, Palotina is a near 30k inhabitants municipality with an agroindustrial economy and a hopeful future. Most of the population, around 68%, have Italian ancestry and about 13% of the community have German ancestry. Climate Humid subtropical climate of Palotina (Cfa in K√∂ppen climate classification) is characterized by humid and hot summers, while winters are cool. Precipitation is moderate all year long.

The settlement grew up rapidly following the discovery of gold by William F. Holcomb in Holcomb Valley early 1860. Which helped the town challenge the seat of San Bernardino County (which subsequently after the election in 1861 went to San Bernardino). Belleville was named after Belle, the first child born in the new town. It was a busy mining town for ten years, it was virtually abandoned before the end of the 19th century. It is now a ghost town. History The first phase of mining was by small groups or individuals for placer gold, by people with claims along stream beds. With better transportation, more prospectors with equipment arrived in the area. When the Bear Valley Mining District was founded, quartz mining began. Stamp mills required to crush the rock were built at different sites in the valleys.\\"Belleville, California - Waiting for the Mother Lode\\", Legends of America At first prospectors during the gold rush had to travel to Holcomb Valley from San Bernardino by a wagon road into the Upper Santa Ana Canyon, and then north by pack mule up the mountains to Bear Valley and on to Holcomb Valley. In June 1861, Jed Van Dusen built a wagon road down the north side of the mountains through Hesperia and then south through the Cajon Pass, at a cost of $1,500. This enabled travelers to reach the town of Belleville in two days by a regular stage from San Bernardino.Belden, Holcomb Valley Gold Discovery In the time of the elections in September 1860, Belleville had a population of nearly 1,500, the largest in Holcomb Valley. It was proposed for the location of the county seat. The matter was decided in the election, in which the smaller city of San Bernardino narrowly won the contest by two votes. Some of the ballots from a precinct in Belleville were said to have been burned by \\"accident\\". With easier access, Belleville grew quickly. Soon it had a store, two butcher shops, two laundries, a bakery, three carpenter shops, two blacksmiths, a stamp mill and a sawmill. It also had several saloons and the Octagon House, featuring dancers who entertained the miners. The many rough and single men made it a violent place. By 1862, Holcomb Valley had 50 murders. A large hanging tree was designated where many men paid for their crimes. Soon the placers began to run out and the population declined. The remaining miners engaged in the more difficult Quartz reef mining. Belleville was eventually abandoned. The gold rush in Holcomb Valley lasted about 10 years, from 1860-1870. Hard rock mining continued for decades more in the mountains. For example, Lucky Baldwin's Gold Mountain Mine produced from 1860 until 1919. California State Mining Bureau, Report of the state mineralogist, Issue 17, State Office, 1921. p.. 346 Civil War era During the national crisis in 1860-1861, Belleville was a hotbed of secessionist sympathizers. United States officials feared they were organizing with others in Southern California to take control of weapon arsenals, secede from the Union, and join the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The U.S. government sent Federal troops on August 25, 1861 to San Bernardino to prevent such actions. The troops traveled secretly at night to avoid an expected ambush. No revolt occurred, despite rumors of secessionists' mobilizing in Belleville and the Mojave Desert. The appearance of a squadron of First U.S. Dragoons in town on election day quelled an incipient secessionist riot in San Bernardino. A few days later a robbery on the pack trail to Bear Valley was attributed to the secessionists.

The hospital complex was located at the northeast corner of Platt and Willis roads, in York Charter Township; one mile south of the boundary with Pittsfield Charter Township and two miles west of the Augusta Charter Township boundary. The City of Saline was four miles due west of the hospital on Willis Road, while the City of Milan was five miles due south on Platt Road. The hospital, which was three miles from the point where York and Ypsilanti charter townships meet, was called \\"Ypsilanti\\" because the area is served by the Ypsilanti telephone exchange. History On June 16, 1930 construction for the hospital had begun. Albert Kahn was the architect that had designed the building. Kahn had his own design firm in Detroit, Michigan. The hospital was opened a year after construction had begun. Over the course of the first year the hospital had admitted 922 patients. The estimated cost of living was about eighty cents per day. At the end of World War II The Ypsilanti State Hospital had built two new buildings with over 4,000 patients. After adding the two wards, this still brought the hospital over capacity. In 1991, Governor John Engler cut all funding for state hospitals. The Ypsilanti State Hospital was the first to be shut down.\\"Ypsilanti State Hospital.\\" Opacity. Ed. Tom Kirsch. Web. 1 Nov. 2009. . The forensic center stayed open until 2001, but when the hospital closed this left many patients homeless. They were left with nothing, most of the patients having lost all contact with family and friends. The Ypsilanti State Hospital had been abandoned for sixteen years before being demolished in 2006. Toyota bought the property to develop the Toyota Technical Center on the site, and all remnants of the hospital complex are gone. Treatments The Ypsilanti State Hospital employed many different types of therapy and treatments for their patients. Within the hospitals first five years it had been open, there were 13,329 different treatments. These treatments are broken up into two different categories: hydrotherapy and physiotherapy. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is a type of treatment based on an assortment of treatments dealing with water. Some of these treatments were needle showers, fan douches, jet douches, salt glows, general messages, local messages, sitz baths, foot baths, ultraviolet radiations, electric light cabinet baths, bubble baths, hot fomentations, colloidal baths, and surgical dressings.\\"Ypsilanti State Hospital.\\" Opacity.

Milton Rokeach, author of the book, was a social psychologist. He put the three men in contact with each other in an effort to determine whether one or more would abandon his delusions of divinity as a result of being in contact with others.

The lake was among the largest at the Northern J√¶ren district, with an area of about 4 km¬≤. It was surrounded by considerable areas of marsh land, and was known for a rich birdlife. The lake drained to Gandsfjord, and the outlet supplied six mills located near the fjord. Drainage Plans for draining the area initiated in the 1860s, but the plan was not approved until 1905. The drainage started in 1906. Including the surrounding areas, about 4.5 km¬≤ of new land was cultivated. The land redistribution involved eighty individual farms (eight main farms): Skadberg and R√∏yneberg (in former H√•land, now Sola municipality), Forus, Gausel, Godeset and J√•tt√• (former Hetland, now Stavanger municipality), and Stokka and Lura (former H√∏yland, now Sandnes municipality). Later usage During occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany from 1940 the Stavanger Airport, Forus was constructed at the location of the former lake. The construction work was directed by the German occupants, with the help of well paid entrepreneurs and volunteers moving in from other parts of the country. The population of Stavanger increased by an estimate of 35%. This both stimulated the economy, and led to friction between the immigrants (often called \\"\\", or \\"Forus Rats\\") and the local population. Gradually the work got characteristics of forced labour, local civilians were forced to work for the occupants, and the work force often treated like prisoners. Later also Russian prisoners-of-war were brought to the district and put into forced construction labour. From 1972 the land has been utilised for development of industry, by the establishment of \\"\\".

The principal feature that distinguishes the DiamondTouch table from other multi-touch interfaces, such as the Apple iPhone, HP TouchSmart, Microsoft Surface or do-it-yourself systems inspired by the work of Jeff Han, is that the DiamondTouch table can identify who is touching where.Sandhana, L., Interactive display system knows users by touch, New Scientist, 25 May 2006 DiamondTouch achieves this feature through capacitive coupling between a transmitter array located in the touch surface and separate receivers located in the chair of each user.Anthes, G., Give your computer the finger: Touch-screen tech comes of age, ComputerWorld, 1 February 2008 The physical set-up of the system consists of the DiamondTouch device connected to a PC via USB cable, and a video projector suspended above the table and aimed down onto the touch surface. Cables connect chairs or receivers to the DiamondTouch unit. The current products have four receivers, thereby supporting one to four users. A software development kit (SDK) allows developers to build custom software applications using standard programming languages including C, C++, Java, ActiveX (for C#, DHTML, VB.NET) and Adobe Flash. A mouse emulator enables operation of common software applications using multi-touch gestures for mouse functions (left button, middle button, right button and scroll wheel). A multi-user annotation software tool allows users to make mark-ups, selecting pen types from a pallet. In September 2008, Circle Twelve introduced a software extension for the geospatial information systems (GIS) software ArcView from ESRI.Circle Twelve press release, BusinessWire, 2 September 2008. The software extension allows multi-user and multi-touch interactions in ArcView when used in conjunction with the DiamondTouch table. History DiamondTouch technology was developed by Paul Dietz and Darren Leigh at MERL, and presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) in 2001. The hardware complimented other Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, including the Personal Digital Historian developed by Chia Shen and others at MERL, and led to developments in tabletop computing, shared display groupware, and touch-based interaction. While the traditional computer interfaces (consisting of a mouse, keyboard and monitor) were originally designed to support individuals, the focus was to create a new type of computer interface to support face-to-face collaboration among small groups of people. In 2003, MERL started a university loan program in which DiamondTouch tables were provided to universities for research purposes, and tabletop computing research built around DiamondTouch began at research groups including Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Tokyo, leading to research papers presented at academic conferences including UIST, ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII). Research in the field led to the formation the annual academic conference beginning in 2006 called Tabletop (initially, the IEEE International Workshop on Horizontal Interactive Human-Computer Systems or TableTop 2006, and most recently the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces or Tabletop 2010).

It is the most common Zelus species in the eastern United States. The size ranges from twelve and a half to eighteen millimeters long.Genus Zelus Fabricius in the United States, Canada, and Northern Mexico (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Hart E.R. 1986. Ann. Ent. Soc. Am. 79: 535-548. On average, adult females are sixteen millimeters long, while males are fourteen millimeters long. Though the base color is pale green, markings on the back can range from dark brown or red to bright yellow. Nymphs are generally more solid green, wingless, and with narrower bodies than adults. The most reliable feature to distinguish this species from others is the pair of spines on the rear corners of the pronotum. These spines are long on the lighter colored individuals and shorter on ones that are darker. It can also be distinguished by dark bands on the distal ends of the femurs, but these can often be too light to be easily seen. The egg masses, which are laid from late June to August, are conical in shape with a flat top. They are laid on leaves in groups of twenty to fifty and held together with a sticky, brownish material. Their bite is extremely painful. Like many other assassin bugs, Zelus luridus preys on other insects. It will often wait on leaves to ambush passing insects, but occasionally it also actively hunts. For this, it uses sticky traps, a common predation strategy to species within the genus Zelus. The sticky material is produced by a gland on the leg. This gland develops in the second instar. During the first instar, the nymphs use secretions deposited over the egg batch by the female as the source of their sticky material.
