A modern adaptation of the Cinderella story, Soho Cinders transfers the action to the heart of London's Soho. The eponymous heroine is replaced by a young rent boy called Robbie who gets wrapped up in an illicit affair with an aspiring politician called James Prince. The story intertwines elements of Cinderella with contemporary political scandal and an urban setting. The musical was first showcased in 2008, followed by a sold-out gala concert production of it in 2011. A recording of this was released in 2011. > \\"Soho Cinders is packed with the best songs Stiles and Drewe have yet > written, driving character, plot and wit in perfect harmony (in every > sense)...\\" Mark Shenton, The Stage Soho Cinders received its world premiere off-West End at London's Soho Theatre in 2012. Inception and development George Stiles and Anthony Drewe started work on Soho Cinders in 2000, having come up with the idea of updating a very basic version of Cinderella into something different in the 1990s.http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/news/backstage- pass/article/item149586/a-partnership-stiles-drewe/ In the summer of 2000, Drewe and George Stiles sat in Regents Park to start developing their adaptation and wrote a lot of it in France at Stiles' sister-in-law's house. Although the musical was almost finished, the pair had been busy with other projects like Honk, Betty Blue Eyes and Mary Poppins, which hindered their progress on Soho Cinders. Workshops for the musical began in the early 2000s but it was not until 6 July 2008 that some of the musical's songs were exclusively premiered at Her Majesty's Theatre as part of a gala concert that celebrated the 25th anniversary of Stiles and Drewe's songwriting partnership, entitled A Spoonful of Stiles and Drewe. The pair debuted the songs \\"Wishing for the Normal\\", \\"I'm So Over Men\\", \\"Gypsies of the Ether\\", \\"It's Hard to Tell\\", \\"They Don't Make Glass Slippers\\" and \\"You Shall Go to the Ball\\". Singers included Gareth Gates, Leanne Jones, Oliver Tompsett, Joanna Riding and Claire Moore as well as Rebecca Thornhill, Daniel Boys, Alison Jiear, Richard Dempsey and James Gillan as ensemble members.Production History A one- off charity gala concert then followed on 9 October 2011 with an all star cast and a 16-piece band led by George Stileson in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. Stiles and Drewe describe Soho Cinders as \\"rawer\\" and \\"grown-up\\" in comparison to their previous work. They wanted to make Soho Cinders satirical and political and set it in the present day; different from their other work of fairy tales and period pieces. On the pair's website, Soho Cinders is described as a \\"fable for the noughties\\" that is inspired by musicals like Guys and Dolls, which achieve a world which never really existed but you kind of feel might have done. They are a heightened version of a past time. The pair have attempted to create a version of London in its current state. They have acknowledged Soho Cinders as both comedic, romantic but a musical that touches on a few serious issues. Synopsis Soho Cinders is loosely based on the story of Cinderella. It is a modern musical fable that is set and celebrates the London district of Soho which mixes politics, sex scandals, and true love in a story about an impoverished student, Robbie, who is paying for his college bills in a somewhat unorthodox way, becoming romantically involved with the engaged prospective mayoral candidate, James Prince. James and Robbie's worlds collide, forcing them to fight for their own fairy-tale ending in this hilarious, satirical twist on the classic Cinderella story.

History Scorpion was founded in 1899 by the philanthropist and translator Sergey A. Polyakov, poets Valery Bryusov and Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis. Konstantin Balmont was said to have suggested its title. Scorpion's initial agenda was two-fold: to meet the already well-developed demand for the so-called 'decadent' brand of literature and to form its own readership, interested in the \\"new art\\" of Russian modernism. The preface to Scorpion's first ever catalog stated: \\"The Scorpion publishing house is interested mostly in works of art, but aims also for the fields of history of literature and aesthetic criticism. Willing to stand above the existing literary trends, it eagerly embraces everything that has real poetry to it regardless of which literary school any particular author belongs to. It is only vulgar things that we tend to avoid. The Among Scorpion's other priorities is translating foreign authors who serve the New Art. The time has come to give our reader the opportunity to form their own opinions on new trends in literature.\\" The inclusion of the foreign literature into the Scorpion's fold was considered obligatory. This way the 'European context' of the Russian symbolism was being highlighted. The first foreign book published by Scorpion in March 1900, was Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken, translated by Polyakov and Baltru≈°aitis. Bryusov praised Scorpion as the center of the New Art in Russia, having brought together the Moscow (Bryusov, Balmont, Andrei Bely) and Saint Petersburg's authors (Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Zinaida Gippius, Fyodor Sologub), the latter associated with Severny Vestnik magazine. Closely associated with Scorpion were miriskussniki L√©on Bakst and Konstantin Somov, as well as Victor Borisov-Musatov, Modest Durnov and Nikolai Feofilaktov, among others. Scorpion, which had neither commercial success nor any academic background, proved to be instrumental in uniting the Russian symbolists into one single movement. The last book published here was Poetry like Magic by Konstantin Balmont in 1915.

The uniform convergence on compact sets of a sequence of holomorphic univalent functions, defined on the unit disk in the complex plane and fixing 0, can be formulated purely geometrically in terms of the limiting behaviour of the images of the functions. The kernel theorem has wide application in the theory of univalent functions and in particular provides the geometric basis for the Loewner differential equation. Kernel of a sequence of open sets Let Un be a sequence of open sets in C containing 0. Let Vn be the connected component of the interior of Un ‚à© Un + 1 ‚à© ... containing 0. The kernel of the sequence is defined to be the union of the Vn's, provided it is non-empty; otherwise it is defined to be \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. Thus the kernel is either a connected open set containing 0 or the one point set \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. The sequence is said to converge to a kernel if each subsequence has the same kernel. Examples *If Un is an increasing sequence of connected open sets containing 0, then the kernel is just the union. *If Un is a decreasing sequence of connected open sets containing 0, then, if 0 is an interior point of U1 ‚à© U2 ‚à© ..., the sequence converges to the component of the interior containing 0. Otherwise, if 0 is not an interior point, the sequence converges to \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. Kernel theorem Let fn(z) be a sequence of holomorphic univalent functions on the unit disk D, normalised so that fn(0) = 0 and f 'n (0) > 0. Then fn converges uniformly on compacta in D to a function f if and only if Un = fn(D) converges to its kernel and this kernel is not C. If the kernel is \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, then f = 0. Otherwise the kernel is a connected open set U, f is univalent on D and f(D) = U. Proof Using Hurwitz's theorem and Montel's theorem, it is straightforward to check that if fn tends uniformly on compacta to f then each subsequence of Un has kernel U = f(D). Conversely if Un converges to a kernel not equal to C, then by the Koebe quarter theorem Un contains the disk of radius f 'n(0) / 4 with centre 0. The assumption that U ‚â† C implies that these radii are uniformly bounded. By the Koebe distortion theorem : f_n(z) \\\\le f_n^\\\\prime(0) {z\\\\over (1-z)^2}. Hence the sequence fn is uniformly bounded on compact sets. If two subsequences converge to holomorphic limits f and g, then f(0) = g(0) and with f'(0), g'(0) ‚â• 0. By the first part and the assumptions it follows that f(D) = g(D). Uniqueness in the Riemann mapping theorem forces f = g, so the original sequence fn is uniformly convergent on compact sets.

Grierson's original intention was to enable good players to enjoy cricket into middle age. In a letter to a prospective opponent in 1937 he explained who would play for the club: \\"Qualifications ‚Äì over 40, good fellows, and useful cricketers. Professionals as well as amateurs. No sub., each paying his own exes.\\"Henry Grierson, \\"The History of the Forty Club\\", The Cricketer, 14 May 1960, pp. 140‚Äì41. The first match was against Wellingborough School on 19 June 1937. The club plays matches against schools with the aim of developing and encouraging cricket in schools. The players were originally required to be over 40 years old, though that was subsequently reduced to 35. Further, for the years 2013/14 the age bar has been removed completely as a move to encourage all age groups with membership now open to anybody over the age of 18. It is reputed to be the largest wandering cricket club in the world. The Duke of Edinburgh is the club's patron. Currently it enjoys some 140 fixtures against schools and youth XIs each season, plus a further 75 or 80 fixtures against clubs during the school holidays, and regular winter tours to various parts of the world. History of The Forty Club Henry Grierson wrote this in his opening article in The Cricketer magazine on May 14th 1960. ‚ÄúThe Forty Club, whose present membership exceeds 1350, is composed of cricketers past and present over 40 years of age irrespective of class creed or colour. In addition to its membership in the UK it is represented strongly in Australia and New Zealand: across the African continent; and throughout India and the Far East. There are also members in the USA and the West Indies. Thus it covers the whole world where cricket is played.‚Äù He happened to be passing his old school Bedford in 1934 and went to the ground in the hope that there was a match on. There was. The School was playing The Incogniti. His old friend Shirley Snell, skippering the Incogs, met him and asked if he was still playing. ‚ÄòNo‚Äô was the answer: Grierson was now devoted to golf. ‚ÄúDid Snell enjoy playing cricket with folk much younger?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo ‚Äì but he would prefer to play with folk his own age but at the time that was not possible.‚Äù Could it be? The seed of an idea had been planted. Grierson felt that if it were possible to raise a sufficient number of fellows of 40 years and over who were reasonably good players, they might be sharp enough to handle some of the schools. Batting should be adequate, there were some qualms about fielding, and if the professionals joined in, the bowling would be good enough for what he had in mind. By 1936 Grierson had made up his mind to form something called The Forty Club, and started looking for an Honorary Secretary. Then he wrote to a number of his old cricketing friends, invited them, got their acceptance, and the Club was founded in the winter of 1936. The inaugural matches in 1937 would be against Wellingborough School and the Old Bedfordians. He went on to design a club tie ‚Äì it would be dark blue silk with little XLs in silver dotted about. Beagley & Co was engaged to produce it at 7/6p apiece or a guinea for 3. Upon invitation, Sir Pelham Warner and Mr Jack Hobbs both agreed to become President and Vice President respectively in 1937. In 1938 the membership had risen to 116 including many famous names ‚Äì Lord Aberdare, AER Gilligan, Patsy Hendren, WW Wakefield. The first dinner was held this year in the Junior Carlton Club and the 6 courses cost 10/6p. CB Fry was the speaker and went on for so long that Pelham Warner had to pull him to his seat by his coat tails. Jack Hobbs played in the 1938 side against Bloxham School and made 85 not out, and then took 3 for 34 in 11 overs. By the end of 1938 committee meetings were held in the Finsbury Distillery in London. It was reported that the Minutes had to be written later when the Secretary was sober. Thereafter and over the years an increasing list of cricketing greats joined the Club ‚Äì Gubby Allen in 1939, Herbert Sutcliffe, Ernest Tyldesley, Percy Fender and Frank Woolley. In 1939, in a match against Rugby School, the Forty Club opened with Jack Hobbs [Surrey/England][hit wicket for 75], and Dick Twining [Oxford/Middx][ct 55], and they were followed by WG Quaife [Warks/England][12*], GTS Stevens [Middx/England][b 7], WC Farnsworth [Northants] and N Haig [Middx/England]. WE Astill [Leics/England], M Howell [Oxford/Surrey], RT Stanyforth [Yorks/England][ and the Rev Sholto Douglas did not bat ! In 1940 Pelham Warner arranged a match against Harrow School and the records declare that the XL only raised a side because of a successful evacuation from Dunkirk the week before, enabling a few players to make it to the match. In 1941 The Forty Club played at Lords for the first time. There were 10,000 spectators including a number of troops from overseas. Matches continued throughout 1942 to 1944 but were spasmodic and often arranged on the spur of the moment. In 1944 the first committee meeting since 1939 was held and Henry Grierson deputed to design a cap. He did so ‚Äì dark blue with a long peak and as a badge, he designed one of Father Time running between the wickets bat in one hand and in the other a scroll bearing the Roman numerals XL. By this time the membership was around 400 and included Field Marshall The Lord Haig, Learie Constantine, Frank Crompton, (Major) DR Jardine and Field Marshall Alexander of Tunis. There is an anecdote about Herbert Sutcliffe who played in the Old Bedfordians match and was on 99 when he hit the ball to long off and set off to what would be a very popular century. Sadly he fell in mid-run, but equally remarkably the fielder could not for some unaccountable reason pick up the ball and throw it in, and when he did he made the wildest possible throw to the bowler who in turn failed to gather it cleanly. Sutcliffe made his ton ! In 1947 the life subscription was ¬£1. This was deemed inadequate to meet the rising operating costs and at a special general meeting it was resolved that the annual subscription would be 10s a year for 4 years after which a member would automatically become a Life Member. Alternatively Life Membership could be bought for ¬£4 10s. The Club bank balance at the time was ¬£33. A year later it was ¬£285. From then on the Club has continued to grow and grow. In 1948 DR Jardine, Alan Melville [the South African skipper] joined. By 1949 the membership had risen to about 500. By 1956 the number had reached 1000. In 1958 Mr Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia was made an Honorary Member and in 1960 Mr Nash, the Prime Minister of New Zealand was elected. In 1959 a link was created with the United Sports Club in Whitehall Court which XL members could join on advantageous terms, and committee meetings would be held there. The 1959 annual dinner was held at the Park Lane Hotel at which 500 people attended. The following year the list was closed at 534. The popularity of the dinner was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì attributed to two factors ‚Äì meeting so many old cricketing friends and to the quality of the speakers. In 1954 a Golfing Society was formed and played its first match on October 4th at Wimbledon Park GC. There were 20 competitors. From this modest start there sprung a successful Society which stages a Spring and Autumn Meeting each year and nowadays enjoys some 35 fixtures a season. In the 50s and 60s the list of famous names who joined and played for the Club continued to impress, such as Denis Compton (4 half centuries in 5 matches), Reg Simpson (7 centuries for the Club), Len Hutton, Peter May, Alec Bedser and Fred Trueman (who went on tours to Jersey and Guernsey). By 1960 the Club membership had risen to 1450. Father Time continued to take his toll and new members joined. A positive link was created to the Dutch seniors cricket club, known as Still Going Strong [SGS], and tours were established with them. A link to a Danish seniors club, Dansk XL, was formed some years later. In 1962 David Bacon, manager of Whitehall Court, put forward a scheme for the Club to take over premises at 2 Whitehall Court which had been previously tenanted by the Lady Golfers Club. These premises were opened at a reception in May of that year. Subsequently in March 1968 The Farmers Club offered The Forty Club the use of their bar and committee rom following a programme of reconstruction. Permission was confirmed in July 1969 and one room, later to be christened as The Forty Room, was allocated to The Forty Club for their committees use and as a place to store their cricketing memorabilia. In the next 40+ years the nature of the game has changed little; the management of the Club has changed little, but the famous names are not there. The membership peaked at just less than 4000 and then fell back to 3000 or so with 150 overseas members. The Golfing Society had some 400+ members and the bank balance was healthy. The cricket climate or cricket environment has changed markedly however. The Club still wishes to focus on those players at the time they are leaving league cricket, and some younger, but the growth of the county over 50s, 60s and 70s means that those who want to play only with their own age group can do so with ease. Therefore the Club faces a constant challenge in its recruiting efforts to attract the 30 to 40 year old. The highlight of the dinner circuit was when the Duke of Edinburgh, Patron of the Club, attended and spoke in 1974. He had consented to become Patron on November 1961 and at the 1974 dinner 998 folk attended. The Forty Club dinner continues to be a significant event in the Club calendar ‚Äì the list of speakers over the years reads like a veritable Who‚Äôs Who of the cricket and wider world - but more and more the majority of attendees are not Club members. The dinner currently is held in the Long Room at Lords where the maximum attendance is 200 and the ‚Äòtop table‚Äô continues to seat a list of legendary cricketing greats. Nowadays, the Forty Club divides its membership in UK into 12 districts each with their own managing team, and all operating under a central executive and corporate strategy. Membership now stand at around 2200; fixtures overall remain at the 200+ mark with the primary focus remaining on schools and youth cricket; there is an annual Inter District tournament; the annual fixtures against SGS and Dansk XL have grown with the inclusion of Cricket Espana and there is now an annual Quadrangular Tournament; overseas tours continue to travel to far off and exotic lands, and the annual Handbook is produced. In this digital age, great use is made of the Club‚Äôs website, email predominates, ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô meetings can be held via video conferencing. On the field of play, the attraction for those ‚Äòslightly senior‚Äô 30+ year olds, and many older, to play schools matches at some of the finest grounds in the country, and the desire to inspire young men and women to play and enjoy cricket, remains undimmed and undiminished. ‚ÄúIn every generation are born a few people who, at a comparatively early age, decide to devote their lives to developing ideas for the welfare of others, and leave a monument behind them. I feel that the Forty Club, through the energy and focus of Henry Grierson, was founded in that spirit and will live for a long time ‚Äì surely as long as cricket is played ‚Äì to help the young and the not so young.‚Äù Geoffrey Howard, Secretary Surrey County Cricket Club, August 1971.''

Enos Bromage was recruited by Derby County from local club, Derby Junction, sometime in 1888 just before the start of the inaugural Football League season. On 30 January 1886 in a match on a slippery snow covered pitch against Eckington Works F.C., Bromage collided with an Eckington forward when catching the ball. He caught the player in the stomach with his knee injuring the player who played on seeming unaffected but died the following day. Apart from one match the regular Derby County goalkeeper in 1888-1889 had been Joseph Marshall. On 2 February 1889 Derby County played their FA Cup 1st Round tie at County Ground, Derby against Derby Junction. The records do not show if Marshall was unfit or had been dropped. Either way Marshall never played top-flight football again and Reuben Pitman was selected as goalkeeper for both FA Cup ties. When League football restarted on 2 March 1889 Reuben Pitman was retained as first-team goalkeeper. Despite playing three times and helping Derby County to three successive League wins Reuben Pitman was either injured or, out of favour, and Enos Bromage replaced him on 6 April 1889. The venue was Victoria Ground, Stoke, then home of Stoke. Both teams were facing re- election and the match was a tight, nervy affair. Derby County and Bromage got off to a great start and within one minute of kicking off Lol Plackett had put Derby County ahead, 1‚Äì0. Derby were not playing well and never looked like scoring another in the first half and so led 1‚Äì0 at half-time. In the second- half the Derby attack were more lively but missed their chances so the Derby team were grateful to Enos Bromage who made some \\"fine saves\\" to keep Derby County in the lead. However, right at the end, Stoke winger, Jimmy Sayer scored an equaliser. The goal was disputed as Derby players felt the ball went in after the referee blew for time but the referee did not agree. Bromage played two League matches for Derby County in 1888‚Äì1889. Derby County finished 10th in the Football League conceding 61 goals, the third worst defence of that inaugural season.

Family Malcolm was the son of Robert Kennedy and Clementina Sobieska Stuart Kennedy (n√©e Robertson), he was born on 30 October 1892 in Kew, Victoria. Education He attended Camberwell Grammar School, Queen's College, Hobart (which was later absorbed by The Hutchins School), University of Melbourne, and Royal Military College, Duntroon. Sportsman Recruited from Blackburn, aged 18, he played his first senior VFL match for Melbourne, against Collingwood, at Victoria Park on 3 June 1911. Melbourne lost by a six points; Kennedy kicked one goal.League Games: Fine Game at Collingwood: Melbourne Play Better, The Argus, (Monday, 5 June 1911), p.9; League Matches: Collingwood (6.13) Beat Melbourne (5.13), The Age, (Monday, 5 June 1911), p.10. He went on to play a total of seventeen games for Melbourne; eleven games in twelve rounds in 1911, kicking four goals, and six games in seven rounds in 1912 (no goals). Before the 1912 season commenced, the VFL instituted the convention of all players wearing a distinctive, large, conspicuous, personal number on the back of their guernsey (to promote sales of The Football Record, which supplied lists of the player numbers); therefore, when Kennedy ran out on to the Melbourne Cricket Ground, on Saturday 27 April 1912, the first round of the 1912 VFL season, to play against Collingwood he was the first Melbourne player to wear the number 12 guernsey. He played his last match against Essendon, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, on the King's Birthday Holiday, Monday, 3 June 1912. In the reports of the day, there is no indication that he was either injured or played badly; and, further, none of the contemporary newspapers give any indication at all of any possible reason that might explain why that match was Kennedy's last game for Melbourne. In 1913, he represented Duntroon at Australian rules football,Team photograph. rugby union, playing as a forward, and at cricket. On 6 September 1913, at the second annual sports carnival of the Royal Military College, Kennedy came third in the finals of the 100 yards, 220 yards handicap, and 440 yards races, the heats having been conducted over the previous fortnight.

Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, meant that Australia was also at war. Due to the direct, personal representations of Lord Kitchener, the graduation of thirty of the cadets in the second intake, including Kennedy, were accelerated, and they were immediately given commissions as Lieutenants. Fifteen of the thirty R.M.C. graduates were allotted to the infantry, to serve under Colonel John Monash, and the other fifteen, including Kennedy and Robert Harold Nimmo (later, Lieutenant General Nimmo), were allotted to the Light Horse.Compliment to Duntroon College, The (Adelaide) Advertiser, (Saturday, 31 October 1914), p.16; note that Kennedy is listed as a \\"Queensland\\" cadet.

He spent most of his career in the service of France, but is perhaps best known for his involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1745, an attempt to regain the British throne for the exiled House of Stuart. During the Rising he acted as adjutant general and quartermaster general of the Jacobite army and had a major influence on the campaign. Although many secondary works give his surname as \\"O'Sullivan\\", he used the form \\"Sullivan\\" in his own correspondence.Pittock (2016) Culloden, OUP, p.xiv Early career Marquis de Maillebois; Sullivan accompanied him to Corsica in 1739 O'Sullivan was born circa 1700 at Cappanacush near Kenmare, County Kerry, one of two sons of Dermot O'Sullivan, whose family estate of Dunkerron had been confiscated under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652.John Bergin. \\"\\"O'Sullivan (Sullivan), Sir John William\\". Dictionary of Irish Biography. (ed.) James McGuire, James Quinn. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2009. Information on his early life is limited and taken from The Young Juba, an often unreliable biography of Charles Stuart written in 1748 by Aeneas MacDonald, using the pseudonym Michell. The Penal Laws limited opportunities for the Irish Catholic gentry and like many contemporaries, O'Sullivan was educated in Paris and Rome, possibly in preparation for the priesthood. MacDonald suggests he became tutor to the son of the Marquis de Maillebois, and accompanied him in the 1739 French and Genoese reconquest of Corsica. He is recorded as serving in Italy and on the Rhine during the War of the Austrian Succession, although few details are provided. 1745 rebellion HMS Lion and Elizabeth, 9 July 1745 Following the abandonment of a French invasion attempt in early 1744, the Stuart heir Charles began planning a small-scale landing in Scotland to take place the following year. He started purchasing weapons in early 1745 while the French provided limited logistical support, much of it brokered by Lord Clare; O'Sullivan joined Charles's household in March. Charles's former tutor Sheridan claimed to have first recommended him, though he is also suggested to have been recruited directly by Clare. A contemporary account said that \\"no one who knows Mr. Sullivan can deny his being one of the best bred, genteelist, complaisant, engaging officers in all the French troops\\".‚ÄòCharacter of Mr. Sullivan‚Äô in Tayler and Tayler, eds, 1745 and After, pp. 16‚Äì19, p. 18. Charles enjoyed O'Sullivan's company and trusted his advice: in return, O‚ÄôSullivan was to be unerringly loyal to him.Riding, Jacqueline. Jacobites: A New History of the '45 Rebellion (Kindle Locations 908-913). Bloomsbury Publishing. Kindle Edition. From this point he was closely involved in planning the 1745 expedition and as one of the \\"Seven Men of Moidart\\" accompanied Charles during his landing on Eriskay. The campaign got off to a poor start when the ship Elizabeth, carrying weapons and a force of Franco-Irish regulars, had to turn back after being intercepted and damaged by HMS Lion. On arrival, nearly every single contact urged Charles to return to France; he persuaded enough to support him but was dependent on a small force mobilised by Donald Cameron of Lochiel and other Lochaber chiefs. O'Sullivan recalled Lochiel had \\"700 good men, but ill armed; Kapock arrived the same day, w[i]th about 350 clivor fellows\\".Narrative of O'Sullivan in Tayler (ed) (1938), 1745 and After, Nelson, p.60 Cavalryman Sir John MacDonald, another of the 'Seven Men', later wrote that Lochiel admitted to lacking military experience; he therefore suggested that although either he or Francis Strickland could do the job of organising the Jacobite forces, O'Sullivan was the best qualified. O'Sullivan was accordingly installed as adjutant-general and quartermaster-general, handling personnel, training and logistics.McDonnell, Hector (1996) The Wild Geese of the Antrim MacDonnells, Irish Academic Press, p.102Reid, S. (2012) The Scottish Jacobite Army, Bloomsbury, pp.90-2 As more recruits came in, O'Sullivan organised them as a relatively conventional eighteenth-century army with a staff, cavalry, infantry, artillery, and supporting elements.Pollard, Tony. Culloden: The History and Archaeology of the Last Clan Battle (Kindle Locations 761-762). Pen and Sword. Kindle Edition. Command of the field army originally rotated between Lord George Murray and the Duke of Perth, but at Falkirk and Culloden, O'Sullivan was in overall control. The two Scots acted as brigade commanders, with the addition of Perth's brother John Drummond after his arrival in late November. Lord George Murray; his poor relationship with Prince Charles badly affected his ability to work with O'Sullivan Arguments over strategy after Prestonpans reflected deep divisions between the Scots and Charles' advisors, many of whom were Irish. They wanted the autonomous, Catholic Ireland promised by James II in 1689, which meant putting Charles on the British throne. The Scots who provided the bulk of the army were mostly Protestants who wanted to end the 1707 Union with England. They preferred to consolidate their position and resented the exiles, many of whom held French commissions and would be treated as prisoners of war if the Rising failed; the Scots risked execution and loss of their lands. There were several disagreements on strategy in the Jacobite Council of War between its Scots and Irish members, particularly regarding the invasion of England. O'Sullivan supported the invasion in the face of the reservations of many Scots, despite his own concerns that their force was not large enough. O'Sullivan and Murray in particular appear to have clashed during the campaign. While French-trained exiles like O'Sullivan considered Murray's knowledge outdated, Murray had a low opinion of O'Sullivan's abilities and later said that he wished that \\"Mr O'Sullivan had never got any other charge in the army than the care of the baggage\\". Nineteenth-century historians tended to interpret these differences in outlook by condemning O'Sullivan for incompetence,Pittock (2016) Culloden, OUP, p.26 although in reality his administration appears to have been effective.Pollard, Tony. Culloden: The History and Archaeology of the Last Clan Battle (Kindle Locations 1040-1041). Pen and Sword. Kindle Edition. O'Sullivan was primarily responsible for the organisation of the army's march southwards to England, which despite the army being formed in three separate columns was tightly coordinated and which has been assessed as \\"staff work of the highest order\\".Reid, S. (1996) 1745: A Military History of the Last Jacobite Rising, Spellmount, p.56 Battle of Culloden O'Sullivan's part in the Battle of Culloden is controversial, as many nineteenth century writers, and some later ones such as John Prebble, laid much of the blame on him for the Jacobite defeat. The influence of this is particularly noticeable in Peter Watkins' 1964 Culloden, based on Prebble's work, which in the course of framing the Jacobites as a largely feudal, archaic army led by incompetent aristocrats, depicts O'Sullivan as a \\"complete fool\\".Pittock, p.149 Although the most common criticism is of his choice of battlefield, O'Sullivan originally selected a site east of the final battle line; alternative choices had their own problems and in the event circumstances largely dictated the site in which the army actually drew up.Pittock (2016) p.58 There were few other viable options left than standing and fighting at Culloden and most of the Jacobite commanders were ultimately in favour of giving battle. Contrary to the accounts of Prebble and others, archaeological studies have shown that the Jacobite artillery at Culloden was not supplied with ammunition of the wrong size.Pollard, Tony. Culloden: The History and Archaeology of the Last Clan Battle (Kindle Locations 851-852). Pen and Sword. Kindle Edition. Panorama of the battlefield, circa 2007. The flag on the left side indicates the Jacobite lines, the flag on the right side shows the location of the Government lines. O'Sullivan's memoirs depicted him and John Drummond attempting to rally the Jacobite left and second line to ensure an orderly withdrawal. A witness records Charles wanted to lead a charge in an attempt to retrieve the situation but O'Sullivan ordered his escort to lead him away from the field. He later wrote that he \\"continued his retraite, making volte face from time to time alternatively with the small number of horse he had & those five and twenty men of Berwick‚Äôs\\".Tayler and Tayler, 1745 and After, p. 153. Evacuated by a French ship in May, on returning to France he urged an expedition be mounted to rescue Charles. Post-Culloden Despite the defeat at Culloden, O'Sullivan remained well regarded by the Stuart family. O'Sullivan was knighted by James Stuart in 1746 and received an Irish knighthood and baronetcy in the Jacobite peerage in 1753. He later fell out of Charles's favour: Charles's biographer McLynn has suggested this was because O'Sullivan had an affair with Clementina Walkinshaw. O'Sullivan's reputation in France does not seem to have been impacted by the Jacobite defeat; he was included on a 'gratification list' drawn up by the French in October 1746 and offered the choice of a colonelcy in one of Clare's, Bulkeleys or Dillons regiments. He subsequently again served as a staff officer with the French Army and is known to have been at Lauffeld in 1747, where Cumberland was defeated by Saxe,Reid (1996) 1745: A Military History of the Last Jacobite Rising, Spellmount, p.178 as well as with the force assembled for the 1759 planned French invasion of Britain. Further information regarding O'Sullivan is sparse. However he married Louise Fitzgerald in 1749 with whom he had a son, Thomas O'Sullivan, who went on to become a Major in the Irish Brigade; Thomas later fled to America and served in the British Army. His descendants included the American journalist John L. O'Sullivan; Margaret Thatcher also believed herself to be descended from O'Sullivan on her father's side.Torrance (2013), \\"A Soft Spot for Toffs\\", Scottish Review of Books, June 2013 The last reference to O'Sullivan is dated 20 December 1760 and he is presumed to have died soon after. He is buried in the church of Annezin-les-B√©thune, Normandy. References Sources * Bergin, John; O'Sullivan (Sullivan), Sir John William\\" in Dictionary of Irish Biography. (ed.)

The lake has a maximum level of above sea level. It can store one third of the canal's annual water requirements for the operation of the locks. Since the reservoir is not part of the navigational route, there are fewer restrictions on its water level. The Madden Dam was built to prevent the occasionally torrential flow of the once wild Chagres River, which flows into the navigational route of Gatun Lake and to control the level of water in the lake during the dry season. The river's unruly flow posed a major challenge to the construction of the Panama Canal which was originally addressed by the construction of the Gatun Dam. Water from the dam's reservoir is also used to generate hydroelectric power and to supply Panama City's fresh water. The dam and the reservoir behind it were both named for U.S. Congressman Martin B. Madden of Illinois, who was a chairman of the House appropriations committee during the period while the U.S. was constructing the Panama Canal. The reservoir, which had been known as Madden Lake from the time the dam first became operational, was renamed Lake Alajuela after the Canal Zone reverted to Panamanian control at the end of 1999.

What is known about O'Toole comes from a letter from the leaders of the Pale, the English colony around Dublin, to Pope John XXII asking him to authorise a crusade against the Irish. The letter names \\"Aduk Duff Octohyl\\" as leader of a host of Irish heretics. Modern historians regard the accusations as politically motivated, and the letter as a counter to the Irish Remonstrance of 1317. Adam Duff was the son of Walter Duff, of the O'Toole family based in the Wicklow Mountains. The O'Tooles had formed an alliance with the King of Leinster, Domhnall mac Art MacMurrough- Kavanagh, to wage war on the English.

In practice, measurement in production means measures of partial productivity. In that case, the objects of measurement are components of total productivity, and interpreted correctly, these components are indicative of productivity development. The term of partial productivity illustrates well the fact that total productivity is only measured partially ‚Äì or approximately. In a way, measurements are defective but, by understanding the logic of total productivity, it is possible to interpret correctly the results of partial productivity and to benefit from them in practical situations.Comparison of basic measure types (Saari 2006) Typical solutions of partial productivity are: #Single-factor productivity #Value-added productivity #Unit cost accounting #Efficiency ratios #Managerial control ratio system Single-factor productivity refers to the measurement of productivity that is a ratio of output and one input factor. A most well-known measure of single-factor productivity is the measure of output per work input, describing work productivity. Sometimes it is practical to employ the value added as output. Productivity measured in this way is called Value-added productivity. Also, productivity can be examined in cost accounting using Unit costs. Then it is mostly a question of exploiting data from standard cost accounting for productivity measurements. Efficiency ratios, which tell something about the ratio between the value produced and the sacrifices made for it, are available in large numbers. Managerial control ratio systems are composed of single measures which are interpreted in parallel with other measures related to the subject. Ratios may be related to any success factor of the area of responsibility, such as profitability, quality, position on the market, etc. Ratios may be combined to form one whole using simple rules, hence, creating a key figure system. The measures of partial productivity are physical measures, nominal price value measures and fixed price value measures. These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements. By excluding variables from measurement makes it possible to better focus the measurement on a given variable, yet, this means a more narrow approach. The table below was compiled to compare the basic types of measurement. The first column presents the measure types, the second the variables being measured, and the third column gives the variables excluded from measurement.

The British resident, Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort were massacred after an 8-hour siege by mutinous Afghan troops inside their Residency in Kabul. This event triggered the second phase of the war, during which an Anglo-Indian army invaded Afghanistan and captured Kabul. Prelude During the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, British troops invaded Afghanistan, and forced the Amir Sher Ali Khan to flee. He was replaced by his son Mohammad Yaqub Khan, who immediately sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Gandamak satisfied most British demands, including the annexation of several frontier districts, and the dispatch of a British envoy to Kabul to supervise Afghan foreign relations. The political officer selected for this task was Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari, the son of an Italian aristocrat who had served for several years in the British colonial administration, in particular as District Commissioner of Peshawar. Despite his experience of the region and his qualities as a diplomat, Cavagnari's appointment was viewed with some misgivings by British observers who knew his arrogant manners. General Neville Chamberlain said of him that he was: In addition, as the principal negotiator of the humiliating treaty of Gandamak, Cavagnari was hated by the Afghan populace. Despite this, he was chosen by the Governor-General Lord Lytton, who trusted and appreciated him.Robson, p.42 The envoy arrived in Kabul on July 24, 1879, with his assistant, a surgeon, and an escort of 75 soldiers of the elite Queen's Own Corps of Guides led by Lieutenant Walter Hamilton VC. The escort (25 Sowars of the Guides Cavalry and 50 Sepoys of the Guides Infantry) was kept small, so as to avoid provoking the Afghans.Robson, p.118 Siege In Kabul, the delegation occupied a compound inside the Bala Hissar fortress, from the Amir's quarters. Throughout the summer, the situation remained calm, and Cavagnari's messages to Simla remained confident. In August, the situation began to deteriorate with the arrival of six Afghan army regiments from Herat, who marched into the Bala Hissar demanding two months of arrears in back-pay. They mocked their colleagues of the Kabul regiments who had been beaten by the British, and demanded to be led against the residency, but the Amir's officers managed to pacify them with the payment of some of the arrears.Robson, p.120 Cavagnari was warned of the danger by a retired Rissaldar-Major of the Guides, but he answered \\"Never fear. Keep up your heart, dogs that bark don't bite!\\" The Rissaldar insisted: \\"But these dogs do bite. Sahib, the residency is in great danger!\\", to which Cavagnari answered: \\"They can only kill the three or four of us here, and our deaths will be avenged\\".Richards, p.85 On September 2 he telegraphed his last message to Lord Lytton: \\"All is well in the Kabul Embassy.\\" The Guides Infantry in Afghanistan. In the morning of September 3, the Herati regiments gathered once more inside the Bala Hissar, demanding their pay, but due to Tax revenues not having been collected, only one month's pay was offered to them. At this point someone suggested that the British had gold in their Residency, and the mutinous soldiers went to ask Cavagnari to pay their salaries. When confronted with these demands, the envoy refused to pay, claiming that the matter was of no concern to the British government. A scuffle ensued, and several shots were fired by the British troops. The Afghan soldiers immediately returned to their cantonment to fetch their weapons, while Cavagnari prepared the compound as best he could, and sent a plea for help to the Amir. Within the hour, 2,000 Afghan soldiers returned and invaded the Residency, which proved impossible to defend. It was surrounded on three sides by taller houses, enabling the Herati troops to gain advantageous firing positions from which they opened a heavy fire that gradually wiped out the defenders. Cavagnari was the first casualty of the attack, being hit in the head by a musket ball, but he was still able to lead a bayonet charge and drive the Afghans out of the compound, after which he withdrew inside the buildings and died of his wounds. The defense was taken over by Lieutenant Hamilton, who despatched a second messenger to Yakub Khan. This time the Amir sent his young son and a Mullah to try and pacify the mutineers, but their party was pelted with stones, unhorsed and forced to retreat. By midday, the main building of the Residency was on fire, and only 30 Guides and three British officers were fit enough to keep fighting. A last messenger was dispatched to the Amir, who answered that he was powerless to help. Eventually, the Afghans brought two cannons to the Residency, and started firing point-blank at the building. Hamilton led his remaining men in a charge that captured one gun, but they were driven back by Afghan fire that killed the surgeon, Kelly, and six sepoys. Hamilton urged his men to charge the guns once more but Jenkyns, Cavagnari's assistant, was killed, and the defenders were driven back. As the main building was on fire and collapsing, Hamilton and the 20 surviving sepoys took refuge in the brick bathhouse of the residency. Hamilton led another charge on the Afghan guns, and this time three sepoys managed to hitch their belts onto one of the gun carriages. After a moment's hesitation, the Herati soldiers charged the small party of Guides. Hamilton faced the oncoming Afghan wave, and emptied his revolver into them before being overwhelmed and killed. His stand allowed his 5 surviving men to retreat inside the compound. As all the British officers were now dead, the Afghans offered the Moslem soldiers the chance to surrender, but their offer was refused by the Guides, now led by Jemadar Jewand Singh. Instead, the remaining dozen Guides charged out of the compound, where they were all killed, but not before the Jemadar had accounted for 8 Afghans. By early evening, the occupants of the Residency were dead; the siege had lasted 8 hours. Aftermath The Guides' Memorial in Mardan, Pakistan, was built in 1892 to honour fallen soldiers who fought during the siege. From the original force of four British officers and 75 Indian soldiers, only 7 soldiers survived: 4 who were away from the Residency at the time of the attack, and 3 who were sent as messengers to the Amir and detained. A British military commission formed to investigate the events expressed the opinion that \\"the annals of no army and no regiment can show a brighter record of bravery than has been achieved by this small band of Guides.\\"Robson, p. 120 The entire escort were awarded the Indian Order of Merit (native soldiers at that time were not eligible for the Victoria Cross), and the Corps of Guides was awarded the Battle honour \\"Residency, Kabul\\". The death of Cavagnari and the destruction of the Residency marked a turning point in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Lytton's aggressive policy towards Afghanistan, known as the \\"Forward policy\\", destined to counter a potential Russian threat to British India, had failed spectacularly. Lytton himself observed that his policy had been \\"shattered to fragments\\", and instead advocated that Afghanistan should be split into three different states, centered on the cities of Herat, Kandahar and Kabul.Robson, p. 146 A military force, known as the Kabul Field Force, commanded by Sir Frederick Roberts, was rapidly mobilised in order to punish the perpetrators of Cavagnari's death. Caught between the threat of British retribution, and a xenophobic population, Yakub Khan surrendered to Roberts and later abdicated, declaring that he would rather be a grass-cutter in the English camp than the king of Afghanistan. After a battle at Charasiab, Roberts occupied Kabul on October 12. He set up a special military court that tried and executed some 100 Afghans for participating in the attack on the residency, and for resisting the subsequent British advance on Kabul. This policy proved controversial, both in Britain and India, and embarrassed Lytton and the Disraeli government, which fell during the 1880 general election, in part over the Afghanistan issue. In popular culture The siege is portrayed, with some fictionalization, in M.M. Kaye's 1978 novel The Far Pavilions. The novel was adapted into a 1984 mini-series, in which Sir John Gielgud portrayed Cavagnari and Benedict Taylor portrayed Hamilton.

Synopsis Looking for Moshe Guez follows director Avida Livny as he searches for a childhood memory: his memories from the first Israeli horror film, The Angel Was a Devil, which he has seen once in the 1980s, as a 10-year-old. Having forgotten about the film, he \\"discovers\\" it again in a book by Meir Schnitzer concerning Israeli cinema, where it is described as \\"the worst film ever made in Israel\\". The first part of Looking for Moshe Guez focuses on the search in Israel, which was produced between 1971‚Äì1976, with Guez as the film director, screenwriter, star, cinematographer, recorder and editor. Among the participants who remember Guez or his film are journalist Lisa Peretz, played by Ophelia Strahl, who described it as the \\"Israeli Ed Wood\\". The second part of the film, which takes part in the Boston area where Guez and his family have been living since the 1980s, enables us to see for the first time scenes from the \\"director's cut\\".

Srilakshmi was former Andhra Pradesh Secretary for Industries (including).Telangana government gave her the posting order on October 7, 2016, appointing as Chief Secretary of State Government Institutions. She got the Chief Secretary post according to her seniority. Arrest due to alleged involvement in OMC illegal mining The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested V.D. Rajagopal and Y. Srilakshmi, as third and fourth accused respectively in the investigation into illegal mining by Obulapuram Mining Company. The permission for mining in Anantapur was for captive mining, i.e. the ore mined in that region is to be used in the local steel plant and not to be exported. Srilakshmi is accused of dropping the term \\"captive mining\\" in the final order approving a mining license to Obulapuram. Srilakshmi suggested that this was done at the insistence of the former Minister of Mines and current Telangana minister Sabitha Indra Reddy. However the CBI defended the Home minister, who is a senior local politician of the ruling Congress party. She was suspended from the IAS after 48 hours of police custody. She received conditional bail on 2 December 2011. The Andhra Pradesh High Court cancelled bail on 2 Jan 2012 and Srilakshmi was taken into judicial custody. Srilakshmi was again granted interim bail on 9 October 2012 till 20 January 2013 with Rs. 50,000 bond. CBI Charge sheet in OMC case The CBI alleged that Srilakshmi and Rajagopal demanded huge bribes from mine owners for prospecting licences. The CBI said in the charge sheet that Srilakshmi showed preferential treatment to Obulapuram Mining Company even with respect to the state owned Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) for mining leases. On Srilakshmi, the charge sheet said that the senior IAS officer, as secretary of industries and commerce, also deliberately favoured the OMC in allotting mining area. The department had received more than 30 applications for lease of the six mining areas in the state and Srilakshmi deliberately allocated three areas to OMC. Among those rejected by her were Ch Shasi Kumar (11 May 2005) and Gimpex Limited (26 April 2007). Favouring OMC, Srilakshmi wrote a letter to the ministry of mines that OMC was a bonafide firm. However, it is evident that many CBI officers are acting us underworld dons favoring few business mans and politicians, as also to those rivalry to Reddys. One such CBI officer Lakshmi Narayana slapped an IAS officer (who is supporting Reddys) during his investigation, suggesting that CBI officer was reported to have been acted as goons in the street for his personal/casteism and favouring business mans and politicians rivalry to Reddys . Lakshminarayana, later met with Jana Sena party president Pawan Kalyan and joined Jana Sena Party, confirming his personal/casteism and political vendetta in his mind, even during his tenure as an investigating agencies that prompted him to join politics even after resigning from top position. See the source https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ending-speculation-ex-cbi-jd- lakshminarayana-joins-pawan-kalyan-s-jana-sena-98459 Conflict between AP state government ministers and IAS officers The conflict between the ministers of the state of Andhra Pradesh, who are elected politicians and the officers from the IAS cadre came to public view in Feb 2012. The extent of corruption in the YSR government was even highlighted in the US state department cables exposed by Wikileaks. In the inter-related investigations into the OMC mining scandal, the EMAAR-MGF Boulder Hills scam and the inquiry into the inordinate wealth of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy allegedly accumulated as a quid-pro-quo for favours received from the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government, the CBI has focused on various IAS officers. IAS officers from Andhra Pradesh including Srilakshmi, Rajagopal, B. P. Acharya, L. V. Subrahmanyam, K. V. Rao, K. Ratna Prabha, etc., have been arrested, charge- sheeted or have been questioned by the CBI in the investigation. The AP IAS Officers Association alleged that they were made scapegoats for the decisions forced by the supervising ministers. They suggested that the decisions that incriminated the IAS officers took, could not have been implemented without the approval of concerned members of the Council of Ministers. The IAS officers alleged that the ministers, who belong to the Congress Party, suspected of involvement in the same cases have been left untouched by the CBI, which is controlled by the home ministry of the Congress-led UPA government at the center in New Delhi. The officers have challenged the CBI procedures in these arrests. While Opposition political parties have suggested that the IAS officers name the ministers responsible for corruption in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress party functionaries have denied that the officers are being made scapegoats. Several other voices including the former vigilance commissioner, Ramachandra Samal, have reiterated that the system is deep in corruption. Without any conflict between officers and government run by politicians are rare in the world, as you see everyday news.

It is a reef building species and is found in tropical parts of the Pacific Ocean. Description Montipora capitata is an encrusting, colonial coral which develops arborescent forms as it matures. The corallites are tiny and well separated by coenosteum. Their walls and the septa are indistinct. The skeleton is porous and there are small smooth surface projections known as verrucae which give the coral its common name of rice coral. These are irregularly spaced and may be fused near the tips of branches. The colour is normally pale brown with white verrucae.Montipora capitata Corals of the World. Retrieved 2011-12-21.Family Acroporidae: Montipora Retrieved 2011-12-21. Distribution Montipora capitata is found in the tropical north and central Pacific Ocean at depths down to . It is common in the waters around Hawaii especially where the sea is turbulent. Ecology The crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), seems to preferentially feed on corals of the genus Montipora. It is a voracious predator and can have devastating effects on slow growing corals. Threats Like other reef corals, Montipora capitata is threatened by habitat destruction. Rising sea temperatures can cause \\"bleaching\\" because the symbiotic zooxanthellae are expelled from the coral's tissues, leaving the coral colorless. The bleaching event results in very high coral mortality soon after. Stressed corals are more susceptible to disease. Other threats are posed by El Nino events, ocean acidification which tends to dissolve the coral skeleton, trawling and other fishing activities, pollution and sedimentation.

In a career that lasted from 1875 to 1876 he ran seven times and won three races. In the summer of 1876 he became the third of six horses to win both The Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris. He was the second foreign-bred horse, after Gladiateur in 1865, to win the Derby: he remains the only Hungarian-bred horse to do so. At the end of the season he was retired to stud. Background Kisber was a powerfully built bay horse, bred at the Hungarian Imperial Stud from thoroughbreds which had been imported from England. His sire, Buccaneer, a member of the Byerley Turk sire line, had won several important races including the July Stakes and the Royal Hunt Cup. He sired several notable winners (including Formosa, a filly who won four British Classic Races in 1868) and was British British Champion sire in 1868 and 1869. By the time his efficacy as a stallion became apparent, however, he was no longer available to British breeders, having been exported to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1866. Kisber‚Äôs dam, Mineral, was a daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Manganese. Mineral won several minor races and, before her export to Hungary, produced the St Leger winner Wenlock. Kisber was sent to the sales as a yearling and bought for approximately ¬£500 by the Turkish-born brothers Alexander and Hector Baltazzi. He was sent into training in England with Joseph Hayhoe at his Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Until 1946, thoroughbreds were allowed to race in England without being officially named. The colt who would become Kisber raced unnamed as a two-year-old when he was known simply as \\"The Mineral Colt\\". Shortly before he ran in the Derby he was named in honour of his birthplace. Racing career 1875: two-year-old season As a two- year-old, Kisber showed outstanding ability in home gallops, including trial races in which he gave weight and decisive beatings to high-class stable companions. He took time to reproduce his home form in public however, and finished unplaced in the July Stakes and third in the Stetchworth Stakes in the summer of 1875. In autumn, despite his lack of success, he was aimed at the most important two-year-old races at Newmarket. He was strongly fancied for the Middle Park Plate in October and was heavily backed by his owners. He failed again however, finishing unplaced behind Petrarch. Two weeks later, Kisber finally justified the confidence of his connections with a three-length win over Springfield in the inaugural running of the Dewhurst Stakes, enabling the Baltazzi brothers to win back the money they had lost on his previous races. 1876: three-year-old season Alexander Baltazzi: Kisber ran in his name although the colt was owned jointly with his brother Hector Kisber made good progress over the winter of 1875‚Äì1876 and was regarded as one of the leading contenders for the Derby. He did not run in any of the trial races or the 2000 Guineas however, and there were rumours that he would also miss the Derby. The rumours originated from the difficult financial position of his owners: the Baltazzi brothers were heavily in debt and it seemed possible that Kisber, as their most valuable asset, would be seized by their creditors. Eventually, the brothers managed to obtain further credit, enabling the colt to run in their colours at Epsom. On 31 May he started 4/1 second favourite in a field of fifteen. Petrarch, who had won the 2000 Guineas was favourite at 2/1. Kisber broke quickly, but was then pulled back by Charles Maidment and raced towards the back of the field in the early stages. He turned into the straight in fifth place and moved up to challenge Petrarch for the lead just over a furlong out. Kisber quickly went clear as the favourite weakened and won very easily by five lengths from Forerunner. The Baltazzi brothers financial position was eased considerably: apart from the prize-money, they took an estimated ¬£100,000 in winning bets. A few days after his win at Epsom, Kisber was sent to Longchamp for the Grand Prix de Paris on 11 June, the most important race in France. Kisber started favourite for the 3000m race in front of a large and enthusiastic crowd which included the President of France. Following an investigation by the French racing officials it was declared that he would not be considered an English horse in the event of his victory. He produced a \\"wonderful\\" performance, leading for most of the way and winning very easily by five lengths from the Oaks winner Enguerrande. The win took his earnings for the year to ¬£11,173. On his final start Kisber was sent to Doncaster for the St Leger, for which he started 7/4 favourite against eight rivals despite rumours that he was having problems in training. He was certainly not impressive before the race, appearing heavily bandaged on all four legs. He ran prominently for much of the way but weakened abruptly in the straight and finished a remote fourth behind Petrarch. John Osbourne, who rode him in the race said \\"He was beaten before he even started\\". There was some dissatisfaction with the result from those who felt that Kisber had not shown his true form and that his owners had never intended him to win. According to one London correspondent, there were \\"suspicions of unfairness\\". Kisber was entered in some major races in 1877, and was rumoured to be returning for a match race against Silvio in 1878, but he never ran again. Popular culture The \\"Kisber\\" was the name given to one of the most fashionable bonnets of the summer of 1876. Stud career Kisber was based at various studs in England from 1877 to 1886 when he was moved to the Baltazzi brothers stud at Napajedla in Moravia. Two year later he was moved to a stud in Bad Harzburg in Germany, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was Champion Sire in Germany in 1894, 1895 and 1896. His death was reported in 1895.

It is the only hospital in Westchester County entirely dedicated to rehabilitation medicine. Opened in 1915, Burke has been involved in medical rehabilitation for over one hundred years. As of January 2016, Burke is a member of the Montefiore Health System, Inc. Burke provides inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation to patients with a broad range of neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiac and pulmonary disabilities caused by disease or injury. Burke treats patients who have suffered a stroke, spinal cord injury, brain injury, amputations, complicated fractures, cardiac disease, arthritis and pulmonary disease as well as neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Patients are generally from the eastern United States, but Burke also sees patients from other parts of the U.S. and, through its International Patient Program, from abroad. It has approximately 600 employees and 17 full-time physicians. Burke Rehabilitation Hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. History Burke Rehabilitation Hospital was established by John Masterson Burke through his Winifred Masterson Burke Relief Foundation, named in honor of his mother. The hospital opened its doors on April 7, 1915 and initially treated patients for pneumonia, ulcers, fatigue, cardiac and thyroid disease. Illustrated 1940s-era postcard showing the full grounds and central courtyard Along with medical supervision and treatments, the hospital‚Äôs early programs also called for rigorous exercise and daily chores. It was one of the first institutions to encourage moderate exercise for cardiac patients and eventually helped found the American Heart Association in 1924. During World War I, Burke was used as a naval hospital and served 2,000 sailors who became known as ‚ÄúBurke‚Äôs Navy.‚Äù The hospital‚Äôs services were needed again after World War II when the number and nature of injuries suffered by veterans led to a renewed emphasis on physical and occupational therapies, improvements to prosthetic limbs and wheelchairs, and the development of community services. In 1951, the same year the hospital became formally known as The Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, its focus became multi-disciplinary medical rehabilitation. Today, the hospital specializes in recovery from physical disabilities due to stroke, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, arthritis, orthopedics and amputation.http://www.burke.org/rehab/about/history Programs The hospital provides the following services:http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/burke-rehabilitation- hospital-6215315/details * Brain Injury Rehabilitation * Cardiac Rehabilitation * Fitness Programs * Geriatric Services * Health fairs and health screenings * Neurological Rehabilitation * Neuropsychology Services * Nutrition Services * Occupational therapy * Orthopedic Rehabilitation * Outpatient therapy * Pain Management * Pastoral Services * Physical therapy * Physician Practice * Pulmonary Rehabilitation * Residency Program * Social Work/Case management and assistance with government services * Speech therapy * Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation * Sports Medicine * Stroke Rehabilitation * Support Groups * Wound management services Notable staff There are several Burke doctors who are in U.S. News & World Report's Doctors list.

Plot Khalifah (Marsha Timothy), a young, physically attractive woman, is working at the salon run by her deceased mother's friend Rita (Jajang C. Noer). After her shift, she goes home by bus and passes a group of three teenaged boys who make catcalls. Upon arriving at home, she talks with her father, Bilal (Brohisman), her brother Faisal (Yoga Pratama) and her father's friend Riko about Riko's nephew, Rasyid (Indra Herlambang). Khalifah is asked to marry him, and is told that it is her decision; after she sees that her father is considering selling his wedding ring to pay the rent, she agrees. Khalifah and Rasyid are married and move in together. The two have very different habits, with Rasyid strictly following Islamic doctrine and Khalifah living a more metropolitan lifestyle; their relationship is also stressed by Rasyid often leaving for weeks at a time for business. Eventually, Rasyid convinces Khalifah to wear a headscarf; after she begins wearing it, her friends and colleagues compliment her on the choice. Meanwhile, she meets a new neighbour, the tailor Yoga (Ben Joshua), and begins to feel attracted to him; she does not act on this attraction. Khalifah soon learns that she is pregnant. Rasyid is also overjoyed at the news, giving Khalifah a special tonic to help her with the pregnancy. However, when Khalifah miscarries during prayer while Rasyid is abroad, she is devastated; when Rasyid learns of the miscarriage, he says that it is because she has sinned and tells her to wear the niqab. Although initially displeased, she agrees. The following day, Rasyid leaves on business for two months, and Khalifah engages Yoga to make her niqab. However, her life outside the house changes rapidly, with passersby staring, pointing, or even accusing her of being a terrorist. Although she initially attempts to quit her job at the salon as she cannot work with the niqab on and cannot be seen by other men with it off, Rita chooses to make the salon exclusively for women on Fridays and Saturdays; this results in another niqab-wearing woman, Fatimah (Titi Sjuman), to come to the salon. Fatimah is able to answer Khalifah's questions on the garment and its social context. Khalifah learns that she is pregnant again, and tells Rasyid when he returns. Although he is at first happy, he becomes increasingly withdrawn; he soon leaves again. Yoga leaves for Saudi Arabia to work as a tailor there. Not long afterwards, as Khalifah is preparing to go to work, she is stopped by a woman on the street who accuses her of being a terrorist; Khalifah is soon picked up and questioned by the police, only to be released when the chief indicates that Bilal, his former teacher, is her father. As Khalifah is recovering at her family's home, she sees on television that a group of suspected terrorists were caught in a firefight with police, and a niqab-wearing gunman was killed. Immediately afterwards there is a knock at the door, with the police having come to ask Khalifah to identify Rasyid's body; in the morgue, she meets Rasyid's other wife and child, of whom she had no knowledge. Upon returning home, she removes everything that connected her to Rasyid, including the niqab. Several months later, with her baby already born, Khalifah receives a package in the post from Yoga; inside, she sees that it is a new niqab. Trying it on in a mirror, she takes it off and says \\"I am Khalifah\\". Production Hakim noted that the film was meant to address controversy over the niqab (example pictured) in Europe. Director Nurman Hakim chose the name Khalifah for the title character for its connotations in the Arab world; literally meaning \\"leader\\", Khalifah is used for men. He notes that the film was meant to address the controversy over burqas in Europe, such as French, Spanish, and Belgian attempts to ban the veils. Khalifah was his second film, after 3 Doa 3 Cinta (3 Prayers 3 Loves; 2009). The film was produced by Triximages and Frame Ritz Pictures. Triximages, owned by Nan Achnas and Nurman Hakim, has a history of producing award winning films since the children's film Bendera (Flag) competed in the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2003; Frame Ritz Pictures, though generally working in soap operas and miniseries, had previously produced two feature-length films. Although the character of Khalifah is 23, 30-year-old Marsha Timothy was cast in the starring role. It was also the feature-film debut of Indra Herlambang, a long-standing television host. Themes Hakim notes that he attempted to draw on the subjectivity surrounding the niqab and burqa. He notes that Khalifah can observe what others are doing without being noticed, but she is also discriminated against. Film critic Wicaksono Adi also notes the discrepancy, writing that although Khalifah must deal with negative reactions from society, she finds a sort of \\"freedom\\": freedom from the stares of men. Wicaksono also notes that although Rasyid is easily identified as an Islamic fundamentalist, dogmatic issues are set aside to deal with Khalifah's personal experiences; the personal aspects of the film are emphasized over the ideological ones. Nunuy Nurhayati in Tempo writes that the other characters' piousness is shown through their physical actions, such as Yoga aiding Khalifah in picking up her groceries after she dropped them. Cynthia Webb, a member of the Australia Indonesia Arts Alliance, writes that Khalifah is an \\"invitation to discuss the wearing of the niqab\\". She notes that it reflects polemics about the veil, with Fatimah's admonition, that one should not wear it unless one is certain, a \\"veiled warning\\" for the Indonesian populace. Release and reception Khalifah was released on 6 January 2011. Indah Setiawati, writing for The Jakarta Post, wrote that the film was successful in its delivery of its message and had good acting, but moved slowly at times. Nunuy Nurhayati in Tempo writes that, although the film takes a new angle in discussing issues related to the niqab, it does not explore Khalifah's inner struggle enough. A review from entertainment news website KapanLagi.com noted that the film would improve the viewers' worldview of everyday issues, not only those related to Islam.

It is the eleventh episode of the show's eighth season and was broadcast on January 15, 2012. Plot Immediately following the events of the previous episode, Bree makes her way to Gabrielle's house to talk with her and Lynette about the second letter she just received. After a tense discussion about the issue Gabrielle and Lynette come to the conclusion that since Bree is the only one who has received any letters, then maybe who ever this person is only wants her. A disgusted Bree marches off while Gabrielle and Lynette decide to reconcile and continue to be mad at Bree. As Bree walks home a person is seen in a car, watching her. Susan heads to Oklahoma to visit Alejandro's family. Once she gets there she sees that the house is for sale and is invited in by the Realtor who shares private information about the family. Alejandro's wife, Claudia, comes home and is disgusted to hear the conversation taking place. The Realtor excuses herself and Susan offers to buy many of Claudia's knick-knacks, pretending to be an Americana collector and writes her a check. Claudia says that Alejandro leaves for extended periods of time often, but always comes back, and that he is a good husband and a good man. While she says this her daughter looks on with fear in her eyes and face, something Susan can't help but notice. Lynette makes dinner at her house for herself and her kids, and all of them notice that the light is flickering. The kids mention that Lynette should call their father, as he will know what to do, but Lynette abruptly refuses. Saying that she should be more independent she attempts to fix the problem herself but the next day she ends up putting holes in the kid's walls, much to their dismay. After Parker and Penny say to call their father or at least a repairman Lynette becomes angry with her kids saying that she will do it herself and that if she had known that their father would eventually leave she would have had him teach her how to do things like that. Upset that she yelled at her kids, Lynette goes to make dinner. When Mike's paycheck bounces he goes to Ben who tells him that he just switched banks and there must have been a misunderstanding. At work Mike sees that things are being taken away and goes to talk Ben who is obviously taking money from a loan shark to pay loans. Mike says that Ben will never be able to pay him back and will always be at his mercy and tells the loan shark and his assistances to leave. Later Mike makes the comment that Renee got $12 million from her divorce, something that Ben hadn't realized. Gabrielle agrees to go to a business meeting for Carlos and asks Lynette to teach her everything she knows in one day. After a tense study session Lynette remarks that Gabrielle can't just float on by on her looks anymore and Gabrielle says that Lynette always has to be right. Both women are upset but after Gabrielle's meeting ends in disaster she realizes that Lynette is right, and after the ordeal with the light fixture at her house Lynette sees that Gabrielle is right in saying that she always has to be right and never wants to accept help. The two reconcile once more and Lynette calls a repair man to fix her light. Bree and Renee go to a bar where Bree ends up meeting a man who seems to have the same taste as her. They end up going back to his place and have brief sex in his pool, but is interrupted when his boss comes storming out of the house - the house, the pool and even the suit he is wearing all belonged to his boss. Bree awkwardly leaves and tells the story to Renee who says that she thinks that Bree had a blast. After consideration Bree says that it was exhilarating. Susan comes back to Alejandro's house and talks to his step-daughter Marisa. She asks if Alejandro ever did anything bad to her in any way and Marisa cries, implying that he did the same thing to her that he did to Gabrielle many years ago. Susan calmly and seriously says that Alejandro is never coming back and will never hurt her again. Susan goes home and no longer feels guilt about Alejandro's death, while Marisa tells her mother what Susan told her. The episode ends with Claudia taking the check that Susan gave her out of her pocket and looking at Susan's address.

The investigation found that Chen had been racially harassed and beaten by his fellow soldiers before his death on October 3, 2011. Early life Chen was born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, New York City, New York by parents who had immigrated from China. His father works as a chef and his mother as a seamstress. His parents came from Taishan, a coastal city in Guangdong province, China. Chen attended P.S. 130 M, graduated from Pace University High School in Manhattan in 2010, and received a full scholarship offer to Baruch College in Manhattan. However, Chen had other ambitions and joined the army in January 2011. He planned after his military service to return to New York City to serve with the New York City Police Department. His mother was unhappy about his choice, but supported his decision. Career After completing basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, in April 2011, Pvt. Chen was assigned to C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, which is based in Fort Wainwright, Alaska. In August, he was deployed with his unit to Kandahar province in Afghanistan. They were stationed at Combat Outpost Palace, a forward operating post. Death at base Chen was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his living quarters at the base in Kandahar province, Afghanistan. \\"Three days after his death, a military official told Ms. Chen and her husband, Yan Tao Chen, that investigators had not yet determined whether the shot to the head was self- inflicted or fired by someone else. But the official also revealed, the Chens said, that Private Chen had been subjected to physical abuse and ethnic slurs by superiors, who one night dragged him out of bed and across the floor when he failed to turn off a water heater after showering.\\" The military did not provide much information to the parents while they were conducting their investigation. But military investigators found that Chen was the target in Afghanistan of ethnic slurs and endured physical attacks at the hands of his fellow soldiers before his death. Chen was found to have been physically and verbally abused by his superiors, who appeared to single him out for being Chinese-American. This abuse occurred on a daily basis for six weeks before his death. As the only American soldier with Chinese ancestry in the unit, he was singled out, endured taunts including racial slurs such as \\"gook\\", \\"chink\\", \\"Jackie Chan\\", \\"Soy Sauce\\" and \\"dragon lady;\\" assigned excessive guard duty to the point of exhaustion, made to do push-ups while holding water in his mouth, and put in a \\"simulated sitting position\\" and kicked by other soldiers using their knees, among other abuses. He was allegedly pelted with stones by fellow soldiers and forced to crawl across gravel shortly before his death. On September 27, 2011, a sergeant dragged Chen out of bed and over of gravel, leaving visible bruises and cuts on Chen's back. Although the incident was reported to Chen's platoon sergeant and squad leader, it was not reported to superior officers. On October 3, 2011, the day he died, other soldiers forced him to crawl on gravel for over while carrying equipment, as his comrades threw rocks at him. Burial Chen received a military funeral at a cemetery in Valhalla, New York, on October 13, 2011. Investigation and legal consequences On December 21, 2011, the US Army charged eight soldiers with various crimes relating to Chen's death: * 1st Lt. Daniel J. Schwartz * Staff Sgt. Blaine G. Dugas * Staff Sgt. Andrew J. Van Bockel * Sgt. Travis F. Carden * Sgt. Adam M. Holcomb * Sgt. Jeffrey T. Hurst * Spc. Thomas P. Curtis * Spc. Ryan J. Offutt All the defendants belonged to C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. They faced various charges, including assault, dereliction of duty, involuntary manslaughter, maltreatment, making false statements, negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment. Following a series of Article 32 hearings on March 5, 2012, investigators dropped the most serious charge, involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. Four of the eight soldiers were recommended for court-martial on the remaining charges, such as negligent homicide, which carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. Subsequent trials were held at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Daniel Schwartz Daniel Schwartz of Maryland, a 2009 graduate of West Point, was Chen's platoon leader and a First Lieutenant. Following a pretrial hearing at Kandahar Air Field, he was recommended for court-martial on February 12, 2012. He faced eight counts of dereliction of duty, including failure to promote \\"a climate in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of race\\" and \\"to prevent his subordinates from maltreating and engaging in racially abusive language.\\" Furthermore, he stood \\"accused of failing to report two soldiers for consuming alcohol in violation of military rules and failing to report one of those soldiers for 'recklessly' detonating a hand grenade near their base.\\" Schwartz reached a plea deal with prosecutors in December 2012, after they consulted with Chen's parents about the issues. Schwartz did not face trial, and the charges against him were dropped. But he was dismissed from the Army, following a nonpublic Article 15 proceeding. Specifics regarding his punishment were not disclosed. Courts-Martial Adam Holcomb In July 2012, the court-martial started of 30-year-old Sgt. Adam Michael Holcomb of Youngstown, Ohio, among the four charged in Chen's death. He faced charges including negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, communicating a threat, assault, maltreatment of a subordinate, dereliction of duty, and violating a lawful general regulation, which combined carried a maximum prison sentence of up to 17 years and 9 months. He pleaded not guilty. The trial was conducted at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Private Degan Berhe testified that Chen had discussed suicide because of being harassed by Holcomb: \\"He told me to my face, sir, that he wanted to commit suicide because he was mistreated.\\" Holcomb was acquitted of being a cause of Chen's death and most of the other charges, but was convicted of assault. He was sentenced to thirty days in jail, demoted by one rank, and fined $1100 in forfeited pay for this offense. Members of the community, including Asian Americans and civil rights activists, were outraged by this light sentence. Ryan Offutt In August 2012, it was reported that Spc. Ryan J. Offutt pleaded guilty to one count of hazing and two specifications of maltreatment. Offutt made a plea deal, resulting in charges of negligent homicide and reckless endangerment being dropped. Offutt had called Chen \\"chink,\\" \\"gook,\\" \\"fortune cookie,\\" \\"squint eye\\", and \\"egg roll.\\" He had kicked Chen and thrown rocks at him. He was sentenced to six months in prison. On appeal, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed the six-month sentence and approved punishment only of reducing him in rank to E-1 and discharging him with a Bad Conduct Discharge.https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Portals/Files/ACCAOther.nsf/SD/9A3C04D4E233CC1885257D7E006DD210/$FILE/sd- offutt,%20rj.pdf Travis Carden In October 2012, it was reported that Spc. Travis Carden was sentenced to ten months in prison, demoted to private and received a Bad-Conduct Discharge, after pleading guilty to charges which included attempting to impede an investigation, striking and pushing another soldier, and negligently discharging a pistol in a government van during the altercation. Carden had previously been found guilty of ordering Chen to perform demeaning physical tasks, and calling him racially disparaging names. Andrew J. VanBockel In Afghanistan, VanBockel was Chen's squad leader at Combat Outpost Palace. In November 2012, a military jury convicted Staff Sgt. VanBockel of hazing, dereliction of duty and maltreatment of a subordinate. He was demoted two ranks, reprimanded and forced to perform 60 days of hard labor, of which 45 days were credited due to pre-trial confinement. Aftermath Private Chen's death followed the suicide of Lance Corporal Harry Lew of the United States Marines, which took place in the same year. The military has been criticized for other deaths of young men associated with hazing, and has conducted courts-martial of fellow military men, including non-coms and officers, who have been seen as permitting or encouraging abusive hazing, against the military's official policies. After the trials associated with Chen's death, the Army said it was working \\"to re-examine its policies against hazing and, officials said, double its efforts to eradicate the practice from its ranks.\\" Congresswoman Judy Chu (D-CA), an aunt of Lew, introduced a bill, \\"Harry Lew Military Hazing Accountability and Prevention Act\\", which was passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017. An American Soldier, an opera based on Chen's suicide and the subsequent courts-martial was premiered at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2014.

While working at the Royal Danish Porcelain Factory, he designed a number of delicately decorated figurines. He is however remembered above all for his statues celebrating the female form. Early life After attending the Technical School in Copenhagen (1892‚Äì94), he worked for a couple of years as a house painter's apprentice before spending the winter of 1897-98 in Gothenburg. There he met the Swedish painter Ivar Arosenius (1898‚Äì1902) whose friendship greatly influenced his early work as a painter and illustrator. Their circle of friends was also inspired by the British illustrator Aubrey Beardsley whose erotic style is also reflected in Henning's early work.\\"Gerhard Henning\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 20 December 2011.Dorthe Falcon M√∏ller, \\"Gerhard Henning\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunsterleksikon. Retrieved 20 December 2011. In 1931, Henning became a Danish citizen.\\"Royal Copenhagen 1238 Princes and the Pea\\", Klosterk√¶lderen. Retrieved 21 December 2011. Career Gerhard Henning: Reclining Girl, Malm√∂ Slottspark In 1909, Henning began to work for Copenhagen's Royal Porcelain Factory where, apart from an interruption from 1914 to 1920, he continued to be employed until 1925. There he met and married china painter Gerda Heydorn, who later became a noted textile designer with whom he occasionally collaborated. Although he had never had instruction specifically in sculpture, he created sophisticated little groups of figures, often in erotic situations inspired by 18th century French art. But after he had met Kai Nielsen and had studied the sculptural works of Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol and some of the classical works in the Glyptothek, his approach developed along more personal and monumental lines. Henning showed an early interest in classical poetry, especially Ovid's Metamorphoses, which inspired him to create a number of amorous figures such as Cupid with Psyche and Pygmalion with Galathea. His main theme was however the naked female figure which he initially developed in collaboration with Kai Nielsen. His statuette of a \\"Reclining Girl\\" (1914) led to Nielsen's \\"Leda without the Swan\\" which in turn encouraged him to experiment with larger formats. His large female figures began with the bold \\"Danae\\" (1927) and was soon followed by the voluptuous \\"Girl Standing\\" (1929). Around 1930, he altered his style with his \\"Moder Girl\\", a slender, short- haired figure in contrast to the heavier bushy-haired figures inspired by antiquity. During the 1930s, he added shoes and socks to his naked figures but soon omitted them again. His \\"Seated Girl\\" (1938) is based on a complex diagonal theme but stands in calm, harmonious equilibrium like his \\"Reclining Girl\\" (1943). He worked on his last large sculpture \\"Susanne\\" (1964) for a full 10 years, drawing on his sketches of Pygmalion and Galatea from 1919-20. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Royal Copenhagen figurines One of the finest works executed by Henning while he was at the Royal Copenhagen factory was \\"The Princess on the Pea\\" inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy story. With meticulous attention to detail, Henning has depicted a series of images on the many surfaces of the glazed sculpture including Chinese dragons, Persian warriors and children at play. Created in 1911, the following year the piece was awarded the First Class Medal at the Paris Salon where it was considered to be one of the finest pieces of European porcelain of the times. Other overglazed figurines include three Fairy Tale couples (1912‚Äì1914), Moongirl (1913), (Satyr and Nymph (1910), Cupid and Psyche (1914), Grief (1914), Venus (1924), and Susanne (1924).\\"Denmark\\", Figurin.se. Retrieved 21 December 2011. Assessment With his appreciation of the curvature and tension of the female form, Henning is one of the most important contributors to the female figure in Danish sculpture. In 1937, Henning was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal and in 1955 received the Prince Eugen Medal.

The local residents also call it crab roe tangbao. It is a dish in Huaiyang cuisine. Brief introduction Wenlou Tang bao originated during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor in the Qing dynasty. It has three exquisite features. First, it is very big and its wrapper is extremely thin and looks like paper. Second, the stuffing is mixed with many materials such as meat, chicken, crab-roe, shrimps, etc. Third, it is the unique process. The soup stuffing should be solidified, put into the wrapper and steamed finally. History Wenlou was set up in Chuzhou District in 1828 where the literators and scholars always gathered in the past. Standing on it, you can appreciate the beautiful view. So it got the name Wenlou. At the beginning, Wenlou did not sell Tang bao. It acted as a teahouse and sold a few foods. In autumn, when crabs spring up on the market, Wenlou will supply the crab-roe tang bao. It is said that the Daoguang Emperor awarded Wenlou Tang bao the title ‚Äúthe most fresh in China‚Äù after he tasted it. It also left a deep impression on former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1964, when Zhou received the leaders of Huai'an, he asked the business of Wenlou Tang bao. According to the report of local media, Wenlou Tang bao was identified as \\"Famous snakes in China\\" by China Cuisine Association in 1997. In 2002, Wenlou Tang bao registered the patent.

It was created in 1955 by Kateryna Yushchenko. In particular, the Address programming language made possible indirect addressing and addresses of the highest rank analogous to pointers. Unlike Fortran and ALGOL 60, APL (Address programming language) supported indirect addressing and addressing of higher ranks. Indirect addressing is a mechanism that appeared in other programming languages much later (1963‚Äì65 in PL/1). The Address language was implemented on all the computers of the first and second generation produced in the Soviet Union. The Address language influenced the architecture of the Kyiv, Strela, Ural, and Promin computers. The Address was used exclusively for the solution of economical problems, including aviation, space exploration, machine building, and military complex in particular, to calculate the trajectories of ballistic missiles in flight in the 1950‚Äì60s. Implementations of the Address programming language were used for nearly 20 years. A book about APL was written in 1967 and it was translated into French and published in France in 1974. The Address language affected not only the Soviet Union's economical development, but information technology and programming. APL's proposed and implemented ideas and tools can be found in many programming-related fields, such as abstract data types, object-oriented programming, functional programming, database and artificial intelligence.

It holds 37 million gallons of water and is supplied by its large Ch√¢teau Style pump-houses located in the south- eastern corner of the park. The site of the reservoir is also known as Rutherford Park and is the location of the McTavish automated weather reporting station (CWTA, 71612). History The McTavish reservoir as it appeared in 1873, uncovered. Cupola of McGill College Building (now called the Arts Building) visible at left. The city of Montreal decided to construct the reservoir in 1852, after a devastating fire that destroyed almost half the houses in the city. The fire had broken out while the previous reservoir, located at what is now Saint-Louis Square, was closed for repairs. The reservoir was constructed between 1852 and 1856 and uses the natural rock of the site to hold water, with some masonry on the south of the reservoir. The McTavish reservoir was increased in size twice after its initial construction. It was subsequently covered in 1957 and the terrain on top used for recreation. The cliff created in the construction of the reservoir is used as an ice climbing location in downtown Montreal. Nine million dollars was spent in 2008-2009 on upgrading the pump house and reservoir for infrastructure security and preventing water contamination, but the security features have proven to be ineffective and easily infiltrated. The city of Montreal has subsequently attempted to close the park in 2009 and restrict access to the public, citing escalating terrorist threats from the September 11 attacks as the rationale for the non-publicly consulted decision. The park remains accessible as of September 2012. In 2011 a pipe in the reservoir burst, sending a torrent of water down to the adjacent McGill University. It was not the first time that the reservoir has caused damage to McGill: during its construction in 1852, blasting propelled large rocks through the roof of the McGill College Building, now its Arts Building, causing staff and students to seek refuge. In January 2013, a severe flooding on the downtown campus of McGill University affecting several buildings and streets in the downtown area was caused by water coming from the McTavish reservoir.

The Continental opened in Saigon in the 1880s and long reigned as the city's prime hotel. In Hanoi, the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi opened in 1901 as le Metropole and endures today as the country's foremost address in hospitality.The World's Best Hotels 2012 During the era of the steamship, tourism was restricted to the upper classes and to travelers. To Americans like Harry Franck, who visited Vietnam in the 1920s and wrote about the country in EAST OF SIAM. And to Brits like Norman Lewis, one of the 20th Century's greatest travel writers, who wrote A Dragon Apparent after a trip to Vietnam in 1950. One could hardly call Franck and Lewis tourists; they were travelers with a literary purpose. The colonial French were the first to exploit Vietnam's natural wonders for tourists. In the grottoes of world- renowned Halong Bay, passengers on the bay's excursion boats carved their names in limestone 100 years ago. Between 1906 and 1937, a service boat called the Emeraude plied the waters of Halong Bay, catering to well-heeled colons. Nearly, 100 years later, a French entrepreneur built a near-replica of this old steamer, running modern travelers past the same karst formations. By the time the French finally gave up on Vietnam in the mid-1950s, jet travel was opening up Asia to tourists like never before. Indeed, when the Caravelle Hotel opened in 1959, it did so with a name that paid tribute to one of the sleek Air France jetliners of the day. Caravelle Saigon Hotel The war was a hindrance to travel, but it was happening nevertheless. Peter Arnett, \\"Fodor‚Äôs guidebook to Japan and East Asia\\", Fodor, 1969 The modern era of tourism in Vietnam really begins with the emergence of doi moi (economic renovation) in 1986. By 1990, travelers were coming into Vietnam on careful orchestrated 'shopping tours.' None of the hotel stock ranked above two-star caliber then. Independent travel was limited. Travel between provinces required special permits by provincial administrators until 1993.

Connections are made on all four edges of a square package; Compared to the internal cavity for mounting the integrated circuit, the package overall size is large.Kenneth Jackson, Wolfgang Schroter, (ed), Handbook of Semiconductor Technology Volume 2,Wiley VCH, 2000, ,page 627 Types Chip carriers may have either J-shaped metal leads for connections by solder or by a socket, or may be lead-less with metal pads for connections. If the leads extend beyond the package, the preferred description is \\"flat pack\\". Chip carriers can be smaller than dual in-line packages and since they use all four edges of the package they can have a larger pin count. Chip carriers may be made of ceramic or plastic. Some forms of chip carrier package are standardized in dimensions and registered with trade industry associations such as JEDEC. Other forms are proprietary to one or two manufacturers. Sometimes the term \\"chip carrier\\" is used to refer generically to any package for an integrated circuit. Types of chip-carrier package are usually referred to by initialisms and include: * BCC: Bump chip carrier * CLCC: Ceramic leadless chip carrier * Leadless chip carrier (LLCC): Leadless chip carrier, contacts are recessed vertically. * LCC: Leaded chip carrier * LCCC: Leaded ceramic chip carrier * DLCC: Dual lead-less chip carrier (ceramic) * PLCC: Plastic leaded chip carrier * PoP: Package on package Plastic-leaded chip carrier Reverse side of an Intel 80C86: J-shaped metal leads Gigabyte DualBIOS in QFJ32 / PLCC32 A plastic- leaded chip carrier (PLCC) has a rectangular plastic housing. It is a reduced cost evolution of the ceramic leadless chip carrier (CLCC). A premolded PLCC was originally released in 1976, but did not see much market adoption. Texas Instruments later released a postmolded variant that was soon adopted by most major semiconductor companies. The JEDEC trade group started a task force in 1981 to categorize PLCCs, with the MO-047 standard released in 1984 for square packages and the MO-052 standard released in 1985 for rectangular packages. The PLCC utilizes a \\"J\\"-lead with pin spacings of 0.05\\" (1.27 mm). The metal strip forming the lead is wrapped around and under the edge of the package, resembling the letter J in cross-section. Lead counts range from 20 to 84. PLCC packages can be square or rectangular. Body widths range from 0.35\\" to 1.15\\". The PLCC ‚ÄúJ‚Äù Lead configuration requires less board space versus equivalent gull leaded components, which have flat leads that extend out perpendicularly to the narrow edge of the package. The PLCC is preferred over DIP style chip carriers when lead counts exceed 40 pins due to the PLCC's more efficient use of board surface area. The heatspreader versions are identical in form factor to the standard non-heatspreader versions. Both versions are JEDEC compliant in all respects. The heatspreader versions give the system designer greater latitude in thermally enhanced board level and / or system design. RoHS compliant, lead-free and green material sets are now qualified standards. A PLCC circuit may either be installed in a PLCC socket or surface- mounted. PLCC sockets may in turn be surface mounted, or use through-hole technology. The motivation for a surface-mount PLCC socket would be when working with devices that cannot withstand the heat involved during the reflow process, or to allow for component replacement without reworking. Using a PLCC socket may be necessary in situations where the device requires stand-alone programming, such as some flash memory devices. Some through-hole sockets are designed for prototyping with wire wrapping. A specialized tool called a PLCC extractor facilitates the removal of a PLCC from a socket. This package is still used for a wide variety of device types, which would include memory, processors, controllers, ASICs, DSPs, etc. It is particularly common for read- only memories as it provides an easily swappable socketed chip. Applications range from consumer products through automotive and aerospace.

Some of them have gone in favor of the Foundation, others have gone against it. This listing is not meant to be exhaustive, and only includes notable cases. Outcomes in favor of the plaintiffs In May 2011, Louis Bacon obtained a court order against the Wikimedia Foundation to compel it to reveal the identity of the editors who defamed him on Wikipedia. However, the order was obtained in the UK, and is therefore unenforceable in the United States. In January 2019, a court in Germany ruled against the Wikimedia Foundation, prompting it to remove part of the history and the allegedly defamatory content about a professor. The Wikipedia article's content was ruled defamatory because the link supporting its claims was no longer active, a phenomenon known as \\"link rot.\\" Outcomes in favor of the Wikimedia Foundation Barbara Bauer, a literary agent, sued Wikimedia Foundation for defamation. She claimed that a Wikipedia entry branded her the ‚Äúdumbest‚Äù literary agent. The case was dismissed because of the Communications Decency Act. Professional golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who also felt he was defamed on Wikipedia, did not sue Wikipedia because he was told that his suit would not prevail in light of the Communications Decency Act. He then sued the Miami firm from whose computers the edits were made, but later dropped the case. In 2007, three French nationals sued the Wikimedia Foundation when an article on Wikipedia described them as gay activists. A French court dismissed the defamation and privacy case, ruling that the Foundation was not legally responsible for information in Wikipedia articles. The judge ruled that a 2004 French law limited the Foundation's liability, and found that the content had already been removed. He found that the Foundation was not legally required to check the information on Wikipedia, and that \\"Web site hosts cannot be liable under civil law because of information stored on them if they do not in fact know of their illicit nature.\\" He did not rule whether the information was defamatory. Sylvia Scott Gibson, author of Latawnya, the Naughty Horse, Learns to Say \\"No\\" to Drugs, sued Wikipedia for describing her book. Her suit was dismissed.Sylvia Scott Gibson et al v. Amazon.com (Document 142) on Justia Other alleged defamation John Seigenthaler, an American writer and journalist, contacted Wikipedia in 2005 after his article was edited to incorrectly state that he had been thought for a brief time to be involved in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy. The content was present in the article for four months. Seigenthaler called Wikipedia a \\"flawed and irresponsible research tool,\\" and criticized the protection the Communications Decency Act provided to Wikipedia. The representative for the American Academy of Financial Management, George Mentz, suggested that either phony or incompetent Wikipedia editors were creating legal problems for Wikimedia in May 2013, because of alleged intentional false claims that had been published on Wikipedia. In 2014, Yank Barry filed a defamation lawsuit against four Wikipedia editors, Updated 11 December 2015. and then withdrew it after about a month. DMCA takedown notices Texas Instruments sent a DMCA takedown notice to the Wikimedia Foundation because certain cryptographic keys were made public in the Texas Instruments signing key controversy article. A Wikipedia editor later filed a counter-notice, Texas Instruments did not reply in 10‚Äì14 business days as required by the DMCA, and the keys were restored to the article. Two other articles also came under the purview of Wikipedia's office actions because of the DMCA: Damon Dash and Conventional PCI. FBI seal controversy In July 2010, the FBI sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation demanding that it cease and desist from using its seal on Wikipedia. The FBI claimed that such practice was illegal and threatened to sue. In reply, Wikimedia counsel Michael Godwin sent a letter to the FBI claiming that Wikipedia was not in the wrong when it displayed the FBI seal on its website. He defended Wikipedia's actions and also refused to remove the seal. NSA lawsuit In March 2015, the Wikimedia Foundation, along with other groups, sued the National Security Agency over its upstream mass surveillance program.  Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. v. WordLogic Corporation et al  Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. v. WordLogic Corporation et al was a lawsuit involving the Wikimedia Foundation as plaintiff and the companies WordLogic Corporation and 602531 British Columbia, Ltd. as defendants over some patents dispute. WordLogic claims that the Wikimedia Foundation and the MediaWiki free software infringes on at least Claim 19 of the . Wikimedia denies those claims and has moved under for a declaratory judgment against the WordLogic entities requesting a declaration from the Court that a number of patents property of defendants are invalid, and that Wikimedia Foundation does not infringe those patents \\"directly or indirectly, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents\\" as provided by the Title 35 of the United States Code.

It runs from R√∂vershagen, east of the Hanseatic city of Rostock, to Graal-M√ºritz on the Baltic coast. Its name came originally from the name of its operator and was later transferred to the line.  History   Origins  At the end of the 19th century the villages of Graal and M√ºritz (then two separate places) strove to become spa towns and seaside resorts. However they were only linked to the larger towns by poorly maintained cart tracks and country roads. As a result, they called for a railway link. During the planning, the following route sections were discussed: * Ribnitz ‚Äì M√ºritz ‚Äì Graal * Gelbensande ‚Äì Graal ‚Äì M√ºritz * Rostock ‚Äì Nienhagen ‚Äì Graal ‚Äì M√ºritz * Extension of the Warnem√ºnde‚ÄìMarkgrafenheide Beach Railway * R√∂vershagen ‚Äì Graal ‚Äì M√ºritz (direct route along the P√∂rstenschneise) In the event the construction of the line was put off due to a lack of finance and the fear of unprofitability. In addition, the most economic route was the line from R√∂vershagen to the Rostock‚ÄìStralsund line, which was operated by the Prussian Railways. This was a further reason for the Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway not to build a railway line here. The route via Ribnitz was refused as it was very much oriented towards Prussia. Not until 1910 were there solid plans to build the new line; the First World War, however, put paid to them.  Foundation, construction and operation  Not until the year 1920 were there once again plans to construct and operate a railway, this time as a private branch line. The Mecklenburgische B√§derbahn AG company was founded on 28 February 1925 with the aim of linking the Baltic Sea resorts of Graal and M√ºritz to the main line from Stralsund to Rostock. The share capital was raised from the Hanseatic city of Rostock and a large number of Rostock businessmen, the local communities and the Berlin Tramway Operating Company, which had two rest and recreation homes for its staff on the Baltic Sea coast. Other shareholders were the railway construction and operating company of Lenz & Co., who carried out the construction and were also charged with running the line. The line was finally completed from R√∂vershagen, albeit with a gentle detour to the west in order to keep open the possibility of creating a junction by extending the Warnem√ºnde Beach Railway to Hinrichshagen from the direction of Warnem√ºnde. The station at Graal-M√ºritz, which was so called even before the villages merged, was erected east of Graal and south of M√ºritz so that the option of continuing the line to Fischland remained open. Neither project was ever realised, however. A DBAG Class 642 railcar between Graal-M√ºritz and R√∂vershagen The 10.3 kilometre long, standard gauge line from R√∂vershagen to Graal-M√ºritz was officially opened on 1 July 1925. Initially trains only ran during the summer; later they ran all year round. In the 1930s there were even through coaches in the summer from Berlin. After the war, the rest homes in Graal-M√ºritz which had been turned into military hospitals, were taken over by the Red Army. Transportation was by rail and prevented the line falling victim to war reparations. From 1949 the line was taken over by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn. But by the 1960s, consideration was given to closing the route, but it was retained due to lack of bus and lorry capacity. Furthermore, the military had a strong interest in the line because, by then, several firing ranges had been established on the Rostock Heath. In the 1970s, passenger traffic was limited for a number of years to the summer season; in winter buses ran instead of rail services. In 1993 the halts of Hinrichshagen and Georg Schneise, which lay in the middle of the forest and had been opened in the 1930s, were closed. Goods traffic ceased in 1994 and, in 1999, passenger services were withdrawn due to the poor condition of the track and the track and trackbed were fully replaced. There were various concepts for reactivating the line. For example, it was proposed to electrify the lien and connect it to the Rostock S-Bahn network. However, that was not followed through. Since 12 December 2004 passenger trains have run once again, mainly from and to Rostock Hauptbahnhof. At first, renovation of the line looked doubtful for a long time; only when the community of Graal-M√ºritz offered to bear a considerable portion of the cost, was work started. As part of the renovation, the line was shortened to 9.7 miles, the station at Graal-M√ºritz was abandoned and replaced by a halt. After the timetable change on 10 December 2006, the new halt of Graal-M√ºritz Koppelweg opened. This has a special feature: the 100-metre-long platform is made entirely of glass fibre composite.  Goods and passenger services  Immediately behind R√∂vershagen a siding branches off to a local gas supplier which is currently still worked. Today it is the only working goods siding on the Rostock‚ÄìStralsund railway. Formerly a sawmill at the eastern end of the village of R√∂vershagen was also served from this industrial siding. This works siding was built even before the construction of the line to Graal-M√ºritz. In addition there used to be just behind the station exit at R√∂vershagen a lot of sidings that belonged to a resin factory. By the mid-1990s the access tracks had been removed and, on the renovation of the line, the whole area was cleared. Since the renovation, goods services to Graal-M√ºritz are no longer possible because there are now no loading sidings in Graal-M√ºritz any more. The line is worked by the Regionalbahn line 12, the trains running almost every hour, except for weekends outside the summer season when they run every two hours. Class 642 units are usually used, but occasionally Class 628s as well. In earlier times, diesel locomotives of Class 201 and Class 346 were employed.  Current developments  There are discussions about resurrecting the plans from 1925 and building a line to the Darss Railway (Dar√übahn) from Graal-M√ºritz and Prerow. These proposals have many supporters, especially given the high number of tourists every year and rising amounts of traffic on the Dar√ü with its single connecting road. The Usedomer B√§derbahn railway company assessed the feasibility of these proposals in 2007. In a press release dated 27 August 2010 it was announced that the state government has approved the construction of the track and begun planning for its construction. The cost of the 19 kilometre route is estimated at 38 million euros. The Meinig Bridge is to be rebuilt as a combined road and railway bridge.

The Hofrecht concerns the \\"private\\" affairs within an estate, as opposed to the Landrecht. The nature of these laws was subject to evolution over the centuries. Their original scope is exemplified by the lex familiae of Burchard of Worms (early 11th century), which was likely based directly on older, early medieval, laws. In the course of the High Middle Ages, the status of the ministeriales was detached from the scope of the lex familiae, and it was further weakened by the development of communal statutes, especially in the context of the development of free cities.

The comedic song relates the story of a train passenger who asks the railcar's porter to wake him and \\"put me off\\" when the train reaches Buffalo during the night. The passenger invites the porter to have a drink with him, who after imbibing too much mistakenly ejects the wrong passenger when Buffalo is reached.

Recent History  = 2006 Restructuring = In 2006, a number of villages which formerly belonged to Jiangwang were given to the neighboring Xinsheng Subdistrict. In the same year a number of villages within Jiangwang were merged together, specifically, the former village of Zhiyuan merged into Yulin Village, the former village of Linhe merged into Silian Village, and the former village of Tanghu merged into Yuelai Village. This resulted in the subdistrict being divided into two neighborhood committees [zh] and four villages. Those subsequent neighborhood committees were the Jiangwang Neighborhood Committee () and the Heyue Neighborhood Committee (). The subsequent villages were Yulin Village (), Heqiao Village ), Yuelai Village (), and Silian Village ).  Economy  As of 2017, the subdistrict reported a GDP of 5.375 billion Renminbi. Agriculture Currently, the subdistrict is home to 6500 mu of vegetable crop fields. In recent years, Jiangwang has grown six new varieties of vegetables, eight types of nursery stock flowers and two tunnel technologies. Nearly ten thousand yuan has been used to construct agricultural facilities, dredge 103 rivers, complete 21.5 liters of earthwork and build another 3500 meters of brick or stone lining and drained a new pump station.  Industry  Companies which have operations in Jiangwang include Red Star Macalline [zh], Princess Disha, and Qinman.  Education  The subdistrict is home to Jiangwang Middle School, a private middle school founded in 1960, which enrolls over 2,700 students.

The constitution of liberty. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 1978.North DC. Institutions, institutional change and economic performance. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1990.Roland G. Transition and economics: politics, markets, and firms. Cambridge: MIT; 2000.Mukand SW. and Rodrik D. In search of the Holy Grail: policy convergence, experimentation, and economic performance. In: American Economic Revue, 95(1): p. 374‚Äì83. As compared to centralized legislation or national regulation, one of the major advantages of decentralized policy experimentation is seen in allowing spatially, sectorally or temporally limited policy trials that reduce the risks and costs of introducing major reform schemes to the national polity, economy and society. A major deficit of policy experimentation is seen in promoting policy heterogeneity, legal fragmentation and jurisdictional disparities. The term has come to renewed prominence in the discussion about the political processes behind China's economic rise since the beginning of Chinese economic reform policies in 1978. Definition Policy experimentation often just paraphrases the cycles of policy reversals and policy re-prioritization that are characteristic of all political systems if established policies come to be seen as failing, too costly, or politically risky. In a stricter definition policy experimentation implies a policy process in which experimenting units try out a variety of methods and processes to find imaginative solutions to predefined tasks or to new challenges that emerge during experimental activity. Policy experimentation is not equivalent to freewheeling trial and error or spontaneous policy diffusion. It is a purposeful and coordinated activity geared to producing novel policy options that are injected into official policymaking and then replicated on a larger scale, or even formally incorporated into national law. In more technical terms, experimentation aims \\"to inform policy by using experiments with direct interventions and control groups instead of observational studies or theoretical analyses\\"Mosteller, F. Selected papers of Frederick Mosteller, New York, Springer; 2006: p. 487, 496. Types of policy experimentation Small-scale policy experimentation If policy experimentation is designed and evaluated by social scientists as part of government-sponsored pilot programs, it is usually limited to narrowly defined trial measures and preselected target groups. It often is confined to the fine-tuning of implementation technicalities (such as testing the suitability of a new social security card in a pilot site), but only very rarely to substantive policy formulation (such as the extent, focus, or budgeting of social policies) that are the object of complex bargaining processes in which tactical political considerations weigh much heavier than outside expertise.Jowell R. Trying it out: the role of 'pilots' in policy- making. London: Government Chief Social Researcher's Office; 2003. Broad- based transformative policy experimentation Transformative policy experimentation is much more comprehensive and ambitious since it strives to alter economic and administrative behavior and institutions. Such experimentation also opens up entirely new market segments and establishes new types of corporate organization, thereby regularly moving beyond the originally defined test groups and procedures and involving policymakers on different levels of the political system. Mosteller sees such \\"reorganization experiments\\" as the most difficult to carry out because they depend on a chain of complex interrelations, may require a great deal of time and resources, tend to provoke stiff political opposition, have to deal with ongoing contextual changes, and are subject to political-administrative interference and changes of the rules of the game in the middle of the experimental process. Transformative experimentation usually comes in the shape of demonstration projects taking place in a politically realistic‚Äîi.e., fluid, disturbed, and contested‚Äîcontext that escapes strict scientific controls, but can give a fuller view of the workings of novel policies and their impact on major social, market, or administrative actors.Mosteller, Frederick. Selected papers of Frederick Mosteller, New York, Springer; 2006: p. 479-480, 492-496. Implementation prior to legislation Policy experimentation in this variant constitutes a distinct mode of governance that differs in one fundamental way from standard assumptions about policymaking. The conventional model of the policy process that is widely taken for granted by jurists, economists, and political scientists holds that policy analysis, formulation, and embodiment in legislation precede implementation. But policy experimentation means innovating through implementation first, and drafting universal laws and regulations later. Policy experimentation versus incrementalism At first sight, policy experimentation displays commonalities with what LindblomLindblom, Charles E. 1959. The Science of 'Muddling Through, In: Public Administration Review 19(2): p. 79-88.Lindblom, Charles E. 1979. Still Muddling, Not Yet Through, Public Administration Review 39 (6): 517-526. characterizes as the incremental method of successive limited comparisons in making public policy: the exploratory, reversible character of policymaking and the prior reduction of political antagonisms by avoiding drastic change at the outset. Yet, under certain conditions, experimentation can transcend incrementalist tinkering with existing practices and lead to drastic policy departures and transformative change marked by the emergence of new configurations of actors, interests, institutions, ideologies, and goals. Tools of experimentation In democratic polities, policy experimentation comes as mostly small-scale explorative pilot projects, as pioneering legislation by individual states in federal systems (\\"states as laboratories\\"), as experimental or sunset clauses incorporated into formal legislation, or, very rarely, as a special dispensation for local administrative districts to be exempt from certain provisions of national law.Morand, Charles-Albert, ed. 1993. √âvaluation l√©gislative et lois exp√©rimentales [Legislative Evaluation and Experimental Laws].

For the Chinese government, experimentation comes in three main forms as (1) experimental regulation (provisional rules made for trial implementation), (2) \\"experimental points\\" (model demonstrations and pilot projects in a specific policy domain), and (3) \\"experimental zones\\" (local jurisdictions with broad discretionary powers).

Characters and story The buddy storyline follows the friendship of seagull Ollie and lugworm Quentin. King Features offers a detailed description of the setting and characters: :Ollie and Quentin is a buddy strip about the unlikely friendship between a seagull named Ollie and an accident-prone lugworm named Quentin. They are best friends despite the obvious food chain disparity that suggests Ollie should be interested in Quentin more as a snack than as a friend. They live in a coastal town with Nobby, an affable single guy who serves as both foil and witness to their silly, mischievous high jinks. During their adventurous romps together, Ollie is somewhat oblivious to the dangers that Quentin's small size presents. Despite Ollie's protective brotherly nature, Quentin endures many hysterical, albeit, unfortunate accidents, such as getting sucked into a vacuum cleaner, being blown up as a party balloon and even requiring brief hospitalization after Nobby mistakes him for a piece of chewing gum.DailyINK Origin The strip originated in the United Kingdom in 2002, with King Features introducing it to international syndication in early 2008.

In 1989, he was convicted of murdering several of his patients and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison. Early life Angelo was born on August 29, 1962, to parents who were both working in the educational sector. His mother was an economics teacher, and his father was a high school guidance counselor for the Lindenhurst school district on Long Island. He graduated from St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School in 1980 and then entered a two-year nursing program at Farmingdale State College, where he was a well-regarded honor student. Arrest Angelo first came to the attention of the public in October 1987 when he was suspected of poisoning a patient at the Good Samaritan Hospital on Long Island, where he worked as a nurse. He was accused of injecting Gerolamo Cucich with a drug into his I.V. Cucich did not feel well after the injection, so he paged another nurse to help him. Later it was found that he had Pavulon in his urine, which he had not been prescribed. He was arrested for assault on the 73-year-old patient because he was the only person to match the description given to the police (a \\"heavyset man with a dark beard and glasses\\"). Following his arrest, he confessed to having poisoned other patients with Pavulon and Anectine. As a result, as many as 30 recently deceased patients were exhumed and examined for traces of these powerful paralyzing agents. It was later concluded that he had poisoned at least 35 people at the hospital while working there for seven months. The poisoning resulted in ten deaths. He claimed that his motive was to portray himself as a hero. After poisoning his victims, he would wait until they went into cardiac arrest and then come by and save them in front of his colleagues. He was held in Suffolk County Jail for more than a year, awaiting trial. He declined to pay his $50,000 bail, fearing for his safety ‚Äî given the high- profile nature of the case. Conviction In December 1989, Angelo was found guilty on two counts of murder, one count of manslaughter, and one count of criminally negligent homicide. He was also convicted of assault in connection with the deaths of four other patients, and he was suspected of being responsible for several other deaths. On January 25, 1990, he was sentenced to 50-years-to-life in prison. He was 27 years old. He is serving his sentence in the Great Meadow Correctional Facility.

A patent for the devices was filed as early as 1935.. See also however the earlier patent . They are used primarily for game birds, pheasant and quail, but also for turkeys and laying hens. Blinders are opaque and prevent forward vision, unlike similar devices called spectacles which have transparent lenses. Blinders work by reducing the accuracy of pecking at the feathers or body of another bird, rather than spectacles which have coloured lenses and allow the bird to see forwards but alter the perceived colour, particularly of blood. Blinders are held in position with a circlip arrangement or lugs into the nares of the bird, or a pin which pierces through the nasal septum. They can be made of metal (aluminium), neoprene or plastic, and are often brightly coloured making it easy to identify birds which have lost the device. Some versions have a hole in the centre of each of the blinders, thereby allowing restricted forward vision. Benefits In pheasants, blinders have been shown to reduce the incidence of birds pecking each other and damage to the feathers or skin. In laying hens, blinders have been shown to reduce feather pecking, improve food utilisation (due to less spillage) and increase egg production.Arbi, A., Cumming, R.B. and Wodzicka-Tomaszewska., M., (1983). Effects of vision restricting \\"polpeepers\\" on the behaviour of laying hens during adaptation, feeding, on general activity, agonistic behaviour and pecking damage. British Poultry Science, 24: 371-381 Welfare concerns Blinders which require a pin to pierce the nasal septum and hold the device in position almost certainly cause pain to the bird. In the UK, the use of these devices is illegal on welfare grounds. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in their Codes of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Laying Hens, states: \\"The Welfare of Livestock (Prohibited Operations) Regulations 1982 (S.I. 1982 No.1884) prohibits ...the fitting of any appliance which has the object or effect of limiting vision to a bird by a method involving the penetration or other mutilation of the nasal septum.\\" Studies on pin-less blinders indicate these devices are at least temporarily distressful to the birds. In pheasants, fitting blinders causes an increase in head shaking and scratching, and increases in damage to the beak and nostrils of the bird. Fitting pin-less blinders to laying hens leads to reduced activity, increased resting, adjustment problems in feeding, stereotypic head shaking and protracted displacement neck preening for a month after fitting. In another study on laying hens, mortality was greater among hens wearing blinders compared to hens that had been beak-trimmed.Robinson, D., (1979). Effects of cage shape, colony size, floor area and cannibalism preventatives on laying performance. British Poultry Science, 20: 345-356.

The area of the district is .Official website of Kandalakshsky District. About the District Its administrative center is the town of Kandalaksha. Population: The population of Kandalaksha accounts for 72.0% of the district's total population. History The district was first established by the All- Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) Resolution of August 29, 1927 along with other new districts into which the Karelian ASSR was divided.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 35 The district included the territories of Kandalakshskaya and Kovdskaya Volosts and the village of Kyurela of Kestengskaya Volost. The administrative center of the district was in the selo of Kandalaksha. On June 1, 1932, Kandalaksha was granted work settlement status.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 52‚Äì55 On April 1, 1937, the VTsIK adopted a Resolution on the administrative-territorial structure of the district, according to which the district included two work settlements (Kandalaksha and Nivsky) and five selsoviets (Kandalakshsky, Knyazhegubsky, Kolvitsky, Konets-Kovdozersky, and Kovdsky). On April 20, 1938, Kandalaksha was granted a status of town of district significance. On May 28, 1938, the district became a part of the newly formed Murmansk Oblast, and on February 9, 1940, Kandalaksha was administratively separated from the district and granted a status of town of oblast significance. Kandalakshsky District was abolished by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 18, 1948 with its territory being administratively subordinated to the town of Kandalaksha. However, the district was reinstated in old borders by another decree on March 13, 1951. Kandalaksha again became the administrative center of the district. By the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, on February 24, 1955 Alakurttinsky Selsoviet was transferred to Kandalakshsky District from Kestengsky District of the Karelo-Finnish SSR. By the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of March 19, 1959, the Councils of Deputies of Kandalaksha and of Kandalakshsky District were merged into one Kandalaksha Town Council of Deputies. The district was nominally retained as a separate administrative division, but all its subdivisions were administratively subordinated to the town's Council of Deputies. On February 1, 1963, the Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR established the new structure of the districts of Murmansk Oblast, which no longer included Kandalakshsky District. On December 2, 2004, Kandalakshsky Municipal District was established by Murmansk Oblast Duma on the territory of Kandalaksha Town With Jurisdictional Territory. The administrative district, however, was not restored until the law of April 11, 2011 amended the law on the administrative-territorial divisions of Murmansk Oblast to include it.Law #1335-01-ZMO Geography Kandalaksha District sits in the southwest corner of Murmansk Olblast, covering 9.9% of the Murmansk region.

William La Due describes modern Eastern Orthodox theological scholarship as split between a group of scholars that hold to a \\"strict traditionalism going back to Photius\\" and other scholars that are \\"not so adamantly opposed (to the filioque)\\". Vladimir Lossky asserted that any notion of a double procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son was incompatible with Orthodox theology. Orthodox scholars who share Lossky's view include Dumitru StƒÉniloae, John Romanides and Michael Pomazansky. Sergius Bulgakov, however, was of the opinion that the filioque did not represent an insurmountable obstacle to reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. The Eastern Orthodox interpretation of the Trinity is that the Holy Spirit originates, has his cause for existence or being (manner of existence) from the Father aloneReligious Bodies: 1906: Separate Denominations: History, Description, and Statistics William Chamberlin Hunt (Author), United States. Bureau Of The Census as \\"One God, One Father\\". That the filioque confuses the theology as it was defined at the councils at both Nicene and Constantinople.The Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit by St Photius pg 75-76 Publisher: Holy Cross Orthodox Press Language: English The position that having the creed say \\"the Holy Spirit which proceeds from the Father and the Son\\", does not mean that the Holy Spirit now has two origins, is the position the West took at the Council of Florence, as the Council declared the Holy Spirit \\"has His essence and His subsistent being from the Father together with the Son, and proceeds from both eternally as from one principle and a single spiration. Views of Eastern Orthodox saints The addition of the Filioque to the Niceno- Constantinipolitan Creed has been condemned as heretical by many important Fathers and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including Photios I of Constantinople, Gregory Palamas and Mark of Ephesus, sometimes referred to as the Three Pillars of Orthodoxy. However, the statement 'The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son' can be understood in an orthodox sense if it is clear from the context that 'procession from the Son' refers to the sending forth of the Spirit in time, not to an eternal, double procession within the Trinity Itself. Hence, Maximus the Confessor defended the Western use of the Filioque in a context other than that of the Niceno- Constantinipolitan Creed and \\"defended the Filioque as a legitimate variation of the Eastern formula that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son\\" (Concordia Theological Quarterly, January-April 1995, p. 32, and cf. p. 40). Hierotheos Vlachos, metropolitan of Nafpaktos, wrote that according to Eastern Orthodox tradition, Gregory of Nyssa composed the section about the Holy Spirit in the Second Ecumenical Council's Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381. Siecienski doubted that Gregory of Nyssa \\"would have accepted the filioque as it was later understood in the West, although he witnesses to the important truth (often ignored in the East) that there is an eternal, and not simply economic, relationship of the Spirit to the Son.\\" Eastern Orthodox theology In Eastern Orthodoxy, theology starts with the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since the Father is the God of the Old Testament. The Father is the origin of all things and this is the basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what the Father is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the uncreated Father (God). God has existences (hypostases) of being; this concept is translated as the word \\"person\\" in the West. Each hypostasis of God is a specific and unique existence of God. Each has the same essence (coming from the origin, without origin, Father (God) they are uncreated). Each specific quality that constitutes a hypostasis of God, is non-reductionist and not shared. It is this immanence of the Trinity that was defined in the finalized Nicene Creed. The economy of God, as God expresses himself in reality (his energies) was not what the Creed addressed directly.The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Its History, Doctrine, and Spiritual ... By John Anthony McGuckin pg 170-171 Nor the specifics of God's interrelationships of his existences, is again not what is defined within the Nicene Creed. The attempt to use the Creed to explain God's energies by reducing God existences to mere energies (actualities, activities, potentials) could be perceived as the heresy of semi-modalism.The Orthodox Church By Kallistos (Bishop of Diokleia) pg 213 Eastern Orthodox theologians have complained about this problem in the Roman Catholic dogmatic teaching of '. Theodoret's statement against Cyril Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus in the Roman province of Euphratensis, refused to endorse the 431 deposition of Nestorius, archbishop of Constantinople, by the First Council of Ephesus. Theodoret accused Cyril of Alexandria of erroneously teaching that the Son has a role in the origin of the Holy Spirit. In fact, several statements by Cyril exist in which he fleetingly declares that the Holy Spirit issues from the Father and the Son (with similar statements that the Spirit issues from the Father through the Son) in an intra-Trinitarian relationship. Antony Maas wrote that what Theodoret denied was not the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, but only the claim that the Holy Spirit was created by or through the Son. Photius's position that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone has been described as a restatement of Theodoret's. In spite of Theodoret's attack on him for saying \\"the Spirit has his existence either from the Son or through the Son\\", Cyril continued to use such formulae. Under persistent urging by the Fathers of the Council of Chalcedon (451), Theodoret finally pronounced an anathema on Nestorius. He died in 457. Almost exactly one hundred years later, the Fifth Ecumenical Council (553) declared anathema anyone who would defend the writings of Theodoret against Saint Cyril and his Twelve Anathemas, the ninth of which Theodoret had attacked for what it said of the procession of the Holy Spirit. (See Three-Chapter Controversy). Theodoret is a saint in Eastern Orthodoxy, but he is called the excommunicated in Oriental Orthodoxy. Cyril spoke of the matter of which Theodoret accused him of as a misunderstanding. Cyril himself taught that the Latin teaching of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son appears to confuse the three hypostases of God with the common attributes of each hypostasis, and to the God's energetic manifestation in the world. John Damascus Before Photius, St John of Damascus wrote explicitly of the relationship of the Holy Spirit to the Father and Son. John of Damascus' position stated that the procession of the Holy Spirit is from the Father alone, but through the Son as mediator, in this way differing from Photius. John of Damascus along with Photius, never endorsed the Filioque in the Creed. Photius and the Monarchy of the Father Photius insisted on the expression \\"from the Father\\" and excluded \\"through the Son\\" (Christ as co- cause of the Holy Spirit rather than primary cause) with regard to the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit : \\"through the Son\\" applied only to the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit (the sending in time).\\"John of Damascus, who gave the doctrine of the Greek fathers its scholastic shape, about a.d. 750, one hundred years before the controversy between Photius and Nicolas, maintained that the procession is from the Father alone, but through the Son, as mediator. The same formula, Ex Patre per Filium, was used by Tarasius, patriarch of Constantinople, who presided over the seventh oecumenical Council (787), approved by Pope Hadrian I., and was made the basis for the compromise at the Council of Ferrara (1439), and at the Old Catholic Conference at Bonn (1875). Photius and the later Eastern controversialists dropped or rejected the per Filium, as being nearly equivalent to ex Filio or Filioque, or understood it as being applicable only to the mission of the Spirit, and emphasized the exclusiveness of the procession from the Father\\" (Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, volume IV, ¬ß108).\\"In general, and already since Photius, the Greek position consisted in distinguishing the eternal procession of the Son (sic: recteSpirit?) from the Father, and the sending of the Spirit in time through the Son and by the Son\\" (John Meyendorff,Theology in the Thirteenth Century: Methodological Contrasts). Photius addresses in his entire work on the Filioque the Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit. That any addition to the Creed would be to complicate and confuse an already very clear and simple definition of the ontology of the Holy Spirit that the Ecumenical Councils already gave. Photius' position has been called a reaffirmation of Orthodox doctrine of the Monarchy of the Father. Photius's position that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone has also been described as a restatement of the Cappadocian Antiochian school (as opposed to the Alexandrian)GeorgeC. Berthold, \\"Cyril of Alexandria and the Filioque\\" in Studia Patristica XIX, Papers presented to the Tenth International Conference on Patristic Studies in Oxford 1987 teaching of the \\"monarchy of the Father\\". Of the Eastern Orthodox's teaching (\\"from the Father alone\\"), Vladimir Lossky says that, while \\"verbally it may seem novel\\", it expresses in its doctrinal tenor the traditional teaching which is considered Orthodox. The phrase \\"from the Father alone\\" arises from the fact that the Creed itself only has \\"from the Father\\". So that the word \\"alone\\", which Photius nor the Orthodox suggest be added to the Creed, has been called a \\"gloss on the Creed\\", a clarification, an explanation or interpretation of its meaning.The Filioque Clause in History and Theology Photius as well as the Eastern Orthodox, have never seen the need, nor ever suggested the word \\"alone\\" be added to the Creed itself. With this, the Eastern Orthodox Church generally considers the added Filioque phrase \\"from the Father and the Son\\" to be heretical, and accordingly procession \\"from the Fatheralone\\" has been referred to as \\"a main dogma of the Greek Church\\". Avery Dulles does not go so far and only states that the procession of the Spirit from the Father alone was the formula preferred by Photius and his strict disciples. Eastern Orthodox theologians maintain that by the expression \\"from the Father alone\\", and Photius' opposition to the Filioque, Photius was confirming what is Orthodox and consistent with church tradition. Drawing the teaching of the Father as cause alone (their interpretation of the Monarchy of the Father) from such expressions from various saints and biblical text. Such as that of Saint Irenaeus, when he called the Word and the Spirit \\"the two hands of God\\". They interpret the phrase \\"monarchy of the Father\\" differently from those who see it as not in conflict with a procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father through or from the Son. As the Father has given to the Son everything that belongs to the Father, except being Father (see examples given above of those who in this way uphold the monarchy of the Father). By insistence of the Filioque, Orthodox representatives say that the West appears to deny the monarchy of Father and the Father as principle origin of the Trinity. Which would indeed be the heresy of Modalism (which states the essence of God and not the Father is the origin of, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The idea of Photius having invented that the Father is sole source of cause of the Holy Trinity is to attribute to him something that predates Photius' existence i.e.Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, John Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrus and John of Damascus. \\"Photius never explored the deeper meaning behind the formula 'through the Son' (), or the necessary eternal relationship between the Son and the Spirit, even though it was a traditional teaching of the previous Greek fathers,\\" according to Siecienski. Photius did recognize that the Spirit maybe said to proceed temporally through the Son orfrom the Son. Photius stated that this was not the eternal Trinitarian relationships that was actually the thing being defined in the Creed. The Nicene Creed in Greek, speaks of the procession of the Holy Spirit \\"from the Father\\", not \\"from the Father alone\\", nor \\"From the Father and the Son\\", nor \\"From the Father through the Son\\". Photius taught this in light of the teachings from Saints like Irenaeus whose Monarchy of the Father is in contrast to subordinationism, as the Orthodox officially condemned subordinationism in the 2nd council of Constantinople. That the Monarchy of Father which is in the Nicene Creed, Photius (and the Eastern Orthodox) endorse as official doctrine. Eastern Orthodox view of Roman Catholic theology Eastern Orthodox theologians (e.g., Pomazansky) say that the Nicene Creed as a Symbol of Faith, as dogma, is to address and define church theology specifically the Orthodox Trinitarian understanding of God. In the hypostases of God as correctly expressed against the teachings considered outside the church. The Father hypostasis of the Nicene Creed is the origin of all. Eastern Orthodox theologians have stated that New Testament passages (often quoted by the Latins) speak of the economy rather than the ontology of the Holy Spirit, and that in order to resolve this conflict Western theologians made further doctrinal changes, including declaring all persons of the Trinity to originate in the essence of God (the heresy of Sabellianism). Eastern Orthodox theologians see this as teaching of philosophical speculation rather than from actual experience of God via theoria. The Father is the eternal, infinite and uncreated reality, that the Christ and the Holy Spirit are also eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin is not in the ousia of God, but that their origin is in the hypostasis of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance The following are some Roman Catholic dogmatic declarations of the Filioque which are in contention with Eastern Orthodoxy: #The Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215): \\"The Father is from no one, the Son from the Father only, and the Holy Spirit equally from both.\\" #The Second Council of Lyon, session 2 (1274): \\" the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from Father and Son, not as from two principles, but as from one, not by two spirations, but by one only.\\" #The Council of Florence, session 6 in Laetentur Caeli (1439), on union with the Greeks: \\"We declare that when holy Doctors and Fathers say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, this tends toward that understanding which signifies that the Son, like the Father, is also what the Greeks call 'cause' and the Latins 'principle' of the subsistence of the Holy Spirit. And since the Father himself has given to his only begotten Son, in generating him, all that the Father has except being the Father, the Son himself eternally has from the Father, from whom he is eternally generated, precisely this: that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.\\" #The Council of Florence, session 8 in ' (1439), on : \\"The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration. ... And, since the Father has through generation given to the only- begotten Son everything that belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.\\" #The Council of Florence, session 11 (1442), in Cantate Domino, on union with the Copts and Ethiopians: \\"Father, Son and holy Spirit; one in essence, three in persons; unbegotten Father, Son begotten from the Father, holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son; the holy Spirit alone proceeds at once from the Father and the Son. Whatever the holy Spirit is or has, he has from the Father together with the Son. But the Father and the Son are not two principles of the holy Spirit, but one principle, just as the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle.\\" # In particular the condemnation, made at the Second Council of Lyons, session 2 (1274), of those \\"who deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son or who assert that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles, not from one.\\" In the judgment of these Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church is in fact teaching as a matter of Roman Catholic dogma that the Holy Spirit derives his origin and being (equally) from both the Father and the Son, making the Filioque a double procession. This being the very thing that Maximus the Confessor was stating in his work from the 7th century that would be wrong and that the West was not doing. They perceive the West as teaching through more than one type of theological Filioque a different origin and cause of the Holy Spirit. That through the dogmatic Roman Catholic Filioque the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son and not a free and independent and equal to the Father, hypostasis that receives his uncreatedness from the origin of all things, the Father hypostasis. Trinity expresses the idea of message, messenger and revealer, or mind, word and meaning. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in one God the Father, whose person is uncaused and unoriginate, who, because He is love and communion, always exists with His Word and Spirit. Gregory Palamas' Tomus of 1351 In St Gregory of Palamas' Tomus (1351) on the issue of the Filioque he very clearly denotes the distinctions of the Eastern and Western churches positions on the procession of the Holy Spirit here St Gregory was not only following the Eastern Tradition of what was addressed in the Nicene Creed by the Greek Fathers but he also clarifies what the divergent phrases of those in the East who appear to support the Filioque and what distinction is actually being made by the Eastern fathers who oppose the use of Filioque. ::\\"The Great Maximus, the holy Tarasius, and even the saintly John [Damascene] recognize that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, from whom it subsists in terms of its hypostasis and the cause of its being. At the same time, they acknowledge that the Spirit is given, revealed, and, manifeste, comes forth, and is known through the Son.\\" Orthodox theologians who do not condemn the Filioque Not all Orthodox theologians share the opinion of Lossky, StƒÉniloae, Romanides, and Pomazansky, who condemn the Filioque. There is a liberal view within the Orthodox tradition which is more accepting of the Filioque. The Encyclopedia of Christian Theology mentions that Vasily Bolotov, Paul Evdokimov, I. Voronov and Bulgakov classify the Filioque as a Theologoumenon ‚Äì a permissible theological opinion. Since a theologoumenon is a theological opinion on what is defined outside of dogma, in the case of any Orthodox theologians open to the filioque as opinion, it is unclear if they would accept that the filioque ever be added into the Creed for the whole church, or just something exclusive for the Latin language based church of the West. For Vasily Bolotov this is confirmed by other sources, even if they do not themselves adopt that opinion. Though Bolotov firmly rejects the Filioque in the procession of the Spirit from the Father. Bulgakov wrote, in The Comforter, that: As an Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov acknowledged that dogma can only established by an ecumenical council. Boris Bobrinskoy sees the Filioque as having positive theological content. Ware suggests that the problem is of semantics rather than of basic doctrinal differences. Saint Theophylact of Ohrid likewise held that the difference was linguistic in nature and not actually theological.

In carburetted vehicles a similar device known as an idle speed control actuator is used.  Description  The IAC actuator is an electrically controlled device, which gets its input from the vehicle's engine control unit (ECU). The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the throttle butterfly valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo actuator servomotor that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the servomotor and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the engine's idle speed to be maintained constant. The linear servo is most commonly a combination of a DC motor, lead screw and a digital optical encoder. There is essentially no difference in efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, sometimes referred to as anti-stall feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely releasing the clutch (manual transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.  Problems with IAC  Although the IAC is supposed to last the vehicle's lifetime, various reasons may cause it to fail/malfunction prematurely. The most common failure mode is partial/complete jamming of the actuator (due to dirt/dust or even oil) where it cannot be smoothly controlled. The result is an engine that fails to maintain idle RPM and frequently stalls. A jammed actuator may be freed simply by cleaning it. However an actuator that has stopped working due to a fault in its servomotor will need replacement. Air leaks in either the stepper housing or pipes will cause elevated idle RPM.

The book was published by Four Courts Press in both hardback and paperback formats. The book garnered significant acclaim. Background P√°draig√≠n N√≠ Uallach√°in, an Irish singer, song collector and academic comes from the area which was historically the Kingdom of Oriel in Ireland. She began writing the book in the years following her sister's death in May 1999.  Title  The book's title, A Hidden Ulster alludes to the lack of public knowledge among singers and song historians on the songs of Oriel. Many songs now sung in Ulster are claimed to be from County Donegal, though many of the songs originate from Oriel. The title is also ties with N√≠ Uallach√°in's father, P√°draig's complaint in 1939 to the Department of Education in Dublin, with whom he was employed at the time. The Department released a list of 80 songs to appear in Ireland's national curriculum, none of which were from Ulster, the northern quarter of the island of Ireland. In his complaint, P√°draig wrote: Content A Hidden Ulster contains expansive notes, lyrics and translations for 54 songs found in the Oriel area, including notation, published for the first time. The book has biographies of local singers, song collectors and songwriters from various periods, catalogues of songs collected in the area and previously-unpublished glass-stained photographs from the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. A large section of the book is dedicated to the traditions, local customs, festivals and professions of Oriel over a number of centuries. Reception A Hidden Ulster was met with widespread acclaim. Patricia Craig of the Times Literary Supplement wrote of the book, \\"P√°draig√≠n N√≠ Uallach√°in, herself an exquisite sean-n√≥s singer has written a timely, absorbing and scholarly account ‚Ä¶a triumph of cultural reclamation.\\"A Hidden Ulster at TLSarchive.com Poet and academic Prof. Michael Longley said, \\"A momentous publication ‚Ä¶ a treasure trove of words, a cultural and social history ‚Ä¶ a work of phenomenal concentration, great tenderness and bighearted loyalty. Proud and heartbroaken, it is an heroic attempt to remember.\\" The book was a Times Book of the Year, critic Paul Muldoon commenting, \\"Anyone with interest in Irish song must mow look to A Hidden Ulster for the definitive account of that tradition.\\" A Hidden Ulster - Paul Muldoon A Hidden Ulster was also received favourable by The Journal of Music,Journal of Music The Irish Times and May Field Review.

Office of Planning, retrieved 2012-01-01. The Vigilants The Vigilants were an early private fire company, formed in 1817 with John Kurz as president, James Moore as Secretary and James Corcoran as Treasurer. It was among the oldest fire companies in the District of Columbia, and the oldest in Georgetown. Its first fire engine, called the Vigilant, was bought from John Agnue of Philadelphia. After an 1848 reorganization, the company gradually came under the control of the government, forming Georgetown's Fire company No. 1 in 1867 and the District of Columbia's Fire Company No. 5 in 1871. In 1868 the company bought what is believed to be the first steam fire engine in the District of Columbia.HABS, p. 2 The Vigilant fireman developed a reputation for rowdyism. Even saying the name of the company could draw a fine at early meetings of the Georgetown Fire Department, according to Albert Cassedy. \\"The proceedings of the meeting were so interesting that two members were fined ten cents each for swearing, and a resolution was passed that any member who mentioned the name of the Vigilant Fire Company should be fined 25 cents.\\"Cassedy, Albert J., The Firemen's Record, Day Printing, Baltimore, I893, p. 25, quoted by HABS, p. 3.

In 1843 this building was moved across the street to 1069 Wisconsin, where it stood until it was demolished in 1964. The current building was built in 1844 as a two-story by rectangle with a single room on each floor, a square wooden cupola and a gable facing the street. An early addition was a two-story shed in the rear, likely used as a stable on the first floor and for hay storage on the second. A single story shed was added to the south, and a two-story addition to the north, both of which run the full depth of the building. Including the additions, the building measures by .

It works with charities, businesses and public services to offer practical help to families. Its campaigns and research work focuses on building a \\"family friendly\\" society by offering insights into current and future family life. It runs the Family Friendly scheme which aims to help public and private organisations to better understand diverse families and meet their needs. The Family and Parenting Institute merged with the Daycare Trust in January 2013 and is now called the Family and Childcare Trust.  History  The Family and Parenting Institute was established by the Labour Government as the 'National Family and Parenting Institute' in 1999, in response to a recommendation made in the Supporting Families Green Paper 1998. The Institute modified its operating name and brand to 'Family and Parenting Institute' in 2006, though the registered name remains the National Family and Parenting Institute.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ERORecords/HO/421/2/acu/sfpages.pdf  Values  The institute describes its values as follows: * Children are the future of society and families the bedrock. * A successful society depends on equipping children and other family members to meet the challenges of life. * Families should be valued and active policies to support them pursued. * Many different individual roles and family forms are capable of achieving a strong and successful family. Current activities As well as research, policy and public affairs, the Family and Parenting Institute is engaged in the following projects:  Parents‚Äô Week  The institute has run Parents‚Äô Week since 1999 ‚Äì an annual week-long celebration of parents and families through events and projects throughout the UK. At the launch of the 2011 Parents‚Äô Week, Minister of State for Children and Families, Sarah Teather MP stated that parenting issues were at the ‚Äútop of the agenda‚Äù for the Coalition Government  Family Friendly Scheme  The Family Friendly scheme was launched by the institute in summer 2011 with the aim of making the UK a more family friendly society. Public, private and charity sector organisations joining in the scheme take a ‚ÄòFamily Friendly pledge.‚Äô They are then given a framework and resources for putting the pledge into action, focusing on customers, staff and services. Families themselves are given the opportunity to give feedback, via the scheme's website, on the quality of the service they received. Current members include BT Group, easyJet, Barclays, Gatwick Airport, Gingerbread (charity), Fatherhood Institute, Grandparents Plus, Action for Prisoners‚Äô Families, Contact A Family and a number of local Family Information Services.  Family Friendly Report Cards  Since 2010, the Family and Parenting Institute has produced a ‚Äúreport card‚Äù on the UK's progress towards becoming a family friendly society. The 2010 report graded the UK on the following factors: costs of raising a child; maternity and paternity leave; elderly care; work-life balance; child and pensioner poverty; childhood commercialisation; neighbourhoods and green spaces and care of vulnerable children. *In 2010 the UK was graded an overall score of C-. *However, in 2011, this was downgraded to D+. The economic squeeze on families was cited as the reason for the drop.  Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood  The Family and Parenting Institute contributed to the 2011 Bailey Review which examined the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood by advertisers, corporates and the media.  Families in an Age of Austerity  The Family and Parenting Institute is in the process of a two- year research project to track how the UK's economic problems are affecting family life. The project has launched two reports, Families in the Age of Austerity, in January 2011, and The Impact of Austerity Measures on Households with Children, in January 2012, in conjunction with the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Both received widespread coverage in the media. The project's final report is expected in January 2013.  Family Voice  Family Voice is a project that started in 2011. It explores the use of social media to find out how to engage more with families.  Family Room  The Family and Parenting Institute coordinates a coalition of 15 leading family charities to attend party political conferences in the autumn.  Associate Parliamentary Group for Parents and Families  This all-parliamentary forum was established to provide impartial and progressive debate between politicians, parents‚Äô groups, charities and researchers. Notable Previous Activities  Early Home Learning Matters  This project brought together the evidence focused on the vital role of parents in securing good outcomes for children, providing information on how to plan and deliver effective services to involve parents in their children's early learning.  Parenting Fund  From March 2004 to March 2011, the Family and Parenting Institute managed the Parenting Fund on behalf of the Department for Education (formerly the Department for Schools and Families). The fund reached hundreds of thousands of the UK's most vulnerable parents through grants made available to grassroots organisations. The impact of the Parenting Fund was assessed and a report published detailing the achievements. In particular: *Impact was felt to be greatest around parental support, disability, fathers and managing conflict. *Mothers had a better understanding of the impact of domestic violence on their children as well as themselves, and were able to form supportive relationships with other mothers. *Separated/divorced parents in conflict were assisted to work better together in order to minimise the impact on their children.

He was the youngest historian ever to be admitted to the Spanish Royal Academy of History, was the son of Ramon Menendez Pidal and the outstanding Maria Goyri de Menendez Pidal, who was the first woman to officially graduate from a Spanish University, the Universidad de Madrid. Gonzalo Menendez-Pidal, typical younger child of a notable family, knew how to combine the family fascination for the history of the Iberian Peninsula with an interest in the latest technologies. Whereas his father and mother traveled about Spain making wax recordings of traditional songs and ballads, Gonzalo Menendez-Pidal studied cinematography at the Film und Bildamt der Stadt Berlin. He filmed his experiences as he traveled about Spain in the time leading up to the Spanish Civil War. Most were anthropological documentaries; one set chronicles the student theater group, ‚ÄúLa Barraca‚Äù, which was he created with Federico Garc√≠a Lorca among others. Gonzalo Menendez-Pidal excelled in photography. He not only recorded and catalogued bits of Spanish tools and hardware; he learned to make the tool, and the why of the tool, and learned to use the tool. His home in the mountains outside of Madrid was not only a photographic archive of the history of Spain, it was a workshop that showed how Spain was built. This man, every bit as great as his father, mother and family, went about cementing its reputation as upholder of its unique character one image at a time. His archives are a tribute to the ingenuity of the Spaniards. His unabashed enthusiasm and scientific approach are well married in his many books about Spain.

Reception  Volume I, published in 2007, was well received in the academic and collectors community. A review by the Central Intelligence Agency's Studies in Intelligence in September 2008 stated that, \\"Ralph Pickard has taken a step in the direction of preserving a piece of the East German heraldic record with his new reference work.\\" (3) David Nickles, Ph.D. observed that, \\"Given the tremendous growth of interest in cultural history during recent years, I hope and expect that historians will appreciate the extent to which a book like this, with its emphasis on decorations and memorabilia, sheds light on the political culture of the German Democratic Republic.\\"(4) Additionally, the editor of Military Trader stated in his review (March 2008 Volume 15, Issue 3); \\"Researchers, historians and collectors with an interest in the Cold War or East Germany's security organization will appreciate the data in the book. A large portion of the book provides detailed information on the different award documents and timelines of when these documents were in use.\\"(5) Volume II, published in early 2012, has been well received by both the East German collecting and academic communities.

Originally introduced independently by and , in the older literature (in German) they were referred to as quasiconformal curves, a terminology which also applied to arcs. In complex analysis and geometric function theory, quasicircles play a fundamental role in the description of the universal Teichm√ºller space, through quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the circle. Quasicircles also play an important role in complex dynamical systems. Definitions A quasicircle is defined as the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended complex plane. It is called a K-quasicircle if the quasiconformal mapping has dilatation K. The definition of quasicircle generalizes the characterization of a Jordan curve as the image of a circle under a homeomorphism of the plane. In particular a quasicircle is a Jordan curve. The interior of a quasicircle is called a quasidisk. As shown in , where the older term \\"quasiconformal curve\\" is used, if a Jordan curve is the image of a circle under a quasiconformal map in a neighbourhood of the curve, then it is also the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended plane and thus a quasicircle. The same is true for \\"quasiconformal arcs\\" which can be defined as quasiconformal images of a circular arc either in an open set or equivalently in the extended plane. Geometric characterizations gave a geometric characterization of quasicircles as those Jordan curves for which the absolute value of the cross- ratio of any four points, taken in cyclic order, is bounded below by a positive constant. Ahlfors also proved that quasicircles can be characterized in terms of a reverse triangle inequality for three points: there should be a constant C such that if two points z1 and z2 are chosen on the curve and z3 lies on the shorter of the resulting arcs, then : z_1-z_3 + z_2-z_3 \\\\le C z_1-z_2. This property is also called bounded turning or the arc condition. For Jordan curves in the extended plane passing through ‚àû, gave a simpler necessary and sufficient condition to be a quasicircle. There is a constant C > 0 such that if z1, z2 are any points on the curve and z3 lies on the segment between them, then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\leftz_3 -{z_1+z_2\\\\over 2}\\\\right\\\\le C z_1-z_2.} These metric characterizations imply that an arc or closed curve is quasiconformal whenever it arises as the image of an interval or the circle under a bi-Lipschitz map f, i.e. satisfying : C_1s-t\\\\le f(s)-f(t) \\\\le C_2 s-t for positive constants Ci. Quasicircles and quasisymmetric homeomorphisms If œÜ is a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle, then there are conformal maps f of [z < 1 and g of z>1 into disjoint regions such that the complement of the images of f and g is a Jordan curve. The maps f and g extend continuously to the circle z = 1 and the sewing equation : \\\\varphi= g^{-1}\\\\circ f holds. The image of the circle is a quasicircle. Conversely, using the Riemann mapping theorem, the conformal maps f and g uniformizing the outside of a quasicircle give rise to a quasisymmetric homeomorphism through the above equation. The quotient space of the group of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms by the subgroup of M√∂bius transformations provides a model of universal Teichm√ºller space. The above correspondence shows that the space of quasicircles can also be taken as a model. Quasiconformal reflection A quasiconformal reflection in a Jordan curve is an orientation-reversing quasiconformal map of period 2 which switches the inside and the outside of the curve fixing points on the curve. Since the map :\\\\displaystyle{R_0(z) = {1\\\\over \\\\overline{z}}} provides such a reflection for the unit circle, any quasicircle admits a quasiconformal reflection. proved that this property characterizes quasicircles. Ahlfors noted that this result can be applied to uniformly bounded holomorphic univalent functions f(z) on the unit disk D. Let Œ© = f(D). As Carath√©odory had proved using his theory of prime ends, f extends continuously to the unit circle if and only if ‚àÇŒ© is locally connected, i.e. admits a covering by finitely many compact connected sets of arbitrarily small diameter. The extension to the circle is 1-1 if and only if ‚àÇŒ© has no cut points, i.e. points which when removed from ‚àÇŒ© yield a disconnected set. Carath√©odory's theorem shows that a locally set without cut points is just a Jordan curve and that in precisely this case is the extension of f to the closed unit disk a homeomorphism. If f extends to a quasiconformal mapping of the extended complex plane then ‚àÇŒ© is by definition a quasicircle. Conversely observed that if ‚àÇŒ© is a quasicircle and R1 denotes the quasiconformal reflection in ‚àÇŒ© then the assignment : \\\\displaystyle{f(z)=R_1f R_0(z)} for z > 1 defines a quasiconformal extension of f to the extended complex plane. Complex dynamical systems Koch snowflake Quasicircles were known to arise as the Julia sets of rational maps R(z). proved that if the Fatou set of R has two components and the action of R on the Julia set is \\"hyperbolic\\", i.e. there are constants c > 0 and A > 1 such that : \\\\partial_z R^n(z) \\\\ge c A^n on the Julia set, then the Julia set is a quasicircle. There are many examples: * quadratic polynomials R(z) = z2 \\\\+ c with an attracting fixed point * the Douady rabbit (c = ‚Äì0.122561 + 0.744862i, where c3 \\\\+ 2 c2 \\\\+ c + 1 = 0) * quadratic polynomials z2 \\\\+ Œªz with Œª < 1 * the Koch snowflake Quasi-Fuchsian groups Quasi-Fuchsian groups are obtained as quasiconformal deformations of Fuchsian groups. By definition their limit sets are quasicircles. Let Œì be a Fuchsian group of the first kind: a discrete subgroup of the M√∂bius group preserving the unit circle. acting properly discontinuously on the unit disk D and with limit set the unit circle. Let Œº(z) be a measurable function on D with :\\\\\\\\mu\\\\_\\\\infty < 1 such that Œº is Œì-invariant, i.e. :\\\\mu(g(z)){\\\\overline{\\\\partial_{z}g(z)}\\\\over \\\\partial_z g(z)}=\\\\mu(z) for every g in Œì. (Œº is thus a \\"Beltrami differential\\" on the Riemann surface D / Œì.) Extend Œº to a function on C by setting Œº(z) = 0 off D. The Beltrami equation : \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}} f (z) =\\\\mu(z)\\\\partial_zf(z) admits a solution unique up to composition with a M√∂bius transformation. It is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of the extended complex plane. If g is an element of Œì, then f(g(z)) gives another solution of the Beltrami equation, so that :\\\\alpha(g)=f\\\\circ g \\\\circ f^{-1} is a M√∂bius transformation. The group Œ±(Œì) is a quasi-Fuchsian group with limit set the quasicircle given by the image of the unit circle under f. Hausdorff dimension The Douady rabbit is composed of quasicircles with Hausdorff dimension approximately 1.3934 It is known that there are quasicircles for which no segment has finite length. The Hausdorff dimension of quasicircles was first investigated by , who proved that it can take all values in the interval [1,2). , using the new technique of \\"holomorphic motions\\" was able to estimate the change in the Hausdorff dimension of any planar set under a quasiconformal map with dilatation K. For quasicircles C, there was a crude estimate for the Hausdorff dimension : d_H(C) \\\\le 1 + k where :k={K-1\\\\over K+1}. On the other hand, the Hausdorff dimension for the Julia sets Jc of the iterates of the rational maps :R(z) =z^2 +c had been estimated as result of the work of Rufus Bowen and David Ruelle, who showed that :1 < d_H(J_c) < 1 + {c^2 \\\\over4\\\\log 2} + o(c^2). Since these are quasicircles corresponding to a dilatation : K=\\\\sqrt{1+t\\\\over 1-t} where : t= 1-\\\\sqrt{1-4c}, this led to show that for k small :1+ 0.36 k^2\\\\le d_H(C) \\\\le 1 + 37 k^2. Having improved the lower bound following calculations for the Koch snowflake with Steffen Rohde and Oded Schramm, conjectured that : d_H(C) \\\\le 1 + k^2. This conjecture was proved by ; a complete account of his proof, prior to publication, was already given in . For a quasi-Fuchsian group and showed that the Hausdorff dimension d of the limit set is always greater than 1. When d < 2, the quantity :\\\\lambda=d(2-d)\\\\,\\\\in (0,1) is the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the corresponding hyperbolic 3-manifold.

Its central figure is the aging Dubslav von Stechlin, widowed for thirty years and living alone in his somewhat dilapidated mansion near the shore of Lake Stechlin, to be imagined as being in the neighbourhood of Fontane's native Neuruppin. Dubslav, a man of honest and humorous character, refuses to take himself seriously, and lives modestly and contentedly in contact with his elderly valet Engelke, his politically progressive vicar Lorenzen, and Krippenstapel, the most Prussian of Prussian schoolmasters.

It was located near the confluence of the Eel River and Saint John River in New Brunswick, four miles upriver from present-day Meductic, New Brunswick.The village, dating from before the 17th century, was situated on a plateau west of the Saint John River. In 1968 the government acquired the Meductic site for the Mactaquac Dam, which flooded much of the Saint John River valley, including Meductic. The fortified village of Meductic was the principal settlement of the Maliseet First Nation from before the 17th century until the middle of the 18th, and it was an important fur trading centre. (The other two significant native villages in the region were the Abenaki village of Norridgewock (present-day Madison, Maine) on the Kennebec River and Penobscot (present-day Penobscot Indian Island Reservation) on the Penobscot River. Only during King George's War, after the French established Saint Anne (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick), did the village Aukpaque, present-day Springhill, New Brunswick, become of equal importance to Meductic).Raymond, p. 3, p. 11, p. 16 The village contained Fort Meductic, which the Maliseet had built before the arrival of the French to defend against Mohawk attacks.Raymond, p. 7 The Mohawk were one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York, south of the St. Lawrence River and generally west of the Hudson River. This is reported to have been the first Fort in Acadia.Raymond, p. 11; Bishop Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier visited the area on the way to Port Royal, Nova Scotia. He wrote: \\"Megogtek is the first fort in Acadia\\". Father Joseph Aubery re- established the mission in 1701. During the lead up to Father Rale's War, to secure the French influence on the village, Priest Jean-Baptiste Loyard built the chapel Saint Jean Baptiste (1717).Binasco, Matteo.

He was responsible for initiating nutrition research in independent India, leading to a number of interventions such as the Integrated Child Development Services, the midday meal scheme for school children, goiter prevention programme, etc. The burning feet syndrome is also known as Grierson-Gopalan syndrome. While the condition was described in 1826 by a British medical officer James Grierson, Gopalan also described this condition in 1946 when he observed it, \\"chiefly in females between the ages of 20 and 40 years, among the poor in South India\\".  Early life and education  He was born in Salem, Tamil Nadu. He earned an M.D. from University of Madras, and Ph.D. and D.Sc. from University of London.Fellow Profile Starting his professional career in nutrition research at the Nutrition Research Laboratory during the British period, he continued there for the next six decades. In the late 1950s, when the Nutrition Research Laboratory moved to Hyderabad and turned to the National Institute of Nutrition, Gopalan took over as director and expanded research to several key areas. Career  Gopalan's research led to a midday meal scheme for school children and a goiter prevention programme. He founded the National Nutrition Foundation, which published Nutritive Value of Indian Foods. He was a recipient of the civilian honours of the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. He set up divisions for clinical research, biochemistry, bio-physics, endocrinology, analytical chemistry, food toxicology and the field units in multi-disciplinary subjects. National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau which is product of his effort started the research to tackle problems such as protein energy malnutrition, Vitamin A deficiency, Phrynoderma, Lathyrism, fluorosis and Pellagra. He was the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research there he expanded research into neglected communicable diseases and modernised the working of the council. Three new institutes ‚Äî Malaria Research Institute; Vector Control Research Institute and Leprosy Research Institute were established to develop and implement preventive and management strategies for these diseases. Gopalan's works on Indian foods also are commendable. he analysed over 500 Indian foods for their Nutritive Values and published a detailed study report of that. This work was used for calculating dietary in-take of all nutrients. This made India the first developing country to have its own recommended dietary allowances. ‚ÄúNIN today bears testimony to his genius as an architect and father of nutrition sciences in India. Research under his leadership formed the basis of major national nutrition programmes initiated in the 1970s such as ICDS [Integrated Child Development Services] and Massive Dose Vitamin-A and iron supplementation,‚Äù said R Hemalatha, director, National Institute of Nutrition. ‚ÄúGopalan was a visionary institution builder. He viewed medical and nutrition science from a holistic perspective and always wanted to address them taking a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral approach. His contributions to medical science in general and nutrition science in particular are immense. He, in fact, brought nutrition to centre stage and was instrumental in putting it as an important driver in developmental plans and policies of the country,‚Äù said Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research.

History The Liberty flag being raised over Fort Moultrie, during its successful defense against the British The Liberty flag was designed, by commission, in 1775 by Colonel William Moultrie, to prepare for war with Great Britain. It was flown by his troops in the successful defense of Sullivan's Island against the British fleet in June 1776. Fighting back stridently during a ten-hour bombardment and siege, Moultrie's forces (primarily the 2nd South Carolina Regiment) eventually led the British to withdraw entirely, saving Charleston. During the battle, the flag was actually shot away, but Sergeant William Jasper ran out in the open and hoisted it again, rallying the troops until a new stand could be provided. The story of this dramatic event, along with the pivotal role of the battle itself, earned the flag a place in the hearts of the people of South Carolina, as well as cementing it as a symbol of liberty in the South, and the new confederacy in general. It therefore became the standard of the South Carolina militia, and when the war officially ended with the liberation of Charleston, on December 14, 1782, it was presented by General Nathanael Greene's \\"Southern Continental & Militia Army,\\" as the first American flag to be displayed in the South. The symbol in the top left corner of the flag is a crescent, some say it is a gorget, others say it is a crescent moon, but all texts from the time describe it as simply a \\"crescent\\". Heritage The 6-cent Fort Moultrie Flag stamp Iconic to the state of South Carolina as a symbol of freedom and the Revolution, eventually this was used as the foundation for the state's own flag. The fort was renamed Fort Moultrie, and the flag is sometimes referred to as the Fort Moultrie Flag. It is occasionally rendered with the word LIBERTY separately in white, along the lower center of the flag. In addition to being the basis for South Carolina's flag, it is the official flag of Moultrie County, Illinois.http://www.fotw.net/flags/us-moul.html The flag was featured on a 1968 US stamp.

Background  The tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the European Union (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for exclusive fishing rights around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions. The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only Jersey trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.  The incidents  The first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler Impatiens to the French port of Barneville-Carteret, after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel HMS Orkney from Guernsey, which confiscated her pots. The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel.British Information Services: Survey of current affairs: Volumen 23, 1993, p. 95Daily report. West Europe, 1‚Äì15. United States. Foreign Broadcast Information Service, p. 27 On 28 March 1993, HMS Blazer was paying a visit to Cherbourg when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the La Calypso, had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, HMS Brocklesby. The captain of La Calypso refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the Blazer at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses, HMS Blazer was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's White Ensign was burned. French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from Blazer and placed them under arrest. The French Navy, meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat Coriander to Cherbourg.\\"French fishermen burn patrol boat's ensign: Minister warns Navy will get tough after two new humiliations in fishing rights dispute\\". The Independent, 29 March 1993. On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to Saint Peter Port in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed. After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed Royal Marines to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at Taunton in Somerset. La Calypso was eventually caught by the fishery vessel HMS Jersey and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993.\\"French skipper under arrest in Guernsey \\". The Independent, 3 April 1993. The skipper, Michel Mesnage, was released on bail on 3 April.\\"Guernsey bails fish feud skipper\\". The Independent, 4 April 1993. A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler Sara P was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.  British and French reactions  A spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of \\"severe provocation\\", while the British minister of Agriculture, John Gummer, stated that \\"The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves.\\" The British Fisheries junior Minister, David Curry, claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the French legislative election, which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents. The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced. The French government condemned the fishermen's actions.Seizing of British officers by French fishing boat sends chill across channel by Richard O'Mara. The Baltimore Sun, 30 March 1993 British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France. A definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the Contentin peninsula and Brittany was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.

Early training C≈ìurdoux entered the novitiate of the Jesuits in 1715, was ordained in 1725, and made his final religious profession as a Jesuit in 1731, at Orl√©ans. Shortly afterwards he left for India, arriving at the Madurai Mission (now in Tamil Nadu in southern India) in 1732. Career as a missionary and religious superior C≈ìurdoux first studied Telugu, a major language of the Dravidian group, in order to work in the region of present Andhra Pradesh, in particular Krishnapuram, Bukkapuram, and Darmavaram Madigubba (1736 to 1737). In 1737, for health reasons, he had to return and remain in Pondicherry. He was the superior of the mission at Karnataka from 1744 to 1751 while he was serving the 4,000 Catholic Tamils in Pondicherry. As superior, he was obliged, against his own inclinations, to enforce the very restrictive decree of Pope Benedict XIV (12 September 1744 ) on the \\"Malabar rites\\". Convinced of the importance of the contemplative life, he brought together a number of Tamil girls and founded a Carmelite convent with them in 1748. Contributions to Indology C≈ìurdoux is best known today as an Indologist. Talented at languages, he composed a Telugu‚ÄìFrench‚ÄìSanskrit dictionary which is still authoritative. A disciple of the Jesuit philologist Jean Calmette, whom he knew personally in India, he was particularly interested in comparative linguistics. Max M√ºller called him the father of comparative philology. He was in contact with the French Indologists Anquetil Duperron and Joseph Nicolas de l'Isle. In a M√©moire sent to the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres (France) in 1767, he demonstrated the similarity between the Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and even German and Russian. His observations were later compiled and published by others in Europe. He never returned to his homeland. Anquetil Duperron published a whole chapter after the French Revolution.See: * Anquetil Duperron (1808) \\"Suppl√©ment au M√©moire qui pr√®c√©de\\" (Supplement to the preceding memoir), M√©moires de litt√©rature, tir√©s des registres de l'Acad√©mie royale des inscriptions et belles-lettres (Memoirs on literature, drawn from the records of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belle-lettres), 49 : 647-697. * John J.

The Smith family's hapless and saturnine goldfish, he is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, when American Dad! initially premiered on Fox on February 6, 2005 with the series' pilot episode. Klaus is actually a man in a fish body. He was once an East German Olympic ski-jumper until his brain was transferred into the body of a goldfish. Personality Klaus was once an East German Olympic ski-jumper until his mind was transferred into the body of a goldfish during the 1986 Winter Olympics by the CIA to prevent him from winning the gold medal, leaving him trapped in the goldfish's body. Klaus still has not come to terms with what happened, at times malcontent and gloomy. Not confined to his fishbowl, Klaus is often seen uniquely scooting himself about the Smith residence, reclined in a glass of water. In the early seasons, Klaus had an obsessive crush on Francine Smith and often made sexual advances to her, but stopped after the events of \\"Finances with Wolves\\", in which Stan saves Klaus' life despite his attempt to have sex with Francine. For much of the later seasons, the Smith family and particularly Roger have been shown to treat Klaus with disdain, take him for granted, and even mistreat him. In earlier seasons, Klaus was shown to be the smartest and most reasonable character in the family, often trying to warn or advise the Smiths of their wrongdoings of selfishness, stupidity, or recklessness. But this slowly changed as the series progressed, and in later seasons Klaus is shown to be much more prone to being crazed and senseless. Relationship with Roger Klaus and Roger's relationship is best described as a sibling rivalry. At times they hate each other and at other times they get along well. Roger is seen to be incredibly spiteful toward Klaus and insists on trying to make him feel despised, saying things like \\"You can't participate Klaus, I hate you. I say that not out of anger but as a fact\\" in \\"Great Space Roaster\\" and \\"It's like you want to be kicked out of this family\\" in \\"The One That Got Away\\". Klaus does things to get Roger into trouble for his amusement, like when he tricked him into eating Francine's potato salad in \\"Deacon Stan, Jesus Man\\". When a horrified Roger asked why Klaus would do something like that he just laughed and said \\"I'm German, it's what we do.\\" In \\"A Pi√±ata Named Desire\\", after Klaus made a comment about acting, Roger simply knocked Klaus's fish bowl across the room, smashed it against the wall, and walked out of the room as if nothing had happened while the fish lay gasping on the floor. Among everyone else living in the Smith household, Klaus is very much the most aware and sensible of Roger's contemptuous, abusive, and insanely-vindictive nature of selfishness and lack of morality and occasionally tries to warn the rest of the family against listening to or getting involved with him. Such instances, however, are ignored by everyone's naivety and general inability (or lack of interest) to take most matters seriously or remember that Klaus is a \\"man in a fish's body\\" rather than just a mere talking goldfish, as said in \\"Dr. Klaustus\\". Although Roger has claimed to hate Klaus in the past, they do have a bond and are capable of being civil to each other such as when they head to Europe together in \\"Red October Sky\\". Further evidence of this can be seen in \\"Pulling Double Booty\\", as Roger and Klaus are quite content to watch a movie together and show annoyance when they must pause it as Stan intrudes with the cookie dough. Another example is that Klaus is often shown in the attic with Roger as he tends his fake bar in many disguises while in \\"Live and Let Fry\\" Roger dresses up as Klaus, the human, to help him get access to a family member's will. In the end, it turns out to be a trap to lure Klaus out of hiding and Roger gets beaten up because Klaus owed some money to the East German Mafia. However, Klaus stays with him and keeps him company during his recovery, making sure Roger has sufficient pain medication to help him through it. Klaus was also the only member of the Smith family to remember Roger's birthday in \\"1600 Candles\\" and the alien seemed genuinely touched that he had bothered to prepare a birthday surprise for him. Klaus and Roger engage in a sexual relationship in \\"Kloger\\", but Klaus breaks it off when Roger starts to want to act like a real couple, as Klaus was only interested in the taboo aspect of sneaking around the family for their relationship. Relationship with Francine Despite showing sexual advances towards Francine in the early seasons, Klaus has shown he does care for her well being, evident in \\"Big Trouble in Little Langley\\". Upon overhearing the Dawsons (Francine's birth family) light-heartedly mention they gave her up so they can maintain riding in first-class, he sees them for who they really are and is upset by this. Klaus wisely warned Stan to remove them out of the house because he is setting Francine up to be hurt by them and tries to convince him to reconcile with the Lings instead. While this makes him uncomfortable, Stan refuses to listen to him and wants to try. He would later regret it when the warning Klaus gave to Stan was true about the Dawsons, especially after they selfishly leave him in the burning house. In the second episode of Season 11 \\"Roger Passes the Bar\\", Klaus tells Francine a story of a time when he bounced a check for his girlfriend's abortion, resulting in them putting the baby back inside of her, \\"and that baby was Shia LaBeouf,\\" he states; implying that Klaus is in actuality Shia LaBeouf's father. Relationship with Stan Klaus and Stan have a complex relationship, which can best be defined as a rocky friendship. Stan's refusal to help Klaus find a human body, as well as his tendency to treat him with marked disrespect, is often a source of tension in the two's relationship. Despite this, the two seem to care for one another, despite both being guilty of treating each other poorly. When given an opportunity, Klaus has been shown to delight in tormenting Stan on several occasions, or betraying him if he feels he has been sufficiently wronged. In other episodes, Klaus has been a source of advice for Stan, often being one of the primary characters the latter consults about his relationship with Francine or his kids. The two have become closer in recent episodes, doing activities together such as hosting a podcast about 90s' music and stopping street crime when Klaus inserts his mind into Stan's car. Relationship with Steve Klaus and Steve tend to get along consistently well, in contrast with other members of the family. With the possible exception of Roger, Klaus is the most frequently present member of the main cast in storylines concerning Steve and his friends, playing announcer for them when they wrestle, helping Snot deck out a basement, and telling Steve and Snot German stories. Like Roger, he is often critical of Steve's effeminate mannerisms, at one point asking him if he's \\"allergic to vaginas\\". Development The character was originally going to be named Francois and have a French accent. When Dee Bradley Baker came to audition for the character he ended up doing a German accent instead. Shortly after he was done with his audition the producers ended up casting him for the role. German dubbing In the German version, Klaus speaks with a Saxonian dialect and is voiced by Andreas M√ºller (de), and his remarks about World War II and the heroic defense of the Germans against the Allies are sometimes replaced by remarks about East Germany and the Stasi (\\",\\" the former East German Ministry for State Security and security service). French dubbing In French version, the character who was originally named Fran√ßois (in memory of Claude Francois electrocuted in 1978) is actually dubbed by Guy Chapellier who also dubbed Roger. The French actor decided to use some German words.

The reforms were proposed and initially approved during Berlusconi II and III cabinet between October 2004 and November 2005. If ultimately approved by referendum, in continuation with the 2001 constitutional enacted modifications, these reforms would have substantially completed the transformation of Italy from a unitary state into a federal republic. Political background, proposed changes and outcome Second confirmatory referendum in Italian republican history, launched on the initiative of the center-right legislature XIV, it aimed at modifying the second part of the Constitution of Italy in several respects. The constitutional law revision, approved by an absolute majority of the members of the Italian Parliament, according to the provisions of art. 138 of the constitution, had opened the possibility to the request for confirmation by one of the three subjects provided for by the article. This request was received by more than one fifth of the members of a chamber, by more than 500,000 voters and by more than five regional councils. Voters were asked whether they approved of amending 57 articles of the constitution. They would have given more power to the Prime Minister by allowing him or her to dissolve parliament, appoint and dismiss ministers, and control government policy. The President of Italy would have become guarantor of the constitution and the republic's federal unity. The reforms would have also ended Italy's perfect bicameralism: the Chamber of Deputies would have been given responsibility for foreign policy, defense and immigration, and the Senate ‚Äì renamed \\"Federal Senate\\" ‚Äì responsibility for nationwide federal law. The Italian Parliament as a whole would have undergone a reduction in the number of deputies (from 630 to 518) and senators (from 315 to 252) for a total cut of 175 MPs, down from 945 to 770 seats. Consequently, the reforms would also have increased the power of the regions, giving them control of education, healthcare, law and order, as well as giving them representation in the Supreme Court of Cassation. The proposals were opposed by incumbent Prodi II Cabinet, and were rejected by 61.29% of voters.

Howe's victory in court was considered monumental at the time. In the first issue of the Novascotian following the acquittal, Howe claimed that \\"the press of Nova-Scotia is Free.\\"Beck (1974), 39. Scholars, such as John Ralston Saul, have argued that Howe's libel victory established the fundamental basis for the freedom of the press in Canada.Saul, p. 10; Kesterton, pp. 21‚Äì23. Historian Barry Cahill writes that the trial was significant in colonial legal history because it was a long delayed replay of the Zenger case (1734).Cahill, p. 563  Background  During the year 1834, Howe was starting to attract attention to himself due to his strong independent viewpoints in his editorials in the Novascotian, the Government was starting to take notice.Chisholm, 7. Howe had eventually reached his breaking point and in late 1834 wrote in the Novascotian that he was going to start a campaign in the interest of bringing to light the wrongful actions of government.Rosner, 11. On January 1, 1835, the final piece of this campaign was published in the Novascotian, a letter signed \\"The People\\".Beck (1974), 31. This letter accused the magistrates of, \\"reprehensible irresponsibility, incompetence, and self- interestedness in the conduct of their responsibilities.\\"Campbell, 80. Specifically, in the letter Joseph Howe accused Halifax politicians and police of pocketing ¬£30,000 over a thirty-year period. Due to the letter being published, Howe was put on trial for seditious libel, being charged with \\"seditiously contriving, devising, and intending to stir up and incite discontent and sedition among His Majesty's subjects.\\"Rosner, 12. The crime of seditious libel had only been defined 200 years prior to the time of Howe's trial and was seen by many as an unfair crime as it could be as broad or as specific as the court chose.\\"Seditious libel Trial The trial took place in the present day library of Province House (Nova Scotia) and the judge in the case was Brenton Halliburton. Howe represented himself in the trial as no lawyer would defend him. Howe used as the basis of his argument the Libel Act 1792.Cahill, 1996, p. 360 He presented for six and a quarter hours addressing the jury, citing case after case of civic corruption. He spoke eloquently about the importance of press freedom, urging jurors \\"to leave an unshackled press as a legacy to your children.\\" Even though the judge instructed the jury to find Howe guilty, jurors took only ten minutes to acquit him.  Legacy  The victory of Howe in the court was considered monumental at the time. In the first issue of the Novascotian following the acquittal, Howe claimed that \\"the press of Nova-Scotia is Free.\\"Beck (1974), 39. Some scholars have argued that Howe's libel victory changed little in the strict legal sense, however, other scholars insist that the case established the fundamental basis for the freedom of the press in Canada.Saul, p. 10 Joseph Howe scholar J. M. Beck argues that Howe was victorious convincing a jury that the libel law was unjust, however, his trial had no immediate effect on changing the civil or criminal code with respect to libel. Beck asserts that the idea that Howe's trial contributed to the freedom of the press in Canada is a, \\"myth that has little basis in fact\\".Campbell, 114. In fact, eight years after the trial, Howe's successor at the Novascotian Richard Nugent was charged and found guilty of libel (1843). Nugent was imprisoned due to his inability to pay damages. Beck also notes that in 1843, the British Parliament passed a law that allowed the accused to use truth of the libel as their defence, which led to freedom of the press. Scholars have agreed with the strict legal sense of Beck's argument, however, scholar Cecil Rosner states, \\"The Howe trial is noteworthy more for its symbolic effect than any legal precedent it may have set...charges of sedition have largely disappeared [but] journalists across the country continue to face civil libel threats...\\".Rosner argues that Canadian law restricts the sources that journalists may use, and despite the introduction of Freedom of the Press in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms courts are still limiting press rights if they deem it necessary; Quebec does not accept truth as an appropriate defense for a libel case; and while journalists in the United States of America enjoy the ability to criticize their elected representatives without risk of prosecution, Canadian journalists do not have the same protection. Rosner concludes that \\"...more victories remain to be won\\". Lyndsay M. Campbell argues that the trial did eventually change the law. Howe was the first in Nova Scotia to argue intent before a jury. Campbell also notes that while Howe's defence did not persuade the presiding judge, it was a defense that would be used by lawyers in future cases.Campbell, 115. Howe changed how the law was perceived by both the legal profession and by the general public.Campbell, 115-116 The timing of the trial was crucial to the lasting effect it had on Canada. It occurred when the number of newspapers was growing rapidly and they were all pushing their own boundaries when it came to political commentary.Campbell, 116. Howe's trial removed the fear of prosecution from these newspapers for having political commentary of their own, as Campbell puts it, \\"The sense of what was possible had changed.\\" John Ralston Saul states that by, \\"...winning his acquittal, Howe established the fundamental ideas, principles, and shapes of freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Canada.\\"Saul, 10. Saul acknowledges that, in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, the laws have regressed and progressed multiple times since Howe's trial. Saul argues that Howe created the, \\"...intellectual foundation of how we still struggle to solidify and to widen the nature of freedom of speech and of the press.\\" Saul states that Howe's trial also had a significant influence on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He argues there is a clear link between Howe's defense and lines 9 and 10 of the Charter, which refer to freedom of speech and freedom of the press.Saul, 11. Saul also references many public leaders across Canada since Howe's trial who were influenced by him, such as Fred Dickson who was the leader of the 1919 Winnipeg Strike on trial for seditious libel, who read Howe's defence was their own to, \\"speak from an ethical center in their own public lives.\\"Saul, 14.  Film  In 1961, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) produced a 28-minute film about the trial entitled Joseph Howe: The Tribune of Nova Scotia.

They produced household disinfectant, sheep dip, wood preservatives, and shingle stain using coal tar that was a by-product of the gas works in Boston. They later bought a factory in Worthington, Pennsylvania which produced lampblack for making ink from natural gas. The Pennsylvania factory later shut down because of insufficient gas, and Godfrey proposed to move the plant to Kittanning. Samuel declined to invest in this venture and Godfrey bought out Samuel's interest in the Pennsylvania operations. Samuel's part of the company continued as Samuel Cabot Incorporated, and Godfrey's became Cabot Corporation.Thomas D.

Painting  Thematic of her paintings is mostly, and in the best strength expressed in her compositions with acts, usually of large size, reaching even dimensions larger than 3 X 3 meters. They are followed by less portraits, and, very rarely presenting landscapes and other themes presented in smaller sizes. In her huge compositions there are not details or precise painting. On a contrary. They seem like huge colored krokies in which the very stroke is adequate to a picture dimension.

Life Gough was educated at Hackney Downs School before attending the University of Cambridge (St John's College) where he studied at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). He subsequently worked with John Cox at JILA (Colorado) from 1966 to 1967, at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and with Edward Spiegel at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York from 1967 to 1969. He returned to Cambridge in 1969 to join the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy and DAMTP. He was Director of the Institute of Astronomy from 1999 to 2004, Deputy Director from 1993 to 1999. He has been a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, since 1972, a Science Research Council Senior Fellow (1978‚Äì1983), a Fellow Adjoint of JILA since 1986, an Honorary Professor of Astronomy at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London (1986‚Äì2009), and a Visiting Professor of Physics (now Consulting Professor) at Stanford University since 1996.

He is married to Rosanne; they have four children: Kim McCabe, Heidi Rose, Julian Gough and Russell Gough, and seven grandchildren.  Scientific work  Gough began his career working mainly on the problem of convection in stars and how it interacts with stellar pulsations. His best known works from this period include the a criterion for the inhibition of convection by magnetic fields in stars, the application of the anelastic approximation to stellar atmospheres, and a model of convection that is the foundation of methods still used today to model the interaction of convection and pulsations in classical variable stars and in the Sun. In 1976, he and his PhD student J√∏rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard predicted that the global oscillation frequencies of the Sun could be used to infer its deep structure. This is regarded as the beginning of what became known as helioseismology and, by extension, asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators; Gough and Christensen-Dalsgaard are regarded as the \\"fathers\\" of the field. Gough and his students subsequently published extensively on the internal structure of the Sun and the calculation thereof, including determining features like the depth of the solar convection zone, the Sun's interior rotation, the protosolar helium abundance and the main-sequence age. He pioneered seismological investigation into the equation of state in the Sun and the helium abundance in stellar convection zones. His doctoral students have included the Raja of Mahmudabad, Chris Jones, Douglas N. C. Lin, John Gribbin, J√∏rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard, Michael Thompson, Margarida Cunha, Marcus Br√ºggen and Pascale Garaud.

Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs, Laurent de La Hyre, dated 1638, with a similar setting The Adoration of the Shepherds by the Le Nain Brothers is in the National Gallery in London. The painting dates from about 1640, and is relatively unusual as a religious subject or history painting in their oeuvre; they are best known for genre painting, especially groups of peasants. As with most of the works of Antoine (c 1600‚Äì1648), Louis (c. 1603?‚Äì1648) and Mathieu (1607‚Äì1677) Le Nain, it is not possible to establish which brother, or combination of brothers, painted it.Wine, 194, 208; for an older and opposing view, see Blunt, 155‚Äì156, who describes distinct styles and types of work for each brother. This painting is unsigned, but when they signed their works, from 1641 to 1648, it was simply as Lenain.Wine, 194 Description The painting is in oil on canvas and in good condition, with minor losses; it measures . The Adoration of the Shepherds is a very common subject in the Nativity of Jesus in art, and the composition is an arrangement of the conventional components, including the Holy Family, the ox and ass or donkey, angels, and three shepherds, two old and one young. One shepherd and an angel are glancing out to the viewer's left, and it has been suggested that they have seen the approach of the Biblical Magi, which may have been the subject of a matching painting. There are pentimenti showing what appears to have been the original composition: on the wall above the lefthand angel dim traces of a head of the Virgin can be seen, slightly bowed to the left matching Joseph just to her right. On the donkey the trace of a curved rein can be seen, starting where the white chest meets the foreleg; the whole animal may originally have been lower.Wine, 206‚Äì207 Michael Levey describes the treatment of the scene as \\"partly 'realistic' and humbly rustic and partly idealized\\",Levey, 211 and the National Gallery detect the influence of Orazio Gentileschi, who had worked in Paris, in the figures of Mary and Joseph, and the ass.National Gallery page Dates in the 1630s have been suggested, and also that the painting is by Mathieu, or Louis.Wine, 208‚Äì209 for date, and recording rather than endorsing the attribution to Mathieu; Levey, 211 attributes it to Louis. Elements of the architectural setting have been compared to those in a painting by Laurent de La Hyre in the Hermitage Museum dated 1638, Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs (in reverse), and the ass is very similar to that in The Milkmaid's Family, also in the Hermitage, a Le Nain painting thought to date to 1641.Wine, 208‚Äì210 There is an Adoration attributed to the brothers, and at least in a similar style, in the National Gallery of Ireland, which shares some aspects of the composition.Wine, 210 Another, more realist, Adoration of the Shepherds in the Louvre was long attributed to the Le Nains, but is now given to Jean Michelin and dated 1659.Louvre; Blunt, 155, has the old attribution. Provenance As with most Le Nain paintings, the original commissioner is not known, nor whether it was intended for a church or other religious institution, or a domestic setting.Wine, 194; Blunt, 157 It first appears in England in the 1770s. Possibly it was the painting of the subject sold at Christie's 7 February 1771, as by Le Nain (lot 21), realizing the good price of ¬£42, and/or that sold on 20 March 1773, again at Christie's, this time for only ¬£14 4s 6d (lot 85, as \\"Le Naine\\"). It was certainly at Blenheim Palace by 1777, now attributed to Luca Giordano, in the collection of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. It remained in the Marlborough collection until the epic sales in the 1880s of the 8th Duke, when it was once again sold at Christie's on 7 August 1886 (lot 652, ¬£52 10s), bought by a dealer. It was later bought by Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk and is recorded as hanging in the \\"Prince's Bedroom\\" at Arundel Castle in 1902, still as a Giordano. In 1962 it was sold by the 16th Duke to the National Gallery, as a Le Nain. It is catalogued as NG 6331, and hangs in Room 18.Wine, 206, whose notes suggest (n. 10) that the misattribution to Giordano may have been deliberate, to increase the market value paid by the Duke, and that Charles Davis of 147 New Bond Street, the dealer who bought the work in 1886, acted for the Duke of Norfolk & may have done so here, or sold it to him later (n. 4).

Bader House and Garden in southeast Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon is a 2.5-story single dwelling and garden listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in Tudor Revival style in 1922, it was added to the register in 1989. Designed by DeYoung and Roald Architects of Portland, the L-shaped house sits on a lot opposite Laurelhurst Park. One of several luxurious houses in the neighborhood, it has a steeply pitched hip roof, tall multipaned leaded windows, massive chimneys, stucco cladding, and decorative half-timbers. The interior features oak and mahogany woodwork, Italian marble and tile, large fireplaces, ornate fixtures, and a built-in vacuum system. A ballroom, a billiards room, and a wine cellar are main features of the finished basement. The house also has a partly finished attic with a bedroom, maid's room, bathroom, and storage space. George Otten, a landscape engineer for the Oregon State Highway Commission, designed the property's formal garden, with paths of Italian marble, a sundial, a pergola, and a circular flower bed, among other features, at the rear of the house. Louis Bader, the original owner of the house, was a lumberman from Illinois who moved to Portland in 1910. He became involved in real-estate marketing, particularly in the Laurelhurst district. In 1909, the Ladd Estate Company, influenced by the ideas of Frederick Law Olmsted, had laid out Laurelhurst as a residential subdivision built on the Hazelfern Farm property of William M. Ladd. Bader, who financed construction of some of the houses in Laurelhurst, lived in the house with his wife, Lillie, and children until 1936. In 1938, the Baders sold the house to Merl Margason, a Portland neurologist.

Born into a family branded counter-revolutionary, Uyghur nationalist and separatist by the Chinese government, Turani was raised in a labor camp where he faced economic hardship and political oppression. Turani attended Kashgar Teacher's College and graduated from the Department of Physics in July 1983. Turani came to the United States on August 12, 1988 and became the first Uyghur political asylee. In 1995, Turani established the East Turkistan National Freedom Center (ETNFC), a non-profit human rights organization based in Washington, D.C. He is the first person to start the East Turkistan independence movement in the United States. In 2004, Turani set up the East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGIE) in Washington, D.C. and was elected as the first Prime Minister.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voice_of_America_Report_on_Chinese_Opposition_of_ETGIE.ogg Activism East Turkistan National Freedom Center As the president of the East Turkistan National Freedom Center, Turani organized demonstrations, conferences and cultural events, concerning the situation of East Turkistan. He also met with many international dignitaries, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, Tibetan Leader Dalai Lama and Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, in an attempt to gain their support in ending the occupation of his nation.Anwar Yusuf Turani: An Uyghur-Muslim Challenge to Chinese Authority in East Turkistan In April 1996, Turani met with Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, forging an alliance between East Turkistan and Tibet against the Chinese government. Later that month, Turani and representatives of occupied Tibet and Inner Mongolia organized an Independence Walk from the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to the United Nations in New York City. At the end of the two- week walk, Turani spoke in front of the United Nations headquarters, addressing the Chinese human rights violations in East Turkistan since 1949.UN Speech by Anwar Yusuf Turani (Part 1), April 25, 1996 In June 1997, along with the support of the Tibetan Independence Movement, Turani cut one of the five stars from the national flag of China in front of the United Nations. Turani removed the star as a symbolic gesture of his nation's yearning to liberate themselves from Chinese occupation. In February 1998, Turani visited Taiwan at the invitation of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations, along with Erkin Alptekin; Professor Thubten Jigme Norbu, elder brother of the Dalai Lama; Tashi Jamyangling, former Home Secretary of the Tibetan Government in exile; and Johnar Bache, Vice Chairman of the Southern Mongolian People's Party. They met Taiwan independence activists and the pro Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive Party members Liu Sung-pan, the President of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan; Chen Shui-bian, former president of Taiwan; and Frank Hsieh, the Mayor of Kaosiung. On June 4, 1999, Turani met with US President Bill Clinton in order to persuade him to back the East Turkistan independence movement. Turani told Clinton that his nation is in favor of waging a war of independence against China;. Turani claimed to had been funded by wealthy Uyghurs in Saudi Arabia. On July 20, 2001, Turani received a letter from the United States Department of State on behalf of President George W. Bush in response to Turani's initial letter concerning the Chinese occupation of East Turkistan. In this letter, the U.S. government expressed its willingness to protect the \\"fundamental human rights -- the rights to freedom of association, assembly, religion, belief, conscience, and expression -- of Uyghurs and others living in China.\\" East Turkistan Government in Exile On September 14, 2004, Anwar Yusuf Turani proclaimed the creation of the \\"East Turkistan Government in Exile\\" in Washington, D.C. and was elected Prime Minister. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Kong Quan publicly registered his displeasure, referencing such groups' terrorism in the Xinjiang region.; In November, the United States Government declared that it \\"does not recognize any East Turkestan government-in-exile, nor do we provide support for any such entity\\". In 2007, Turani criticized the People's Republic of China for imprisoning Uyghur imam Huseyincan Celil. Turani compared Celil's arrest to that of Rebiya Kadeer and theorized that the PRC wanted to use Celil as leverage against Canada, where Celil held citizenship. Since 2007, Turani has been addressing the primary issues that the people of East Turkistan are facing both in their homeland and abroad. Turani regularly issues press releases in the native Uyghur language to educate the Uyghur people of their history and situation, and to show them a path toward their independence.‚Äò‚ÄôWeten Dawasi‚Äù, STJSH' ning \\"Weten Dawasi\\" Heqqidiki Bayanati (1/3-Bolum), April 22, 2011, January 5, 2012 In 2011, Rebiya Kadeer accused the Chinese government of intentionally cultivating multiple Uyghur governments in exile in order to divide the Uyghur people.

Brother to Samuel Scheer, an English teacher at Windsor High School and part-time musician. Education and early career Scheer was born in New York City. He received his Bachelor of Music and Masters of Music degrees at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, followed by a scholarship to the University of Cologne and an International Rotary Fellowship to study at the Hochschule F√ºr Musik in Vienna. While in Europe, he worked as an actor and singer in leading roles at the Theater an der Wien, the Deutsches Theater in Munich and as director George Tabori's assistant at the Schauspielhaus in Cologne. Operatic librettist Mr. Scheer worked as librettist with Tobias Picker on Th√©r√®se Raquin (based on the √âmile Zola novel), commissioned by a consortium of companies including The Dallas Opera San Diego Opera, and the Op√©ra de Montr√©al, and premiering in Dallas in November 2001, starring Diana Soviero. A revised version of Th√©r√®se Raquin was performed in March 2006 at the Linbury Studio Theatre of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Scheer collaborated again with Picker on An American Tragedy (based on the novel by Theodore Dreiser, which premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 2005, starring Nathan Gunn, Patricia Racette, Susan Graham, Dolora Zajick and Jennifer Larmore. Scheer has collaborated with the composer Jake Heggie on a number of projects, including the critically acclaimed Moby-Dick, which premiered at The Dallas Opera in April 2010, starring Ben Heppner and Stephen Costello. In February 2008, the Heggie-Scheer collaboration Last Acts (based on a play by Terrence McNally, opened at the Houston Grand Opera, starring Frederica Von Stade. (Last Acts was subsequently retitled Three Decembers). They also collaborated on lyric dramas To Hell and Back commissioned and debuted by the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra in November 2006, featuring soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian and Patti LuPone, and For a Look or a Touch, written for a baritone, actor, and chamber ensemble (debuted by the Seattle ensemble Music of Remembrance in 2007).

It has the characteristic mineral assemblage of kyanite + talc, responsible for its white colour. The name was introduced in 1973 by German mineralogist and petrologist Werner Schreyer. This rock is associated with the metamorphism of some pelites, evaporite sequences or altered basaltic or felsic intrusions. Whiteschists form in the MgO---- (MFASH) system. Rocks of this primary chemistry are extremely uncommon and they are in most cases thought to be the result of metasomatic alteration, with the removal of various mobile elements. Occurrence Whiteschists occur as lenses or tectonic slices on a metre to kilometre scale within nine orogenic belts around the world. There are two occurrences in Central Africa, one in Tasmania, one in the Norwegian Caledonides, two in the Alps and three in Asia. One of the most extensive outcrops of whiteschist occurs within the Lufilian Arc - Zambezi Belt orogen. This northwest-southeast trending zone extends for about 700 km. The whiteschist is found with rocks bearing the assemblages anthophyllite-cordierite-kyanite and garnet-staurolite-kyanite. Most occurrences were originally described from metasedimentary sequences, and thought to represent either evaporite or bentonite layers. However, whiteschists have now been described with protoliths ranging from metabasalt to granite. Formation Whiteschists have a chemistry that only very rarely occurs as the primary composition of rocks. This implies that they can only form under conditions where other chemical components have been removed by large scale metasomatism, strongly altering the original rock composition. The mobile components that may be removed include , CaO, , MnO, , Rb, Ba, Th. Another feature of whiteschists is that iron and manganese only occur in their highest oxidation state, indicating that the fluid responsible for the metasomatism was characterised by a high oxygen fugacity. The main reaction involved in their formation is Mg-chlorite + quartz ‚Üí talc + kyanite, which has been used to define the stability of the whiteschist assemblage. In at least one example however, the overall reaction phlogopite + amphibole + plagioclase ‚Üí kyanite + talc + quartz + Fe(hematite) + Na, Ca, K, Mn (fluid) has been described from an altered amphibolite, suggesting that the original reaction may be insufficient to describe the full stability range of the kyanite + talc assemblage under high oxygen fugacity conditions.

Chpt. 2, p. 8. Business model The business model of the company was to encourage book buying in the retail marketplace by signing customers on to memberships of book selling syndicates, wherein they could buy mass market published books at a substantially reduced price rate compared to the same books' sale prices in high street retail outlets. The drawback was that in exchange for this reduced price, customers (or book club \\"members\\"), in joining a syndicate signed a legal contract agreeing to purchase a minimum number of books from titles' lists offered by BCA each year, this way compensating BCA for the lower prices by sales volume. In the medium term this business model ran into difficulty as customers who had signed on for this process attracted in by low prices for a particular book or two that they were interested in, found themselves required to purchase books beyond that which they didn't necessarily want merely to fulfill their contractual obligations. This led to a sense of customers being trapped into purchasing something against their will, and the model became increasingly unpopular and shunned by the public as time went on.

He was the first ever Polish tank officer or crew member to be awarded the Virtuti Militari (Silver Cross-V No 3380). He became Commander of the II Battalion of the Polish 1st Tank Regiment.  Early life  Born on the 4 December 1881 in Putyrol in the Kursk Gubernia of Russia he was educated at the 1st Cadet Corps School in Petrograd (St Petersburg). In 1898 shortly after leaving school he was in one of the first groups of students to enter the newly founded Kiev Polytechnic Institute of Emperor Alexander II. There he studied mechanical engineering. He briefly entered Russian military service in 1905 before joining the army reserve.  Russian Army  With the commencement of the First World War in 1914 he was mobilised to participate in the campaign against Germany and Austria and was assigned as a staff officer to the headquarters of the XXIII Corps of the Imperial Russian Army. Later he was sent to the Nikolaev Cavalry School in Petrograd where he underwent higher officer training. In 1916 he was sent to Main Artillery Control Headquarters and was made Commander of the 1st Artillery Squadron. In April 1917 following the end of the Tsar and appointment of a Russian Provisional government he became Chief of Engineers of the Russian XI Army and was sent to the South- West Front where he fought at the Kerensky Offensive, the last major Russian offensive of the First World War.  Polish Army  In November 1917, he left the Russian Army and briefly became an officer into the Polish 1st Corp. After the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty and the subsequent dissolution of the Corps in May 1918 he made his way via Murmansk to France to join the emergent independent Polish Army (Haller's Army). He joined the Polish 1st Tank Regiment (1 Pulk Czolgow) which was newly equipped with 120 of the small but relatively fast French Renault FT tanks. The 1st Tank Regiment consisted of four tank companies organised into two Battalions. After initial training on the new tanks, he first commenced as the Technical Adjutant to the I Battalion but shortly after on December 18, 1919 was promoted and took over Command of the 2nd Company from its previous French Commander, one Captain Dufour. In 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, he was involved in a great deal of fierce fighting, particularly in the evacuation from Wilno and the Defense of Grodno. On August 12, 1920 he was promoted to Major and became Commander of the II Battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment, taking over from Captain Henryk Romiszowski. In 1921 he became the first ever Polish tank officer or crew member to receive the Virtuti Militari the decoration \\"for outstanding bravery in combat\\" was awarded for his actions during and subsequent to the Defense of Grodno. He was wounded in action and later also received the Polish Cross of Valour. With the formal ending of the Polish-Soviet war in 1921 he retired from his command of the II Battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment and recommenced in his career as an engineer being responsible for the building a number of bridges and other civil works. He died from a heart attack on 5 February 1929 at only 48 years of age.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1973. History thumb As Ontonagon became a more important Lake Superior port, it was realized that a navigational aid to shipping would be required. Thus, in 1847, funds were appropriated to purchase land on which to site a lighthouse, and in 1850 a further $5000 was appropriated to build the structure. Construction began in 1852 and was completed in 1853. The station was first lit with Lewis lamps, which were replaced in 1857 with a fifth-order Fresnel lens at a cost of $500. However, by 1866, the original wooden lighthouse had badly deteriorated, and plans were made to replace it. A new brick structure was completed in 1867 by Detroit contractor W.F. Chittenden at a cost of $14000, and the lens was moved from the older wooden structure, which was then demolished. In 1889, an iron galley was installed around the light to make window-washing easier. In 1890, a kitchen addition to the keeper's quarters was constructed. Use of the light was discontinued in 1963, and it was officially closed in January 1964. The building was leased to the last light keeper, and served as his family's private residence for a few years. The Fresnel lens and keepers' logs were given to the Ontonagon County Historical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and in 2003, ownership of the structure was transferred to the Ontonagon County Historical Society. The society undertook a complete restoration of the structure, and conducts tours for visitors. Description The Ontonagon light is a rectangular, 1-story cream-colored brick keeper's house on a stone foundation, integral with a three-story, tall tower. This design was used, with some variations, on a number of Michigan lighthouses, including the Bois Blanc Light, Copper Harbor Light, Grand Island North Light, Granite Island Lighthouse, Gull Rock Light Station, Huron Island Light, Marquette Harbor Light, and the Sand Point Light. The tower is topped with a polygonal iron beacon. A spiral stair within the tower provides access to the light, as well as to the basement and upper floor of the main dwelling. A single-story kitchen addition is attached opposite the tower. Three bays of windows are on each side of the structure, with double- hung six-over-six sash windows with stone lintels and sills on the first floor. The structures gable roof has a single hipped dormer on each side.

She was born in Birmingham, the eldest of the family of Francis Clark, a silversmith of Birmingham, and his wife Caroline, a sister of Rowland Hill. The family settled in Adelaide, South Australia in 1850. A delicate child with poor eyesight, she was an apt and industrious student like her brother Howard. In 1837 she was sent to stay with her grandmother Hill in Tottenham, half a mile from Bruce Castle, to study at \\"Miss Woods School\\" in a nearby town, perhaps Upper Clapton. Around 1840 scarlet fever struck the family and Emily was left with rheumatism in her hands. In 1863, shortly after the death of brother Howard's wife Lucy, Emily joined him in his newly built \\"Hazelwood Cottage\\" (a few hundred metres from the original \\"Hazelwood Homestead\\") to care for his three young children: Frank, Nellie and new-born Lucy, and stayed there until Howard's marriage to Agnes McNee in 1865. Public life The next phase of her life, for which she is best remembered, arose from her friendship with fellow-Unitarian Annie Montgomerie Martin, who had visited Adelaide's Destitute Asylum, a State-run institution for children abandoned by their parents on account of poverty, and been shocked at the hopelessness of its occupants. Emily had seen in Scotland the virtues of having these unfortunates rather raised amongst working families (and perhaps influenced by her cousin Rosamond Davenport Hill), broached the subject in the Register, which prompted favourable editorial comment and extended the debate to the Orphan Girls' Home. It is likely that her brother Howard, a proprietor of the Register, was behind these editorials. Emily argued that housing them together perpetuated their feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness and was unlikely to develop them into productive citizens, and it was, moreover, expensive. There were, at the time, two State bodies concerned with the welfare of uncared-for children: the Children's Apprenticeship Board (formed in 1848) and the Destitute Board, which since 1867 ran a form of poorhouse in the \\"Grace Darling\\" (previously a temperance hotel) in Brighton, followed by a new orphanage in Magill in 1869. Emily's aim was to replace these with a less bureaucratic system that sent these children to live in the homes of working families, no more than four together, and preferably away from the city. The families would receive adequate recompense, but the overall cost would not be substantially higher than the warehousing of the children. Despite influential support from Catherine Helen Spence, John Howard Clark, C. B. Young, Margaret Fraser (later Lady) Davenport (1821‚Äì1902) and Mary (later Lady) Colton (1822‚Äì1898), An informative obituary. the government refused to put any of her ideas into operation, but did permit her \\"Boarding-out Society\\" to engage in trials. Neville Blyth organised for her to have responsibility for a boy and a girl who were unhappy in the institution. She was appointed to the State Children's Council on 9 December 1886. She appears to have been invited by the State of Victoria in 1902 to advise on welfare of orphan and destitute children, especially babies of unmarried girls with no family support. In this and similar references, her surname is mis-spelled \\"Clarke\\" Retirement She retired from the State Children's Council, mainly due to her deafness, on 13 August 1906. Her sister Mary Crompton had done much useful work on the boarding-out committee and succeeded her on the State Children's Council in 1906. Catherine Spence wrote the book \\"State Children in Australia\\" about the work of Emily Clark, and it was published by the State Children's Council in recognition of her service. Miss Spence wrote:-\\"In other English speaking countries boarding-out in families is sometime permitted, but here, under the Southern Cross, it is the law of the land that children shall not be brought up in institutions but in homes. This movement originated in South Australia, and with all its far-reaching developments and expansion it is due to the initiative of one woman, of whom the State and the Commonwealth are justly proud ‚Äì Miss C. E. Clark.\\" In her last years she was infirm and almost totally blind, but she retained much of her fierce intellect. A late poem, published in The Register, can be quoted here: > All-healing Death! Thou art not far away. Time bears thee onwards with > unflagging wings ‚Äì Nearer and nearer coming day by day To break the tangled > web that round me clings The web of life with many glittering strings; So > bright and beautiful, I fain would stay In this fair world, but darkness and > decay Creep at the heels of age, and earthly things Their savour lose: so > may I glad obey Thy stern command, that ease and solace brings With gentle > sleep, the strife of hopes and fears Ended in peace; then let none weep for > me In mercy dost thou come, and I would be Remembered happily, and not with > tears.

Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney called the pledge \\"undignified and inappropriate.\\" Romney's campaign later clarified that he would not sign because language in the pledge made the assertion that African American children born into slavery in 1860 were better off than children raised today. He was not the only one to take issue with this language. The \\"slavery portion\\" of the pledge was soon removed. After the controversies with the pledge, House Speaker Pro-Tem Jeff Kaufmann, said the pledge has \\"ridiculous implications,\\" questioned Vander Plaats' integrity, and said that his \\"political credibility is waning to the point of no impact.\\" In November and December 2011, the organization \\"agonized\\" over whether to make an endorsement and whom to endorse.

For historical reasons, the Russian Accounting Standards framework has been determined by the state, rather by professional bodies. The primary users of RAS are state and tax authorities, rather than management or third parties. RAS financial statements must include balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and explanatory notes. Under RAS, a specific layout is mandatory for the balance sheet and other statements. The Russian government has been striving to harmonize Russian Accounting Standards with IFRS since 1998. The Law No. 208-FZ introduced IFRS into Russian legislation in 2010. Since 2012, IFRS have increasingly been adopted in Russia, and they are mandatory for consolidated financial statements, while standalone financial statements must be prepared using RAS. IFRS statements are also required for domestic public companies. IFRS are generally deemed more relevant to the needs of investors. Comparison to IFRS Major reasons for deviation between Russian GAAP and IFRS / US-GAAP (e.g. when the Russian affiliate of a larger group need to be consolidated to the mother company) are the following: # Booking of payables in the general ledger according to national accounting standards can only be made upon receipt of the actual acceptance protocol (good's receipt). Indeed, in Russia, in contrast to IFRS and US-GAAP, the invoice (outgoing or incoming) is not an official tax or accounting document and does not trigger any booking. There is also no provision to book in the General Ledger any expense for goods and services that according to a contract are effectively received but for whom documents are still not exchanged. # There is no possibility under Russian GAAP to recognise the good-will as an intangible asset in the balance sheet of a company. This has a major consequence when a company is sold. Indeed, if a company (or part of it) is sold at a higher value than its book value (i.e. to account for the good-will value), the selling party need to pay tax at the relevant profit tax rate (20% in 2013) on the difference in value between selling and accounting value and the buyer has no possibility to amortize the cost and deduct it from present and future revenues. # There is no equivalent of IAS 37 in the Russian GAAP. Loans and monetary securities are not discounted, so the present value of such financial assets is not discounted for the relevant interest rates at the different maturities of the loans.

The college opened in 1977 as the only osteopathic medical school west of the Rocky Mountains. COMP was the founding program of Western University of Health Sciences (WesternU), which now has 8 colleges in addition to COMP, each offering professional degrees in various fields of healthcare. COMP has a single 4-year program, conferring the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. Graduates are eligible to practice medicine in all 50 states and more than 85 countries. In 2011, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened a branch campus in Lebanon, Oregon called COMP-Northwest. COMP is accredited by the American Osteopathic Association‚Äôs Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation.  History  thumbrighttop430pxHealth Education Center (HEC) HEC is the main building for the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. The building first opened for classes in early 2010 The College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific first opened in 1977, and was the first osteopathic medical school to open in California after the merger between the California osteopathic medical board and the M.D. board in 1961, the California College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons became an M.D. granting school (now the UC Irvine School of Medicine). In 1974, the Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California voted to move forward on planning the development of a new osteopathic medical school in California. After acquiring a facility in Pomona and recruiting Philip Pumerantz from Chicago to serve as president, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific was founded in 1977. The first classes began in 1978, and the inaugural class of students graduated in 1982. That same year, in 1982, the American Osteopathic Association granted COMP full accreditation. At the time, COMP was the only osteopathic medical school west of the Rocky Mountains, and until 1997, when Touro University California opened in Vallejo, it was the only one in California. In 1977, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened its first outpatient clinic, and in 1988, the school opened the Mission Osteopathic Medical Center in downtown Pomona. In 1990, the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges granted COMP candidacy status, and full accreditation was awarded in 1996. In August 1996, the college was restructured to form a university, which was named ‚ÄúWestern University of Health Sciences,\\" and COMP became one of the colleges in this university. In 2010, the Pomona Patient Care Center and the Health Education Center opened as a part of a $100 million expansion project at Western University. The Health Education Center is a 180,000 square-foot teaching and research facility, and serves as the primary building on campus for COMP. Since 1982, a total of 4,245 physicians have graduated from COMP and 64 percent of alumni live and practice in California. 44 percent of the 2010 graduating class entered a residency in California. During the 2012-13 application cycle, COMP received 4,339 applications for 220 openings. The class of 2017 had an average Medical College Admission Test score of 28, and an average overall GPA of 3.56. Graduates of COMP receive a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree and are referred to as osteopathic physicians. Osteopathic physicians, like M.D. physicians, are complete physicians and are licensed to prescribe medication and perform surgery. Osteopathic physicians and M.D. physicians are very similar, but D.O. physicians receive additional training in the musculoskeletal system, and learn osteopathic manipulative medicine. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine describes the training of osteopathic physicians as \\"virtually indistinguishable\\" from that of M.D. physicians.Dennis L. Kasper, Eugene Braunwald, Anthony S. Fauci, Stephen L. Hauser, Dan L. Longo, J. Larry Jameson, and Kurt J. Isselbacher, Eds. Chapter 10. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Ed. 2005. McGraw Hill. D.O. physicians may choose to enter either a D.O. or an M.D. residency. Research The College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific publishes research on several subjects in the basic and clinical sciences. Research topics include the following: tuberculosis, Alzheimer's disease, skin cancer, Angelman Syndrome, endangered species, and anatomy. Research is funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the FRAXA Foundation, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institutes of Health. In a 2010 report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, COMP was recognized as a top medical school in terms of its social mission, ranking higher than any other California medical school and higher than any other osteopathic medical school. COMP was also 12th in the number of primary care physicians it produced. In 2007, COMP was recognized by the Hispanic Business Journal as the 18th best medical school for Hispanics in the United States. In 2014, the U.S. News & World Report ranked COMP (WesternU) as 17th amongst all US medical schools for producing primary care residents.  Academics  The 1st and 2nd years of medical school at COMP focus on the basic sciences, and a systems-based approach to basic clinical sciences. Much of the curriculum at COMP is case-based, rather than lecture-based, especially during the second year. The Summer Medical Sciences Preparatory Program is an optional course for students interested in an introduction to gross anatomy, biochemistry, and osteopathic manipulative medicine. The Intensive Summer Anatomy Course is an optional course for students interested in anatomy. The curriculum at COMP includes Interprofessional Education (IPE), a program that involves 9 colleges at WesternU. The IPE program aims to demonstrate an understanding of other health professions and to provide and promote a team approach to patient care and health care management, leading to improved patient care. While a debate exists on the effectiveness of interprofessional education in encouraging collaborative practice, IPE is becoming a more common component of medical school curriculum in the United States, and many groups, including the World Health Organization, view it as a means of reducing medical errors and improving the health care system. The 3rd and 4th years of training are clinically oriented, where students rotate through various specialties of medicine; the core rotations are internal medicine, family practice, surgery, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, and osteopathic manipulative medicine, and they provide opportunities for students to develop clinical skills. The majority of 3rd year core rotation sites are located in Southern California, including: thumbrighttop405pxPatient Care Center (Pomona campus) Services include medical care, podiatry, dentistry, pharmacy, and optometry. * Arrowhead Regional Medical Center * Chino Valley Medical Center * Community Memorial Hospital * Downey Regional Medical Center * Garfield Medical Center * Kaiser Permanente, Fontana, California * Pacific Hospital of Long Beach * Patton State Hospital * Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center * Riverside County Regional Medical Center * WesternU Patient Care Centers WesternU has two Patient Care Centers (PCC) that offer medical care, podiatric, dentistry, pharmacy, and optometric services; one is located in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, and the other is in Pomona, on the main campus. The Pomona Patient Care Center opened in May 2010, and serves more than 10,000 patients per year. Students from the different colleges at WesternU learn and develop clinical skills at the Patient Care Centers. COMP students may rotate at the Patient Care Center for family medicine, internal medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and osteopathic manipulative medicine. During their 4th year, students complete sub-internships at hospitals with residency programs. Students at COMP may choose to complete a master's degree in addition to their Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Three master's of science programs are offered through other colleges at Western University: a Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences, a Master of Science in Health Sciences, and a Master of Science in Medical Sciences. The College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific is affiliated with OPTI-West, an Osteopathic Post-Graduate Training Institute. Through OPTI-West the college works with hospitals to establish and maintain postdoctoral training programs. COMP is affiliated with various residency programs at hospitals such as Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Riverside Regional Medical Center, San Diego Sports/Medicine and Family Health Center, and St. Mary‚Äôs-Corwin Medical Center.  College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Northwest  In 2011, a satellite campus of COMP opened in Lebanon, Oregon; it is known as the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest (COMP-Northwest). The new 54,000 square-foot building is used to educate medical students during their first two years of training. During the 3rd and 4th year of training, the students rotate in hospitals and clinics. Currently, only the medical program is offered at the Lebanon campus, although the university plans to eventually open additional colleges. The inaugural class is composed of 107 students, selected from about 2,000 applicants. COMP-Northwest is the first new medical school to open in Oregon in over 100 years; currently, 5% of physicians practicing in Oregon are osteopathic physicians, a number that is expected to increase with the establishment of COMP-Northwest. John Kitzhaber, MD the former governor of Oregon and an emergency physician, delivered the keynote speech at the Convocation Ceremony for COMP-Northwest. During the 76th Oregon Legislative Assembly, the Oregon State Senate passed a resolution to \\"congratulate the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest, thank the founders for their commitment to the people of Oregon and wish the college success in the future. Student life In 1985, COMP students formed a theater group called Sanus, which is the Latin word for \\"sanity.\\" The theater troupe remains active, and students from other colleges at Western University also participate. The college also hosts an active chapter of Sigma Sigma Phi, a national Osteopathic Medicine Honors Fraternity that emphasizes community service and scholastic achievement. Along with students in other programs at WesternU, students at COMP participate in a number of clubs on campus.

A Deputy Leader and a senior and a junior whip were also elected. Following the Labour Party's loss in the 2011 general election, leader Phil Goff and deputy leader Annette King resigned, prompting the leadership election, which was conducted as a secret ballot of the Labour caucus. David Cunliffe, David Shearer and David Parker stood for the leadership, and Nanaia Mahuta and Grant Robertson contested the deputy position. Cunliffe and Mahuta ran as a ticket. During the campaign Parker pulled out of the race and endorsed Shearer. Shearer and Robertson won the votes for their respective positions. Chris Hipkins and Darien Fenton were chosen as the senior and junior whips, respectively. Background The leadership election followed Phil Goff's resignation as party leader. At the 2008 general election, the Fifth Labour Government, led by Helen Clark, was defeated by John Key's National Party. Following Clark's election-night resignation, Phil Goff was unanimously elected as the party's leader, with Annette King as deputy, and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick as the senior and junior whips, respectively. The party lost more support in the 26 November 2011 general election; its popular vote dipped to 27% ‚Äì its worst- ever result under the mixed-member proportional representation system ‚Äì and its number of MPs was reduced from forty-three to thirty-four. On 29 November 2011, Goff and King announced their resignations, effective 13 December. New whips also had to be chosen because Rick Barker (who replaced Hughes as the senior whip in April 2011, following Hughes leaving Parliament) and Chadwick were not re-elected to Parliament. Candidates Former Cabinet ministers David Cunliffe (MP for New Lynn) and Nanaia Mahuta (Hauraki-Waikato) ran as a ticket for the leadership and deputy leadership, respectively. Former minister and list MP David Parker and 2009 Mount Albert by-election winner David Shearer were candidates for the party leadership, and Wellington Central representative Grant Robertson sought the deputy leadership. Shane Jones considered standing for the deputy leadership, but in the end did not run. Parker stated his preference for Robertson as deputy leader. Shearer did not indicate a preferred deputy. Shearer was viewed as unlikely to win the election; Claire Trevett of The New Zealand Herald originally expected that only Cunliffe and Parker would run for the leader's role, and The Dominion Post Vernon Small wrote that \\"Mr Shearer's bid is seen as a way to lift his profile\\". Political commentator Bryce Edwards said that Cunliffe was the more appealing candidate to the public, and described Parker and Robertson as \\"sort of Phil Goff clones\\". Campaign Labour Party president Moira Coatsworth stated that the leadership contest would be a \\"robust contest of ideas\\", and suggested to the party's caucus that a series of meetings with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities‚ÄîHamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of a capital gains tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe. Outcome and aftermath The election took place on 13 December 2011 and comprised a secret ballot of the thirty- four Labour caucus members, meaning a candidate had to receive the support of eighteen MPs to win. Shearer was elected the party leader, Robertson the deputy leader, Chris Hipkins the senior whip and Darien Fenton the junior whip. Upon election, Shearer stated, \\"I am a fresh face for Labour and I represent a fresh start for New Zealand.\\" Both One News' Espiner and 3 News reported that Shearer received about twenty-two of the thirty-four votes for the leadership position; however, Coatsworth stipulated that the election was secret and that she was the only person who had access to the ballot papers, which were destroyed. Robertson and Jacinda Ardern publicly supported Shearer, and Carmel Sepuloni backed Cunliffe. On 19 December, Shearer announced a reshuffle of the Labour front bench‚ÄîParker replaced Cunliffe in the finance portfolio and number three ranking, Ardern took the number four spot as social development spokesperson, while Cunliffe moved down to number five and gained the economic development portfolio. Clayton Cosgrove (number six) became responsible for state owned enterprises and commerce, Jones (number seven) took regional development and fisheries and Mahuta (number eight) picked up education. Shearer himself took the science and innovation portfolio, while Robertson was made environment spokesperson.

He served as Mayor of the City of Kingston, Ontario for the terms 1841-43; 1846; 1850; 1852‚Äì53 and 1855. Personal life John Counter was born on April 18, 1799 came to Kingston from Devonshire, England with his parents in 1820. He had an older brother George and younger sister Susannah. His parents were John and Susannah. He began his career in the family business as a baker and confectioner, with a bakery located at the corner of Barrie and Clergy Streets. After securing major local contracts to supply bread, he moved on to real estate investments and a variety of transportation and industrial enterprises with the goal to make Kingston a transportation hub. He married Hannah Rhode, aged 17 and they had four children. Within 10 years he lost his brother, two grandchildren, his two sons, and his wife, and finally he died, on October 29, 1862, in virtual obscurity and penniless, at the home of his son-in-law. Business affairs John Counter was an avid businessman, and invested heavily in Kingston‚Äôs commercial district, was involved in the real estate and transportation industries, and owned both a foundry and a sawmill. He was involved in the Calvin Company which proposed a ferry to the railway in Cape Vincent, USA. This was before the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway, and Counter wanted to build and own an infrastructure that could be used to connect the two countries when the railway was finally built. He owned substantial waterfront rights and share in the Penny Bridge, later to become the La Salle Causeway. He also proposed building the Wolfe Island Canal (now abandoned) to provide quick water transportation to and from Cape Vincent. Counter promoted the incorporation of Kingston as a town judging that it would bring increased business and improve property values. This ambition was realized when he signed the petition which finally brought incorporation in 1838. Political career He sought a council seat in the town‚Äôs first election but was defeated. Later, in 1841, he was among the first to propose building a new town hall in 1841. Architect George Brown was selected to design the new town hall, and he travelled to England to borrow ¬£20,000 for its construction. In the same year he organized accommodations for government officials when Kingston became the home of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, giving up his own home to the vice-chancellor, R.S. Jameson, and renting the new offices of the Marine Railway to the government. Upon incorporation in 1846, Counter was elected the city‚Äôs first Mayor, and served an additional four terms due to his popularity and influence. He was instrumental in establishing the Board of Trade in 1839. He was among the people who donated their homes for the new government workers in 1841, and the people who donated the first clock in the City Hall Clock Tower. He supported the Wesleyan Methodists, and donated generously to the building fund for the Victoria Street chapel in 1847. He donated the land for Sydenham Street Church and laid the cornerstone on April 17, 1851. However, he had borrowed heavily to support his numerous interests and also to open the first subdivision in Kingston. He resigned from the office of mayor in June 1855 because his shares in the local gas company were considered to constitute a conflict of interest; and only a few months later, in October 1855, he could not meet a large mortgage payment and his financial obligations forced him into bankruptcy. His house was at Plymouth Square, at the corner of Ontario and Johnson Streets. It was torn down in 1973. Official portrait Counter‚Äôs portrait was painted by American itinerant artist Alvah Bradish while he was visiting Kingston in 1842. Bradish was well known as a portrait painter in Rochester and Detroit, and is known to have undertaken commissions in Toronto and Montreal. Bradish advertised in the Kingston Chronicle in July 1842 that he was at Daley‚Äôs Hotel and offering his \\"professional services for a few weeks\\". Town Council members asked Mayor Counter to sit for his portrait, which was delivered in September 1842 at a cost of ¬£17.10 and was paid for by the councilors personally, not from civic funds. He is depicted wearing a relatively simple Chain of Office and holding a scroll in left hand. It has been loaned to the Art Gallery of Ontario, where they made the existing slides of the painting that have been copied for archival institutions nationwide, and was stored at the City of Kingston facility at 19 Queen Street until it received restoration work in the late 1970s. It currently hangs in the John Counter meeting room at Kingston City Hall.

This step aroused the hostility of the increasingly powerful Cowley family: Robert Cowley, the head of the family, warned Cardinal Wolsey that the book was in fact an effort to persuade King Henry VIII that there was no solution to Ireland's problems but the return to power of Kildare, who was then in temporary disgrace.√ì Math√∫na p.9 Cowley wrote contemptuously that Bathe \\"knows as much about Ireland as I do about Italy\\", and should be \\"touched (i.e. rebuked) for his presumption.√ì Math√∫na p.9 He narrowly escaped being implicated in the rebellion of Silken Thomas, as, in addition to his loyal service to Thomas's father the 9th Earl of Kildare, he was a friend of several of the rebels, and had recently married the daughter of John Burnell of Balgriffin, one of the ringleaders of the rebellion.Ball, p.204 Robert Cowley and his son Walter Cowley continued their attacks on him, arguing that he was unfit to be appointed to even a minor administrative post, for \\"his conduct is disagreeable to the duty of a true subject\\" (presumably this was an accusation of disloyalty during the recent rebellion).O Math√∫na p.9 Fortunately for Bathe, he had some influential friends, including Thomas St. Lawrence, the Attorney General for Ireland, through whom he gained the confidence of the Lord Deputy, Leonard Grey, and was sent by him to report to Thomas Cromwell on the state of Irish government.√ì Math√∫na p.9 He survived Grey's downfall in 1540 and played a considerable role in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.Ball, p.204 He outwardly conformed to the Church of Ireland but is said to have remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church in private.Lennon, Colm Sixteenth-century Ireland- the Incomplete Conquest Gill and Macmillan 1994 pp.313-4 He was appointed the Irish Chief Baron in 1540 and held office under each successive Tudor monarch until his death in 1570, being commended for his good service to the Crown,Ball, p.204 despite some complaints about his slowness in collecting revenue.

The 2011 Eastbourne Borough Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Eastbourne Borough Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats stayed in overall control of the council. Background Before the election the Liberal Democrats controlled the council with 20 seats, compared to 7 for the Conservatives, after taking control at the 2007 election. A total of 94 candidates stood for the 27 seats on the council being contested, while 10 sitting councillors stood down at the election, 8 Liberal Democrats and 2 Conservatives. Important seats for control of the council were expected to be Old Town and Sovereign, as well as Hampden Park and Upperton. Local issues at the election included plans for the redevelopment of the town centre, which was supported across parties, and calls to improve Eastbourne's transport links. However, with the Liberal Democrats in government nationally together with the Conservatives, national government decisions, such as the increase in tuition fees, were also an issue during the election. Election result The Liberal Democrats remained in control of the council with 15 seats, but lost 5 seats to the Conservatives. The Conservatives gained all 3 seats in Sovereign ward and also took the 2 seats the Liberal Democrats had been defending in Upperton. This took the Conservatives to 12 councillors, but the Liberal Democrats held on to all 3 seats in Old Town ward after a recount, to keep a 3-seat council majority. Overall turnout at the election was 44.17%, compared to 42.26% in 2007. Ward results By-elections between 2011 and 2015 A by-election was held in Meads on 31 May 2012 after the resignation of Conservative councillor Nigel Goodyear. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Caroline Ancell with a majority of 1,318 votes over Liberal Democrat Gerard Thompson.

A classic problem in sexual selection is the fixation of alleles that are beneficial under strong selection, thereby eliminating the benefits of mate choice. Genic capture resolves this paradox by suggesting that additive genetic variance of sexually selected traits reflects the genetic variance in total condition. A deleterious mutation anywhere in the genome will adversely affect condition, and thereby adversely affect a condition-dependent sexually selected trait. Genic capture therefore resolves the lek paradox by proposing that recurrent deleterious mutation maintains additive genetic variance in fitness by incorporating the entire mutation load of an individual. Thus any condition-dependent trait \\"captures\\" the overall genetic variance in condition. Rowe and Houle argued that genic capture ensures that good genes will become a central feature of the evolution of any sexually selected trait.  Condition  The key quantity for genic capture is vaguely defined as \\"condition.\\" The hypothesis only defines condition as a quantity that correlates tightly with overall fitness, such that directional selection will always increase average condition over time. Condition should, in general, reflect overall energy acquisition, such that life-history variation reflects differential allocation to survival and sexual signalling. Genetic variation in condition should be very broadly affected by any changes in the genome. Close to equilibrium any mutation should be deleterious, thereby leading to non-zero overall mutation rate, maintaining variance in fitness.  Rowe and Houle's Quantitative Genetic Model  Rowe and Houle's simple model defines a trait as the result of three heritable components, a condition-independent component a, epistatic modification b and condition, suggesting the following function for a trait: T = a + bC where C is the condition of an individual. Loci contributing to C are loosely linked and independent of loci contributing to a and b. Rowe and Houle then find the expected variance of T and ignored higher-order terms (i.e. products of variances): G_T \\\\approx G_a + \\\\bar{b}^2 G_C + \\\\bar{C}^2 G_b where G_T represents the genetic variance in the signal and analogously for other traits. Under directional selection on T, the loci underlying a and b may lose all genetic variance. However, there is no qualitative difference in directional selection on C between stabilizing selection (i.e. no sexual selection) and directional selection on T. Therefore, the second term \\\\bar{b}^2 G_C will remain positive (due to biased mutation) and dominate G_T under sexual selection.  Other Applications  Genic capture can also play a role in accelerating adaptation to new environments.  Comparisons  Genic capture was proposed as a simpler alternative to another theory explaining the lek paradox that proposed that sexual selection creates disruptive selection, i.e. positive selection for genetic variance. Genic capture does not require any particular fitness function.

Uppland Runic Inscription 541 or U 541 is the Rundata catalog listing for a Viking Age memorial runestone which is located at the Husby-Sjuhundra church, which is five kilometers west of Norrt√§lje, Stockholm County, Sweden, and in the historic province of Uppland. The inscription is signed by the runemaster √ñpir. Description The inscription on U 541 consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on a serpent that follows the edge of the stone, which is made of sandstone and is 1.45 meters in height, and then becomes entangled in the center. A cross is near the top of the inscription. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr5, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. This stone is considered to be an excellent representative of an inscription in style Pr5. p. 33. The text indicates that the inscription was carved by the runemaster with the normalized name of √ñpir, who was active in Uppland in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The stone is not in its original position, but was noted as being part of the church during a survey of runestones in the 1800s. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often reused as materials in the construction of churches, walls, and roads. In 1887, the parishioners decided to extract U 541 and a second stone, U 540, from the church and, with financial help provided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, both stones were removed and attached outside the church's northern wall. The runic text does not follow the memorial formula typically used in runestones carved in the late Viking Age, but states \\"here lies\\" followed by the name Sigreifr or S√¶reifr, who was the brother of the unnamed sponsor of the stone. The use of \\"here lies\\" indicates that the stone originally stood over the grave of the deceased, perhaps in a consecrated graveyard since there is a cross on the inscription. It has been noted that the phrase \\"here lies\\" is a direct translation of the Latin phrase \\"HIC IACET\\" that was often used on medieval graves and followed by the name of the deceased. p. 445. Another Viking Age runestone with an inscription that begins with this phrase is U 559 in Malsta. The inscription was signed by the runemaster √ñpir using the Old Norse phrase en √òpi Ä risti runa Ä, which means \\"and √ñpir carved the runes.\\" This exact phrase was also used by √ñpir when signing inscriptions on U 118 in √Ñlvsunda, U 181 in √ñsseby-Garns, the now-lost U 262 in Fresta, U 287 in Vik, U 462 in Pr√§stg√•rden, and U 566 in V√§llings√∂.

Design and development The design of the Super P√©trel has its origins in Claude Tisserand's Hydroplum, a single-seat, wooden amphibian intended for kit building first flown in 1983 and its two-seat, Rotax 532-powered development, the 1986 Hydroplum II. The Soci√©t√© Morbihannaise d'A√©ro Navigation (SMAN) acquired production rights to the latter in 1987, marketing it as the P√©trel, and passed them on to Billie Marine when SMAN ceased trading. Rights were also bought outside France; EDRA began P√©trel production in Brazil in 1989. In 1991 they began producing the improved Paturi, which replaced the P√©trel entirely in 1996 but was itself replaced by the Super P√©trel in 2001. By 2014 the design was being produced by Scoda Aeron√°utica of Ipe√∫na, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The Super P√©trel is of mixed construction, though with much use of composite materials. The wings have tubular aluminium alloy spars combined with PVC foam ribs. The leading edges and wingtips are formed from glass fibre composite, with fabric covering elsewhere. The wings have constant chord and zero sweep, with angled winglet tips; the upper wing has the greater span, less dihedral (2¬∞ 13‚Ä≤ compared with 3¬∞ 26‚Ä≤). There is slight stagger. The Super P√©trel is a single bay biplane with N-form aluminium interplane struts with an additional diagonal strut in each bay from the lower fuselage to the top of the interplane struts. The centre section is supported by a pylon or cabane which also contains the engine mounting. Ailerons are carried only by the upper wings; there are no flaps. The wings can be disassembled in about 30 minutes for transportation by trailer. The single-step hull is an epoxy/carbon fibre foam monocoque, with a carbon fibre boom supporting the all-composite, cruciform and wire braced tail unit. The rear control surfaces are balanced. The cockpit is forward of the central pylon and seats two side-by-side with dual controls. It may be flown open, with just a windscreen, or enclosed by the single piece, forward-hinged canopy. There is a baggage compartment behind the seating. The Super P√©trel has a short legged tricycle undercarriage for land operation; the main units, which have hydraulic brakes, retract upwards through 90¬∞ into the sides of the hull with the wheels exposed but recessed into the underside of the lower wing. The steerable nosewheel retracts forward, leaving the tyre partly exposed as a docking fender. A pair of small, stepped floats on the lower wings below the interplane struts stabilise the aircraft on water. The Super P√©trel is powered by a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912ULS flat-four engine mounted in pusher configuration on the central pylon just below the upper wing. It drives a three-blade Airplast propeller, either a fixed pitch model 175 or an electrically controlled, variable pitch model PV 50. Operational history Seven Super P√©trels appeared on the civil aircraft registers of European countries, excluding Russia in mid-2010. There have also been sales in North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand as well as in Brazil where there were 50 registered by December 2009.

The series primarily revolves around the daily life of the cat Gumball Watterson and his family‚Äîadoptive brother Darwin, sister Anais, and parents Nicole and Richard. Gumball's fellow Elmore Junior High students also have frequent recurring roles throughout the series. Creator Ben Bocquelet conceived The Amazing World of Gumball in 2007 while working as a development artist for Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe, and based several of its characters on previous sketches characters he had created for commercials. Main characters Gumball Watterson Gumball Tristopher Watterson, born Zach Watterson, (voiced by Logan Grove on seasons 1-3, Jacob Hopkins on seasons 3-5, Nicolas Cantu in season five to six), and Duke Cutler (Gumball Chronicles: The Curse of Elmore) is the protagonist of the series. He is a 12-year-old mischievous blue cat who lives with his family in the fictional California city of Elmore. He attends Elmore Junior High in the seventh grade with his adoptive brother Darwin, who is 10 years old. Often finding himself and Darwin in various antics which end up getting them into trouble, episodes in the series' first season characterized Gumball as well- meaning in his actions, but with naive tendencies; throughout the show's progression, he has since established himself as a more serious character capable of logical thinking and prone to sarcasm. In \\"The Name\\", it was discovered that his real name was \\"Zach\\", however, this caused him to develop a split personality, though he was seemingly cured at the end of the episode, by changing his name to Gumball. Gumball has a crush on his classmate Penny Fitzgerald, who in turn shares the same feelings for him. They initially struggle to properly express their feelings for each other until the episode \\"The Shell\\", where he finally works up the nerve to express his feelings to her after she reveals her true form, and they begin dating. In the premiere of season 3 it is revealed that Gumball and Darwin are part of a small fraction of people who don't age past a certain point, which by the end of the episode causes them to regress to a point slightly before puberty. Despite occasional lapses in judgment, Gumball is loyal, straightforward, and a good-natured person at heart. He is protective of his loved ones, but has a large ego, often causing him to react out of proportion to criticism or out of jealousy. Darwin Watterson Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemius Watterson, III (voiced by Kwesi Boakye on seasons 1-3, Terrell Ransom Jr. on seasons 3-5, Donielle T. Hansley Jr. on seasons 5-6, and Christian J. Simon on season 6) is a 10 year old orange goldfish who is Gumball's best friend adopted by the Watterson family. Initially given to Gumball as a pet, Darwin later sprouted legs and subsequently became a full member of the Watterson family. The series' first season depicted Darwin with a tendency to be more naive and gullible than others, due to his sudden introduction into the world; subsequent seasons established his more serious side, including the ability to think logically and, in \\"The Words\\", speak his mind freely. Although Gumball can sometimes be a negative influence on him, Darwin is extremely loyal to Gumball and often helps him out of sticky situations. He is sometimes shown to not exhibit normal behaviour, such as calling his adoptive parents Mr. Dad and Mrs. Mom. In Season 4, Darwin began showing heavy feelings for Carrie Krueger. In Season 5, they officially began dating. Anais Watterson Anais Rosie Watterson (voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski), a pink rabbit, is Gumball and Darwin's precocious 4-year-old sister. She is one grade above her brothers, as revealed in \\"The Others\\". Gumball resents the fact that she is always telling him what to do, but nonetheless loves her and acknowledges her good intentions. Although impatient with her brother, she often tags along with him on his misadventures as a voice of reason, usually having to help Gumball out of situations caused by these misadventures. She has, however, been shown to not be above manipulating her family to get what she wants. Despite her intellectualism, she still shows typical childlike behavior, including an obsession with the children's television character Daisy the Donkey, and has tried to fit in with Gumball and Darwin on numerous occasions. She attends eighth grade at Elmore Junior High, which Gumball and Darwin are unaware of due to them \\"filtering\\" out anyone or anything that isn't part of their lives. Nicole Watterson Doctor Nicole Watterson (n√©e Senicourt) (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a 43 year old cat and the mother of Gumball, Darwin, and Anais. A workaholic, she is often bossy, over-stressed, and possesses a short temper. She acts as a guide to her sons when they get in a tough spot with their misadventures. Competitive by nature, Nicole is a master martial artist, and is very agile and flexible. Despite her bossy, over-stressed, and short- tempered personality, she is sweet and shows much affection for her family, keeping them safe as much as she can. She is also very protective of her family, as seen in \\"The Ape.\\" Since she is the only truly responsible member of the family, Nicole does most of the household chores, and in addition, works long hours at the Rainbow Factory just to put food on the table. Unfortunately, Nicole also suffers from a tremendous amount of emotional stress because of her many duties, and as such, is quite strict and demanding whenever upset. In fact, on one occasion, Gumball decides it would be easier to face Tina than an angry Nicole. Despite all that, Nicole is still a good mother and person, and she still loves her family very much, especially her son, Gumball. Much of her issues stem from her hard pushing parents who gave her the first name Doctor in the hopes that she will become one later on in life. Nicole is also occasionally vindictive, as was shown in the episode \\"The Ape,\\" after Miss Simian called her and her family \\"losers.\\" On top of this, she is also very resourceful and inventive, a trait she most likely passed on to her daughter Anais, who has demonstrated similar talents. She usually punishes her sons Gumball and Darwin by grounding them when they do something wrong, such as in \\"The Nobody\\" which Nicole grounds her sons by making them staying in their room and bans them from watching TV, playing the internet, going to the museum after they being framed for stealing things around the house. Winning seems to be a necessity for her at times, most likely due to her mother's ambition for her to succeed in her youth. Though, despite her somewhat ruthless faults, she can accept defeat, acknowledge her mistakes, and even find humor in them. As shown in \\"The Parents\\", Nicole's parents have very high expectation for her, which explains her awkward first name \\"Doctor\\" and her short temper due to the tremendous stress they would put on her as a child. Richard Watterson Richard Buckley Watterson (voiced by Dan Russell) is a 43-year-old anthropomorphic pink rabbit. He is the father of Gumball, Darwin and Anais. Being a stay-at-home dad, he spends most of his time sleeping, watching TV, and playing video games. As revealed in the episode \\"The Lady\\" Richard also dresses up as a woman (Samantha) and spends the day with his girlfriends (parodying The Golden Girls), but it is later revealed that all of them are men who couldn't seem to make friends with other men and decide to continue their friendship as sassy old women. He has been \\"the laziest person in Elmore\\" for 13 years and has a large appetite and is a voracious eater. Richard often serves as a third-wheel to his sons' misadventures and cares deeply for his family despite his lethargic nature. He can be very naive at some times and may be called \\"dumb\\" or similar words by other characters throughout the series. In the episode \\"The Job\\" it appears that Richard can't hold a job or else the universe will be destroyed which is why he must remain unemployed. Richard is the father figure in the Watterson family but doesn't seem to possess any responsibility or common sense. He is very childlike and lazy and is not a good role model for his children either. However, Richard genuinely loves his family, and has good intentions, despite his severe lack of intelligence and maturity as seen especially in \\"The Prank\\" and \\"The Authority.\\" He also greatly enjoys eating, and as a result, he is overweight. His obsession with food can sometimes be his undoing, such as when he was supposed to help his wife in \\"The Spoon,\\" but he ends up licking a sausage on the floor instead. He can also sense when there is toast nearby, as seen in \\"The Recipe.\\" Due to his continuous hunger, he gained an instinctive- like nature, as seen in \\"The Game\\" and many other episodes, where he runs toward any food he sees. Richard is very childish and has been seen exhibiting childish behaviors in several episodes, which include believing in ghosts, joining in some of Gumball's misadventures, believing in Santa Claus, and many others. He also has a very hypocritical sense of humor. He enjoys pulling pranks and laughing at people, but hates it when others prank or laugh at him, saying that \\"it's only funny when it happens to someone else.\\" The motive for Richard's personality was shown in \\"The Authority,\\" where it was revealed that Granny Jojo sheltered Richard his entire life, leading him to grow up as an unintelligent and lazy person. In \\"The Man,\\" it was revealed that Richard's father walked out on him when he was young, claiming he was going out to buy some milk. Richard still believed it out of denial, even into his adult life. Despite his incompetency and childishness, Richard can occasionally spout out some good advice. In \\"The Gift,\\" he was the one telling his sons to give Masami friendship (which they later did), and he manages to tell Nicole some very good, philosophical advice about life. It is also possible that Richard has a sufficiently sized brain, just he neglects to use it. As seen in \\"The Fuss\\" when he tried to think, a large cramping mass grew rapidly in size and made his veins stand out on his head. According to Ben Bocquelet, his height is 6‚Äô2‚Äù (1.88 m). Supporting/Recurring characters Elmore Junior High students Several Elmore Junior High students gathered in the school cafeteria. The series features a variety of different animals and objects for characters such as Gumball and his classmates. =Penny Fitzgerald= Penny Fitzgerald (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a shape-shifting fairy (formerly a peanut with antlers) and following the events of the episode \\"The Shell\\", Gumball's girlfriend. Their mutual affection and incapability of expressing their feelings for one another was a running theme in the series until \\"The Shell\\", where Gumball finally directly reveals his feelings for her and they have their first kiss in the woods. In the same episode, it is revealed that underneath Penny's shell lies a yellow, fairy-like self which shape-shifts based on her emotional state. Penny's father Patrick, the head of a local construction company, is extremely overprotective of his daughter, and does not trust Gumball until he saves her from getting run over by his own car in the episode \\"The Knights\\" and \\"The Shell\\" for helping his daughter through her emotions. She is a member of the Elmore Junior High cheerleading and synchronized swimming teams. =Rob= Rob (voiced by Charles Philipp) was one of the more prominent Elmore Junior High students, and later on in the series, Rob is the main antagonist and Gumball's arch-enemy. Rob is formerly a tall blue cyclops, and upon exposure to the Void, he turns into a disfigured, polygonal, white cyclops. He tries to have some friendly conversation with Gumball and Darwin in \\"The Pony\\", only to discover ‚Äì much to his annoyance ‚Äì that the two do not even know his name. He is later seen in the Void of all the world's mistakes in the episode \\"The Void\\". However, in \\"The Nobody\\", he manages to escape the void, becoming disfigured in the process, takes residence in the Wattersons' basement, and frames Gumball and Darwin for stealing things around the house. As a result, he remembers that Gumball and Darwin left him, and swears revenge on them for not noticing him. In \\"The Bus\\", he attempts to blow up everybody and the hijacked bus up as well, but his plans were foiled thanks to Gumball and Richard. In \\"The Ex\\", it is seen that Banana Joe was his new nemesis. But toward the end he resumes his hatred with Gumball. In \\"The Inquisition\\" Rob disguises himself as Superintendent Evil, and begins transforming the students and staff of Elmore Junior High into real people, though Gumball and Darwin restore everyone to normal, and Tina beats Rob up when he tries to explain his motives and knocks him out. The ending shows Rob‚Äôs actions were part of an attempt to save everyone from an unknown threat, and Rob, now alone, is sucked into the Void along with the school. The series ends on a freeze frame of Rob falling into the Void. =Carrie Krueger= Carrie Krueger (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is a ghost who lives in a malevolent mansion and \\"enjoys being depressed\\". She can teleport and possess living bodies, and in \\"The Ghost\\" she uses the latter ability on Gumball so she can feel the satisfaction of being able to eat again. In \\"Halloween\\", she turns the Watterson siblings into ghosts so they can attend a ghost-exclusive Halloween party at her mansion, and in the process almost gets them trapped in the Underworld. Carrie is the daughter of a mortal man who formed a romantic relationship with a female ghost and, as a result of using a forbidden spell, was cursed to live a lonely existence inside mirrors until Carries sets his soul free in \\"The Mirror\\" and they are happily reunited. In \\"The Matchmaker\\", she and Darwin become a couple. Carrie's last name is a reference to Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. =Tobias Wilson= Tobias Wilson (voiced by Rupert Degas, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a multicolored, cloud- shaped humanoid who is heavily interested in sports and possesses an overbearing self-confidence. He thinks of himself as a heavily built jock, despite actually being rather weak, and appears to be quite wealthy. He makes his debut appearance in \\"The Third\\", where Gumball and Darwin pay him twenty dollars to become their friend. In \\"The Knights\\", Tobias holds a mock medieval battle with Gumball for the affection of Penny. Despite this, he has been seen hanging out with Gumball and Darwin on several occasions, including having a starring role in one of the duo's home movies. He has an older sister, Rachel (voiced by Jessica McDonald), who considers herself of higher status than Tobias and his \\"dweeb loser baby friends\\". =Banana Joe= Joseph \\"Banana Joe\\" A. Banana (voiced by Mic Graves) is a hyperactive banana and the class clown of Gumball's Elmore Junior High class, with the tendency to crack a joke whenever possible. His jokes often serve as a source of irritation to others, with Gumball describing him as a \\"one-trick pony\\" in his debut appearance. While he is often classified as the class clown, he can be a bully, usually to Gumball and Darwin. He is killed by Rob in \\"The Rerun\\" but this event was erased from the timeline by Rob. He also has an active Elmore Stream account where he posts a variety of videos. Masami Yoshida Masami Yoshida (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is a living cloud who is the wealthy daughter of the Rainbow Factory's owner. Spoiled by her parents, she is tantrum-prone and has apparently threatened to have her classmates' parents fired if she doesn't have her way; in \\"The Gift\\", several of her classmates panic about getting her a perfect birthday gift out of fear of such a scenario, though it is later indicated that this has never actually happened and she admits that she simply wants be a treated like a normal person. When angry, she has the ability to develop into a full storm cloud capable of causing massive amounts of damage. The episode \\"The Storm\\" reveals her unrequited crush on Alan, and she manipulates Gumball into getting the two together, albeit temporarily. =Bobert= Bobert (voiced by Kerry Shale) is a robot who is one of the smartest students at Elmore Junior High but constantly struggles to understand emotion and develop a social life. He is the primary focus of the episode \\"The Robot\\", where Darwin and Gumball's efforts to help him fit in ultimately end with him stealing Gumball's identity. Multiple times in the series, he has showcased his ability to transform into a larger form by triggering his \\"defense mode\\". In the episode \\"The Bet\\", he is forced to become Gumball's personal slave for a day after losing a bet. Bobert is also the primary focus of the episode \\"The Upgrade\\", where he has an update (BS8) with his software that Gumball and Darwin struggle getting used to and go to the Bobert Store to get a downgrade. The manager gave them a new Bobert and sent old Bobert on a plane with a bunch of random old junk. Gumball and Darwin use new Bobert to fly up to the plane to get old Bobert back. They open the hatch in the back of the plane and everything falls out including Bobert. While falling Gumball finds Bobert's original os(BS7) disc and installs it. At the last minute before impact Bobert boots ups up and saves them from smashing into the ground. =Sarah G. Lato= Sarah G. Lato (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is a yellow ice cream cone who debuted in \\"The Banana\\" as a transferee to Elmore Junior High and makes her first major role in \\"The Sweaters\\", where she attempts to defend Gumball and Darwin from two uptight human students, only to lead them into more trouble. In \\"The Fan\\", she is depicted as an obsessive fan of Gumball and Darwin. =Leslie= Leslie (voiced by Kerry Shale) is an effeminate, friendly daisy who plays flute in the school band and can often be found hanging around the girls. He is Penny's cousin, and Gumball's mistaken assumption that he is her boyfriend is his major source of jealousy in the episode \\"The Flower\\". =Alan Keane= Alan Keane (voiced by Kerry Shale, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a teal-colored balloon who, despite their physical incompatibility, is in a romantic relationship with Carmen and sits at lunch with her. He is overly nice and even-tempered, never showing anger or raising his voice even when the subject of insults or physical attacks, much to the annoyance of his classmates. Being filled with helium, Alan regularly speaks in a high-pitched voice. In \\"The Photo\\", Gumball envies him for having a beautiful face. Alan rebuffs this, but Gumball replies: \\"Dude, even your mole looks better than me\\". In \\"The Vision\\" it is revealed Alan secretly plans to take over the world and rule it as a dictator, brainwashing people to eradicate sadness. After discovering this, Gumball and Darwin attempt to assassinate Alan, which they succeed in after many failed attempts ‚Äì though he reappears in subsequent episodes without any explanation. It was shown in \\"The Faith\\" that the world goes through chaos if Alan stops his kindness. =Carmen= Carmen (voiced by Teresa Gallagher, season 1; Alix Wilton Regan, season 2 onward) is a small green cactus who is considered to be a leader among her female classmates. She is in a relationship with her balloon classmate Alan, though the danger of her spikes bursting him is a constant hindrance. Their relationship in the cafeteria annoys their classmates, who are frequently annoyed by their romantic gestures and deem them \\"too perfect\\" and Alan interrupts and yells at Gumball. In \\"The Storm\\", Carmen and Alan are baby talking in the lunch room when everyone comments they are \\"too perfect\\". Later Gumball and Darwin see Carmen crying and she says it's because her and Alan's relationship is too boring so she gets Gumball to flirt with her then kiss her. Alan gets jealous and ends up saying he loves her so much that he wants her to be happy even if it isn't with him. Gumball tells him he needs to get back into dating to show Carmen he's moved on. Alan reluctantly agrees and ends up dating Masami. Masami had given Gumball the plan that Carmen would get jealous and try to get him back but really only wanted to date Alan. Gumball tries to tell Masami her plan didn't work when she informed him it worked perfectly cause now her and Alan were dating. Gumball is gonna go tell everyone of her plan but Masami turns into a huge storm and rampages through the school taking Alan with her. Everyone chases them and then Alan bravely confronts Masami and states his feelings for Carmen. In \\"The Best,\\" it is shown that Carmen was once a trouble making student at her old school, so much so that she ended up on the news. Carmen is also one of the cheerleaders for her school. She is best friends with Penny Fitzgerald, Sarah, and Molly. =Teri= Teri (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a hypochondriac paper bear usually found in the nurse's office. Although somewhat self-absorbed and paranoid, she is very nice and is one of the school's cheerleaders. Her mother works as a doctor and maintains a website discussing the dangers of germs. =Hector J√∂tunheim= Hector J√∂tunheim (voiced by Kerry Shale) is a gentle, Bigfoot-like giant who is the largest student in Elmore Junior High, to the point that only his legs and feet are seen on-screen. Hector is the subject of the episode \\"The Colossus\\", where his mother ‚Äì a witch who works as a cleaning lady ‚Äì reveals that he can be dangerous if he expresses too much emotion, such as anger, sadness or excitement. In the same episode, he goes on a rampage around Elmore after Gumball and Darwin, unaware of Hector's need to control his emotions, describe him as being boring. His surname is a reference to J√∂tunheimr, the homeland of giants in Norse mythology. =Tina Rex= Tina Rex (voiced by Dan Russell, season 1; Stefan Ashton Frank, season 2 onward) is a Tyrannosaurus who lives in the Elmore city junkyard, and who is Elmore Junior High's most notorious bully. She often picks on her fellow schoolmates, especially Gumball, and has her own gang of bullies which includes Jamie and, to his reluctance, Anton. As a dinosaur, she is one of the strongest students in school, contributing to her fearsome and aggressive reputation. Despite this, she also has a softer side not only in general, but also for Gumball; in the episode \\"The Fight\\" she reveals that she considers him to be a friend. Her Cartoon Network biography suggests that she might have animosity toward others because she is \\"angry at the world for not noticing her femininity\\". =Idaho= Idaho (voiced by Kerry Shale, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a free-spirited potato from the rural countryside with old-fashioned beliefs, and is one of the less popular students of Elmore Junior High. In \\"The Bumpkin\\", Gumball, disillusioned with his suburban lifestyle, seeks Idaho's help in teaching his family how to live a simple lifestyle. However, Gumball eventually finds himself unable to resist his modern lifestyle, and one night Idaho walks in on him indulging in video games and junk food. Gumball talks him into trying out his modern lifestyle and eventually sends him into severe culture shock, which his rural family cure by burying him in soil. =Anton= Anton (voiced by Lewis MacLeod in ‚ÄúThe Dress‚Äù and Tony Hull in every other each appearance) is a simple-minded piece of toast who was forcibly drafted into Tina's gang despite his unwillingness to do so, and only appeases them to avoid their anger. He is prone to being killed in various freak accidents, only to be resurrected by his parents after each occasion with a toaster which creates a new copy of him. =Juke= Juke (voiced by Hugo Harrison, music by Beatbox Hobbit) is a native of the continent of Boomboxemburg who moved to Elmore, and is, as described by Gumball, a \\"boombox head\\" who speaks entirely in beatboxing. In \\"The Boombox\\", he spoke it. As a result, nobody in Elmore Junior High can understand him. He is able to speak comprehensible English if he is switched from \\"Music Mode\\" to \\"Voice Mode\\" through a switch on the back of his head, but his arms are too short to reach it and his attempts to communicate this fact to others end in failure. =Sussie= Sussie (face by Aurelie Charbonnier, voiced by Fergus Craig Season 3 until end of Season 4, voiced by Charbonnier Season 5 onwards and Season 1, Ben Bocquelet voiced her screaming, yelling, and laughing Season 2 onward) is an upside-down chin with googly eyes and puppet-like characteristics who debuted in the episode ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù. She is talkative, odd, and obnoxious, and as a result is generally avoided by the rest of her classmates. She was the main problem for Darwin in \\"The Words\\". =Clayton= Clayton (voiced by Rupert Degas in ‚ÄúThe Party‚Äù, Kwesi Boakye in ‚ÄúThe Dress‚Äù; Max Cazier, season 2 onward) is a red ball of clay who is a compulsive liar, with a tendency of making up absurd stories about himself. In the episode \\"The Skull\\", Clayton begins an on-and-off friendship with Gumball and Darwin, and displays his ability to transform into different people and objects. At the end of the episode, he tells Principal Brown the truth for the first time. In \\"The Move\\" he reveals that he lies because he is insecure and feels like a loser, though Gumball and Darwin help him and presumably cure his lying habit. =Rachel Wilson= Rachel Wilson (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is Tobias' older sister, who disgusts his \\"dweeb loser baby friends.\\" In \\"The Party\\", however, after her friends don't show up to the party Tobias invited all of Elmore Junior High to, Darwin helps her feel better and fixes the trashed house, so she kisses Darwin. The directing staff did not like the character, so Rachel made a handful of cameos in the second season before being dropped from the show. Rachel does make a brief cameo in a flashback in \\"The Matchmaker\\". =Ocho= Harry \\"Ocho\\" Tootmorsel (voiced by Max Cazier) is a Space Invaders-esque 8-bit spider and a generally friendly person, but often overreacts to what people say about him in a negative manner, such as to Darwin and Gumball after the latter accidentally sends him an insulting text message. In the show's first season, he spoke solely in video game blips; since the second season, however, he has started speaking in comprehensible, albeit distorted, English. In season five, his real name is revealed to be Harry Tootmorsel, a name that he only tells to his most trusted friends. His uncles are Mario and Sonic. =The Eggheads= Colin and Felix (voiced by Kerry Shale for Colin and Rupert Degas in season 1 and Hugo Harrison in season 2 onward for Felix) are a pair of egg brothers who are two of the most intelligent students and bullies at Elmore Junior High, speaking in English accents and considering themselves to be much smarter than their classmates. =Jamie Russo= Jamie Russo (voiced by Jessica McDonald, seasons 1‚Äì2; Maria Teresa Creasey, season 3 onward) is a \\"half-cow, half- troglodyte\\" creature who is a bully of Elmore Junior High and member of Tina's gang. As a result of Miss Simian holding her back a year, she has grown resentful of her new classmates and of authority in general. Her mother is Elmore Junior High's gym coach, whom she listens to and respects despite her disapproval towards Jamie's bullying. =William= William (internal monologue narrated by Mic Graves) is a flying eyeball who is Miss Simian's personal spy and only talks when reporting information to her. The episode \\"The Voice\\" reveals that he has psychic abilities, which he uses to wreak havoc on Gumball and Darwin after they accidentally block him on the social networking site Elmore Plus. The same episode shows that he actually expresses a desire to interact with his classmates, which is hindered by his lack of a mouth; his inner thoughts are narrated to the viewers. =Molly Collins= Molly Collins (voiced by Jessica McDonald) is a shy sauropod who is a member of the cheerleading team and, as shown in \\"The Pressure\\", the owner of a treehouse where she and the other girls hang out in. She made several appearances in the show's first season, but was absent for the entire second season; no reason was given for her disappearance until the third-season episode \\"The Void\\", where Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Small realize that all traces of Molly have vanished and nobody else seems to have any memory of her. Investigating further, they eventually open up a portal at the former location of Molly's home and are sucked into a void containing \\"all the mistakes the world has ever made\\", where they find and rescue her. =Hot Dog Guy= Hot Dog Guy (voiced by Alex Jordan) is a hot dog who, when in contact, is awkward with Gumball. He made periodic appearances prior to the episode \\"The Hug\\", when Gumball hugs him several times to prove he is not predictable to Darwin. In \\"The Awkwardness,\\" Gumball wants to buy ketchup for a hot dog before running into the Hot Dog Guy many other times in the episode. In \\"The Nest\\" he is seemingly eaten by the carnivorous baby turtles, but came back. His butt exploded in ‚ÄúThe Castle‚Äù. =Clare Cooper= Clare Cooper (voiced by Naomi McDonald) is an emo girl who is a human. She hates Gumball and Darwin, but is friends with Penny and Anais.

Elmore Junior High staff =Principal Brown= Principal Nigel Brown (voiced by Steve Furst) is a furry slug who is Elmore Junior High's principal and Ms. Simian's love interest. He likes to lick Ms. Simian's hair, and likes to sing while being held by her. He teaches music, judges cheerleader tryouts, leads the school's band, and is a substitute sports teacher. He used to, along with Mr. Small and Ms. Simian, teach gym until Russo got her job. His Cartoon Network biography states that their romance has been detrimental to his profession, leaving him incapable of properly running Elmore Junior High. In \\"The Fraud\\", it is revealed that Principal Brown has worked as a principal for 20 years with a fake diploma. In ‚ÄúThe Grades‚Äù Principal Brown hints at having a shady past, where it is implied that he is on the run from the FBI and a closet furry, as well as having a face on the back of his head similar to that of Quirinus Quirell and Lord Voldemort. Principal Brown makes numerous budget cuts, filling vending machines with pictures of food and renting half the school out to a prison, among other things. =Ms. Simian= Ms. Lucy Simian (voiced by Lewis MacLeod, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a 2 million year old baboon and the sadistic teacher of Gumball and Darwin's class as well as a major antagonist. She takes great pleasure in giving her students pop quizzes and being generally unpleasant, and as such is widely reviled by the entire school body, save for Principal Brown, her love interest. She has a generally antagonistic relationship with Gumball, often suspecting him of being nothing but a troublemaker, but once faked friendship with the Wattersons in order to win a teacher's appreciation award, and offered a genuine apology to Gumball and Darwin for her rash judgement against them in \\"The Apology\\". Her face intentionally resembles that of the Grim Reaper. =Mr. Small= Mr. Steve Small (voiced by Adam Long) is the Elmore Junior High guidance counselor, a cloud man who is interested in New Age culture and possesses hippie-like qualities in terms of appearance and behavior. Mr. Small's eccentric and unconventional teaching methods are usually more confusing to the children than helpful, and despite his good intentions they often leave his office confused and not any better, if not worse from the time they entered. It is revealed in the episode \\"The Fraud\\" that he is not a U.S. citizen, though it is unclear if he was merely born elsewhere or renounced his citizenship. He also mentions he lost his love Janice, which in the episode \\"The Void,\\" is revealed to be a purple van that runs on \\"good vibes.\\" Several episodes show that he indulges in questionable practices rather than normal activities; he goes on a diet of raw sunlight, his attempts to cure Gumball and Darwin traumatize them, uses herbal teas Implied to be a type of drug, and he often uses alternative medicine. His mannerisms are similar to those of Mr. Van Driessen from Beavis and Butt-head. =Rockwell ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Robinson= Rockwell ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Robinson (voiced by Lewis MacLeod in season 1, Hugo Harold-Harrison in season 2, and Simon Lipkin in seasons 3-6) is an orange, fuzzy 27 year old Muppet-like character who performs various odd jobs around Elmore Junior High, mostly as the janitor, but also as a cafeteria worker, a school bus driver, and, in \\"The Curse\\", the clerk at the lost and found office. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, the Wattersons' next-door neighbors, and is generally good-natured and gets along with the children well. =Coach Russo= Coach Russo (voiced by Dan Russell) is a large, pink 3-dimensional cube who is Jamie's mother. The newest member of the faculty, she works to ensure that all of the students are fit like her daughter. She makes her debut appearance in \\"The Coach\\" and speaks in a consistently deadpan tone, never showing emotion facially or in her speech. =Mr. Corneille= Mr. Moonchild Corneille (voiced by Simon Lipkin) is a frog and the 8th grade teacher of geography at Elmore Junior High. He always pretends to be sophisticated, but is a fake personality. As of ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù, he is in a relationship with Joan Markham, the school's nurse. He also has his picture on all of his history books. =Joan Markham= Joan Markham (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is Elmore Junior High's nurse. She is in a relationship with Mr. Corneille, starting in ‚ÄúThe Cage‚Äù. She hates her job because Gumball and Darwin try unconvincing excuses to get sick notes and get out of gym class, Teri comes to her office every day, Lucy is rude to her, and she does not know how to help the students because most of them have biologies she has no clue how to work with. She is always sarcastic because of this, and sometimes tries to do the least work possible to help her students. She is also a paramedic, doctor, and nurse at a hospital, even though she hates her jobs. She has long blonde hair under her hat. Other Watterson family members =Frankie Watterson= Frankie Watterson (voiced by Richard \\"Rich\\" Fulcher) is a conman rat and the ex-husband of Granny Jojo and the father of Richard who abandoned them a long time ago. In \\"The Signature\\", after his apartment was re-possessed due to his overdue rent, he returns to the Watterson household, and he reunited with Richard, only to scam him of taking over the house. The Wattersons stop him, while Frankie looks back to the day he left his son. He then decides to reunite the whole Watterson family. In \\"The Outside\\", Frankie comes for a visit, but gets treated like a prisoner, because of a misunderstanding. =Joanna Watterson= Granny Jojo (voiced by Sandra Dickinson) is the Watterson children's grandmother and also Richard's mother. She is a 66 year old pink rabbit who speaks in a New York accent. In the season 1 episode \\"The Kiss\\", she is depicted as a general annoyance to the family, doing nothing but watching police dramas on television, and with Nicole and Richard always leaving the house whenever she makes a visit. She was previously married to a traveling conman named Frankie Watterson, who abandoned her and a young Richard under the pretense of going out to buy milk; she later remarries to Louie, a local Elmore senior citizen, in \\"The Signature\\", despite Richard's initial disapproval. =Louie Watterson= Louie Watterson (voiced by Shane Rimmer) is a 72 year old black mouse and a former member of a close-knit crew of Elmore senior citizens which includes Betty, Donald, and Marvin Finkleheimer. In \\"The Man\\" it is revealed that he was dating Joanna Watterson, whom he marries in \\"The Signature\\", making him Richard's stepfather and Gumball, Darwin, and Anais' stepgrandfather. Other characters =Mr. and Mrs. Robinson= Gaylord and Margaret Robinson (Mr. Robinson voiced by Stefan Ashton Frank and Mrs. Robinson voiced by Teresa Gallagher) are the Wattersons' stuck-up, grouchy, 55-year-old next door neighbors, and Rocky's parents. They are grey Muppet-like characters and hate their neighbors with a passion. Mr. Robinson deeply despises Gumball and Darwin in Season 1 and ‚ÄúThe Sale‚Äù for annoying him all the time; the boys, however, look up to him as their idol. In later episodes, he warms up to them somewhat and treats them better, though they still irritate him. Mrs. Robinson is, however, pure evil and enjoys causing suffering for no reason. Their constant bickering is a focal point of their relationship, and they actually enjoy doing so. Mr. Robinson owns a prized 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville Convertible which often ends up getting damaged by the Wattersons as a running gag, much to his annoyance. =Banana Barbara= Banana Barbara (voiced by Sandra Searles Dickinson, Naomi McDonald) is a recurring character and the mother of Banana Joe. She plays a major role throughout the events that establish the ending episode of \\"The Inquisition\\". She is best known for being able to predict the future in her various paintings. In \\"The Future\\", she plays a role in which Rob kidnaps her and tries to force her to paint what the future is like, which leads up to the ending of \\"The Inquisition\\". = Harold Wilson = Harold Wilson (voiced by Kerry Shale) is the father of Tobias Wilson and a psychotherapist. He seems to have been making fun of Richard Watterson ever since he played a prank on him in high school, as seen in \\"The Cycle.\\" Harold is a fairly despicable person, at one point abandoning his wife for a younger woman when he believes he is a billionaire and conning his patients into paying for his home renovations. = Garry Hedges = Garry Hedges (voiced by Dan Russel) is the neighbor of Gumball. He is a purple moose with large antlers. Even is commonly seen wearing a pale brown hat, green sweater with blue slacks. In the episode \\"The Neighbor\\", Gumball and Darwin attempt to find out his name. It is revealed that his name was Harry Gedges before he joined the Witness Protection Program after he testified for a group of people. He only switched the two letters in his name (Harry Gedges ‚Üí Garry Hedges) =Larry Needlemeyer= Larry Needlemeyer (voiced by Kerry Shale) is an origami rock, who works at almost every establishment in Elmore, including the grocery store, the gas station, convenience store, several fast food restaurants and the DVD rental shop amongst other places. He had previously been known as \\"Lazy Larry\\", the laziest person in Elmore, until he lost his title to Richard 13 years prior to the start of the series and subsequently morphed into a hard worker. Larry was generally distrusting of the Wattersons, as they often get him into trouble at his various occupations until \\"The Pizza\\". It was revealed that he works everywhere just to pay the damages the Wattersons created that involves him. He has a girlfriend named Karen, who the Wattersons damage his relationship with as a running gag, but they may not be together anymore, as in ‚ÄúThe Boredom‚Äù Karen says she has a daughter who may be with a different guy, and in ‚ÄúThe Love‚Äù, Melted Cheese Guy almost asks her out. The daughter may have been with Larry or before she met Larry, and Melted Cheese Guy could simply not have known she was dating Larry. =Patrick Fitzgerald= Patrick Fitzgerald (voiced by Dan Russell) is Penny's father. He is the father figure of the Fitzgeralds. Unlike Nicole, he did not approve of Gumball and Penny's relationship at first, until \\"The Shell\\". Patrick is very protective of his family, especially Penny, and has a very serious demeanor. In \\"The Shell,\\" the reasoning for his over-protectiveness is revealed to be due to the family's shape-shifting abilities. He believed that the world would perceive them as monsters without their shells. He correctly predicted that Penny was too unstable‚Äî she ended up going on a shape-shifting rampage throughout the town, changing into a progressively more monstrous form every time someone called her a monster. =Marvin Finkleheimer= Marvin Finkleheimer (voiced by Dan Russell) is an 80-year-old red bean who lives at a house and likes to beat kids with his cane on the skull if they help him across the street. In the episode \\"The Watch\\", he feuds with Gumball and Darwin over possession of a gold watch, an heirloom which the Wattersons and Finkleheimers have feuded over for several generations. Towards the end of the episode, the two sides chase each other to claim the watch and cash it in for its $700 value. Marvin is eaten by the Evil Turtles in \\"the Nest\\", but he somehow escaped their stomach and, as Kip said, made a full recovery. In Season 1, he was originally going to be named Bert, when he is called that by the yellow old man, Donald, and Louie but that was changed/retconned by the writers. =Doughnut Sheriff= Doughnut Sheriff (voiced by Lewis MacLeod in season 1, and Dan Russell in season 2 onwards) is a pink-frosted doughnut who, as his name suggests, is an officer in Elmore's police force. He is rather oblivious and has displayed incompetency on the job, often finding himself involved in the Watterson's antics. He was a main character in the episode ‚ÄúThe Law‚Äù where he tried to run over men, women, children, senior citizens, and babies and Gumball and Darwin cheered him on. =Sal Left Thumb= Sal Left Thumb (voiced by Kerry Shale) is one of Elmore's most wanted criminals, a walking fingerprint whose weapon of choice is a rusty spoon. He is often seen robbing the local convenience store, and in \\"The Spoon\\" Gumball and Darwin become unwitting accomplices in one of his crimes. He was killed in \\"The Bumpkin\\", but came back. =Felicity and Billy Parham= Felicity Parham (voiced by Sandra Searles Dickinson, and Teresa Gallagher in \\"The Kids\\") is an orange background character on the show along with her blue son William Geoffrey \\"Billy\\" Fitzgerald Kitchener Parham, III (as shown in \\"The Extras). Billy appears to be an intelligent boy who usually just asks his mother random questions about life. After Season 3, he gained more of an active role and was rejected from Anais Watterson's heart. So, he then became a big mouthed, smart aleck-like individual. Billy's dad is also mentioned. =Mr. Rex= Mr. Rex is Tina Rex's father. He loves to eat invaders at home. He fought with Nicole when she tried to speak with him about the fight that Tina had with Gumball. His true appearance was originally written to be shown in the episode \\"The Rex\\" where it might have been shown how he came back to life, but this episode was ultimately cancelled and not produced, but later his true appearance is revealed in \\"The Routine\\", where he fought Richard while getting mayonnaise. He gained a scar after ‚ÄúThe Fight‚Äù possibly due to Nicole's fight with him. =Mowdown= Phillip \\"Mowdown\\" (voiced by Simon Lipkin) is a violent giant pink teddy bear. He makes his first appearance in \\"The Lesson,\\" and another appearance in \\"The Finale\\" near the end among the angry crowd. In Season 3, he appears with Julius again in \\"The Question.\\" Mowdown is part of Julius‚Äô crew, and is one of the more violent members, though he contrasts this with his appearance and occasional incompetence. =Kenneth= A grayish-brown monstrous blob creature created by Gumball mixing disgusting things into a jar and Richard accidentally microwaving it. He made his debut in ‚ÄúThe Microwave‚Äù and reappears in ‚ÄúThe Finale‚Äù and in Gumball's subconscious in ‚ÄúThe Name‚Äù. =Carlton and Troy= Carlton and Troy (Carton is voiced by Hugo Harrison and Troy is voiced by Fergus Craig) are two teenage human boys from Richwood High that first appeared in \\"The Sweaters\\", where they taunted Gumball and Darwin. Carlton later appears in \\"The Society\\" in a mascot costume and was kidnapped by Gumball. =Mr. Kreese= Mr. Kreese (voiced by Steve Furst) is Carlton and Troy's coach. Mr. Kreese acts as though he is a playground bully, taunting Gumball and Darwin by making faces at them and bragging how Carlton and Troy will win the fight with Gumball and Darwin. =Judith Fitzgerald= Judith Fitzgerald (voiced by Maria Teresa Creasey) is the mother of Penny and Polly and is married to Patrick Fitzgerald. =Chimera= Chimera (voiced by Simon Lipkin) is Anais‚Äô imaginary friend. =Ripley 2000 Manager= The Ripley 2000 Manager (voiced by Dan Russell) is Larry's incredibly rude and cheap boss, who only cares about money. He is shown fighting Richard Watterson over a refund. =Azrael= Azrael (voiced by Alex Jordan in the U.S., and Joe Sugg in the U.K.) was Carrie's boyfriend for one or two decades. He first appears in \\"The Drama\\". =Extras= Various background characters, including: *Banana Bob, Banana Joe's dad *Mrs. J√∂tunheim, Hector's mom who is, bizarrely, a troll witch *Betty MacArthur, an elderly cloud-shaped woman *Donald MacArthur, a plaid cloth and Betty's husband *Jackie Wilson, Tobias‚Äô mom who is a rainbow humanoid *Karen, Larry's girlfriend, a humanoid axolotl *Pantsbully, a blue bean *Hank and George, two LEGO men who work as construction workers *Grady, Frank, and Howdy, puppets that were formerly owned by the Wattersons. *Samantha, Angela, Maria, and Violet, the four women in the episode \\"The Lady\\" *Floppy Disk, the cyber police. *Mike, a clipboard police officer, researcher, and office worker. *Lenny Smith, a 3D cube office worker. *Newspaper Employee, an office worker and weatherman. *Quattro Pepperoni, Siciliana's husband who has a son. *Siciliana Pepperoni, Quattro's wife who has a son. *Peter Pepperoni, Quattro and Siciliana's son, who was homeschooled until he came to Elmore Junior High. *Blue Elephant, an elderly blue elephant who works at a car dealership.

In a career that lasted from 1873 to 1874 he ran ten times and won five races. His most notable success came as a three-year-old in 1874 when he won The Derby. At the end of the season he was retired to stud where he had little success. Background George Frederick, described by the Times of India as \\"a bright golden chestnut of great muscular power\\" was bred by his owner, William Sherard Cartwright a former solicitor and mine-owner. The colt was sent into training with Tom Olliver at Wroughton, near Swindon in Wiltshire but when Olliver fell ill in 1873, the stables were taken over by his twenty- six-year-old assistant, Thomas Leader. Cartwright sent his mare, Princess of Wales, to the stallion Marsyas for several years in succession, and named all her foals after members of the British royal family. These included the colt Albert Victor, who ran second to Favonius in the 1871 Derby. George Frederick was named after Queen Victoria‚Äôs grandson, the future King George V. Racing career 1873: two-year-old season George Frederick was unplaced on his debut in a Biennial Stakes at York in August, when he appeared less than fully fit. At Doncaster in September he won the Municipal Stakes from the future Epsom Oaks and St Leger winner Apology and then finished third to Farnsfield in a six furlong sweepstakes at the same course. He ran four times at Newmarket in autumn, winning the Boscawen Stakes and a Triennial Produce Stakes at the first October meeting but finishing unplaced in the Middle Park Plate and the Criterion Stakes. The Field described him as a promising colt, but not a potential Derby winner. 1874: three-year-old season George Frederick began his three-year-old season at Newmarket in April, when he finished third in a Biennial Stakes. He did not run in the 2000 Guineas, but reappeared in the Newmarket Stakes, in mid-May, which he won. He then performed very impressively in a private trial gallop. In the Derby on 3 June (the eighth birthday of the prince after whom he was named), George Frederick started 9/1 in a field of twenty runners. Glenalmond started favourite, with Couronne de Fer and the 2000 Guineas winner Atlantic also strongly fancied. Although the ground was softened by heavy overnight rain, the weather on Derby day was fine and the crowd was as large as usual, with both Parliament and the Stock Exchange closing down for the day. Ridden by Harry Custance, George Frederick was towards the back of the field in the early stages, before moving up to sixth place at half way as the lead was held by his stable companion Volturno. George Frederick was moved up to take the lead early in the straight and was never threatened, winning easily by two lengths from Couronne de Fer, with Atlantic a neck further back in third. There were great celebrations on George Frederick‚Äôs return to Wiltshire: there was a procession through the streets of Swindon, with a local band playing \\"See the Conquering Hero Comes\\" (a tune composed by George Frederick Handel) on the Derby winner's arrival. At Wroughton the church bells were rung and the village was decorated in the red and black colours of the winning owner. George Frederick subsequently became difficult to train and never won again. He was expected to run in the St Leger and was heavily backed, but rumours of training problems surfaced and Cartwright was forced to prove the colt‚Äôs wellbeing by inviting members of the sporting press to view the horse at his stables. On the morning of the race, it was announced that the colt had suffered a leg injury and would not run, provoking a great deal of \\"bitter feeling\\", even though a veterinary certificate was produced to prove the legitimacy of the problem. Stud career George Frederick made little impact as a stallion but sired one very good horse in the colt Frontin, who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris in 1883. By 1892 George Frederick had gone blind and was sold for 65 guineas by the Marden Stud to a Mr Bevill. He was exported to the United States where he died in Crescent, Missouri on 23 September 1896.

During the Great Turkish War (1686‚Äì99)  After allied Christian forces had captured Buda from the Ottoman Empire in 1686 during the Great Turkish War, Serbs from Pannonian Plain (present-day Hungary, Slavonia region in present-day Croatia, Baƒçka and Banat regions in present-day Serbia) joined the troops of the Habsburg Monarchy as separate units known as Serbian Militia. Serbs, as volunteers, massively joined the Austrian side. In the first half of 1688 the Habsburg army together with units of Serbian Militia captured Gyula, Lipova and Ineu from the Ottoman Empire. After Belgrade had been liberated from the Ottomans in 1688, Serbs from the territories in the south of Sava and Danube rivers began to join Serbian Militia units. One of the first commanders of the Serbian Militia during the Great Turkish War was Antonije Znoriƒá. In the period 1689‚Äî1691, one of the commanders of Serbian Militia units in Banat was Novak Petroviƒá. The Ottoman Empire had suffered partial military collapse against the Austrians in the 1680s, most notably at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, and the loss of Belgrade to Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1688 and Bosnia in 1689. However, with the beginning of the Nine Years War in the west, the early 1690s saw an end to Habsburg conquests in the Balkans and a partial Ottoman recovery.McKay & Scott. The Rise of the Great Powers 1648‚Äì1815, p.75 Despite the Ottoman recovery and the weakening of the Habsburg military presence on the Danube (most Habsburg soldiers were sent to fight against the France in the War of the Grand Alliance) the Habsburg supreme command planned offensive activities against Ottomans, heavily relying on the Serb soldiers of Serbian Militia and Serb rebels in the Balkans. In 1689 Louis William was appointed as chief commander of the Imperial army in its invasion of the territory of present-day Serbia. Before the invasion Louis William recruited Serb rebels all over territory of present-day Serbia, whose infantry units were called hayduks while cavalry units of Serb rebels were called Serb husars. On August 29, 1689 Serbian Militia under the command of Pavle Nestoroviƒá as a vanguard unit of the Habsburg army were victorious against a vanguard unit of the Ottoman army during the Battle of Batoƒçina. On 4 October 1689 Nestoroviƒá was appointed as commander of all units of Serbian Militia in Serbia. Jovan Monasterlija, who was appointed as captain of Serbian Militia in 1690, recruited Serbs into his units in the summer of 1690 on the southern border of the Austrian Empire. During the Battle of Slankamen on August 19, 1691, Serbian Militia with 10,000 Serbs under the command of Jovan Monasterlija participated in the important victory over Ottoman forces. When Austrian forces supported by Serbian Militia captured Oradea from Ottomans in the spring of 1692, the seat of the Serbian Militia's headquarter became Baja. As reward for the important part he played during the Battle of Zenta, Jovan Tekelija was appointed as Captain of Serbian Militia in Arad in 1698.: \\"–í–µ—õ —Å–ª–µ–¥–µ—õ–µ, 1698. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, —É –∑–Ω–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞—ö–∞, –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω –¢–µ–∫–µ–ª–∏—ò–∞ —ò–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞- –≤—ô–µ–Ω –∑–∞ –∫–∞–ø–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ –º–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∏—ò–µ —É –ê—Ä–∞–¥—É, ...\\" The Austrian Empire had intentions to reduce the power and importance of Serbian Militia and its military and religious leaders by dividing it to smaller units and sending them to different distant parts of the Empire. Monasterlija's rank was changed from Serbian vice-voivode and Chief of the Serbian Nation to Rascian obercaptain. Because of the constant Ottoman threat such plans were never fully implemented.  After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699)  After the Habsburg Monarchy signed the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, Serbs who settled the Military Frontier began to lose their hopes to recapture Serbia from Ottomans and to return to their homes they left during the Great Serb Migration. Since they were subjected to continuous attempts of authorities to Catholicize them or to remove their privileges including their rights to own arable land, members of Serbian Militia began to consider migration to Russian Empire. In 1704 Monasterlija's Serbian Militia was defeated in the battle with R√°k√≥czi's rebels near Baja and many Serbs escaped from the town. Serbian Militia had important role in the struggle against R√°k√≥czi's rebels. Austrian government supported privileged position of the Serbian Militia which they perceived as counterweight to separatist aspirations of Hungarian officials and well trained and cheap military force which could be used to fight against Ottomans or other enemy. From the same reasons, Hungarian officials had hostile relation toward Serbian Militia.

Resulting baldness is noticeable around the abdomen, flank, and legs. Psychogenic alopecia, also called over-grooming or psychological baldness, is a compulsive behavior that affects domestic cats. Generally, psychogenic alopecia does not lead to serious health consequences or a decreased lifespan.  Causes  Grooming is a natural behavior for cats. Cats spend 5‚Äì25% of their waking hours grooming. Grooming becomes excessive when it takes precedence over other activities or no longer seems functional. Excessive grooming, which can lead to hair loss, skin wounds, and ulceration, can result from chronic stress or develop in cats who already exhibit nervous temperaments. Even when the source of stress is resolved or removed, excessive grooming may continue. There may be some genetic basis for the behavior, and it predominantly affects purebred cats of oriental breeds, but can develop in any feline. Female cats appear more susceptible. Environmental factors suspected of causing over-grooming include flea allergy, boredom, food allergy, dust or pollen causing an allergic reaction, constipation and urinary tract infection caused by avoidance of a dirty litter tray, dermatitis, and anxiety caused by inconsistent meal times. Deprivation of sunlight could be the part of the problem for indoors only cats.  Symptoms  Areas affected are those the cat can access most easily, including the abdomen, legs, flank, and chest. * Baldness, usually beginning with the abdomen. * Obvious over-grooming (although some cats may only engage in the behavior in the absence of owners). * Redness, rashes, pus, scabs on the bald area or areas traumatized by over-grooming. * A highly irritable cat may even cut its face with the claw of its hind foot if over-zealously scratching the back of its head. Treatment The cat should be taken to a veterinarian. The most suspected cause of skin problems in cats will be fleas. Other causes of over-grooming are not as easily ascertained. As household antiseptics are known to be toxic to cats, veterinary antiseptics for cats can be used to treat open sores, if they do occur. Sores can also be treated with cream, oral or injected anti-inflammatories, however if the problem continues to recur it may be more cost effective to subject the cat to laboratory testing early on. It may be difficult to keep a clean dressing on a cat's belly, and an anti-lick collar is adequate to let the wound heal. If an anti- lick collar is used, a soft anti-lick collar is less cumbersome, although they are less durable. If the cat wears a plastic anti-lick collar, it may use the edge of the collar to grind against existing wounds, making them worse. A soft anti-lick collar will become less effective as it is kicked out of the shape by the cat's hind leg, and will need prompt replacement. The cat can sanitize the wound if the collar is removed for daily short periods of time, also giving the cat an opportunity for an overall grooming. Scratches and wounds can heal completely using this method. When the cat stops wearing the collar, thinned hair, redness of skin or cracked nipples on the cat are early indicators that the cat has started to over-groom again. Antidepressants for cats may be suggested by a vet.

Format Magazine - Pushing Play. 5 November 2008. The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified (\\"modded\\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non- art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \\"video game art\\". Art games are often considered a means of demonstrating video games as works of art. Overview A definition of the art game was first proposed by Professor Tiffany Holmes (School of the Art Institute of Chicago) in her 2003 paper for the Melbourne DAC Conference, \\"Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre\\". Holmes defined the art game as \\"an interactive work, usually humorous, by a visual artist that does one or more of the following: challenges cultural stereotypes, offers meaningful social or historical critique, or tells a story in a novel manner.\\" The paper stated that an art game must contain at least two of the following: \\"[1] a defined way to win or experience success in a mental challenge, [2] passage through a series of levels (that may or may not be hierarchical), [3] a central character or icon that represents the player.\\" This definition was narrowed by Rebecca Cannon in an October 2003 paper where she highlighted the competitive, goal-oriented nature of the genre in defining art games as \\"compris[ing] an entire, (to some degree) playable game... Art games are always interactive--and that interactivity is based on the needs of competing [...] Art games explore the game format primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative, cultural critique.\\"Bittanti, Matteo. Game Art. Mattscape. Retrieved 1 February 2013. In a 2015 article, Colombian video game theorist Carlos D√≠az placed importance on the \\"reflection experience\\" as an integral aspect of the art game. This experience can pertain to a variety of cultural avenues, but it transcends the medium and its structure. Within the topic of the art game, further subdivisions have been proposed. In her 2003 paper, Holmes identified two common art game types as the \\"feminist art game\\" (an art game that generates thinking about gender and typecasting), and the \\"retro-styled art game\\" (an art game that juxtaposes low-resolution graphics with academic or theoretical content, and that creatively subverts the format of an arcade classic to support a conceptual creative agenda). In 2005, art theorist Pippa Tshabalala n√©e Stalker broadly defined the art game as \\"a video game, normally PC as opposed to console based, that generally but not exclusively explores social or political issues through the medium of video games.\\" She proposed two different categorical schemes to further subdivide the genre by theme and by type. Subdividing by theme, Stalker defined \\"aesthetic art games\\" to include \\"games that deal with using the game medium to express an artistic purpose,\\" and she defined \\"political\\" or \\"agenda-based art games\\" as art games that \\"have some sort of ulterior motive other than aesthetics\\" and whose basis is in \\"using the medium of the computer games to bring an issue to the public's, or at least the art world's, attention in order to attract support and understanding for a cause.\\" Subdividing by type, Stalker identified the \\"art mod\\", the \\"physical manifestation art game\\" (the player is involved physically in the game, often experiencing physical consequences, such as pain, for their actions), \\"machinima\\", and \\"3D real-time [art] game\\" (an art game that displays all the characteristics of a complete level-based commercial game, both on the programming and commercial side). The identification of art mods and machinima as forms of the art game conflicts with Cannon's definition of the art mod that highlights the non-interactive and non-competitive nature of these forms of media. Distinctions are drawn in describing the art game as a genre compared to traditional video game genres (such as the platformer or first-person shooter). Rather than describing the game on a surface level, descriptions focus on the artistic intent, as well as the execution and implementation of the gameplay. For instance, Bethesda's 2008 release Fallout 3 is considered to be a role-playing game with first- person shooter elements, but it could also be considered to have elements consistent with art games--it implements moral player choices for the sole purpose of provoking emotion or thought in the player. There are several recent instances of video games that similarly involve the characteristics of art games, such as Braid and Undertale. Games like these aren't necessarily created or marketed under the classification of \\"art game\\", but are still created for artistic purposes that transcend their respective structures. The potentials and limitations of the medium are increasingly discovered as the video game industry develops, therefore resulting in the recent popularity of art game elements. If nothing else, the genre can be seen as a means to push the medium to its conceptual limit. Since the development of these early definitions, art theorists have emphasized the role of artistic intent (of author or curator) and further definitions have emerged from both the art world and the video game world that draw a clear distinction between the \\"art game\\" and its predecessor, \\"video game art\\".Sharp, John. A Curiously Short History of Game Art. Georgia Institute of Technology. Proceedings of the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games. Pp.26-32. 29 May - 1 June 2012. At the core of the matter lies an intersection between art and the video game. Easily confused with its often non-interactive sibling art form video game art, and the concept of video games as an art form (irrespective of artistic intent), the essential position that art games take in relation to video games is analogous with the position that art film takes in relation to film. ACM SIGGRAPH opened an online exhibit \\"The Aesthetics of Gameplay\\" in March 2014, featuring 45 independently developed games selected via a nomination process, where the mechanics of gameplay are, in part, tied to the visuals and audio of the game. Greg Garvey, the curator of this exhibit, compared this to the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk where the work attempts to encompass other art forms, though as Garvey comments, the \\"merger of interaction with the aesthetics\\" drives these games beyond this concept. \\"Art game\\" versus \\"game art\\" Due to the contemporaneous improvement of graphic capabilities (and other aspects of game art design) with the trend toward recognition of games as art and the increases in video game art production and art game releases, discussions of these topics are often closely interleaved. This has led to the drawing of a number of critical distinctions between the \\"art game\\" and the various kinds of \\"game art\\". In drawing a distinction between games with artistic imagery and art games, commentators have compared the art to sculpture and have emphasized the concept of artistic intent in the creation of the art game. This difference has been described by Justin McElroy of Joystiq as \\"the same [as that] between a sculpture and a building. Though a building/game can be aesthetically pleasing, an art game/sculpture is using its very structure to produce some kind of reaction.\\" This same comparison has been used by Jenova Chen in an interview discussing art games and the prominence of non-games to the artistic gamer community.Chen, Jenova.

Along with expanding on the notion of art games as comparable to architecture in a 2010 interview with Nora Young for Spark, Jim Munroe stated that whereas video games such as the \\"art game\\" are shifting in the direction of the \\"high arts\\" within the realm of art generally, traditionally video games have occupied a position in the \\"cultural gutter\\" (making up the \\"low arts\\").Young, Nora & Misener, Dan. Repeat of Spark 126 ‚Äì October 16 & 19, 2011: Games as Art (Podcast available: Games as Art ). Spark. 7 November 2010. Another key distinction that has been made between art games and games with artistic imagery (and indeed all games viewed as art) is that art games are intended as artistic creations from the outset whereas traditional games are often commercially motivated and play-oriented. Thus the \\"game\\" portion of \\"game art\\" is merely the means to an artistic end. This has been expanded by some commentators to include the artistic intention of the curator as well as the original creator. This distinction also brings into focus the concept of \\"serious play.\\" Graham and Elizabeth Coulter-Smith of Southampton Solent University and The University of Northampton respectively, define serious play as \\"a mode of communication that is not instrumental and not overbearingly focused on the linguistic model,\\" a communicative medium that involves the concrete action of the participants rather than abstracts such as language. This holds significant implications for an artistic medium, as it facilitates communication of meaning through increasingly more empathetic and concrete means. Unlike other media, players of games must expend not only time but effort--in the form of problem-solving or the application of timed reflexes. This participatory element demonstrates that adding effort as an element in an art work results in a higher degree of emotional investment, and therefore a higher potential impact of artistic intent on the participant. In distinguishing between art games and video game art, the elements of interactivity and often competition (or goals) are frequently emphasized. Because art games are games and because games are interactive, definitions for the art game tend to require interactivity whereas video game art can be either interactive or non-interactive. Beyond this, the questions of whether competition, rules, and goals are intrinsic to games and to what extent \\"play\\" is even definable in the context of an art game raise thorny problems for critics who compare a game like chess to a game like Sim City and who question the playfulness of a game like Escape From Woomera. A number of commentators have included the concept of competition as part of the definition of the art game to distinguish it from video game art. An example of such a definition is offered by Professor John Sharp: \\"Artgames are games in the formal sense of maintaining the experiential and formal characteristics of videogames--rules, game mechanics, goals, etc.--as an expressive form in the same way other artists might use painting, film or literature.\\" Thus game art pieces can be seen to employ traditional (non-art) games as the canvas or artistic medium whereas art games employ the formal qualities of the game as the artistic medium.Silfer, Kyle. Applied Ludology: Art games and game art. Alibi. V.16, No.28. Feature Archive. July 12-18, 2007. \\"Art game\\" versus \\"art mod\\" The idea of a distinction between art games and artistic modifications to existing games is one that several commentators including Rebecca Cannon and Matteo Bittanti have found useful in further discussing the related topics. Using Tiffany Holmes' original definition of the \\"art game\\" as a starting point, Cannon emphasized that whereas art games \\"always comprise an entire, (to some degree) playable game\\" and may be made from scratch, art mods by definition \\"always modify or reuse an existing computer game but only rarely include a reward system, and if so, only when of thematic relevance.\\" Likewise, whereas interactivity and playability are defining characteristics of the art game, they are often of no consequence for the art mod.Cannon, Rebecca. \\"Meltdown\\" from Videogames and Art (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. For Cannon, the nature of a work as a modification is not alone determinative of the question of whether the work is an art game or an art mod. Some modifications are \\"art games\\" despite being mods according to her definition. In addressing the potential for confusion on this point, she has stated that at the most basic level, \\"art games explore the game format primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative and/or cultural critique, whilst art mods employ game media attributes for extensive artistic expressions.\\" Thus, whereas art games explore the game format, art mods explore game media and whereas art mods always exploit existing games, art games often replace them. Fluxus scholar Celia Pearce describes the art mod or \\"patch\\" as an \\"interventional strategy,\\" referencing the Dadaist concept. She argues that the art mod is an example of this pseudo-vandalism involving subversion and reflection within the cultural context of video games. Other art theorists including Pippa Tshabalala have rejected this narrow definition of the \\"art game\\" and have instead adopted a broad definition under the theory that the concept of the game is not limited to systems where the author has created rules and goals, but that games emerge whenever the observer self-limits play experience. Thus, observers experiencing the Jodi art mod, SOD (a modification of Wolfenstein 3D), can experience it as an art game as soon as they decide that their goal will be to progress to the next level. History Origins and first wave art games The art game genre has emerged most directly from the intersection of commercial culture (specifically commercial video games) and contemporary digital art. In attempting to determine the earliest origins of the genre, however, art theorists including Tiffany Holmes and Greg Costikyan have identified its earliest roots in Dada and the collaborative drawing games of the Surrealist artists of the 1920s. Others have drawn still broader connections to literary games invented by the author for the reader in 19th and 20th century literature.LaFarge, Antoinette. WINSIDE OUT: An Introduction to the Convergence of Computers, Games, and Art. University of California, Irvine. 2000. By treating the game as a topic of artistic utility, these earlier art movements legitimized the concept of the game as an artistically explorable form and as more than simply idle amusement. At the Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, Professor Celia Pearce further noted that since the Fluxus movement of the 1960s and Marcel Duchamp's art productions, procedurality has taken a central position in certain forms of art. The artistically motivated imposition of strict rules of creation for an art piece (in this case the restriction by the author to the format or medium of the video game) brought video games and art into a collision resulting in the first true art games.Pratt, Charles J. The Art History... Of Games? Games As Art May Be A Lost Cause. Gamasutra. 8 February 2010. Although early game-like programs such as Conway's zero-player Game of Life (1970) were foundational to later art games,Blow, Jonathan. Games as Instruments for Observing Our Universe . Champlain College, Burlington VT. February 2010. Pearce identifies the earliest true art games as originating in a small wave in the early 1980s with games such as Bernie DeKoven and Jaron Lanier's Alien Garden (1982). Other early art games from this period include Jane Veeder's Warpitout (1982),Staff. \\"Chicago Computer Artist Accelerates to Warp Speed.\\" Softalk. Pg.227-229. February 1983. Lanier's Moondust (1983), and Lynn Hershman Leeson's Laserdisc games LORNA (1983) and Deep Contact (1984).Kuehn, Emily. \\"Review: The World of Art Games .\\" Columbia College Chicago Profile. 2009. Following this period of activity, art game production would see a lull until the end of the 1990s. Video games were first displayed in the art museum setting during the 1980s, in retrospective exhibitions like Corcoran Gallery of Art's \\"ARTcade\\" (1983)Blakeman, Mary Claire. \\"The Art Side of Video Games.\\" Video Games. Vol.2, No.4. Pp.27-30. January 1984. and Museum of the Moving Image's \\"Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade\\" (1989).Rosenkrantz, Linda. \\"New York: It's Happening, It's ... Teen Town!\\" The Washington Post. 23 April 1989. However, just as with the production of art games, the practice became much more common during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Exhibitions like the Walker Art Center's \\"Beyond Interface\\" (1998),Holmes, Tiffany. Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade. Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference (Tampere, Finland); Art Gallery, SIGGRAPH 2002. August 2002. the online \\"Synreal\\" (1998) and \\"Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art\\" (1999), shift e.V.'s \\"RELOAD\\" (1999), the UCI Beall Centre's \\"Shift-Ctrl\\" (2000), and several others in 2001 were among the first wave of video game exhibitions that popularized the concept. This expanded to exhibitions heavily featuring or exclusive to art game content in the early 2000s with shows like MASS MoCA's \\"GameShow\\" (2001) San Francisco MOMA's \\"010101: Art in Technological Times\\" (2001), the Whitney Museum's \\"Bitstreams\\" (2001), and the New York Museum of the Moving Image's \\" Digital Media\\" (2003). Rise of the \\"artist game\\" Drawing from the modern traditions of the 1970s New Games Movement, where the playing of a game could be regarded as a form of performance art, art pieces such as Frank Lantz' Pac Manhattan, Blast Theory's Can You See Me Now? Stuart, Keith. Blast Theory brings interactive art to Exeter. The Guardian. 4 October 2011. and similar hybrid performance- art/art-games including Painstation (2001), Go Fish (2001), and Vagamundo (2002) came in the early years of the modern period of art game production. The burgeoning video game art movement also provided direct inspiration for art game development particularly in the creation of art mods. Art theorist Rebecca Cannon identifies the earliest example of a purposeful art mod to be Iimura Takahiko's 1993 AIUEOUNN Six Features (a modification of Sony's \\"System G\\"), although the transgressive capability of mods like Castle Smurfenstein (1983) had already been recognized during the first period of art game creation.Bogacs, Hannes. Game Mods: A Survey of Modifications, Appropriation and Videogame Art. Vienna University of Technology - Design and Assessment of Technologies Institute. February 2008. Online artist collectives including Jodi.org and the Australian SelectParks soon began production of art games in the studio setting, repurposing older games through the use of interactive art mods. The use of mods within art games became one of the primary tools for art game creators who designed games with a message, such as the addition of female characters to a traditionally male-centric game, or to force the audience to re-examine a familiar work in a different light. Consequently, the early history of art games is intimately connected to the history of commercial video games and the establishment of video gaming conventions, and significant events in the history of video games have corresponding significance to art games. This is true both in terms of the level of technological advancement that make up the substance of art games as well as by providing cultural touchstones (such as the classic arcade games and blockbuster titles from the 1990s like Doom and Myst) that art games may use referentially or as the subject of an homage. Art games of this kind have been defined by theorists as \\"artist games\\"Stockburger, Axel. \\"From Appropriation to Approximation\\". Videogames and Art (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.29, 34-35. --art games created by non- developer contemporary artists rather than by game developers. Typically produced on a smaller budget and with less technical (coding) knowledge than art games emerging from the game scene itself, \\"artist games\\" are often more explicit in terms of their artistic ambitions and commonly occupy \\"the grey area between modification and original game\\" because they are frequently based on classic arcade titles from the 1980s. Early examples of this kind of game include Thompson and Craighead's Trigger Happy (1998), Esc to Begin's Font Asteroids (1999), and Natalie Bookchin's The Intruder (1999). As video games became increasingly common as a form of media throughout the 2000s,Wasteland, Matthew. Opinion: Tell Me What Art Is, and I'll Tell You What Games Are. GameSetWatch. 27 September 2008. video games that deemphasized the game portion of the medium (such as serious games, non-games and art games) saw a rise in production. This in turn led to recognition of the game as a vehicle for ideas instead of simply an entertaining diversion. The term \\"art game\\" was first used in the scholarly setting by Professor Tiffany Holmes in her 2002 paper, \\"Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade\\".Lee, Shuen-Shing. I Lose, Therefore I Think: A Search for Contemplation amid Wars of Push-Button Glare - 7. The Rise of Art Games. GameStudies.org. 2004. Holmes presented this paper at the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference in Tampere, Finland, and at SIGGRAPH 2002, later expanding it by defining the term in a 2003 paper for the Melbourne DAC Conference. Further refinements to the definition were made by theorist Rebecca Cannon in her late 2003 paper, \\"Introduction to Artistic Computer Game Modification.\\" Rise of the indie art game Beginning in the early to mid-2000s with games such as Samorost (2003) and The Endless Forest (2005), a strong overlap developed between art games and indie games. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement brought art games to the attention of the video game culture at large, and sparked large debates regarding whether or not video games can be fairly considered as works of art, as well as a backlash against use of the term. These debates have in turn led to the retrospective determination of numerous older commercial video games (prior to the use of the term \\"art game\\") as art games. As indie art games have seen a dramatic rise in production in the late 2000s (especially from 2008 and onwards), indie game developers like Jenova Chen, Molleindustria, Jason Nelson, Jason Rohrer, and Tale of Tales have become established and \\"artist games\\" have become relatively less common. Discussions over the commercial viability of art games have led to speculation concerning the potential for the commercial video game industry to fund the development of \\"prestige games\\" (games that are unlikely to be commercially successful but whose artistic vision marks them as important to the development of the medium). These considerations are generally regarded as premature, as the concept of \\"prestige\\" hasn't yet taken hold for publishers as it has for developers in the nascent industry. Consequently, publishers are generally unwilling to take on commercially risky high-concept games the same way that major film studios (who often have arthouse divisions) might for art films that could enhance their prestige.Carless, Simon. Why Are There No Prestige Games?. GameSetWatch. 26 November 2006. The need for adequate funding to produce high quality art games has been recognized by art game creators like Florent Deloison and Mark Essen, who in 2011 joined designer game firms where individualized art games can be commissioned as luxury items by art patrons for a substantial price.Pfeiffer, Alice. \\"Playing around with real life; Firm hopes to find niche with video games based on customers' histories.\\" International Herald Tribune. 22 November 2011. Criticism of the term \\"art game\\" Alongside the growing use of the term \\"art game\\", numerous members of the video game culture have reacted negatively to its application. Critics have noted that the term turns away a certain segment of the gamer population who reject the notion that games can be works of art, and who equate \\"art games\\" with elitist gaming. This kind of reaction has in turn caused some game developers to reject the use of the term to describe their games, instead using terms like \\"not-game\\", \\"un-game\\", or simply refusing to accept any categorical label for their work. Some common criticisms of the term include: *A view from some within the gaming community that describing a game as an art game means that it's pretentious and not fun.Sterling, Jim. Jimquisition: The Definition of Art Games. Escapist Magazine. 2 July 2012.Short, Emily. Column: 'Homer In Silicon': On Aging. GameSetWatch. 9 January 2010. *A view that those who play and enjoy art games (known as \\"art gamers\\") are snobby and not to be emulated.Rogers, Tim. The Hierarchy of Video Game Haters. Kotaku. 21 January 2013. *A view that the term \\"art game\\" needlessly introduces the distinction between high art and low art within video games where it has never existed previously.An artist interview with Paolo Pedercini / Molleindustria. Molleindustria. 14 June 2011. *A view that the term \\"art game\\" is over-broad and that it is incorrectly used synonymously with \\"indie game\\" thereby improperly co-opting the concept of innovation when innovation itself is not art.Smith, Edward.

The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper river in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen quarter of Wuppertal. It was run by the SA group in D√ºsseldorf. The purpose of the early concentration camps was to repress and terrorize opponents of the new regime, primarily communists, but also socialists, dissenting Christians, and trade unionists. Unlike later concentration camps, the prisoners and the guards at Kemna were from the same cities and in many cases, knew each other and were already enemies from the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 and subsequent political battles of the 1920s. Torture was practiced and the screams of the men were audible to people living and working nearby, and severely injured men were taken to nearby hospitals, all causing word of the camp's misdeeds to spread quickly. There was a major release of prisoners in October 1933; those released were forced to sign a document promising to keep secret all they had seen and experienced at the camp, and were threatened with re-arrest if they disobeyed. The Nazis wanted the public to become familiar with the term \\"concentration camp\\" and regard it with dread, but worried that the excesses at Kemna and the other early concentration camps would turn public opinion against them and thwart their plans. As a result, the camp was closed in January 1934, just six months after it opened. After the SA lost political influence, reports of torture led to an investigation and eventually to hearings and the perpetrators given a warning. No crimes were prosecuted. After the war, the Kemna Trial became the first major German trial regarding a concentration camp. Nonetheless, the camp was afterward largely forgotten, with no research into its past and for decades, only two sources supplying most of the information known about the camp. In 1983, a monument honoring the prisoners who suffered there was installed across the street from the former concentration camp; the builders of the monument were forbidden by the owner of the property from erecting any memorial on the site itself.  History  After the Reichstag fire of February 27, 1933, and the subsequent Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties, the Nazis moved quickly to debilitate their political enemies. They conducted mass arrests of some 10,000 of their political opponents within just a few days, intending not just to confine, but also to weaken them physically and mentally through terror. The sudden surge of thousands of new prisoners created a critical shortage of places to confine them. Interior Minister of Prussia Hermann G√∂ring began to look for regional locations in cities for short-term, temporary means to house the newly arrested. Between March and May 1933, prisoners in the Bergisches Land were housed by the dozens in schools, SA barracks, cellars and other locations; prisons moved their women to other locations to make more room for the new prisoners. These were all in residential areas, however, and the torture already being practiced caused unrest in the community, prompting the SA to seek a new, larger location on the outskirts of town. They found a suitable location, an empty factory in Wuppertal, the owner of which, on a promise by the local district government to purchase the property later, agreed to allow the SA to use rent-free in the short term. Kemna became one of the first concentration camps in Germany, and existed from July 5, 1933 to January 19, 1934. It was run by the D√ºsseldorf SA and Wuppertal police chief (Polizeipr√§sident) Willi Veller and backed by the D√ºsseldorf district government. The first commandant, SA Sturmf√ºhrer Hugo Neuhoff, was soon replaced by Alfred Hilgers, who, at the same time was the SA Standarte 258 of the Koburg Protective Custody camp in Mettmann. In a space expected to hold 200-300 prisoners, the SA guards confined up to 1,100 prisoners in unsanitary, overcrowded conditions in a former textile factory on Beyenburger Stra√üe, directly on the banks of the Wupper. Torture and arbitrary violence were daily events. To maintain order and help run the institution, the SA established a hierarchy within the prisoner population, choosing some to work as prisoner functionaries and by establishing some of the large holding cells in the building as preferable to others. There was a major release of prisoners in October 1933, but for many, Kemna was just the first place of confinement on the way to other concentration camps. In the evening and particularly at night, the screams of prisoners were heard at a bar from the camp, as well as by people who lived across the Wupper. On the weekend, family members and friends of those incarcerated, as well as others, who were merely curious, took walks in the neighboring woods, from where the camp was clearly visible. Articles appeared in the local press, referring obliquely to \\"enhanced interrogations\\" and explaining the need for a firm hand to deal with the type of prisoners held there. Locals began warning each other with the saying, \\"Watch yourself, or you'll end up in Kemna!\\" With rumors about the camp spreading, the Nazis emptied and closed the camp just six months after it opened, fearing the risk to their image at home and abroad. Although the Third Reich wanted the public to become familiar with the term \\"concentration camp\\" (in German, Konzentrationslager) and understand its implications enough to dread it, it was concerned about the consequences of public awareness of the practice of torture at Kemna and the other early concentration camps. The prisoners were brought to Emslandlager, forced to sing, as they marched out of Kemna, \\"Forward, march to Emsland, Camp Kemna is closed‚Äîhappy is he who forgets\\". The German word for happy, \\"gl√ºcklich\\", also means \\"lucky\\" or \\"fortunate\\".  The camp   Buildings and grounds  Kemna concentration camp is located in the Barmen quarter of Wuppertal on at Beyenburger Stra√üe 146. The camp was sometimes referred to as \\"Konzentrationslager Wuppertal- Barmen\\", the name printed as the return address on postcards sent by prisoners, but is primarily known as \\"KZ Kemna\\", KZ being the German abbreviation for \\"concentration camp\\". The main building was a four-story former factory at number 146.German references describe the building as \\"three-story\\" because the ground floor is not counted as a story. Also on the grounds were a house at number 142, a boiler unit and some smaller buildings. A chain-link fence, topped with barbed wire surrounded the property, replacing a barbed wire barrier that was originally erected. On the ground floor of the main building were the kitchen, laundry room and a registration room where all new prisoners were recorded. Above that, on the second floor, were the quarters for the commandant and room three, which initially provided quarters for the guard staff and, during that time, was where most of the torture took place. The third floor was divided into two rooms where the prisoners were housed, rooms four and five. All the windows in these rooms were painted black, both inside and out, preventing prisoners from looking out and passersby from looking in, and causing the rooms to be dark, even during the day. Nonetheless, these rooms were considered the best; they were outfitted with beds, tables and benches in the summer of 1933, and were not as close to the torture area. The attic floor contained a clothing storeroom, an orderly room and prisoner quarters for Nazis placed in \\"protective custody\\". Special cells for harsh punishment were the freight elevator and cubicles under the stairs, where prisoners were forced to crouch for hours. Rooms one and two, also prisoner housing, were in two one-story buildings closer to the river and where until October 1933, the prisoners had no beds and slept directly on the ground, with just a bit of straw underneath them. Room one led to the \\"bunker\\", a concrete former coke storage room adjacent to the boiler unit, and the infirmary. The heating equipment was non-functional; a battlefield forge stood in the unit. The bunker was , with one small opening and an iron door leading to room one. New prisoners lived there for days, even weeks. As many as 50 men at a time were forced to live there in stifling air and heat; one witness said, \\"The exhaled breath of those locked up was so great that water condensed and ran under the door, as if poured from a bucket.\\" Room two led to the toilets and contained a small room where food was served and a 17-man crew peeled potatoes for the kitchen. In late September 1933, in preparation for a large transport of 200 men, the guards' quarters and the infirmary were moved into the house, which had previously been empty. Afterward, the former infirmary became the main torture room and a new infirmary was set up in a walled-off section of room two. Of the prisoner housing, room one was considered the worst because there was an increased likelihood of attracting the attention of a passing SA man, an occurrence that could lead to immediate abuse. Most feared by the prisoners, however, were the torture rooms; the bunker, the freight elevator and the cubicles, where inmates were denied even the normal camp standards of meals, washing, toilets and the infirmary. In addition to these, a wing was added to the main building with the prisoners forced to provide the labor. The new wing had guards' quarters, plus individual cells and a sound-insulated interrogation room. The SA began using the new wing in December 1933 just before the camp was closed.  The prisoners  The total number of prisoners is estimated to have been between 2,500 and 5,000. The number is difficult to ascertain because camp records were destroyed and there is little other information from which a precise number can be deduced. Of the total number of prisoners, 646 people have been identified by name. Woodcut by former Kemna prisoner G√ºnther Strupp Those imprisoned were primarily those swept up in mass arrests of political opponents from the Communist Party (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) and the Social Democrats (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD) from the Bergisches Land, also certain unaligned Christians, and unionists. Jews who were there were imprisoned for their political views, not because they were Jews, although the SA's anti-semitism resulted in worse treatment if one even appeared to be Jewish. There were also transports and others arrested individually from the area, including nearby cities such as Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, Krefeld and Essen. While the guards in other concentration camps were from various parts of Germany, prisoners and guards at Kemna were all from the same area and often knew each other personally. Some prisoners were prominent in their areas or in the region and were considered \\"trophy prisoners\\" and subjected to especially harsh treatment and vengeful torment. These \\"big shots\\", as the SA called them, included Heinrich Hirtsiefer, a former Prussian Vice Minister President, Wilhelm B√∂kenkr√ºger, a former director of the Wuppertal employment office, and Georg Petersdorff, the secretary of the D√ºsseldorf and Cologne Reichsbanner Gaue. Despite the beatings and torture, of those prisoners who were released, most resumed their anti-Nazi activities.  Torture and torment  Beatings at Kemna, as at other early concentration camps, were frequent, beginning with the \\"welcome beating\\" on arrival at the camp right through to having to run a gauntlet when leaving. Because prisoners and guards were political opponents who were former neighbors and co-workers, punishment and torture at Kemna took on a personal nature. Prisoners were brought to interrogations naked and gagged with cloth stuffed in their mouths, were tied to special whipping benches, where they were whipped with rubber clubs, whips and sticks. Bleeding, they were then locked in a cubicle under the stairs, where they could neither sit nor stand and cigarette smoke was blown through the air holes. Beforehand, prisoners were made to eat \\"appetizers\\" of unsoaked salt herring smeared with lubricating grease or feces; when they regurgitated, they were forced to lick up the vomit. In November, prisoners with fresh wounds were thrown into the cold waters of the Wupper and afterwards, made to stay in their wet clothes. There were also simulated executions. According to one former SA paramedic, about 25 prisoners attempted suicide; others succeeded or simply died from the effects of the torture. Some survivors were crippled mentally or physically from their treatment, some for the rest of their lives. Beatings and torture were so routine at Kemna, that the SA-Oberscharf√ºhrer Bruno Wolff, who served as deputy camp commandant during the last three months of Kemna's existence, was quite open when asked about prisoner abuse in an interview with the state's attorney in 1934. The brutality was aggravated by alcohol, particularly at night. Frequent and extreme drunkenness, which was a common problem within the SA, aggravated the situation at Kemna, as numerous former inmates later testified. Typically, off-duty guards would go out drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready to take part in interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, normally closed at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open. Willi Veller's drinking was so out of control that he was incapable of showing up for work on a regular basis‚Äîand it was no secret.  Legal action   During the Nazi era  Because of the many severely injured prisoners who were brought to the local hospitals, rumors about Kemna began to spread, although cautiously, since speaking about the situation could land one in the same predicament. On March 8, 1934, the state's attorney, Gustav Winckler, made his first report to his superior, G√ºnther Jo√´l, regarding Kemna.\\"Biografische Ausz√ºge von Gustav Winckler (1897-1980)\\" Gemeinde H√ºllenhahn, Evangelische Kirchengemeinde in Wuppertal. Retrieved January 8, 2012 On July 16, 1934, an account from a former Kemna prisoner appeared in the Wuppertal press. After the Night of the Long Knives, when the SA was purged, its top leaders removed and its power curbed just two weeks later, Jo√´l began an investigation and soon had a number of witnesses willing to testify. Staff of SA guards at Kemna, ca. November 1933 Concurrently, opponents of Veller from within the party contacted Jo√´l to warn him of the influence of the \\"Veller clique\\", Wolff and the D√ºsseldorf state police. They also sought support from Rudolf Hess, then Hitler's deputy, who had the Reichsinspekteur conduct an investigation. The Reichsinspekteur met with Winckler, who gave him the findings of his own investigation and urged him to resolve the charges unequivocally. Days later, on August 18, 1934, Hess issued a temporary injunction for \\"abuse of the gravest kind against protective custody prisoners at Camp Kemna\\" against Veller, Hans Pfeiffer, Hilgers, Wolff and three other SA leaders from Wuppertal. All were expelled from the Nazi Party. Although the ministry of justice had handed out letters of protection to their informants, one was taken into protective custody as soon as word of Winckler's investigation spread. The informant was released after five days, after Jo√´l was informed and intervened. The regional Nazi leadership unleashed a barrage of attacks‚Äîincluding death threats‚Äîagainst Winckler, himself a Nazi Party member, hauling him before the party court. In mid-December 1934, Prussian Ministry of Justice state secretary, Roland Freisler ordered the files on the case to be turned over to the Nazi Gau leadership. The party then immediately initiated proceedings at the highest party court in Munich, which was already dealing with objections to the expulsions. The main hearings were held February 19‚Äì20, 1935. The accused had numerous witnesses, including some prominent individuals. It also issued an opinion on two deaths of former inmates attributed to their confinement, though the deaths took place in hospitals after Kemna had closed. Under pressure from G√∂ring's personal adjutant, the case was later reopened in hearings before the highest party court. The court found that the investigations had been conducted in a one- sided manner, with testimony coming only from \\"implacable enemies of the new state\\" whose credibility the judge questioned. Although the accused had gone beyond the point \\"necessary to break the resistance\\" and had \\"as a result, transgressed the F√ºhrer's order, that the National Socialist state well knows how to render his opponent harmless, but beyond that, eschews all vengeance\\". The court noted that the SA in the Wuppertal industrial area had to contend with especially persistent communist opponents, who never stopped trying to organize underground, even after the Machtergreifung; and that this behavior of the state's attorney has given impetus to this element. On April 1, 1935, more than a year after the camp was closed, the court lifted the injunction and gave the accused a reprimand. The state's attorney conducted three more examinations of witnesses and on January 18, 1936, sent his report and the case files to the Reich's ministry of justice. The report gave little attention to criminal proceedings, and little store was set by the witnesses. Jo√´l concluded by recommending that the entire case be suppressed.  Postwar: the Kemna Trial  Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 8, 1945 and barely two weeks later, Herbert Claus, a former Kemna prisoner and before that, a police wachtmeister, wrote a letter to the Wuppertal criminal police with strong accusations against a former Kemna guard, Hermann Warnstedt. Newly re-employed in the office was Johannes Pauli, another former Kemna prisoner, who, recognizing the charges from his own experience, set the cogs in motion and on July 12, 1945, Warnstedt was arrested. Other former Kemna prisoners also began to report their experiences and more arrests followed. On December 20, 1945, the Allied Control Council established a new law, \\"crimes against humanity\\", with the definition, ‚ÄúAtrocities and offenses, including but not limited to murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape, or other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds whether or not in violation of the domestic laws of the country where perpetrated.‚Äù Following this, on August 30, 1946, the British military government approved the jurisdiction of German courts to handle such crimes when they did not involve other nationals, but were German against Germans. In November 1946, the Wuppertal branch of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (VVN) began work to re-open the case against Kemna and to pursue other cases of Nazi war crimes. They located Winckler, who had been transferred to Kassel in 1935 and returned to Wuppertal in 1946. Winckler began working on the case again. The first major German trial regarding a concentration camp was about Kemna, the Kemna Proze√ü in 1948. Thirty people were charged, either with having been responsible for the crimes that took place there, or for having carried them out. The fact that guards and prisoners had often been known to one another from the Kampfzeit, the turbulent \\"fighting times\\" from 1919 through the 1920s, then became a defense as guards claimed that at Kemna, they had only tried to gain some delayed satisfaction for prior assaults. Hilgers was sentenced to death. The sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment in a Zuchthaus and in 1956, he was granted clemency and was released on December 21.  Memorials  Across the road from the former site of Kemna concentration camp is a small lane that leads to a monument honoring the victims of the camp. It was installed across the road rather than at the actual site of the camp because the owner of the factory then in the building would not allow the monument to be placed there. The main building and an addition, built by the prisoners, were renovated, and still exist, as does a house that belonged to the camp. Neither the buildings nor the property are protected as landmarks. The monument contains a bronze-relief, which depicts several images that refer to aspects of the prisoners' life at the camp. Its creation and placement was organized by pupils of the Gymnasium am Kothen, a secondary school in Wuppertal. The monument was placed in 1983, in time for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the camp. The lane leading to the monument was named after Karl Ibach, who entered the camp at the age of 18. Three other locations in Wuppertal are also named for former Kemna prisoners: Friedrich-Senger-Platz, Otto-B√∂hne-Platz and Oskar-Hoffmann-Treppe. In 1948 Ibach wrote a book about the camp, which for decades was one of only two sources of information about it. There is a -long path from the market square in Langerfeld to the memorial. Marked with handmade wooden signs along the way, it was built in 2001 by a Wuppertal youth organization and representatives of several secondary schools. In 1999 and 2000, the monument was vandalized and a Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime event at the memorial was attacked by 14 right-wing extremists. The subsequent trial attracted attention from all over Germany. From June 4 to July 10, 2005, the story of Kemna concentration camp was documented in an exhibition at the W√ºlfing-Museum in Radevormwald which featured photos and documents from the period, as well as biographies of the Kemna victims from Radevormwald, Wermelskirchen and H√ºckeswagen.\\"Ausstellung der Bergischen Zeitgeschichte (BZG)\\" Stadtnetz Radervormwald.

Originally a mounted infantry unit named the 1st Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, CEF, it was formed on November 7, 1914, in Brandon, Manitoba. Part of the 1st Brigade Canadian Mounted Rifles, the unit landed in France on September 22, 1915, where the conditions of the Western Front made its mounts more of a hindrance than a benefit. On January 1, 1916, both CMR brigades (six regiments) were dismounted, converted to infantry and reorganized as the 8th Infantry Brigade (four battalions). The 1st Regiment, CMR, became the 1st Battalion, CMR, and it absorbed half the personnel of the 3rd Regiment, CMR (the other half going to the 2nd Battalion, CMR). Canadian Mounted Rifles recruitment poster The battalion fought in most of the 3rd Canadian Division's engagements until the end of the war. The 1st CMR, along with the 4th CMR, was manning the 3rd Division's front on June 2, 1916, when the Germans launched their assault at the outset of the Battle of Mount Sorrel. Its positions were overrun, and 557 of its 692 members (80%) were killed, wounded or captured. The battalion was rebuilt over the summer, and it was one of the first Canadian Corps units to attack when the corps shifted to the Somme. On September 15, 1916, the 1st CMR was in the first wave attacking Mouquet Farm. Although the attack gained ground, the Canadians did not take the strong point, but the assault was considered a successful diversion from the main attack on Courcelette. The battalion was disbanded on November 15, 1920. Perpetuation of the 1st Battalion, CMR, was initially assigned to the Manitoba Mounted Rifles and the Saskatchewan Mounted Rifles. The Manitoba Mounted Rifles converted to artillery in 1946 as the 118th Medium Battery, RCA (in Fort Frances) and this battery was virtually disbanded (see Supplementary Order of Battle) in 1965. The Saskatchewan Mounted Rifles merged into the 16th/22nd Saskatchewan Horse in 1936, which converted to infantry in 1941 as the Battleford Light Infantry (16th/22nd Saskatchewan Horse). This regiment merged into the Prince Albert and Battleford Volunteers in 1946, which in turn became part of the North Saskatchewan Regiment (Machine Gun) in 1955.

The film was directed by and written by Oliver Kalkofe, Oliver Welke and Bastian Pastewka. It is about two policemen, Inspector Very Long (Pastewka) and Chief Inspector Even Longer (Kalkofe) who must find the Wixxer, a gangster who wants to take over London's crime world. Plot The film begins at BlackWhite castle, one of the last castles in Black-and-white located in the United Kingdom. Residing there is the Earl of Cockwood (Thomas Fritsch), a notorious gangster. At some point, a tourist couple from Bitterfeld gets lost in the woods and witnesses a murder: the Monk with the Whip gets overrun by a truck. At the wheel: The Wixxer, an evil gangster who wears a skull mask and wants to take over London's crime scene. To do that he arranges for the death of many of the current gangsters. Scotland Yard sends its ‚Äì allegedly ‚Äì best man, Chief Inspector Even Longer. Since the Wixxer killed Even Longer's partner Rather Short (Thomas Heinze), a new partner is assigned: Very Long. They start to investigate and suspect the Earl of Cockwood. However, the Earl (who officially raises pugs and unofficially smuggles girl groups, amongst other things) is affected by the Wixxer's ambitions as well. Their investigations bring the two inspectors back to London where they meet the dubious Harry Smeerlap (Lars Rudolph) and his men, who work for Cockwood. Smeerlap tries to conceal his racketeerings, but Very Long and Even Longer can finally arrest him. At the end they are able to finally identify the Wixxer: it is none other than Rather Short who killed the original Wixxer and assumed his identity.  Background  The film is based on a radio play that Oliver Kalkofe (together with Oliver Welke) performed in the 1990s during his time as a radio moderator at radio ffn. The film was shot mostly in the Czech Republic, i.e. in Hostivar studios, the Kladnice mine and around Prague. Three actors (Grit Boettcher as a waitress, Eva Ebner as Miss Drykant and Wolfgang V√∂lz as Sir John) who appear in this film, also appeared in some of the original Wallace films made in the 60s. Joachim Fuchsberger was approached for a role but, after hearing the title, disgustedly declined. However, after seeing the film on DVD, he agreed to appear in the sequel, .  Music  The title song The Wizard was performed by Right Said Fred and Anke Engelke (as her character Doris Dubinsky). The Wizard was originally performed by Madness of which Kalkofe is a big fan.

This result, the Herglotz-Riesz representation theorem, was proved independently by Gustav Herglotz and Frigyes Riesz in 1911. It can be used to give a related formula and characterization for any holomorphic function on the unit disc with positive real part. Such functions had already been characterized in 1907 by Constantin Carath√©odory in terms of the positive definiteness of their Taylor coefficients. Herglotz-Riesz representation theorem for harmonic functions A positive function f on the unit disk with f(0) = 1 is harmonic if and only if there is a probability measure Œº on the unit circle such that : f(re^{i\\\\theta})=\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} {1-r^2\\\\over 1-2r\\\\cos (\\\\theta-\\\\varphi) + r^2} \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\varphi). The formula clearly defines a positive harmonic function with f(0) = 1\\\\. Conversely if f is positive and harmonic and rn increases to 1, define : f_n(z)=f(r_nz). \\\\, Then : f_n(re^{i\\\\theta}) = {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} {1-r^2\\\\over 1-2r\\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\varphi) + r^2 }\\\\, f_n(\\\\varphi)\\\\,d\\\\phi =\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}{1-r^2\\\\over 1-2r\\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\varphi) + r^2 } d\\\\mu_n(\\\\varphi) where : d\\\\mu_n(\\\\varphi)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} f(r_n e^{i\\\\varphi})\\\\,d\\\\varphi is a probability measure. By a compactness argument (or equivalently in this case Helly's selection theorem for Stieltjes integrals), a subsequence of these probability measures has a weak limit which is also a probability measure Œº. Since rn increases to 1, so that fn(z) tends to f(z), the Herglotz formula follows. Herglotz-Riesz representation theorem for holomorphic functions A holomorphic function f on the unit disk with f(0) = 1 has positive real part if and only if there is a probability measure Œº on the unit circle such that : f(z) =\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} {1 + e^{-i\\\\theta}z\\\\over 1 -e^{-i\\\\theta}z} \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\theta). This follows from the previous theorem because: * the Poisson kernel is the real part of the integrand above * the real part of a holomorphic function is harmonic and determines the holomorphic function up to addition of a scalar * the above formula defines a holomorphic function, the real part of which is given by the previous theorem Carath√©odory's positivity criterion for holomorphic functions Let : f(z)=1 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \\\\cdots be a holomorphic function on the unit disk. Then f(z) has positive real part on the disk if and only if : \\\\sum_m\\\\sum_n a_{m-n} \\\\lambda_m\\\\overline{\\\\lambda_n} \\\\ge 0 for any complex numbers Œª0, Œª1, ..., ŒªN, where : a_0=2,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, a_{-m} =\\\\overline{a_m} for m > 0.

It spans across the Dnieper River connecting the left and right banks of the city, the Darnytsia and Holosiiv districts of Kyiv, respectively. The bridge carries a double track rail line and is built to accommodate six lanes of road traffic. Already in operation, the bridge complex currently lacks road connection ramps from some directions which are still under construction. Additional railroad links to match the new bridges' capacity are also being constructed. The bridge's expected capacity is 60,000 vehicles and 120 pairs of trains per day, which will serve as a major relief for both the Kyiv road and bridge network and as well as Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia national rail system. Location and design The new bridge is being constructed north of the existing Darnytskyi Railroad Bridge. History The bridge construction is the initiative of the late Heorhiy Kirpa, the head of Ukrzaliznytsia and the Minister of Transportation in the early 2000s (hence the unofficial name). The -span will cost an estimated $700 million. Its construction was ordered by the state-owned Ukrzaliznytsia rail company and financed by the government, but the Kyiv municipality co-sponsors the project. The main developer of the project is Kyivdniprotrans, and the main constructor is BMK Planeta-Mist. Following the construction of the bridge, a new major passenger terminal will be completed in the Darnytsia Railway Station on the left bank of the city. In July 2006 one third of the bridge was constructed and the first train was initially expected to run through the bridge in the second half of 2007.

According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Bangladesh being located on the Tropic of Cancer receives fairly direct radiation throughout the year and maintains relatively high temperature. Unusual haze in Motijheel, Dhaka (2020) Background Bangladesh lies at the bottom of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna (GBM) river system. Bangladesh is watered by a total of 57 trans-boundary rivers flowing to it: 54 from neighboring India and three from Myanmar. The country, which has no control of water flows and volume, drains to the Bay of Bengal. Coupled with the high level of widespread poverty and increasing population density, limited adaptive capacity, and poorly funded, ineffective local governance have made the region one of the most adversely affected on the planet. There are an estimated one thousand people in each square kilometer, with the national population increasing by two million people each year. Almost half the population is in poverty (defined as purchasing power parity of US$1.25 per person a day). The population lacks the resources to respond to natural disasters as the government cannot help them. In the 2017 edition of Germanwatch's Climate Risk Index, Bangladesh was judged to be the sixth hardest hit by climate calamities of 180 nations during the period 1996‚Äì2015. Effects Sea level rise Population density and height above sea level in Bangladesh (2010) Low-lying coastal regions, such as Bangladesh, are vulnerable to sea level rise and the increased occurrence of intense, extreme weather conditions such as the cyclones of 2007‚Äì2009, as well as the melting of polar ice. To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100 Effects on agriculture It was projected that by 2020, from 500 to 750 million people would be affected by water stress caused by climate change around the world. In most countries like Bangladesh, yields from rain-fed agriculture was predicted to be reduced to 50% by 2020. For a country with increasing population and hunger, this will have an adverse effect on food security. Although the effects of climate change are highly variable, by 2030, South Asia could lose 10% of rice and maize yields, while neighboring states like Pakistan could experience a 50% reduction in crop yield. As a result of all this, Bangladesh would need to prepare for long-term adaptation, which could be as drastic as changing sowing dates due to seasonal variations, introducing different varieties and species, to practicing novel water supply and irrigation systems.  Migration and displacement  Climate change has caused many citizens of Bangladesh to migrate and by 2013 already 6.5 million people had been displaced. Poor and other vulnerable population groups have been affected disproportionally. Dhaka as well as local urban centers are mostly the destination of migration caused by climate change. This leads to an increased pressure on urban infrastructure and services, especially around health and education and creates a heightened risk of conflicts. An increased number of floods, due to reduced river gradients, higher rainfall in the Ganges-Meghna-Brahmaputra river basins, and the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, is considered the major reason for migration in the context of climate change in Bangladesh over all. These floods not only lead to the erosion of arable land, but also have a negative impact on other income opportunities and often disrupt the livelihood patterns of whole families. In the northern regions of Bangladesh drought plays a major role in displacement of persons, in the South rising sea levels and cyclones are reasons for migration. Food security With a larger population facing losses in arable lands, climate change poses an acute risk to the already malnourished population of Bangladesh. Although the country has managed to increase its production of rice since the nation's birth ‚Äî from 10 million metric tons (MT) to over 30 MT ‚Äî around 30 percent of the population is still malnourished. Now more than five million hectares of land are irrigated, almost fourfold that in 1990. Even though modern rice varieties have been introduced in three-fourths of the total rice irrigation area, the sudden shift in population increase is putting strains on the production. Climate change threatens the agricultural economy, which, although it counts for just 20 percent of GDP, contributes to over half the labor force. In 2007, after a series of floods and cyclone Sidr, food security was severely threatened. Given the country's infrastructure and disaster response mechanisms, crop yields worsened. The loss of rice production was estimated at around two million metric tons (MT), which could potentially feed 10 million people. This was the single most important catalyst of the 2008 price increases, which led to around 15 million people going without much food. This was further worsened by cyclone Aila. In March 2017, extreme pre-monsoon rains and flash floods damaged 220,000 hectares of rice crops. Rice imports increased to three million tonnes from less than 100,000 tonnes the year before. A December 2018 study published by the American Meteorological Society found that climate change doubled the likelihood of the extreme pre-monsoon rainfall. =National and international policies= Given the frequent climate change- based catastrophes, Bangladesh needs to enhance food security by drafting and implementing new policies such as the 2006 National Sausage Policy. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported this policy through the \\"National Food Policy Capacity Strengthening Program\\" (NFPCSP). There is also an initiative for the start of a \\"Food Security Country Investment Plan\\" enabling the country to secure around US$52 million under the \\"Global Agriculture and Food Security Program\\" (GAFSP), making it Asia's first recipient. More work and better implementation from the government is necessary for activities to reach fruitful outcomes. Already, 11 ministries and governmental agencies are involved in this integrated endeavor. In the aftermath of the \\"East Pakistan Coastal Embankment plan\\" (CEP) in the mid-20th century, Bangladesh has recently started work on the \\"Master Plan for the South\\". The southern coastal area is vulnerable to the ill-effects of global climate. Crops, livestock, and fisheries of the southern delta are threatened. There are plans for a US$3 billion multi-purpose bridge named \\"Pad ma\\" to transform the agricultural sector in the region. The government estimates a GDP increase of around two percent as a result of the project. In an effort to achieve middle income country status by 2021, the government is focusing on increasing agriculture production, productivity, water management techniques, surface water infrastructure, irrigation, fisheries, and promoting poultry and dairy development. Bio fuels fit into this scenario by providing energy for agriculture. In 2006, the Ministry of Agriculture provided a 30 percent subsidy to diesel to power irrigation for farming, further proposing a 7,750 million BDT disbursement to help almost a million farmers with fuel. Mitigation policies Bangladesh loses land to rising sea levels, but gains land from sediment deposits. The effects of sea level rise and land accretion in Bangladesh are highly regional and variegated. Natural land accretion, paired with targeted policies to secure such land for farming use has the potential to partially mitigate the effects of land lost. As a Least developed country (LDC), Bangladesh is exempt from any responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are the primary cause of global warming. But lately this has been the rallying factor for policy makers to give off higher amounts of emissions in nearly all sectors with disregard for the environment. Large developed industrial nations are emitting increasing quantities of GHGs. The country cannot go far in their struggle with reducing emissions and fighting global warming with the considerable scantily supported funding and help it receives from the international community. There exist plans such as the \\"National Action Plan on Adaptation\\" (NAPA) of 2005, and the \\"Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan\\" (BCCSAP) of 2009. BCCSAP states that an integrated approach is necessary and the only way to gain sustainability is where economic and social development is pursued to the exclusion of disaster management, as one major calamity will destroy any socio-economic gains. Around 40‚Äì45 percent of GHG emissions are required to be reduced by 2020 and 90‚Äì95 percent by 2050. This is using the 1990 GHG concentration levels as a benchmark. With higher population and rapid industrialization, Bangladesh should be on its way to developing a low-carbon path given it initially receives significant financial and technical support from the international community and national goals of economic growth and social development is not hampered. But a more holistic short-term plan is also necessary. Bangladesh has established the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) allocating US$200 million and cumulating around further US$114 million respectively. Although 3000 cyclone shelters were constructed with over 40,000 trained volunteers and 10,000 km of embankments erected, Bangladesh should not only place emphasis on capacity building and disaster management but also institutional and infrastructure strengthening, development of research and low carbon technologies in order to create an inclusive and truly comprehensive mitigation scheme. Even though it is agreed that the willingness and cooperation of the current UNFCCC parties (194 member states as of 2011) is necessary to help the nation, funds like the Special Climate and LDC, Adaptation Fund should be easily made available.  Foreign aid and funding  Various countries have pledged to provide funding for adaptation and mitigation in developing nations, such as Bangladesh. The accord committed up to US$30 billion of immediate short term funding over the 2010-2012 period from developed to developing countries to support their action in climate change mitigation. This funding is available for developing nations to build their capacity to reduce emissions and responds to impacts of climate change. Furthermore, this funding will be balanced between mitigation and infrastructure adaptation in various sectors including forestry, science, technology and capacity building. Moreover, the Copenhagen Accord (COP 15) also pledges US$100 million of public and private finance by 2020, mostly to developing nations. Another misconception is that this accord will divert funding from poverty reduction. The private sector alone contributes more than 85 percent of current investments for a low carbon economy. In order to maximize any future contributions from this sector, the public sector needs to overcome the political and bureaucratic barriers the private sector has to face towards a low carbon future.

The songs from Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ feature him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing on this album also makes use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland's guitar playing also has unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks.

Although the L2D was intended for both civil and military application, the production run was largely reserved for the Japanese military as the Navy Type 0 Transport. The Nakajima prototype, powered by Pratt & Whitney SB3G radial engines, first flew in October 1939 and entered production in 1940 as the L2D1 with parts imported from the U.S. while the two Sh≈çwa examples were being assembled to Japanese production standards to simplify manufacture. Differing in minor details, mainly due to the use of locally produced Mitsubishi Kinsei 43 radial engines of similar power, the initial series from both companies were very similar to its Douglas antecedent. By 1942, Nakajima had built, including the prototype, 71 L2D2 Navy Type 0 Transport Model 11s and then embarked on manufacturing combat aircraft of their own design. Sh≈çwa, once their factory and production line was complete, built the next series, a total of 416 aircraft, including 75 cargo versions with the \\"barn door,\\" and reinforced floor (designated L2D2 1). The first Japanese military version was equipped with wide cargo doors, essentially mirroring the U.S. C-47, appearing about the same time. Other L2D variants, while normally unarmed, the L2D4 and L2D4-1 variants carried one flexible 13 mm Type 2 machine gun in a dorsal turret in the navigator's dome and two flexible 7.7 mm Type 92 machine guns that could be fired from fuselage hatches, but this armament configuration was not a production standard.Rickard, J. \\"L2D 'Tabby'.\\" History of War, 12 November 2008.

The most radical changes to the original design came about due to wartime exigencies in shortages of strategic materials, that led to metal components in less critical structural areas being replaced by wood.

The third was flown to Medan on Sumatera, however there were oil-leaks and it had to make an emergency landing and was abandoned. ('Japanese planes under Dutch command' by G.J.

Released in 2011, it is a retrospective compiling material from the band's albums Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, Significant Other, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, Results May Vary and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1).  Music and lyrics  The music of Icon has predominately been described as nu metal and is noted for \\"kinetic, frenzied energy\\". On this compilation, DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \\"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\\" Wes Borland's guitar playing on this compilation is experimental and nontraditional, and is noted for creative use of six and seven-string guitars. The songs from Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ feature him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing on this album also makes use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland's guitar playing also has unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The breakup with his girlfriend inspired the Significant Other songs \\"Nookie\\" and \\"Re-Arranged\\".  Critical reception  Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Icon \\"[provides] a good overview of the leading rap-metal outfit of the '90s.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  * Fred Durst - vocals * Wes Borland - guitars * Mike Smith - guitar on tracks 9 and 10 * Sam Rivers - bass * John Otto - drums, percussion * DJ Lethal - turntables, samples, keyboards, programming, sound development  References  2011 greatest hits albums Limp Bizkit compilation albums Albums produced by Rick Rubin ","title":"Icon (Limp Bizkit album)"},{"id":"34151508","text":"Hotel Imperial is a 1939 American dramatic film directed by Robert Florey. It stars Isa Miranda and Ray Milland.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Hotel Imperial The plot follows a 1917 play by the Hungarian writer Lajos B√≠r√≥: in the waning days of World War I, on the Russian-Austrian frontier, a young woman looking to avenge the suicide of her sister poses as a chambermaid in the Hotel Imperial. A Hungarian silent film was released in 1918, and an American version starring Pola Negri in 1927. The history of this production began in 1936, with Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer in the lead roles, but Dietrich clashed repeatedly with director Henry Hathaway. Filming resumed with Margaret Sullavan, who broke her arm, necessitating yet another cast change. Four years after the release of this version, Five Graves to Cairo (1943) moved the setting ahead to World War II and featured Franchot Tone and Anne Baxter. Milland had a near-fatal accident on the set. One scene called for him to lead a cavalry charge through a small village. Milland insisted upon doing this scene himself, but as he was making a scripted jump on the horse, his saddle came loose, sending him flying straight into a pile of broken masonry. Knocked unconscious for 24 hours, he was laid up in the hospital for weeks with multiple fractures and lacerations.

They form a portion of the 29% minority in the Czech Republic. They live primarily in Moravia, in the villages of Jevi≈°ovka (Frieli≈°tof), Dobr√© Pole (Dobro Polje) and Nov√Ω P≈ôerov (Nova Prerava). History The ancestors of the Croats in the Czech Republic arrived in the 1500s from central Croatia, fleeing before the Ottoman Turks. The period of their settling is at the same time as the arrival of the Croats to Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, who are called the Burgenland Croats. The migration of the Croats to Moravia got the attention of ethnographers, linguists, and historians in that era. The first mention of Croats was at the end of the eighteenth century. They tried to explain the reasons for the migration of the Croats from their ancestral homeland. They believed that the colonization of the Croats started from the Croatian regions south of the Kupa and Petrova Gora, better known as Banska Krajina [or today Banovina], was summarized by Adolf Turek. The Czech Croats lived without a main settlement in parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and Austria. Once, it used to be a continuous string of villages, especially the so-called \\"Croatian Corridor\\", assimilation and repression was brought onto the local Croats which directly affected the ties of the Czech Croats with the other Croatians in the Diaspora, especially the Burgenland Croatians. In fact, this corridor was known as link a between the Western Slavs and the Southern Slavs, more precisely, Slovene-Croat-Serb state or later, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Czechoslovakia itself. Croat-Prague student groups thought of the idea of a \\"Slavic corridor\\" that went between Bratislava and Varazdin. Later, idea of a \\"Croatian corridor\\" was given life and personally published by Stjepan Radiƒá. This idea as well as others that were national orientation, and started by the Croats ended ingloriously. However it did allow the creation of the Burgenland, the cradle of the Burgenland Croatians in neighboring Austria.http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/cromor.html Languages A saying of the Czech Croats was \\"We are a people of three languages.\\" Of all the national minorities, only the Croats were trilingual. They spoke German, and Czech and nurtured Croatian at home. Considering that they often used Czech and German in schools, churches, public administration, the grammar and vocabulary of the Moravian Croats did not remain untouched. The Croatian Cakavian and Ikavian language was mixed with loan words of both Czech and German origins. Croatian is not studied in Czech schools, so the majority younger generation does not speak it. The older generation of Czech Croats preserved the language, culture, and customs by gathering in organizations and reading magazines in Croatian.

She was member of the Congress of Deputies representing Madrid from 2004 until 2018.  Biography  Education and early life  Born in Valladolid in 1971, S√°enz de Santamar√≠a grew up as the only child of Pedro S√°enz de Santamar√≠a and Petra Ant√≥n. She studied law at university and she got a Licentiate Degree in Law in University of Valladolid in 1994, achieving rank 1 in her promotion, awarded top honors, with an academic record full of Honours and she obtained the Extraordinary Prize of Degree. After passing a \\"competitive public examination\\" (oposiciones), she joined the State Lawyers Corps (an elite body of civil servants). In 2005 S√°enz de Santamar√≠a married Jos√© Iv√°n Rosa Vallejo, whom with she has had a son, born on 11 November 2011.  Start of political career  S√°enz de Santamar√≠a in November 2011 during a campaign event at Alcal√° de Henares. In 2000, Mariano Rajoy‚Äôs former chief of staff hired her to work as advisor to the cabinet of the First Vice-President of the Government in the Ministry of the Presidency and the Ministry of Home Affairs.David Rom√°n (January 28, 2016), No problem has been too large or lethal for Rajoy‚Äôs deputy Financial Times. From 2004 to 2008 S√°enz de Santamar√≠a, served as secretary in the People's Party (PP) executive board, charged with the party's Regional and Local Policy. She ran as candidate to the Congress of Deputies, 19th in the PP list for Madrid vis-√†-vis the April 2004 general election.: As the PP obtained 17 seats in the constituency, she was not elected, but she assumed the office of deputy in the Lower House on 13 May 2004, covering the vacant seat caused by the resignation of Rodrigo Rato, who had been appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She served as legislator for the rest of the 8th term of the Cortes Generales. In the 9th term, she was chosen by Mariano Rajoy to become the Spokesperson for the People's Group in the Congress of Deputies, replacing Eduardo Zaplana.  Right hand of Rajoy at the Government  S√°enz de Santamar√≠a delivering a press conference at La Moncloa in May 2012, following a meeting of the Council of Ministers. Following the results of the 2011 general election, which delivered an absolute majority to the PP in the Congress of Deputies, Mariano Rajoy was invested Prime Minister and formed a new cabinet. S√°enz de Santamar√≠a became the Deputy Prime Minister and Spokesperson for the government on 22 December 2011. S√°enz de Santamar√≠a served in the Rajoy Government as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency from December 2011 to June 2018, as Spokesperson of the Government from 2011 to 2016, and as Minister for Territorial Administrations from November 2016 to June 2018. In 2014, for a brief time, she also assumed in acting capacity the portfolios of Health and Justice. On 27 October 2017, after Mariano Rajoy enforced the Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution on the Catalan government, dismissing regional premier Carles Puigdemont, S√°enz de Santamar√≠a was entrusted with the responsibility for overseeing the functions of the Generalitat of Catalonia.  Failed bid for party leadership  Wordmark used for her bid to party leadership On 5 June 2018, after the successful motion of no confidence on Mariano Rajoy, and the later's removal from the post of Prime Minister and his decision to also resign as leader of the People's Party, S√°enz de Santamar√≠a postulated herself as candidate in the upcoming primaries to elect a new party leader. Soraya Sa√©nz de Santamar√≠a edged the 1st position in the voting held among party members with a narrow margin of 1,500 votes over Pablo Casado, with otherwise staunch rival Mar√≠a Dolores de Cospedal coming in 3rd.

Distanced from the party executive board except for her spell at the helm of the area of Regional and Local Policy, it has been pointed out she built her political leadership outside from the party rather than from the inside. She was regarded as the theoretical representative of the most moderate wing within the PP.

The Cynthia Woods was named for his wife Cynthia Woods Mitchell. 2008 accident On June 6, 2008, the Cynthia Woods set sail in the Regatta de Amigos with a 6-person crew consisting of the captain (a university employee), along with four sailing team members (TAMUG students), and one safety officer who was a volunteer. The race started in Galveston, Texas at 2:00p.m. local time. The race finish was in Veracruz, Mexico. The boat is believed to have lost its keel in rough seas during the night. The boat was equipped with two transponders: a main one attached to the boat and a portable one provided by race officials for monitoring. The main transponder stopped working around midnight on June 6 and the portable stopped working around 9:00a.m. the next morning. The crew missed their scheduled 8:00a.m. check-in call on June 7. Safety officer Roger Stone woke up the crew down below and got them out of the boat before it sank, but he did not make it.

The Foundation does not receive any financial support from the government and is funded solely through donations from corporate sponsors, community fundraising and groups, events, donations and bequests from individuals.  History  The Foundation was established in 1984 to raise funds for health and medical research, which includes grants, medical trials and vital equipment at the Princess Alexandra Hospital; Queensland‚Äôs leading research hospital and largest clinical trials centre. Gardasil, the cervical cancer vaccine discovered by PA Research Foundation board member Professor Ian Frazer and the Brisbane Technique are just two familiar entries in a long list of significant achievements from the Princess Alexandra Hospital.  Fundraising and community activities  The PA Research Foundation is involved in a variety of events which help generate and raise significant funds. For over 12 years, the Foundation held Australia's Biggest Duck Race for Cancer Research, a fundraising event which saw over 40,000 rubber ducks race along the Brisbane River to raise funds for cancer research. The event concluded in October 2018. The Foundation also hosts The Smiddy Fun Run, an annual race around the PA Hospital Campus held every November in memory of Adam Smiddy, a PA Hospital Physiotherapist whose life was cut tragically short after being diagnosed with melanoma at the age of 26. In 2019, the Foundation revamped its Art Union Program introducing their Lucky Duck Lottery, with funds raised through ticket sales supporting life-saving cancer research at the PA Hospital Campus. Team PARF, the Foundation's online fundraising platform, encourages members of the community to participate in fundraising events to run, swim, cycle your way to lifesaving medical research.  Campaigns  The Foundation is also known to hold campaigns in collaboration with corporate partners, including Australian Leisure and Hospitality (ALH) Group, Aveo Group, Stellarossa and Australian Venue Co (AVC). ALH Group has fundraised for Project Pink since 2010, raising more than $2.5 million for breast cancer research at the PA Hospital Campus. Aveo Group have also championed Project Pink since 2016, with communities across Australia coming together to raise over $750,000 for breast cancer research. Stellarossa Stores around Queensland have also supported Project Pink, fundraising for breast cancer research since 2015. MANDATE - the Foundation's Men's Health Campaign, runs in AVC venues annually around Australia throughout the months of June and July. 2020 will be the 9th year MANDATE will run in AVC venues to raise funds for prostate cancer research, having raised over $1 million to date through the partnership.  Research grants  Each year, the Foundation funds research projects proposed by the clinicians, scientists and health professionals on the Princess Alexandra Hospital campus. The Foundation receives applications from health researchers on the campus which are then assessed by the Research Committee, an independent team of qualified medical professionals, and awarded based on merit and funds available. All research funded by the Foundation goes through a rigorous selection process to ensure it is of genuine scientific merit, and does not replicate any other research anywhere in the world. The philosophy of awarding research grants is to: * Support researchers and projects on the path to securing competitive funding. * Attract new researchers to the campus. * Provide assistance to new researchers in the early stage of their research career and, * Promote the culture of collaboration and group work within the PA research environment. Through the grants, the PA Research Foundation has been able to fund equipment, research fellowships and postgraduate scholarships, studies and provide project support that directly benefit research projects in areas such as cervical cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, leukaemia, breast cancer, heart disease, immunology, kidney disease, diabetes, liver disease, transplantation and arthritis.

Lesage was globally known in the art of embroidery and worked for the largest fashion and haute couture houses. His atelier is now part of Chanel through the company's subsidiary, Paraffection.  Early life and background  Lesage, of Norman origin, was the son of Albert and Marie-Louise Lesage. He had an older brother, Jean-Louis, and a twin sister, Christiane. In 1924, Lesage's parents took over the workshop of the embroiderer Michonet. The workshop, founded in 1858, was known for working with Parisian theatrical costume designers and producing special orders for the court of Napoleon III. The atelier supplied the best-known figures in Parisian couture, from Worth to Paquin and Madeleine Vionnet. Albert Lesage's first career was as a broker in international trade. He was taken prisoner during World War I and began a new life in Chicago, where he was hired as director-designer of the women's clothing department at Marshall Field's in 1919. Returning to Paris three years later, Albert joined Michonet (who was looking for a successor). Marie- Louise was an assistant in charge of embroidery for Madeleine Vionnet. She and Albert met at Michonet's, where Yo (as she was nicknamed) was sent to oversee orders from the dressmaker. When they took over the Michonet business, it was renamed Albert Lesage et Cie. The new company diversified, developing its own collection of embroidered accessories and printed fabrics. Albert encouraged his son to serve an apprenticeship at his side. Although he inherited his father's gift for drawing, Fran√ßois was a talented colorist like his mother. After the end of World War II, he opened a studio on Sunset Boulevard in 1948. Lesage settled in Hollywood and created embroideries for film-studio couturiers. Albert's death a year later interrupted his plans, and he returned to France at age 20 to join his mother. Lesage continuously expanded his collection of samples. Under his leadership, the maison became the preferred embroiderer of many fashion houses. \\"Embroidery is to haute couture what fireworks are to Bastille Day\\" was a maxim Lesage liked to repeat, summing up his philosophy about the craft. His boldness and imagination gradually opened the doors of international fashion, and American, Italian and Japanese designers drew on his talent. In 1987, a line of embroidered accessories was revived and sold in the Schiaparelli boutique on Place Vend√¥me.  Maison Lesage  In the Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles, Albert and Marie-Louise Lesage expanded their catalog with avant-garde motifs which were sought by a clientele for whom fashion was nurtured by art. One, Elsa Schiaparelli, became a faithful customer and began ordering embroideries inspired by the circus, astrological signs and the marine world in 1936. A bolero (\\"Chevaux Savants\\" with rearing embroidered horses, from the summer 1938 collection), a cape embroidered with sun rays, and gilt sequins from the following winter highlight the collaboration between the designer and the craftsman. Until she closed her business in 1954, Elsa Schiaparelli gave Lesage all her embroidery work. Albert Lesage found exceptional materials: Murano glass for small flowers and imitation semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, jade, turquoise rocks with black webbed patterns, artificial stones, pebbles and cabochons. He crushed gelatin sequins to give them the appearance of hammered coins, combined chenille and mink, and used metal blades and fish scales. Fran√ßois collaborated with Pierre Balmain, Cristobal Balenciaga and Christian Dior, and Jacques Fath, Jacques Heim, Robert Piguet, Jacques Griffe, Jean Dess√®s, Hubert de Givenchy, Gr√®s, Jean-Louis Scherrer and Marc Bohan (at Jean Patou) called on Maison Lesage. Like Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent worked only with Fran√ßois Lesage after they met in 1963; their collaboration lasted 44 years. Arguably the most famous are jackets with Vincent Van Gogh's Irises and Sunflowers for the summer 1988 collection, each of which required 600 hours of work. The iris jacket was made with 250,000 sequins in 22 colors, 200,000 beads and of ribbon. The 1980s began international collaborative relationships with Calvin Klein, Oscar de la Renta and Bill Blass. Karl Lagerfeld, who had just arrived at Chanel in France, began a professional relationship with Lesage in 1983. For Lagerfeld, Lesage was inspired by Boulle furniture and Coco Chanel's Coromandel panels. Chanel had never wanted to work with Lesage, since Schiaparelli was a rival. The Lesage archives are a source of inspiration for designers. A Vionnet sample was wanted by Azzedine Ala√Øa, for Dior by Galliano, and by Lagerfeld for Chanel. Each time, Lesage told them: \\"This is Vionnet. Claude Montana at Lanvin, John Galliano for Dior, Thierry Mugler, Marc Jacobs (at Louis Vuitton) and Jean-Paul Gaultier called on Lesage and his embroiderers. Lesage creations include a dress with a panther-skin effect, embroidered with tubes in color gradients from beige to brown, for the Jean Paul Gaultier winter 1998 collection. A loyal customer and friend, Christian Lacroix never stopped calling on Maison Lesage: \\"It is he who gave me a taste for embroidery. He is my couture godfather.\\" Lesage embroidered a \\"black tide\\" dress as a gift for the young designer Christian Le Drezen, who died in 2003. In the dress, crafted with bird feathers, shards of granite and seashells, Lesage wanted to commemorate the ecological disaster caused by the oil tanker Erika on the Brittany coast. Although fashion was an essential part of Lesage's work, the embroidery atelier also carried out special orders. In 1997, for France's World Youth Day, Lesage embroidered Pope John Paul II's chasuble and mitre. Roman Polanski and Erik Orsenna asked him to embroider l'habit vert for their 1999 induction into the French Academy. Jean-Loup Dabadie did the same in 2008, and so did Simone Veil and Dominique Bona after that.  Awards and recognition  Lesage was celebrated in a 1988 monograph, \\"Haute Couture Embroidery: The Art of Lesage\\" by Palmer White. An exhibit paid tribute to his talent at the Palais Galliera in Paris and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York (1987), the Fashion Foundation of Tokyo (1989) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (1991). Lesage received many awards: Regional Grand Prix for Arts Craftsmanship, the Medal of the City of Paris in 1984 and Knight of the Order of the Arts et M√©tiers (1985). He received the Grand Prix de la Cr√©ation of the City of Paris (1989). In 1994 Lesage was made a Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honor, and was promoted to the rank of Officer in 2007. He received the rank of Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters (2003). The craft industry (the M√©tier) named him Master of the Art in November 2011, a few weeks before his death.

Kaminski (born September 16, 1942) is a technologist and former U.S. government official, best known for his leading role in the development of stealth aircraft. Early life Kaminski was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He received his B.S. degree from the Air Force Academy in 1964. Later, he earned MS degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics and in Electrical Engineering from MIT, and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University. Military and government career Kaminski served 20 years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, mostly within Air Force Systems Command, rising to the rank of full colonel. Among other Air Force assignments, Kaminski was responsible for test and evaluation of inertial guidance components for the LGM-30 Minuteman missile and terminal guidance systems for the first U.S. precision-guided munitions.U.S. Missile Defense Agency, \\"Dr. Paul G. Kaminski Former Under Secretary of Defense 2011 Ronald Reagan Award Winner\\" (2011) In 1971 Kaminski was assigned to the National Reconnaissance Office and based in Los Angeles. There he led work on a space system and related \\"unconventional imaging\\" technology, including the flying of prototypes on low and high altitude aircraft. This assignment, possibly related to the Lacrosse radar satellite, continued until 1976Stanford University School of Engineering, \\"Alumni Profile: Paul Kaminski (PhD 1971 AA)\\" In 1976‚Äì77, Kaminski attended the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. During that time he met Under Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, and became Perry's Special Assistant in 1977. One of his assignments was to assess early work on stealth technology. Kaminski recommended going ahead with the creation of a large program that included, already by 1978, the experimental Have Blue airplane.David C. Aronstein and Albert C. Piccirillo, Have Blue and the F-117A: evolution of the \\"Stealth Fighter\\" (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). When Perry left government in 1981, Kaminski became Director for Low Observables Technology, with responsibility for overseeing the development, production and fielding of major stealth aircraft systems such as the F-117 (already well underway at the time) and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (which was just being defined), along with an advanced, stealthy cruise missile and other programs. Kaminski held this position from 1981 to 1984. Kaminski left the Air Force after 20 years service in 1984. After a decade in the private sector, he returned to government in 1994 as Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) from 1994 to 1997, under by-then Secretary of Defense William J.

However, he was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico in 1920. He was reelected in 1924 and 1928, this time with the Alianza Puertorrique√±a. From 1930 to 1933, he served as President pro tempore under Luis S√°nchez Morales. For the 1932 elections, he ran for the Republican Union party, being reelected once again. He remained in his seat until 1944, when he ran for Representative. Iriarte was member of the Commission of Reforms to the Organic Act formed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also member of the Status Commission from 1945 to 1946. In 1948, he returned to the Senate for the Statehood Party. In 1951, he was also member of the Constituent Assembly that created the Estado Libre Asociado, representing the Statehood Party. Iriarte died in January 1967, at the age of 80. He was buried at the Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

It was directed by Robert Florey and released by Warner Bros. on March 4, 1933. Two women stranded in Palm Beach become involved in the case of a new bride who goes missing on her wedding night. Plot Kay Curtis (Glenda Farrell) and June Dale (Mary Brian) are two showgirls living in the Palm Beach hotel. When June refuses one of her wealthy male friend's sexual advances, he chooses to let June and Kay pay for their own hotel bills. They decide to ask Daisy Bradford (Peggy Shannon), who is engaged to millionaire Henry Gibson (Ben Lyon), for help paying the bills because Daisy used to be a fellow showgirl. However, Daisy pretends not to know them. Kay tries to win some money gambling, but ends up losing all their money instead. When they run into Daisy's former boyfriend Raymond Fox (Lyle Talbot) in the hotel, he offers them some money to leave town, but June and Kay accidentally miss the train. Later, Henry and Daisy are married, but Daisy goes missing, and a gangster named Jim Hendricks is found dead in the hotel's garden. Henry offers a large reward to the public for any information about Daisy. Kay and June decide to find Daisy and claim the reward. After Henry, Kay, and June survive a near fatal car accident, Kay suggests that they wreck the car and declare Henry dead from the automobile accident. When Daisy returns to the hotel after Henry's assumed death, she claims that Henry had drugged and kidnapped her and killed Jim Hendricks. However, Kay pulls a gun on Daisy and she confesses that she was going to run away with Raymond, and when Jim Hendricks tried to stop them, Raymond killed him. Raymond and Daisy are arrested by the police, and Henry gives the reward to Kay. Later, Henry decides to marry June, who he has fallen in love with.

The original working title for the movie was \\"The Blue Moon Murder Case\\". Actors Murray Kinnell, Walter Huston and William Powell were considered for the film. And Florence Ryerson was initially assigned to write the script for the movie. Reception The New York Times movie review said: \\"The question of what happened to Peggy Shannon is worrying the principal characters in \\"Girl Missing\\", the new film at the Rialto, but the routine and slow-paced quality of the production makes the problem less acute for its audiences. Hidden away in the picture is the material for a lively melodrama which never realizes its full possibilities. The resources that the Warners have summoned to the task of telling this story include a good deal of unintelligent dialogue, feeble direction and an unconvincing arrangement of the narrative. The acting is of no great assistance, either. Ben Lyon plays the wealthy husband, Mary Brian and Glenda Farrell appear as a pair of interested chorus girls and Lyle Talbot enacts the r√¥le of Daisy's former lover.\\" Home media Warner Archive released a double feature DVD collection of Illicit (1931) and Girl Missing (1933) on December 13, 2010.

Nazi spies try to pry information out of a British agent.  Plot  In New York City, German agents arrange for Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) to take a taxi driven by one of their own men. The abduction goes awry when the taxi collides with another vehicle. Both driver and passenger are taken to the hospital in an ambulance attended by intern Dr. Mike Lewis (John Garfield). On the way, Jane regains consciousness and claims to have amnesia; she cannot remember who she is. The driver reports this to his superiors. Mike is excited, as this is his area of study, and persuades Dr. Murdoch (Roland Drew) to let him take the case. John Goodwin (Moroni Olsen) shows up and claims Jane is his daughter. However, after he leaves, Jane tells Mike that he is lying, and that she is actually working for British Intelligence. Mike does not quite believe her, especially when Goodwin returns with a famous specialist, Dr. Ingersoll (Raymond Massey), from whom Mike took a class. When Jane adamantly refuses to go home with her \\"father,\\" Ingersoll suggests that Mike go along to ease her mind. Jane agrees to this arrangement. In private, she tells Mike that she wants to find out as much as she can about the Nazi spy ring. Mike finds it suspicious that the Goodwin mansion is heavily staffed, and he is not permitted to go anywhere without an escort. When Steiner, a reluctant German agent, balks at kidnapping, he is kept prisoner at the mansion. He manages to pass a note to Mike, warning him that Jane is in great danger. This finally convinces Mike that she was telling the truth. Mike manages to get away, but this only confirms Ingersoll's suspicion that Jane is faking her amnesia. By the time Mike returns with Sheriff Dill, the mansion is deserted except for Ingersoll. Still trusting his old teacher, Mike accompanies him to the district attorney. Ingersoll, however, has him committed as a doctor who became too close to the psychotics he was studying. A guard offers to let Mike escape for $500, but turns out to be working for the spies; Mike ends up back in Ingersoll's hands. By threatening Mike, Ingersoll gets Jane to give him the location of a large convoy, which he passes along to a U-boat wolfpack. Mike manages to wrestle a gun away from a henchman. Jane (after informing Ingersoll she gave him the wrong information) notifies the authorities, who send bombers which sink the U-boats. Afterward, Mike and Jane are in a car that is rear- ended. Jane once again pretends to have lost her memory ... until Mike starts kissing her.

She also published a defense of the seriousness and importance of women‚Äôs writing. She proposed that both men and women should be treated as rational beings, arguing that ‚Äúit is all one for a woman to pen a story, as for a man to address his story to a woman.‚ÄùBell, Sandra. \\"The Broadview Anthology of Sixteenth Century Poetry and Prose.\\" Sandra Bell, Marie Loughlin, Patricia Brace In 1578, the publication of The Mirrour of Princely Deedes and Knighthood, Margaret Tyler's translation of Diego Ort√∫√±ez de Calahorra's Spanish romance, Espejo de Pr√≠ncipes y Cavalleros, was met with criticism because its masculine and secular topic was considered inappropriate for a woman. Other women had translated religious literature, as this conformed with the notion that female education should promote piety. Treaties and handbooks on education stressed the danger in allowing eager female students to read foreign tales of love. Tyler protested in her letter ‚Äúto the reader‚Äù against restrictions imposed on the literary efforts of women. Life Tyler's biography remains speculative. The identification of even her class and religion are difficult and controversial. The only certainties about her life are described in the dedicatory letter she wrote to Lord Thomas Howard in her translation of the first part of The Mirrour of Princely Deeds and Knighthood. In this dedication, Tyler explains that she was a servant to the aristocratic Howard family and describes herself as \\"middle-aged\\". Based on these two facts, some scholars have identified her as the wife of another servant, John Tyler, who was responsible for the duke's tenant and land records.Comparative Literature Studies, v044 44. References to \\"Tyler's wife\\" in a contemporary letter indicate that she may have served in the Howard family in the 1560s and served the Woodhouses and Bacons in the 1570s. A will written by a Margaret Tyler in 1595 at Castle Camps, a town near Cambridge, indicates that she may have had a son, Robert Tyler, and a daughter surnamed Ross. Some scholars, most notably Maria Ferguson and Louise Schleiner, believe that Tyler was Catholic since she served in the Catholic Howard family.Ort√∫√±ez, De Calahorra, Diego, Margaret Tyler, and Kathryn Coad. Margaret Tyler. Aldershot, England: Scolar, 1996. She may also have been Spanish-born, and would have journeyed to England with the retinue of √Ålvaro de la Quadra, the ambassador of Philip II. Ferguson, however, conjectures that Tyler may have been a pseudonym for Margaret Tyrell, who was related by marriage to the Howards. The source of Tyler's knowledge of Spanish is not known. Knowledge of the Spanish language was of value to English merchants at the time due to the importance of Spain‚Äôs economy. During that era, merchants' daughters or the servants of traveling diplomats may have learned the language. Major works The Mirrour of Princely Deedes and Knighthood The 1578 publication of The Mirrour of Princely Deedes and Knighthood, Margaret Tyler's translation of Diego Ort√∫√±ez de Calahorra's Spanish romance, was a dramatic entry into the literary realm. Throughout this romance, Tyler's translation follows the original closely and makes only some small changes. Tyler usually breaks a long sentence into shorter ones. She prefers clarity to preserving the elegance and flow of the original. She sometimes adds a few words and/or changes a chapter heading. For example, Tyler's chapter heading for chapter 29 emphasizes the hero's cross-dressing, whereas Ort√∫√±ez does not. Tyler also includes a sentence in chapter 15 that is not in Ort√∫√±ez version. An example of the similarity and differences between Ort√∫√±ez and Tyler's work can be seen in the views below. The Spanish and English version are both similar. In the opening sentence of the romance, the word-order and vocabulary in the translation are quite close to the original and only a slight difference is seen. > Despu√©s quel grande emperador Constantino pobl√≥ la gran ciudad de > Constantinopla de los nobles ciudadanos romanos, reedificando los antiquos > edificios fundados por Pausania, rey de los partos, entre todos los > emperadores que despu√©s d√©l sucedieron en el imperio griego ninguno paresce > que tanto se haya levantado, ni su nombre hiziesse tan famoso, como el > grande y muy nombrado emperador Trebacio, cuyos hechos y las inmortales > haza√±as de los cavalleros de su tiempo quiero aqu√≠ contar, seg√∫n que > Artimidoro el griego en los grandes vol√∫mines de sus cor√≥nicas lo dex√≥ > escripto, el qual dize ans√≠.5 [End Page 299] > After that the greate Emperour Constantine had peopled the Citie of > Constantinople, with the race of the noble Citizens of Rome, and had > reedified the auncient buildings founded by Pansanias king of the Parthes. > Among all the Emperours which succeeded in that Empire of Greece, none > seemed to have raysed his own name, or to have made it so famous, as the > great and mightie Emperour Trebatio. Whose worthy deedes with the valiant > actes of the knights of his time, I will report here, according as > Artimidoro the Grecian hath left them written in the great volumes of his > Cronicle. Tyler's translation was hugely successful, so much so that The Second Part of the Mirrour of Knighthood was soon commissioned, though this was translated by the Welsh poet Robert Parry, not Tyler. Tina Krontiris thinks this is probably because Tyler was by then \\"too old for another laborious translating task\\".Tina Krontiris, Oppositional Voices: Women as Writers and Translators of Literature in the English Renaissance, Routledge, 11 Jun 1997, p.154. The full series of the Spanish originals was eventually published in eight volumes. =Dedication to Thomas Howard= In the dedicatory letter to Thomas Howard, Tyler explains and justifies her actions, stating, \\"the earnestness of my friends persuaded me that it was convenient to lay forth my talent for increase, or to set my candle on a candlestick, and the consideration of my insufficiency drove me to think it better for my ease either quite to bury my talent...or rather to put my candle clean out than that it should bewray every unswept corner of my house; but the opinion of my friends' judgement prevailed above mine own reason.‚ÄùOrt√∫√±ez, De Calahorra, Diego, Margaret Tyler, translator, and Kathryn Coad, editor. Margaret Tyler. Aldershot, England: Scolar, 1996. She claims, in short, that she took on this labour to make her friends happy. She adds that she in no way meant for her work to sound ungrateful to the Howard family: ‚ÄúUnder your Honour‚Äôs protection, I shall less fear the assault of the envious, and of your Honour‚Äôs good acceptation.‚Äù Since she served Thomas Howard‚Äôs family, she felt the need to testify to him since his parents were already deceased. In the standard manner of such dedications, Tyler wanted to make sure she was seen grateful and loyal to the Howard family:\\"Books for Women in the 15th and 16th Century - All Empires.\\" Web. 30 Nov. 2011 \\"I bear to your parents while they lived, then being their servant, and now do owe unto their offspring after their decease, for their demerits.\\" =To the reader= Tyler's preface justifies her activity as a translator. Krontiris suggests that female translators were typically more literal than male ones, in order to emphasise their submissiveness. Tyler follows this convention, saying that \\"the invention, disposition and trimming of this story is wholly an other man's, my part none therein but the translation\\". However, after this standard declaration of modesty, Tyler defies convention by asserting her right as a woman to authorship.Krontiris, p. 22. She implicitly concedes that men might retain a right to \\"discourse in learning\\", but never directly accepts it. However, she confidently affirms that story-telling is the province of both sexes, and thus it is \\"all one\\" whether a tale is told by a woman or a man.

It is inspired by the Spanish jota style of music and also contains Native American and Mestizo elements. Sandunga is a rarely used word in the Spanish language that can be translated in a variety of ways including; gracefulness, elegance, charm, wit, and celebration. The melody of the song is believed to have originated from Andalusia and it was rearranged by Zapotec musician Andres Gutierrez (Whose name is Ndre Sa‚Äôa in the Zapotec language). The lyrics were written by M√°ximo Ram√≥ Ortiz in 1853 after the death of his mother. Ortiz, who served as governor of Tehuantepec also wrote the song in part to promote independence of the isthmus from the Mexican government. The song tells of a Zapotec woman mourning the death of her mother while crying out, \\"Sandunga\\". Vela Sandunga The city of Tehuantepec is divided into neighborhoods called barrios, each of which has its own church. Every year celebrations called velas are held in honor of the patron saints of these churches. The most important of these velas is the Vela Sandunga, which is held during the last week of May. This vela is celebrated all week long throughout the entire city and is held to commemorate the creation of this song. A large festival is held, featuring presentations of musicians from the Conservatoire de Paris, the election of a festival queen, and a parade dedicated to the evolution of Tehuantepec traditional dress. The vela concludes with a procession in honor of Saint Dominic, the patron saint of the Isthmus. Notable Versions \\"La Sandunga\\" has been covered by many artists including Chavela Vargas, Jaramar, Lila Downs, Susana Harp, Los de Abajo, Guadalupe Pineda, and Raphael. As early as 1946 it was recorded in the United States by the Viva America Orchestra as conducted by Alfredo Antonini with Elsa Miranda and John Serry Sr. for Alpha records (Latin American Music #12205A, 12205B, 12206A,12206B).Latin American Music - Alfredo Antonini and Viva America Orchestra sound recording at the Library of Congress Online Catalog at Catalog.loc.gov Latin American Music at the Library of Congress Online Catalog catalog.loc.govThe Billboard. \\"Advanced Record Releases - Alfredo Antonini and Viva America Orchestra\\", New York, Vol. 58 No. 14, 6 April 1946, P. 34 & P. 130 Latin American Music - Alfredo Antonini and Viva America Orchestra in Billboard on books.google.com Film A 1938 Mexican film titled \\"La Zandunga\\" featured this song in its soundtrack.

Her sculptural works are primarily composed of blooming arrangements of large rigid objects such as televisions, small appliances, camping and construction trailers, hot water heaters, mattresses, airplane parts, rowboats, kayaks, canoes, surfboards, and other objects. Works such as Big Edge at CityCenter in Las Vegas contain over 200 boat vessels. Stainless Steel, Aluminum, Monochrome I, Built to Live Anywhere, at Home Here, at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, contains 66 used aluminum boats and rises to a height of 30 ft. Early life and career Rubins was born in Naples, Texas. Her family moved to Cincinnati before settling in Tullahoma, Tennessee. She studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland, where she received her BFA in 1974, and then at the University of California, Davis where she received her MFA in 1976. Rubins taught at Virginia Common Wealth University and Florida State University in Tallahassee before moving to New York. In New York, along with teaching she ran a house painting business. Rubins resides in Topanga, California, and taught at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1982 to 2004. Work In college, Rubins worked primarily with clay, creating igloo-like sculptures out of mud, concrete, and straw.Elizabeth Hayt (May 2, 1999), Monuments of Junk Artfully Compacted New York Times. She was inspired by the work of Peter Voulkos and Robert Arneson. She ended up at UC Davis finishing her MFA and studying with Arneson. Rubins avoided the characteristic permanence of ceramics with the constant disassembling of sculptures, collapsing her work back into the slip bucket or back into raw scraps. Her 1974 piece Mud Slip, Army-Surplus Canvas and Used Cups from Coffee Machine combined found materials with wet clay; it lasted only as long as the clay stayed wet. Her creation of unlikely assemblages grew as she began to incorporate more detritus and found materials into her work. After college, Rubins taught night classes at City College of San Francisco and scavenged the local Goodwill and Salvation Army stores in San Francisco, where she was living at the time, collecting nearly 300 television sets for 25 to 50 cents apiece. In 1977 she taught for a year at Virginia Commonwealth University where she started working with used appliances. Rubins was privately commissioned to create her first public installation in 1980. Big Bil-Bored was a controversial artwork, voted \\"Ugliest Sculpture in Chicago\\" in a radio poll. Constructed of various discarded appliances, the installation towered forty-three feet high outside of the Cermak Plaza shopping center in Berwyn, Illinois. Big Bil-Bored Soon after, Rubins was offered a commission for another public installation. In 1982, the Washington Project for the Arts funded Rubins's Worlds Apart, a forty-five foot tall temporary installation composed of abandoned appliances, concrete and steel rebar. Her work overlooked the Whitehurst Freeway, blocks from the Watergate Building in Washington D.C., and again caused controversy. The sculpture was taken down as soon as the permit expired. While in Washington Rubins was contacted by artist Charles Ray to teach at UCLA where she met Chris Burden. Big Bill Bored, 1980. Rubins is perhaps best known for building sculptures out of salvaged airplane parts, such as an installation in 1995 for the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the piece weighed nearly 10,000 pounds.Jori Finkel (June 25, 2006), A Bouquet of Boats Blooming at Lincoln Center New York Times. Already by the mid-1980s she had begun regularly using abandoned airplane parts in her work. Her contact for the plane parts was Bill Huffman in the Mojave desert. For durability, she chose aluminum, fiberglass and composites rather than wood. Rubins collaborated with husband Chris Burden on a number of projects, including an installation called A Monument to Megalopolises Past and Future at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) in 1987. In the late 1980s Rubins started working with discarded mattresses which were inspired by pastries she saw in Vienna - both relate to dreams in her mind. In 1993 she made a sculpture of cakes and mattresses at UCLA. It was shown at Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York Boats entered Rubins' sculptural vocabulary in 2000s.Nancy Rubins: Skins, Structures, Landmasses, June 3 - July 9, 2010 Gagosian Gallery, Los Angeles. Rubins also started working with assembling discarded cast- aluminum playground structures. Most of these structures were built out of melted down WWII materials. These pieces were shown at the Gagosian gallery in 2014. Aside from sculpture, Rubins is known for her large scale graphite drawings which resemble lead sheets.Pleasure Point projecting out from the roof at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, La Jo lla. 2007 Exhibitions Rubins's work has been shown internationally.

Chanda is identified within the Buddhist Abhidharma teachings as follows: * One of the six occasional mental factors in the Theravada Abhidharma; in this tradition, chanda is a factor that can have positive or negative result depending upon the mental factors that it is co- joined with. * One of the Ten mahƒÅ-bh≈´mika in Sarvastivada Abhidharma. * One of the five object-determining mental factors in the Mahayana Abhidharma; that is a factor that grasps the specification of the object. * One of the eight antidotes applied to overcome obstacles in Samatha meditation within the Mahayana tradition. Definitions Theravada tradition Ajahn Sucitto states: :Desire as an eagerness to offer, to commit, to apply oneself to meditation, is called chanda. It‚Äôs a psychological ‚Äúyes,‚Äù a choice, not a pathology. In fact, you could summarize Dhamma training as the transformation of ta·πáhƒÅ into chanda. Ajahn JayasƒÅro states: Western presentations of Buddhist teachings have often led to the understanding that suffering arises because of desire, and therefore you shouldn‚Äôt desire anything. Whereas in fact the Buddha spoke of two kinds of desire: desire that arises from ignorance and delusion which is called ta·πáhƒÅ ‚Äì craving ‚Äì and desire that arises from wisdom and intelligence, which is called kusala-chanda, or dhamma-chanda, or most simply chanda. Chanda doesn‚Äôt mean this exclusively, but in this particular case I‚Äôm using chanda to mean wise and intelligent desire and motivation, and the Buddha stressed that this is absolutely fundamental to any progress on the Eightfold Path.... ' The Abhidhammattha-sangaha states: :Chanda here means desire to act (kattu-kamata), that is to perform an action or achieve some result. This kind of desire must be distinguished from desire in the reprehensible sense, that is, from lobha, greed and raga, lust. Whereas the latter terms are invariably unwholesome, chanda is an ethically variable factor which, when conjoined with wholesome concomitants, can function as the virtuous desire to achieve a worthy goal. The characteristic of chanda is desire to act, its function is searching for an object, its manifestation is need for an object and that same object is its proximate cause. It should be regarded as the stretching forth of the mind's hand towards the object. Mahayana tradition The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is interest? It is the desire to endow a desired thing with this or that particular attribute, and has the function of laying the foundation for making a start on assiduous striving. Alexander Berzin describes 'dun pa as the mental factor \\"to obtain any object, to achieve any goal, or to do something with the object or goal once obtained or achieved.\\"Berzin Archives glossary entry for \\"'dun pa\\" Berzin explains: :So we have intention (‚Äôdun-pa, Skt. chanda). The intention is the wish to obtain an object, or to achieve a goal, or to do something with it. It can be to meet with what we‚Äôve previously met with, not to be parted with what we‚Äôre presently being aware of, or it can be keen interest to engage with something in the future. So Buddha has the intention to benefit everybody. I mean, we have intention all the time. I‚Äôm looking at this cup of water, paying attention to it, etc., and there‚Äôs the intention: What am I going to do with it? I‚Äôm going to pick it up and drink it. So, obviously, because we have intention we would like to make it pure and have a pure intention to benefit everybody‚Äîno matter what we‚Äôre doing, may it be of benefit to everyone.Developing the Mind Based on Buddha-Nature, Session Two: Primary Consciousness and Mental Factors, Alexander Berzin Alternate translations * Aspiration (Jeffery Hopkins) * Desire to act (Bhikkhu Bodhi) * Desire as an eagerness to commit (Ajahn Sucitto) * Intention (Erik Pema Kunsang, Alexander Berzin) * Interest (Herbert Guenther) * Zeal (Nina van Gorkom) See also * Mental factors (Buddhism) * Ta·πáhƒÅ References Sources  External links * http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma2/becono2.html - an article by P.
