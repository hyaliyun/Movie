It has elicited controversy around its desire to decentralise the conversion process and is associated with the Tzohar network of rabbis. At present they have received wide support around the Jewish world. but the Chief Rabbis are unwilling to accept their authority.  Creation  The organisation was started by a series of rabbis who wanted to challenge the existing monopoly that the Chief Rabbinate had over conversions to Judaism. These included rabbis Seth Farber, Chuck Davidson and Nahum Rabinovitch. The organisation soon grew with the addition of several high-profile rabbis, including rabbis David Stav, Slomo Riskin, Nahum Rabinovitch and Yisrael Rosen, amongst others. The organisation has continued to grow, and as of the beginning of 2019 there are more than 70 rabbis who are actively converting people, with a particular focus on children prior to their bar or bat mitzvah.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5458400,00.html  Legality  In the Knesset, Elazar Stern presented a bill to legalise an alternative path to conversions outside of the Chief Rabbinate, although significant opposition existed to the passing of the law from the Haredi political parties, and their pressure was sufficient to prevent the bill passing into law. However, the status of the people converted by Giyur KeHalacha is a significant struggle today in Israel, with efforts, both legislative and legal, ongoing. These political-legal manoeuvrings are significant in Israel since Halacha is strongly entwined in the day to day running of the state, and specifically the Chief Rabbinate, which controls the conversion process, and uses this power to decide who can get married, and who can be buried in a Jewish cemetery.  Halacha  Giyur KeHalacha follows Orthodox Halacha, while easing some of the harsh restrictions of the large centralised beth dins. In addition to Giyur KeHalacha there are other independent conversion courts, such as Ahavat HaGer.  Controversy  The Chief Rabbinate courted significant controversy when they cancelled many of the conversions performed under the auspices of Giyur KeHalacha, or otherwise not accepting conversions done by the group. This act has no basis in Halacha. When the Supreme Court rejected the cancelling of conversions, the ultra-Orthodox communities attempted to pass a new law to by-pass the courts. In Australia, the local rabbis refused to accept the legitimate conversions performed through the Beth din of rabbi Yisrael Rosen, a member of Tzohar and Giyur Kehalacha.

The shrine is dedicated to the 12th century warrior-saint Khaliq Walid, popularly known instead as Khalid Walid (not to be confused with Islam's Khalid ibn Walid of Arabia). The shrine dates from the period of the medieval Delhi Sultanate, and may be the earliest Muslim funerary monument in South Asia. The shrine represents the first stage of evolution of funerary monuments in southern Punjab which would later culminate with the Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam in Multan. History The tomb dates from between the last quarter of the 12th century, and the early decades of the 13th century. The shrine bears an inscription stating that the shrine was built by Ali bin Karamakh, who served as Governor of Multan during the reign of Muhammad of Ghor. The tomb was rediscovered and identified as the shrine of Khalid Walid by Dr Ahmad Nabi Khan and Kamil Khan. Architecture The shrine features elements of military architecture, such as bastions and crenellations. Exterior The shrine assumes the form of a fortified rectangle measuring 70 by 90 feet, and is capped by a low and sloped dome, with an exterior made of plain brick and inward sloping walls that may derive from Seljuk architecture from Central Asia. The use of wooden bands horizontally across the shrine, and use of both glazed and cut brick also represents the influence of Central Asian Seljuk architecture. The shrine reflects elements of military architecture, with semicircular bastions in each of the shrine's corners, as well as in the middle of 3 of the 4 walls. The western wall of the shrine features a small projection, indicating the location of the mihrab. The roofline is decorated with crenellations - a feature commonly employed in fortified structures such as the Rohtas Fort. Similar influence of military architecture is found at the Tomb of Shah Rukn- e-Alam in Multan. Interior The shrine's interior is square shaped measuring 24 feet on each side, with entrance on each side that open to vaulted galleries, and rectangular shaped chambers on the east and west side of the shrine. The interior space is divided into a series of galleries The shrine's interior walls are decorated with cut-brick designs. The shrine is notable for its exceptional mihrab made of cut and molded brick, decorated with Kufic calligraphy, capped with a hood similar to a baldachin.

In Chinese communities, especially in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, wedding door games are challenges set up by the bridesmaids for the groom as a ceremonial demonstration of the groom's love for the bride. These games typically take place in the morning of the wedding at the bride's family home, before the groom is allowed to receive the bride in the bride's room. The groom typically receives the help of his groomsmen in completing the tasks. Common games include the consumption of unpleasant foods, answering of questions pertaining to the bride and the bride and groom's relationship, and performance of song and dance. Negotiations are commonly made regarding the bridesmaids' demands, accompanied almost always by bargaining concerning the red envelope offerings to the bridesmaids. These games originated in ancient Chinese folk customs, and have been elaborated on in modern times. These games are distinct from the practice of ' () in China, sometimes confusingly also known as wedding games, in which the couple, particularly the bride, is teased by their guests during or after the wedding.  Naming  Door games are known in Chinese in mainland China as \\"games with which to receive the groom\\" ' or \\"games with which to block the door\\" ' . In Hong Kong, the process is known in Cantonese as \\"playing with the groom\\" (). In Malaysia, these games are called heng dai games, after the Cantonese word referring to the groomsmen (), while in Singapore, the process is known as the wedding gatecrash.  Typical components  Before the games start, the groom and groomsmen must first pay a fee in order for the bridesmaids to open the door. It is common for the groom and groomsmen to prepare red envelopes filled with cash that they use to negotiate with the bridesmaids who guard the door. These amounts are usually in multiples of auspicious numbers, such as the number 8 that signifies wealth, or 9, that signifies a long-lasting union. Groomsmen often will carry ample amounts of red envelopes and try to negotiate with the bridesmaids as to the amount of red envelopes that is required before they agree to open to the door. Door games usually include the consumption of unpleasant or strange food or drink. In particular, grooms are made to consume foods that are sour, sweet, bitter and spicy () in succession, to signify his resolve to weather the joys and sorrows of marriage with his partner. Bitter foods used for this purpose include bitter tea and bitter gourd, while spicy foods include wasabi and chilli padi. In addition, declarations of love through words, songs and poems from the groom may also be requested. It is not uncommon for door games to also include physical tests, such as push-ups, and cross-dressing, especially in Malaysia and Singapore.  Contemporary opinions   Singapore  Wedding door games are an opportunity for grooms to demonstrate their resolve and commitment, which some brides appreciate. The practice is also seen by some as a valued tradition and a rite of passage. Wedding games may also add to the fun and excitement of the wedding. However, the prospect of these challenges may induce anxiety in grooms before the wedding. In addition, many couples are becoming disillusioned about the meaning provided by such games, noting that the games are humiliating and labour-intensive to prepare. Some couples set boundaries on the games, such as excluding sexual elements. One wedding photographer estimated in 2016 that roughly 20% of Singaporean Chinese couples do away with such wedding door games, even while retaining the other elements of a traditional Chinese wedding.

The poem is about how the English people, although naturally peaceful, slowly become filled with a hate which will lead to the advent of a new epoch. The first four stanzas have four lines each with alternate rhymes, while the fifth (and final) stanza has five lines. The last line of every stanza ends with \\"... the English began to hate\\". The context is the anti-German sentiment in Britain during World War I. Kipling was known for never portraying Germans in a positive light, and had been the first to use the word \\"Hun\\" as a slur for Germans. The poem was written following the death of his son in that war. The poem first appeared in Kipling's 1917 collection A Diversity of Creatures, where it accompanies the short story \\"Mary Postgate\\".

Out of the over 1000 people arrested, 676 non-violent offenders were released because of jail overcrowding, ability to obtain bail or to attend court dates. Most of the charges were for misdemeanors. Of the arrestees, 35 have been identified as being eligible for Salt Lake's drug court. One person declined the offer of drug court. Each qualified arrestee must go to a drug bed for long-term addiction treatment. Completion of drug court means that any current and previous drug charges will be expunged from their record. Saturday, 24 August 2019 The purge is causing a spillover into outlying neighborhoods. It is also causing spillover into southern Utah and authorities there are worried about collateral impact such as theft, vandalism, loitering, trespassing, drug dealing, public intoxication, and violence. Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes and Department of Public Safety Commissioner Keith Squires also emphasized that the law enforcement prong of Operation Rio Grande‚Äîits name aside‚Äîwon't be confined to the Rio Grande area. If wrongdoers \\"run and try to hide at the Jordan River, we're going to the Jordan River. If they're going to South Salt Lake, we're going to South Salt Lake. West Valley‚Äîwere going there,\\" Hughes said. \\"This is not about a geographic area, per se, as it is what has hurt this community, the state and the people that live in it. And we're going to eradicate that.\\" The house speaker, and also Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox estimate the two year cost of the operation to be $67million.

He refused his resignation to Pius VII in 1801, contributing by this refusal to elicit the schism of the Little Church of the Two S√®vres. Refractory to the civil constitution of the clergy, he also became refractory to the concordat. A significant part of his clergy followed him and returned to resistance. Letters from the exile, false or authentic, maintain the movement of resistance in the parishes. Dissenting parish priests are either displaced or tolerated. In 1803, on a report from Dupin, Prefect of the Deux-S√®vres, Bonaparte asked the King of Spain to arrest Coucy.

It is a rare marine eukaryote consisting of a number of cells embedded in a jelly-like matrix. This organism demonstrates a very primitive level of cell differentiation and specialization. This is seen with flagellated cells and their collar structures that move the cell colony through the water. Similar low level cellular differentiation and specification can also be seen in sponges. They also have collar cells (also called choanocytes due to their similarities to choanoflaggellates) and amoeboid cells arranged in a gelatinous matrix. Unlike S. rosetta, sponges also have other cell-types that can perform different functions. Also, the collar cells of sponges beat within canals in the sponge body, whereas Salpingoeca rosetta‚Äôs collar cells reside on the inside and it lacks internal canals. Despite these minor differences, there is strong evidence that Proterospongia and Metazoa are highly related. Its genome has been studied as a model for Premetazoan evolution. The genome is 55 megabases in size. Homologs of cell adhesion, neuropeptide and glycosphingolipid metabolism genes are present in the genome. Salpingoeca rosetta colonies Sexual cycle S. rosetta has a sexual cycle during which it transitions between haploid and diploid stages. When nutrients become limiting, haploid cultures of S. rosetta become diploid. This ploidy shift coincides with mating during which small, flagellated cells fuse with larger flagellated cells. Evidence has also been obtained for historical mating and recombination in S. rosetta. S. rosetta can be induced to undergo sexual reproduction by the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. A single protein of V. fischeri, EroS, fully recapitulates the aphrodesiac-like activity of living V. fischeri. Colonial organization S. rosetta was named for the rosette- shaped colonies formed by its cells. The colonies are held together by adhesion molecules long thought to be found only in Metazoan organisms. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a bacterial sulfonolipid, called rosette inducing factor (RIF-1) and produced by Algoriphagus machipongonensis, triggers colony formation in S. rosetta. The effect of RIF-1 on colony formation in S. rosetta has been suggested as an example of how interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes may have led to multicellularity in the latter.

It is connected to the X-Men film series, and follows two parents who take their family on the run after discovering their children's mutant abilities. The pilot was written by series creator Matt Nix, with frequent X-Men film director Bryan Singer directing the episode. The Gifted received a put pilot commitment in July 2016, with Nix attached to write. An official pilot order came in January 2017, with Singer joining then. Casting began in February for a March filming start, in Dallas, Texas. The episode introduces an alternate timeline to the X-Men films where the X-Men team has disappeared, and focuses on the discrimination that mutant face from other people and the government. The show stars Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker, with Sean Teale, Natalie Alyn Lind, Percy Hynes White, Coby Bell, Jamie Chung, Blair Redford, and Emma Dumont. Stan Lee also appears, in a cameo appearance. \\"eXposed\\" aired on Fox on October 2, 2017. It was watched by 4.9 million viewers, and received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its social commentary and cast. Plot In Atlanta, Georgia, police pursue a mutant, Clarice Fong, who has used her ability to create portals to escape prison. She is found by a group of mutants from an underground community of mutants, including Lorna Dane / Polaris, John Proudstar / Thunderbird, and Marcos Diaz. They promise to help her get to safety, but when Diaz is shot, Polaris attacks the officer who shot him until she is captured. The others escape. The next day, district attorney Reed Strucker tries to convince Polaris to cooperate with him in exchange for a reduced sentence, and notifies her that an examination revealed her to be pregnant. His children, Lauren and Andy, attend their school dance, where Andy is forced into a locker room by a group of bullies, until he screams and the whole building begins to break apart around them. Lauren races to find her brother, protecting herself and others from falling debris by conjuring shields out of the air. She finds Andy and the two flee. At home, Andy explains to their mother Caitlin that he has developed mutant abilities and caused the incident at the dance, while Lauren reveals her own mutant abilities which she has been hiding for three years, knowing that any mutant that uses their powers is arrested and taken to detention centers by prosecutors like their father Reed. Agent Jace Turner of the Sentinel Services (SS) arrives at the Strucker house, looking for the children. The three of them escape and meet up with Reed, who suggests fleeing to safety in Mexico. Reed contacts Diaz, and offers to give him information on Polaris in return for the mutant underground's help in getting them to Mexico. They meet with Diaz that night, with the mutant having not informed the other members of the underground of this. Turner and the SS arrive at the meeting, and release robotic devices that attack the group. They are saved by the appearance of Proudstar and Fong, the latter creating a portal for them all to escape, but Reed is not able to make it through and is captured. Production Development Bryan Singer, director of several of the X-Men films, returned to direct the pilot episode of The Gifted. In July 2016, after a series based on the Hellfire Club, an X-Men comic property, did not move forward at Fox, the network made a put pilot commitment for a different X-Men based series. The new pilot, written by X-Men fan Matt Nix, was for an action-adventure series based on ordinary parents discovering their children's mutant abilities. Early versions of Nix's pilot script were received \\"enthusiastically\\" by Fox executives, and Fox chairman and CEO Gary Newman was expecting a final draft in early January 2017, with a pilot pickup within a few weeks of that. Fox officially ordered the series to pilot on January 24, and later revealed it to be titled \\"eXposed\\", and premiering in October. Bryan Singer revealed on January 25 that he would direct the pilot, after previously directing several of the X-Men films. He decided to do this after a change in schedule for a film he was directing. He stressed that \\"tonally and visually it will be very, very different\\" from the films, and said that \\"some stuff [will] go down, visually, but at its heart it's a story about a family\\". Singer began prepping for production on January 27. When Singer first discussed the pilot with Nix, he compared Nix's description of it to the film Running on Empty; Nix had used that film in his original pitch for the series to executives, describing it as \\"Running on Empty with mutants\\". Writing Nix described the series as coming \\"at the world of mutants from the side\\"; the films and comics \\"have generally started with the X-Men and encountered the world outside\\" from their perspective, but the series looks to \\"take place inside the world of people who are [not] already X-Men and [do not yet] know that world.\\" These issues reflect modern, real-world problems such as police attempting to kill mutants just because they look different, or the government only taking issue with mutants if they reveal themselves in public. Nix was influenced by the comic District X which is \\"just about a district in New York. It's where the mutants are ... dealing with crime, drugs, their relationships to each other.\\" When the Strucker children discover their abilities, Nix wanted to avoid clearly defining exactly what those abilities are immediately since \\"when your powers manifest, they don't come with a label. It's not like somebody pops up and says, 'Hey! You can do this!' When we think about powers on the show, what's the organic relationship between this person as a living, breathing human being, and their power? The idea is that what your power is and what you can do is influenced by who you are as a character.\\" Nix decided to end the episode with the main characters separated, to avoid them \\"settling into a rut, saving a mutant every week. Separating them gives everybody a really deep emotional connection. On the mutant side, Eclipse wants Polaris back. On the Strucker side, they all want Reed, and they‚Äôve gotta figure out where he is. There‚Äôs a lot to do. I wanted to set up the pilot with plenty to do and a big emotional connection to what they‚Äôre doing, to keep the story personal.\\" He added, \\"The end of the pilot was really about getting these people together for a common problem, but they don't know each other, so what's going to happen now?\\" Casting In February 2017, Blair Redford was cast, later confirmed as John Proudstar / Thunderbird; Jamie Chung was cast as Clarice Fong / Blink, Stephen Moyer was cast as Reed Strucker; and Sean Teale was cast as Marcos Diaz / Eclipse. The next month, Natalie Alyn Lind joined as Lauren Strucker; Amy Acker was cast as Caitlin Strucker; Emma Dumont as Lorna Dane / Polaris; Percy Hynes White as Andy Strucker; and Coby Bell as Jace Turner. The guest cast for the episode was revealed in September 2017, including Joe Nenners as Agent Ed Weeks, Matthew Tompkins as D.A. Cal Jones, Steffan Argus as Jack, Dalton Gray as Jake, Pierce Foster Bailey as Trevor, Giovanni Devito as Dax, Toks Olagundoye as Carla, and Jeff Daniel Phillips as Bartender. Dale Godboldo also guest stars in the episode, and Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance. Additional appearances in the episode include Dinarte de Freitas as Pedro, Josh Henry as Ben, Jason Jamal Ligon as Side-Eye, Hayley Lovitt as Sage, and Jermaine Rivers as Shatter. Filming Filming for the pilot, under the working title Heaven, began on March 13, 2017, in Dallas, Texas, and was completed by April 11. During filming, Moyer, Acker, Lind, and White spent time together doing \\"silly family activities around town\\", including a trip by Lind and White to Six Flags. For Lee's cameo, the producers learned that he was in Dallas for a comic book convention, and were told that the cameo could be filmed if it was done within a free two-hour period that Lee had before he was flying home. The scene was improvised at a bar location in 20 minutes, with actors who had not expected to be filming that day. Nix said that is \\"the kind of thing where I think people sometimes underestimate the degree to which we who make the show are just another group of fanboys trying to make something happen by the skin of our teeth.\\" Some reshoots for the pilot had also been carried out by the end of April. Moyer explained that his character was originally intended to be \\"more obviously out for himself and slightly less interested in his kids, slightly less interested in the marriage\\", but in discussions between himself and Nix the pair decided to try make the character more likeable, so some of the reshoots for the episode involved this. For instance, the scene where the character learns of his children's mutant abilities was cut from the episode, and a new scene was filmed with him receiving a call from his wife about the issue while he was driving home from work. Moyer added, \\"We want the audience to empathize with his plight at the beginning. So we made his journey less idiomatic, less opinionated to leave it slightly more ambiguous this way.\\" When the episode was filmed, it was set in Texas. However, production on the rest of the series was moved to Atlanta, Georgia, after a decision on tax rebates in Texas had not been made in time for production to resume there. The episode was then altered to be set in Atlanta, retroactively, so the rest of the series could be set there as well. Music Ahead of the episode's premiere, it was revealed that John Ottman and David Buckley were composing the score for the show, with only Ottman credited for the pilot. He previously scored several of the X-Men films for Singer. As an on-set joke, Ron Wasserman's theme from the 1990s X-Men animated series was used as a character's cell phone ring tone. It was decided that this should be kept in the final episode, though the studio thought it was too expensive. Nix said \\"there aren't a lot of those battles you get to win when you're making a network television show, but that one? We knew it cost more money than a regular ring tone, but it's so much fun so we're doing it.\\" Release Broadcast \\"eXposed\\" aired on Fox on October 2, 2017. It was broadcast on CTV in Canada, and on Fox channels in more than 183 countries following its U.S. debut, using a \\"day-and-date launch\\" format. Marketing The first footage from the episode was revealed in a trailer for Fox's May 2017 Upfront presentation, which Hoai-Tran Bui of /Film said \\"looks like a Singer take on Heroes.\\" Bui added, \\"The Gifted is a bit more by-the-numbers [than other X-Men series Legion], airing on a primetime network, spearheaded by X-Men movie director Singer, and clearly connected to the movie universe ... Whether that connection helps or hinders the series is yet to be seen‚Äîas is Singer's involvement, whose X-Men films become increasingly nonsensical and ... bad.\\" The trailer had been viewed over 31 million times within a day of its release, including over 11 million views on YouTube. The first six minutes of the episode were released online on September 28, 2017. Home media Within a week of its broadcast on Fox, \\"eXposed\\" was released free to stream on iTunes, along with two featurettes about the series. Reception Ratings In the United States the episode received a 1.5/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.5 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 4.9 million viewers. This was called a \\"solid start\\" to the series, and was noted to be higher than the season premiere of Lucifer in the same timeslot the year before, as well as the debut of the other new Marvel series of the season, Inhumans. Within three days, the episode's rating share for the 18 to 49 demographic had risen to 2.3, and its total viewership was up 2.4 million to 7.3 million viewers; this was the highest three-day increase for a Fox series released on Monday in over a year, and the highest three-day increase for any series released on Monday at 9 pm in three years. Critical response Giving his first impression of the series' pilot for TVLine, Matt Webb Mitovich praised the \\"instantly engaging premise\\" and visual effects. He felt the entire cast was solid, which he called \\"no easy feat with an ensemble this size\\", and also highlighted the clear establishment of the characters' relationships and the significant plot twists featured in the episode. Dominic Patten at Deadline Hollywood called the episode \\"quite good\\", feeling that the series is derivative of Heroes but \\"sets the stakes legitimately high\\" and covers timely issues. Joshua Yehl of IGN scored the episode a \\"great\\" 8 out of 10, feeling it \\"doesn‚Äôt try to do anything markedly new with the mutant metaphor, but it hits every beat of that formula so well that it‚Äôs a great time regardless.\\" He thought the cast's performances elevated the \\"by-the-numbers\\" plot, especially those from Moyer and Dumont. Yehl felt that Singer focused on \\"what worked best about his most beloved entry in the franchise\\", X2, by focusing on intolerance. Kelly Lawler from USA Today reacted positively to the episode, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four and saying it \\"has a handle on both its source material and the best way to adapt it.\\" Lawler praised the performances of Moyer and Dumont, and Nix's approach to the action scenes in the episode. Daniel Fienberg, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said he could not call the series \\"mandatory or necessary viewing\\", but \\"a solid family dynamic and Bryan Singer's direction help Fox's new X-Men-adjacent drama get off to a decent start.\\" Fienberg said the most essential element established in the episode was the Strucker family dynamic, but that this did become \\"soapy\\" in places and was only balanced out by the several action sequences. Christian Holub from Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot an \\"A-\\" rating, calling it a \\"great, fast-paced start\\" to the series, noting Singer's direction, and saying, \\"While expertly deploying many familiar tropes from the X-Men mythos, the show also feels like a genuinely new story rooted in our current cultural moment.\\" At The Washington Post, David Betancourt wrote that The Gifted is \\"surprisingly just as good as any other comic-book-inspired show on network television.\\" He said the series had potential, and was \\"not something easily accomplished in the now-crowded field of live-action network and streaming superhero options.\\" The A.V. Clubs Jesse Hassenger graded the pilot a 'B-', feeling that it fell short of the standard established with Legion, didn't have any moments as \\"affecting as the best Bryan Singer X-Men movies\\", and did not \\"nail\\" the \\"moments of humanity in an ensemble of superpowered craziness\\", but said the series \\"holds a lot of promise. It‚Äôs got a snappy pace, introducing a bunch of new mutants, a bunch of powers, the family that has to go on the run, the government agency that‚Äôs after them, and a couple of serial-friendly cliffhangers both immediate and longer-range.\\" References External links 2017 American television episodes American television pilots Television episodes about psychic powers The Gifted (American TV series) X-Men television series episodes Television episodes set in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"EXposed"},{"id":"55244942","text":"Tata Steel Zoological Park is situated in the corner most area of Jubilee Park.

The idea behind the company was to build 5-foot-wide \\"pantry boxes\\" that contain non-perishable food and other items similar to those found in a convenience store, with Payment via a mobile app that charges the customer by credit card. The machines would use artificial intelligence to determine the 100 most commonly-purchased items and switch items if necessary. As of 2017, the company had installed 50 locations in San Francisco. Plans were to place the machines in places like gyms, apartment lobbies, and offices, and to build enough machines that a customer is always within 100 feet of one. The company claimed to be a major disruptive force. Controversy There was a major Twitter backlash against the concept when it was announced that machines would be installed in New York. Critics claimed that the startup could put real traditional New York bodegas out of business, and that use of the term \\"bodega\\" for the machine was culturally insensitive. There were also accusations of gentrification of New York neighborhoods. It was also claimed that the concept was similar enough to a vending machine or automat as to not be innovative. Mandatory credit card usage and cameras around the machines raised privacy concerns. The machines also do not offer some of the amenities of real bodegas, such as alcohol, tobacco products, fresh sandwiches, or types of ethnic food local to particular New York neighborhoods. The CEO Paul Macdonald claimed that 97% of Hispanics surveyed did not find the term used for the machines offensive. Many bodega owners and employees do not see the startup as a particular threat. The CEO later apologized for causing offense and claimed that it was not his intent to put local bodegas out of business. In July 2018, the company announced it was changing its name to Stockwell, citing the negative feedback around the original name as a motivator. In June 2020, it was reported that Stockwell would shut down on July 1st, but on August 13th, 2020, 365 Retail Markets announced it was acquiring the company for an undisclosed amount.

The official court uniform and dress of the Ottoman Empire were required to be worn by those in attendance at the imperial court in the nineteenth century, with the aim of being on the same line as most European nations. It consisted of European- inspired clothing in the Empire style. It was introduced during the early stages of the Tanzimat modernization period until the end of the First World War.  History  1876 standard court dress The Tanzimat reforms emerged from the minds of reformist sultans like Mahmud II, his son Abdulmejid I and prominent, often European-educated bureaucrats, who recognised that the old religious and military institutions no longer met the needs of the empire. Most of the symbolic changes, such as uniforms, were aimed at changing the mindset of imperial administrators. Many of the officials affiliated with the government were encouraged to wear a more western style of dress. Many of the reforms were attempts to adopt successful European practices. The reforms were heavily influenced by the Napoleonic Code and French law under the Second French Empire as a direct result of the increasing number of Ottoman students being educated in France. After the French military mission in 1796, French practices became very popular within Ottoman society. After the creation of the first cabinet, Mahmud II ordered several bureaucrats to the courts of France and other nations around the globe to observe not only clothing but also innovated institutions, which were acceptable for that era. The first new court uniforms were worn around 1839, the time of the sultan's death. His son Abdulmejid I succeeded him and French-style court uniform and dress were officially set. European-style clothing was also popular among the upper class, as redingotes, jackets, waistcoats, frock coats, ties, sharp-pointed and high-heeled shoes were not unusual during the Tanzimat modernization period.  Republican period  After the abolition of the Ottoman monarchy, the white tie was introduced for all government officials including the president.

Known as Viceland until December 2, 2019, it is a part of the Viceland family of television channels worldwide. The channel launched on February 29, 2016 (on the same day as the now-defunct Canadian version of the channel), replacing H2 on most multichannel television providers in the United States. Operating under the creative direction of film director Spike Jonze, Vice TV has a focus on lifestyle-oriented documentary and reality series aimed towards millennials, leveraging the resources of Vice's verticals with new original series, along with adaptations of and reruns of existing Vice web series. The network's launch programs featured programs hosted by existing Vice personalities such as Action Bronson and Thomas Morton, as well as notable figures such as Eddie Huang, Ellen Page, and Lance Bangs. History In August 2014, A&E; Networks acquired a 10% stake in Vice Media. On November 3, 2015, A&E; Networks officially announced that Vice would \\"take over\\" its channel H2 and re-launch it as a new service, Viceland, \\"as early as\\" February 2016. Viceland Logo Vice Media CEO Shane Smith stated that the channel was the \\"next step in the evolution of our brand and the first step in our global rollout of networks around the world\\", signifying that Vice would now be \\"platform-agnostic\\" with the addition of television to Vice's traditionally digital media-oriented strategy, and be capable of producing high-quality media. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Smith explained that, despite Vice traditionally being oriented towards digital content, \\"75 percent of the world's advertising budget\\" was being spent on television advertising, and that partnering with an established media company gave Vice access to A&E;'s infrastructure and the 70 million homes that already received H2, rather than having to build Viceland entirely from scratch and negotiate carriage with providers. A&E; Networks handles the distribution and operations of Viceland, and assists in advertising sales. Vice holds a 49% minority stake and control of international expansions. Smith stated that the network planned to \\"test new and innovative monetization strategies\\", including a goal for only 10 minutes of commercial advertising per-hour, and to leverage Vice's existing production capabilities and experience with native advertising to produce sponsored short-form content for advertisers to air in lieu of traditional commercials. The Walt Disney Company, who co-owns A&E; Networks with Hearst Corporation, made a second 10% investment of $200 million in Vice Media to support the production of new programming. Prior to launch day, Vice ran newspaper ads for Viceland, containing only the network's name and a phone number that, when called, invited viewers to contribute answers to questions. On February 29, 2016 at 6:00 a.m. ET, the channel began broadcasting a countdown clock to the official relaunch as Viceland later in the evening, accompanied by footage of Vice executives answering the viewer-contributed calls as voice mail. The network's first program following the official launch was the series premiere of Noisey, following hip-hop musician Kendrick Lamar.  Programming  Vice's programming consists primarily of lifestyle-oriented documentaries and reality series aimed towards millennials, directed in Vice's trademark style of \\"character-driven documentaries\\". Creative director Spike Jonze stated that his goal for Viceland was to make its lineup have \\"a reason to exist and a strong point of view\\", rather than be just a \\"collection of shows\\". Jonze explained that Viceland would continue to reflect Vice's core mission of \\"trying to understand the world we live in by producing pieces about things we're curious about or confused about or that we think are funny. And if it doesn't have a strong point of view, then it shouldn't be on this channel.\\" Smith stated that the channel's main goal was \\"trying not to be shitty\\". Viceland will focus primarily on lifestyle content; Vice News content will remain largely exclusive to Vice's existing joint venture with HBO. Jonze stated that unlike the HBO content, Viceland would be \\"far from objective [reporting]\\". Thirty different programs were developed for Viceland, including original series and expanded versions of existing Vice's web series. Original programs announced for the initial slate included Thomas Morton's Balls Deep, Flophouse‚Äî a series where Lance Bangs follows the lives of up-and-coming comedians at underground stand-up events, Fuck, That's Delicious‚Äî a television version of the food-oriented web series starring Action Bronson, Gaycation‚Äî a series in which Ellen Page explores the LGBT cultures of different regions, Huang's World‚Äî featuring Eddie Huang \\"exploring identity using food as an equalizer\\", King of the Road‚Äî a series following skaters on Thrasher Magazine's annual scavenger hunt, States of Undress‚Äî a series focusing on fashion weeks around the world, the music documentary series Noisey, Vice World of Sports, and Weediquette‚Äî which focuses on the mainstream cannabis culture and industry. Blocks of existing short-form content from Vice (Vice Lab) are also featured, along with other, acquired content‚Äî such as Friday- night airings of cult films accompanied by Vice Guide to Film documentaries on their directors. 10 of the 30 original programs planned were produced in Canada, including Cyberwar‚Äî which focuses on cyberterrorism, and Dead Set on Life‚Äî an expansion of Matty Matheson's food-oriented web series Keep It Canada. A month after Viceland's initial launch, the network announced a second slate of shows, including Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch ‚ÄòAncient Aliens‚Äô‚Äîa series in which Action Bronson watches episodes of Ancient Aliens with guests whilst smoking marijuana, Black Market‚Äî a series in which Michael K. Williams explores underground economies around the world, the U.S. premieres of Cyberwar and Dead Set on Life, Party Legends‚Äî a show about re-enactments of entertaining party stories, WOMAN‚Äî a series in which Gloria Steinam features the lives of different women around the world, and VICE Does America‚Äî which Abdullah Saeed and two VICE co-workers explore forgotten places of the world. Jonze stated that Viceland's original programs will have varying lengths, stating that \\"some are four episodes. Some are six. Some are eight. We're making everything based on what feels right\\", and that extended episodes may be possible if warranted. On May 3, 2016, Vice announced a partnership with ESPN (a fellow Disney/Hearst venture) to produce sports- oriented content for its properties. The deal also includes some content- sharing between ESPN and Viceland, such as encore airings of ESPN's 30 for 30 documentaries on Viceland, and airings of Vice World of Sports on ESPN. In June 2016, Viceland broadcast live coverage of the Governors Ball Music Festival. On February 24, 2019, the channel launched Vice Live, a two-hour live show airing Mondays through Thursdays at 9PM. The series was meant to anchor Viceland's primetime lineup and act as a replacement for Desus & Mero after that show's hosts moved to Showtime. Shortly after debuting, Vice Live was trimmed down to an hour. Due to low ratings, the show was cancelled after its April 11, 2019 episode aired. In August 2019, Vice Media announced that the channel was merging with Vice News as a part of its shift from entertainment and lifestyle programming to a news-based lineup. Earlier that month, the company had also announced that Vice News Tonight, which aired on HBO from 2016 to 2019, would re-launch in 2020 on the network, now renamed Vice TV. These decisions were made after a decline in ratings and viewership under the network's established niche. Availability Viewership In August 2016, it was reported that average viewership of Viceland's programming was down by nearly half over H2 (in a period from November 28 to December 15, 2016, the network had average primetime viewership of 58,000 in the 18-49 demographic, down from 95,600 one year prior under H2). However, the median demographics of the network were beginning to skew younger than H2, and some premieres had achieved upwards of 100,000 viewers. A&E; Networks CEO Nancy Dubuc defended the numbers, stating that the network's goal was to \\"attract an audience that is not watching much TV,\\" and that they were \\"trying to pivot the conversation away from just purely ratings\\"‚Äînoting that Viceland had already received several Emmy nominations for its programs within its first three months of operation. Year-over-year, Viceland lost 42% of its viewership in 2017 compared to 2016.https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/highest-network- ratings-2017-most-watched-hbo-cbs-espn-fx-msnbc-fox-news-1201911363/ It lost another 10% in 2018.https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/network-ratings-top- channels-espn-cnn-fox-news-cbs-nbc-abc-1202030597/ See also * H2 (American TV channel) References External links * English-language television stations in the United States .

Her aunt supports her and they start leading a normal life. Yamuna spends most of the day looking for a job because she doesn't want to be a burden on her aunt. Frustrated one day she tries to find what job Akkey does. She follows her to Sir J. J. School of Art & finds out that she is a nude model for the students of Arts College. After a minor tiff on the nature of the job Akke reveals to Yamuna that she is been doing this for past 15 to 20 years and it is a noble work of education. After some thought, she asked Yamuna if she would like to do the job. After initial hesitation, Yamuna agrees and they go to her college. Yamuna starts with her job as a nude model and gets a decent amount of money. Along with that she also does housekeeping jobs to earn extra income. There is only one student who seems to care about her while the rest of them are oblivious to her presence. She is happy with her job because it funds the education of her son. One fine day she finds paintings in his school bag and figures out his inclination towards arts. Both the ladies fear that one day Lakshman would join the same college and their secret would be exposed. So it is decided that they would send him to a relative in Aurangabad for higher education. Lakshman vehemently protests this because understand that Mumbai offers better education opportunities than Aurangabad. He is forced to leave Mumbai and is very bitter about this. Life continues, Lakshman constantly demands money for his education. Yamuna takes up private assignments reluctantly to fulfil is demands. However, this one student from her college always accompanies her because she is not comfortable posing nude outside the secure premises of the college. One day a very renowned artist M. F.

The sole example of the M-5, built while he was a student in France by Caudron, was a low wing cabin tourer or military liaison aircraft. Design and development Antonio Gedez Muniz was a pioneer of the Brazilian aviation industry but he produced his first designs while at the French Ecole Sup√©rieure de A√©ronautique. Several studies remained unbuilt before he had the M-5, a two- or three-seat cantilever low wing cabin tourer, built by the Caudron company. Its wing was straight-tapered in plan out to rounded tips and had an aspect ratio of 8.0, quite high for the time. It had a reflex (double-curved underside) section, 2¬∞ of dihedral and thinned continuously to the tips. The wing was built in three parts, with a short, rectangular inner section within the fuselage and two dominant, tapering outer panels. Each outer panel was built around a spruce box spar and the wing surface ahead of it was plywood, forming a torsion resisting D-box. Behind the spar the wing had fabric covering. The M-5's ailerons were long and narrow. Its rectangular section fuselage was entirely wooden, with spruce longerons and thick plywood covering. The engine was a water-cooled, six cylinder Hispano-Suiza 6Pa with its fuel tanks between the wing spar of the central section, within the lower fuselage. Behind the engine was a multi-windowed cabin with two seats in tandem and fitted with dual controls; without dual control a third tandem seat could be added. The empennage was also wood- framed, with ply-covered fixed surfaces and fabric-covered control surfaces. Like the wings, the tail surfaces were straight-tapered to rounded tips. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the elevators were split to allow rudder movement. The M-5's fixed, tailskid undercarriage had a track of . Its mainwheels were on cranked steel axles hinged on the lower fuselage longerons which also mounted oblique drag struts, forming a V. Vertical legs from the axle ends operated rubber shock absorbers within the wing leading edge, like those used by Klemm light aircraft. Muniz had hoped that the aircraft would be ready for the August 1929 International Lightplane Tour of Europe but, though in that month the M-5 was reported as \\"nearly ready\\", the first flight was not made for almost another year, when it was flown from Issy-les-Moulineaux on 10 July 1930, piloted by Delmotte. Two days later he flew it to Villacoublay, where five days later Muniz displayed it to the Brazilian community. There were several senior military officers there, as the M-5 could be used as a liaison aircraft. After more flights into early August, the initial report was that the M-5 was stable, fast and landed slowly. It was still undergoing trials at Villacoublay at the start of 1931. Fifteen months later Muniz had returned to Brazil where he went on to design successful trainers like the Muniz M-7 and M-9; it is not known if the M-5 returned with him.

She studied at the Chkalov Gorky Engineering and Construction Institute (Nizhny Novgorod State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering). Her first singing performance was at the 1980 Nizhny Novgorod Spring Universe Jazz Rock Festival where she won the award for the best solo vocal performance. The talent of Kormukhina was spotted by the famous jazz conductor Oleg Lundstrem, who persuaded the young singer to move to Moscow and study at the Gnessin State Musical College. During her studies she performed with his orchestra. In 1987, she became part of the band \\"Rock Atelier\\", front-lined by Kris Kelmi. Later Kormukhina left the band. At the initiative of Ovanes Malkik-Pashaev, Kormukhina became a vocalist of the Krasnaya Pantera group. In 1989 the band collapsed. After the breakdown of Krasnaya Pantera, Kormukhina began a solo career. In 1991, she released her first solo album \\"Beyond the edge of words\\". In 1992 the singer won the Ovation Award for Best Rock Singer of the Year. A several-year creative break followed, which was interrupted in 1997 when the clip for the song \\"Right for love\\" came out. In 1999 she married guitarist Aleksei Belov, who wrote a large portion of Kormukhina's hits. In 2005, the song \\"I am falling into the sky\\" was released, which was also the title song for the album of the same name released in 2012. In 2014 Kormukhina and Belov with the members of Gorky Park took part in the closing ceremony of the Sochi Olympics with the song \\"Moscow Calling\\".

Thirty people were treated in hospital or an urgent care centre, mostly for burn injuries, by a botched, crude \\"bucket bomb\\" with a timer containing the TATP explosive chemical. Police arrested the main suspect, 18-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan in a departure area of the Port of Dover the next day, and subsequently raided several addresses including the foster home of an elderly couple in Sunbury-on-Thames where Hassan had lived. Hassan arrived in the UK illegally in October 2015 and had said that he had been compelled to undergo training by ISIL with about 1,000 other young people and he had feared members of his family would be killed if he had attempted to resist. The incident was classified by Europol as a case of jihadist terrorism. On 6 April 2019 it was announced that Lt. Col. Craig Palmer, a British Army officer who was that morning a passenger on the affected tube train, had been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for his part in helping to bring the bomber to trial and conviction. Background Four other attacks occurred in England in the months preceding the bombing: the Westminster attack, the Manchester Arena bombing, the London Bridge attack and the Finsbury Park attack. According to the BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, along with the Parsons Green train bombing and police having foiled at least seven 'significant plots', this makes it \\"the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s.\\" Incident Map of the station area A homemade bomb partially exploded on an eastbound District line train at Parsons Green Underground station, in West London. The District line train was packed with commuters and school children. Witnesses described seeing a fireball in the rear carriage of the packed rush-hour train. Numerous passengers were reported to have suffered flash burns. Others received crush injuries in the rush to leave the scene. Thirty people received medical treatment for their injuries, 19 of whom were taken to hospital by ambulance and the remainder self-presenting at hospital. The device had been left in a white plastic bucket inside a shopping bag. Wires were hanging out, as well as a black towel. Reports also indicate the device had a timer attached and was packed with knives and screws. According to Ben Wallace, the security minister, the bomb contained the triacetone triperoxide explosive (TATP), the same explosive used in the 2005 London Underground bombings and the November 2015 Paris attacks. The explosive is known to be very unstable, which may have led to critical errors in the construction of the bomb, such that it only partially exploded. According to Chip Chapman, former head of counter-terrorism at the Ministry of Defence, \\"This absolutely didn't function properly because‚Ä¶ of TATP is enough to blow car doors off\\". Claim of responsibility According to the Amaq News Agency, an affiliated unit of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant carried out the attack. The Metropolitan Police described the claim as \\"very routine in these sort of circumstances‚Ä¶ whether or not they have had any previous engagement with the individuals involved\\". On 17 September, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was no evidence to suggest that ISIL was behind the attack, and added that they would find out how the attacker was radicalised if they could. Investigation and trial The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation into the attack. According to the Metropolitan Police, ‚Äúhundreds of detectives‚Äù are involved in the investigation. Investigators reportedly linked the attack to Islamic extremism and considered feasible a network of individuals involved in such plans. The Metropolitan Police launched a manhunt for one, possibly two, suspects. On 16 September, Kent Police arrested Ahmed Hassan at the Port of Dover on suspicion of a terror offence. The port area was partially evacuated and a number of items recovered by the police. Later that day, police raided, and searched a house in Sunbury, Surrey. Hassan was not named initially, but was identified by media reports as an 18-year-old Iraqi orphan refugee who had been referred to a governmental anti-extremist programme. Seven men were arrested in total during the investigations. Later on 16 September, a man was arrested in Hounslow, west London, A third man, a 25-year-old, was arrested in Newport, south Wales, on 19 September and an address in Newport was searched. The seventh and final arrest took place on 25 September in Cardiff. On 21 September the second arrestee was released without charge. On 22 September, Hassan was charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury. He appeared in court the following day and was remanded in custody, to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 October. The other six arrestees were released without charge. Ahmed Hassan pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial took place on 5‚Äì16 March 2018 at the Old Bailey. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) indicated that Hassan had not conveyed his motive for the attack and that, perhaps due to his destruction of electronic devices, there was no evidence of ISIS being an inspiration. On 16 March, he was found guilty by a unanimous jury. On 23 March, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 34 years; he will be eligible for parole on 23 March 2052. The sentence reflected the court's belief that Hassan had lied about his age and was in fact older. It has been claimed, in an article by Lizzie Dearden of The Independent, that the police missed or misinterpreted evidence indicating Hassan was inspired by ISIS.  The bomber  Ahmed Hassan arrived in the UK in late 2015 claiming to be under 18, at a time when the UK government had shortly before instituted more generous rules on accepting asylum applications from unaccompanied minors. At a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan told officials he had been in contact with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and been trained to kill. Hassan also stated during the interview that he blamed the United Kingdom for his father having died in Iraq. While his asylum application was being processed, he was placed in foster care with a highly experienced elderly foster couple who were given no hint of his extremist links. Reactions  Domestic  In a statement after the incident, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said: \\"My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and the emergency services who, once again, are responding swiftly and bravely to a suspected terrorist incident\\". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \\"As London has proven again and again, we will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism. I am in close contact with the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London (TfL), Government and other emergency services who are responding at the scene and leading the investigation. I will be attending the emergency COBRA meeting in Whitehall this afternoon with the Prime Minister. My sincere gratitude goes to all our courageous emergency responders and the TfL staff who were first on the scene. I urge all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant\\". Khan also said: \\"I am not going to apologise for saying we need more resources and more police in London\\". Subsequent to the attack, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre decided to raise the terror threat level from 'Severe' to 'Critical', for only the fourth time since its 2006 introduction. Operation Temperer was also activated for the second time, as a result of the raise in threat level. The terror threat level was then returned to 'Severe' by JTAC on 17 September 2017. Citing the Parsons Green train bombing, police advised the public not to record terrorist events, but instead to \\"run, hide, tell\\".  International  US President Donald Trump tweeted: \\"Another attack in London by a loser terrorist. These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\\" He also touted his proposed travel ban. His comments were described by Theresa May, who characterised the tweets as inaccurate speculation, as \\"not helpful.\\"  Craig Palmer bravery award On 6 April 2019 it was announced that Lt. Col. Craig Palmer, a passenger on the affected tube train, had been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for his part in helping to bring the bomber to trial and conviction. Despite great risk to himself, the Artillery officer, who was two carriages away as the train entered Parsons Green station, went towards the scene of the bomb and recognised it for it was. He took pictures that were able to be used in evidence at the subsequent trial of the bomber.

She served between 1931 and 1933 as an active member of the Hesse Landtag (parliament), after which, for reasons of race and politics, she was forced into exile. Pringsheim also worked as a journalist/writer and theatre critic.  Life  Lily Chun was born in the East Prussian capital, K√∂nigsberg, where she spent her early childhood. The family relocated to Breslau in 1895 and to Leipzig in 1899. Her father, Carl Chun (1852‚Äì1914), was a zoologist and deep sea researcher who was employed as a university professor at K√∂nigsberg, Breslau and then Leipzig. Her mother, Lily Vogt, was the daughter of the zoologist-geologist-politician Carl Vogt (1817‚Äì1895). When she was 16 she was excluded from her school, where the staff found her \\"exceptionally headstrong\\" (... wegen \\"ausgepr√§gter Eigenwilligkeit\\"). As a young woman Lily Chun supported herself by writing, publishing short stories and (subsequently forgotten) novels. She married Ernst Pringsheim at Leipzig on 18 March 1907. He was a professor of botany and a member of a leading Silesian family of Jewish provenance. The marriage produced five recorded children, but it ended in divorce in 1921. In 1922 Lily Pringsheim settled with her five children in Darmstadt. She joined the Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / SPD) in 1921. She attracted attention as a \\"brilliant, persuasive and forthright public speaker\\". A particular admirer of her political abilities was the interior minister, Wilhelm Leuschner. Between December 1931 and April 1933 she was a member of the Hesse Landtag (parliament), serving on many parliamentary committees. In the chamber she spoke out openly against the anti-Semitism of the populist Nazi Party and was rewarded with death threats. She was also the first in Hesse to put her signature to a call for a \\"reduction of the penal provisions in ¬ß218 of the constitution\\", which concerned the country's longstanding anti-abortion laws. The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. After the Reichstag fire which occurred at the end of February 1933, state mandated anti-Semitism became rapidly institutionalised. Pringsheim and her children were placed under police surveillance. The family were persecuted by the authorities not just because of their political activities but also because the authorities had determined that they were \\"half-Jewish\\". Two of her sons had to break off their law studies. In July 1933, believing that she was scheduled for imminent arrest by the Gestapo, she fled with three of her children via Dresden to Prague in Czechoslovakia which at this stage was still independent. From Prague she moved on to Vienna where she remained only briefly, before making her home in Brno. In Brno she became involved with the local branch of the League of the Rights of Man. As a result of this connection she was for several months during the first part of 1937, despite living in a very small apartment, the rather improbable landlady of Jean Genet, on the run from France where he had acquired a string of convictions for petty crime and, more recently, gained the status of an army deserter. He slept on the balcony. Genet later became a doyen of the French literary establishment. As a 27 year old asylum seeker in Brno, Pringsheim found him a \\"highly literate and memorable autodidact [with an] uncontrollable thirst for knowledge\\". Later, when Genet's literary archive was opened up to scholars, several rather stiff and literary love letters were found that he had written to Pringsheim, but he was more than twenty years her junior, and Genet's more serious \\"love interest\\" at the time was almost certainly Anna Bloch, the wife of an industrialist who had imprudently recruited Genet to teach his young wife French. During 1938 the German army incrementally invaded Czechoslovakia. Pringsheim, now using a Czechoslovak name, became a political refugee again, fleeing to London. By 1940 she had moved on again, this time to Peru where she joined up with her eldest daughter, Marianne, who had already settled there. In 1941 she undertook what was intended to be a brief visit to the United States of America. She was caught out in December when the United States unexpectedly (to her) joined in the European war as a response to the Pearl Harbor attack. It became impossible to travel to Peru. Her visit to the country lasted seven years during which she engaged in teaching and social work with a Qu√§ker Organisation. At one stage she was employed as a radio presenter. She also became a much sought after speaker on behalf of the Socialist Party. Lily Pringsheim returned to Peru in 1947. While she was in the US her son Johannes was killed. Unlike his older brother, Karl Peter, who had followed his mother to London, Johannes had stayed in Czechoslovakia after the German invasion and become a resistance activist. In 1943 he was summoned to London by the Czechoslovak government in exile. It is believed that he crossed Switzerland on foot, but in France he was caught by the Gestapo and placed on a train destined for Buchenwald. Little more is known of his fate, although there is a report that he was killed in the Strasbourg area while jumping off the train. Lily Pringsheim came home to Darmstadt in 1950, making her home at a top floor apartment alongside the Luisenplatz. She taught conversational English and French at the local school for the rest of her life. There was talk of a return to politics, but she found she was unable to gain any sort of a foothold in the Darmstadt branch of the post-war SPD. She died at Darmstadt in 1954 having never got over the death of her son, Johannes.

Ierapetra Football Club, short for Omilos Filathlon Ierapetra (, translated: Ierapetra fans' club) and also simply known as OFI ( ‚àí not to be confused with OFI Crete based in Heraklion, whose acronym is spelled differently () in Greek), is a Greek professional football club based in Ierapetra, Lasithi, Crete, Greece. The club was established in 1970, and its traditional colors are black and white. It is the oldest and most successful football club representing the town of Ierapetra, hometown of one of the greatest Cretan players of all time: Petros Vouzounerakis, of whom the club's home ground is named after (Ierapetra Municipal Stadium ¬´Petros Vouzounerakis¬ª). The club currently competes in the Football League, the third tier of the Greek football league system.  History  O.F. Ierapetra was founded in 1970 as a result of a merger between Thyella and Diagoras, the two clubs based in the town at the time. Throughout the 70s, O.F. Ierapetra played in the Pan-Hellenic Amateur Championship, which used to be the unofficial third tier of the Greek football league system. During the following decades, the club had a significant presence in the Delta Ethniki (4th level in the national league pyramid) of which they earned promotion to the Gamma Ethniki in 2006 after winning the Cretan Group championship title. For their first ever season in the Gamma Ethniki, the club failed to avoid relegation, largely due to inexperience, despite some memorable winning results against historic clubs such as Panachaiki. In 2017, the club once again achieved promotion to the Gamma Ethniki after winning the Lasithi regional championship, where it still competes.  Crest and colours  At the start of 2010‚àí11 season, O.F. Ierapetra merged with the other two clubs representing the town of Ierapetra, Anagennisi and A.S. Ierapetra thus forming Ierapetra F.C.

Playing career A junior from Hills District, Mann was graded with the Parramatta Eels for the 1973 season, and made his first grade debut for the Eels in the 1974 season. At his most effective when in top stride, Mann was one of the Eels' best players during the series of sudden death play-offs to decide the final five semi-finalists in 1975.

The Sea Eagles went on to win the match 13-10. Despite being dropped from the Eels' 1976 Grand Final team, and despite missing most of the Eels' superb 1977 season in which they won the minor premiership for the first time in the club's history, Mann was called into first grade again when John Peard withdrew due to injury, to play in the historic 1977 Grand Final against the St. George Dragons at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Grand Final was significant, because it was the first of two to date (the other being the 1978 Grand Final between the Manly Sea Eagles and the Cronulla Sharks in which they drew 11-all) to be forced into a replay when the scores finished 9-all at full time.Alan Whiticker, Grand Finals of the NSWRL (2e), Gary Allen 1994 Mann was consequently dropped from the side when John Peard returned from injury to play in the Grand Final replay.

Founded in the Borders in 1903, Barrie was acquired by Chanel. in 2012. A ‚ÄúBarrie‚Äù brand was launched in 2014.  History  In 1903, Walter Barrie and Robert Kersel opened a factory specialised in the production of high-quality stockings. Located in Hawick, Barrie thus manufactured two-tone model designed by Gabrielle Chanel in the 1920s. In 1962, the company took the name of Barrie Knitwear Ltd. In 1975, it moved to a new factory in Burnfoot specially designed for cashmere. Barrie started working for names in fashion such as Chanel, an activity that continues to this day. In October 2012, Barrie Knitwear Ltd was acquired by Chanel. Barrie presented its first own- label collection for fall-winter 2014-2015. Each collection is designed in the House of Barrie's design studio in Paris, and then produced in Hawick, Scotland. In 2014, Barrie opened its first shop in Paris, followed by a second in London. Today, the brand is active in 22 countries.  Scottish tradition  Knitting was an important activity in the Scottish isles in the 17th and 18th centuries. Families generally made sweaters, socks and accessories. Wool contains natural oils that offered fishermen essential protection as they went off to sea. This activity was industrialized in 1771 with the arrival of four looms. In 1845, more than 2,000 of Scotland's 2,605 looms were located in the Scottish Borders, and the city of Hawick alone accounted for half of these.  The Barrie brand  Since the brand inaugurated its Paris studio in 2014, four collections per year have been designed in the French capital. Sketches are sent to the workshop in Scotland, where the knitting machines are programmed according to the measurements and patterns of each garment. Barrie offers pullovers, cardigans, skirts, dresses, trousers, overcoats, T-shirts, beanies, gloves, etc. Some Barrie clothing and accessories are recognizable thanks to iconic thistle knitted in 3D. This technique makes bold stylistic innovation possible, enhancing knitwear with simple or sophisticated relief textures using tone-on-tone or contrasting colors. Buttons, manufactured by artisans such as the costume jeweler Desrues, Chanel's traditional supplier of buttons and accessories, are decorated or painted by hand to feature the Barrie logo in tone-on-tone porcelain. With the announcement of its new artistic director, Augustin Dol-Maillot, Barrie begins a new chapter in its history with its Spring-Summer 2019 Collection.

Native to eastern Australia, it has been introduced into New Zealand, Japan, the United States, Mexico, and Uruguay. Description Badumna longinqua is an average-sized spider, with males attaining a maximum length of no more than , while females are marginally larger with a maximum body length of . Its common name, grey house spider, is due to colouration on the cephalothorax and abdomen, which are carpeted with light-grey hairs and spot-like markings and legs, which are purplish-brown in colour with hairs arranged into stripes on each leg. The similarly coloured brown carapace darkens nearer the chelicerae and eyes. Its eight eyes are small and black, with the front middle pair exceptionally larger at approximately 1 and a half times the size of surrounding eyes.Simo, M., Laborda, A., Jorge, C., Guerrero, J.

Koch, 1867) (Araneae: Desidae) in Uruguay, with notes on its world dispersion . Journal of Natural History , 45 (27-28), 1637-1648. Underneath these setae is an ovate abdomen and legs, which are purplish-brown in colour with hairs arranged into stripes on each leg.Pennisi, E. (2017). Untangling spider biology . Science, 358 (6361), 288-291  Distribution   New Zealand range  Badumna longinqua was originally native to eastern Australia. The spider was unintentionally introduced and colonised into New Zealand and now is widespread throughout both the North and South Islands.Simo, M., Laborda, A., Nunez, M., & Brescovit , A. D. (2015). First records of the invasive spider Badumna longinqua (L. Koch) (Desidae) in southern Brazil with notes on the habitats and the species‚Äô dispersion.

The invasive spider Badumna longinqua (L. Koch, 1867) (Araneae: Desidae) in Argentina: New distributional records, with notes on its expansion and establishment. Check List: the journal of biodiversity data , 9 (3), 618-621. as it is not as common southern and western of the South Island due to unfavourable environmental conditions. The colonisation of this species has increased over the last few decades due to human transport and trade, most likely arriving during colonial times, via inert phoresy on ships, planes, trains, and merchandise. The species was only first reported in New Zealand in the twentieth century. The range expansion of the species is due to human activities. This is because Badumna longinqua is able to spread within goods in transportation such as ships, trains and planes, which, offer warmth and the availability of food. Another speculated arrival method is that of ballooning, a means of dispersal in Araneae where a spiderling lets out a thread of silk called gossamer, which is carried away by wind or a thermal updraft, causing the spider to become airborne. Badumna insignis, a closely related, slightly larger species, commonly named the common black spider or black house spider, has also colonised New Zealand, but only as far as the northern part of the North Island.  Geographic Distribution  Aside from Australasia, B. longinqua has increased its global range to other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Japan, the United States, Uruguay, and South Africa  Habitat preferences  Badumna longinqua is mainly located in temperate zones or climates of the world. Temperate zones or climates are in the middle latitudes, which are found between the tropics and the polar regions. Environmental conditions can limit the success of a species but Badumna longinqua shows great tolerance and survival for varied climates. In most foreign nations including New Zealand, the grey house spider is a synanthropic species and is common in urban habitats and agroecosystems. The species resides almost exclusively in the somewhat artificial environments that are produced as a result of human inhabitancy, and not in wild habitats, for example natural forest. The distinctively messy web of B. longinqua can be found in many urban places, such as nooks and crannies on window frames and walls, in rubbish bins, under furniture, on car bodies and mirrors, trees bases and benches in urban parks, and artificial posies in cemeteries. Badumna longinqua have also been found in cemeteries in artificial flowers, which therefore suggest that they are very suitable to refuge. The species primarily are found living in tree trunks, rock walls, retreats, leaves, and tangled webbing in green shrubs. Badumna longinqua live in grasslands, riparian forests and wetlands. Higher densities of the species populations are found in trees near roads or urban areas where human activity is higher. Commercial Eucalyptus plantations in Uruguay, and Pinus plantations elsewhere provide an abundance of potential homes for the spiders, which often take up residence on the trees, positioning their hideaways under loose bark. In the United States, Badumna longinqua seems to be less reliant on a synanthropic relationship with people and can also be located in woodlands, along immediate coastal areas, within agricultural ecosystems, and recently in vineyards. Phenology The female Badumna longinqua spider can potentially spend the whole of her life in the one same web, whereas the sexually mature male is forced to leave his home when it becomes time to reproduce. The male begins his hunt for females in the warmer months of the year, from summer through to early autumn. Although the details of B. longinqua courtship have not yet been formally described, and biology of the spider is not well studied, it is acknowledged in most cases to be a solitary spider. The lifespan of Badumna longinqua is not officially documented, however its closest relative Badumna insignis lives for a maximum of around two years, and so it could be postulated that B. longinqua would live for approximately the same period of time. Web As a starting point for its web, Badumna longinqua first finds a satisfactory hiding place, such as a crack or small opening to funnel out its web from, which it then interlines with silk. From this tubular entrance, it builds a multitude of ladder-like webs in a radiating fashion,Ubick, D. (2005). Spiders of North America: An Identification Manual. New York , USA: American Arachnological Society . and for this reason it is placed into the ladderweb spiders grouping, of which it is one of only a few in New Zealand. The grey house spider's special cribellate silk is used for the connecting zig-zag patterned threads of the web. Located in the spider's rear legs, the calamistrum combs the silk of the web. As the web is occupied for long periods of time, with the female spider even remaining in her web for the entirety of her life unless compelled to move silken additions and restorations are carried out nightly, resulting in a disorderly looking web which becomes increasingly untidy over time. Despite possibly being one of the most abundant spiders around homes and buildings throughout New Zealand, B. longinqua itself is not often sighted as it feeds at night and will stay hidden in its retreat during the daytime. Furthermore, it generally does not go wandering into households in search of a mate as with other common species of Araneae. When night falls, the grey house spider exits its burrow to tend to its web, and then sit in wait of a meal. Prey This species is a web-building spider meaning that it constructs its web in a calm and undisturbed place. Thus making them wait for food to come to them and capture their food. An assortment of insects are preyed upon by Badumna longinqua, including; small psyllids, ants, and moths, as well as some insects of considerably larger size than itself, like wasps, bees, and even bumblebees and cicadas. However, usually making up over half of the diet is, as could be expected, a variety of flies. Victims that make the fatal mistake of blundering into the sticky web are rushed at, bitten, and further entangled by the spider until unable to move or escape. If this prey is caught during the day, the grey house spider retires back into the safety of its burrow, to emerge after nightfall and feast on its earlier catch. Spiders feed by liquefying the prey through injection or regurgitation of digestive fluids into their prey to then proceed to suck the digested food. Predators and Parasites Parasitic wasps and flies can pose a risk to B. longinqua, but its greatest predator is the notorious hunting spider, Lampona, more commonly known as the white-tailed spider. There are two species of Lampona in New Zealand and both seem to readily predate grey house spiders as a favoured dietary choice. Along the Pacific Coast of California and presumably in other countries, grey house spiders are frequently preyed upon by the cosmopolitan long-bodied cellar spider or \\"daddy long legs\\" (Pholcus phalangioides), another very prevalent alien species which is likewise common and introduced in Aotearoa. Many birds eat this species as well as some mammals (New Zealand Short-tailed Bats).

In the present time, the Red Queen makes a deal with Alice to gain special magic dust that only someone pure of heart can claim, while the White Rabbit is forced to work for Jafar.

Reception Ratings The episode was watched by 3.73 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 0.9/3, roughly the same as the previous episode. The show placed fifth in its timeslot and thirteenth for the night. Critical reception Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a 5.9 out of 10, giving it a mixed review. She said \\"Tonight's installment of Wonderland had some fun moments but was mostly predictable. It wasn't horrible, but also not awesome. The story at least moved forward so Cyrus and Alice are closer to being together. Additionally, Sophie Lowe and Emma Rigby offered some good character moments. They weren't enough to carry the episode though.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.3 out of 5, signaling positive reviews. Lily Sparks of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"All in all, this was a pleasant, simple episode that added a few layers of emotional complexity to one of the series‚Äô most cartoonish characters. The Red Queen definitely needed some characteristics beyond \\"evil\\" and \\"sexy,\\" and we got them. I do wish that this episode had been front-loaded to air earlier in the season‚Äîit would've been nice to see more of the Knave and the Red Queen's backstory in the pilot, and the classically styled Alice and the general creepiness would've been a lot more engaging than the marshmallow swamp and terrible animated caterpillar and all that foolishness we endured in the first two episodes.\\" References External links 2013 American television episodes Once Upon a Time in Wonderland episodes ","title":"Heart of Stone (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland)"},{"id":"55246105","text":"Elizabeth Mary Craik is a Scottish classical scholar, who is Honorary Professor of Classics at the University of St Andrews.

Goblinshead. p.280 History The name 'Pitlurg', meaning 'the hillside place', suggests there was an earlier Pictish settlement on the site. A Gordon family, descended from Jock o‚ÄôScurdargue, owned the lands until 1724. It was partly occupied until the 1760s. General Gordon, 1815, a descendant, took the name for his estate of Leask and Birness, Formartine. When James VI was at Aberdeen, on 4 August 1589 he wrote to John Gordon of Pitlurg asking him for a hackney horse for his use and the use of his bride to be, Anne of Denmark. The Earl of Huntly and other Gordon lairds sent him to Edinburgh to speak for them in 1593. In 1594 James VI invited him to the baptism of Prince Henry to be a companion to the ambassadors.Miscellany of the Spalding Club, 1 (Aberdeen, 1841), pp. 3-8. In October 1594 James VI made him keeper of Huntly Castle.Miscellany of the Spalding Club, 1 (Aberdeen, 1841), p. 9. Robert Gordon of Straloch was born and resided here, inheriting the estate from his brother John. Structure Pitlurg Castle was a Z-plan tower house and courtyard. Only one round tower with two vaulted storeys remains. It is now a doocot. The castle was built on rock. To the south was the Den of Pitlurg, while there was an open view to the west. There was a well in the castle courtyard, while it is thought that the castle was surrounded by a deep ditch, and there was a long range of buildings to the west. The structure to the east has been removed, but it is marked by a rebuilt doorway, and by the remains of a stone staircase leading to the second floor of the tower on the south east side.

In 2002, the group released their debut album –í—Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ (\\"Invasion\\"). In 2003, –ê—Å—Å–∞–∏ joined the band.

These two albums became turning point in Russian rap and the hip-hop family was named \\"St. Petersburg's new wave\\". The style of Krec was named \\"lyrics of light sadness\\". In 2009 Colta.ru, a magazine, included these albums in its list of the ten main Russian rap albums. The partnership with Smoky Mo and UmBriaco then ceased. The next year Assai released a solo album –î—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞ (\\"Another shore\\"). The next album –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∫–µ (\\"By the river\\") was released in 2006. The song \\"–ù–µ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" (\\"Tenderness\\") from this album was used in the –ü–∏—Ç–µ—Ä FM (Piter FM) film OST. After this album, members of the band released solo albums. In 2007, Fuze released Meloman. After the separation, joint concerts were fewer, and members devoted more time to solo projects.

This time Fuze recorded solo and performed with guest musicians. On 9 March 2017, Obelisk 16 was released, consisting of 16 tracks, most of which were released as singles in 2016.

He was the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of AGL Energy. Early life Vesey was born in 1955 and grew up on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper East Side. His parents settled in New York having fled their native Hungary as the Nazis rose to prominence in the 1930s; his father gaining US citizenship by serving as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne during World War II. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he received a BA in Economics and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering. He went on to study for a Masters of Science degree at New York University. Professional career Identifying energy as ‚Äúthe issue of the day‚Äù, Vesey started out as an engineer at New York utility Consolidated Edison, before joining Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. Vesey subsequently worked in leadership roles at Ernst and Young and FTI Consulting, before joining AES Corporation in 2004. He held a number positions at AES, including running the business in Latin America, before becoming Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 2012. There he led the company‚Äôs Global Operations portfolio across 20 countries. Having run the Melbourne- based Citipower Pty Ltd in the late 1990s, Vesey returned to Australia as Managing Director and CEO of AGL Energy Limited in February 2015. Citi analyst Dale Koenders described the appointment as ‚Äúa good time to change the perception of AGL‚Äù and Vesey's first action as CEO was to place AGL Energy‚Äôs entire upstream gas business under review. Vesey implemented a new Greenhouse Gas Policy in 2015, including a commitment for AGL to close its existing coal- fired power stations by 2050. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Vesey spoke of his desire to take AGL \\"out of the CO2 emissions business\\". In March 2017, Vesey launched the world‚Äôs largest residential virtual power plant in South Australia. The plant will involve 1,000 connected batteries being installed in homes and businesses in South Australia providing 5MW of peak capacity. The launch of the initiative resulted in a public row between Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill during a media conference, at which Vesey was also answering questions. Vesey commented that Frydenberg and Weatherill needed to \\"keep talking\\". Also in March 2017, Vesey responded to Elon Musk‚Äôs claim that Tesla could solve Australia‚Äôs energy shortage crisis within 100 days - offering him a site for a grid battery farm in South Australia. Vesey is a member of the 2016 cohort of Male Champions of Change and the co-author of Unlocking the Benefits of Restructuring: A Blueprint for Transmission (PUR Inc., November 1999). Awards In October 2016, the Climate Alliance recognised Vesey as its Business Leader of the Year, citing his role in launching ‚Äúnumerous initiatives to transition towards a carbon constrained future‚Äù. In the same year, he was named at number 11 in the Australian Financial Review‚Äôs 2016 Corporate Power List. In December 2017, Vesey was named CEO of the Year at the S&P; Global Platts Global Energy Awards. He was recognised by the judges as \\"progressive, enlightened and hard-charging\\", and praised for moving AGL away from coal to a diverse portfolio of renewables. In the same month Vesey was named by The Australian Financial Review as one of its Business People of the Year, having ‚Äúmanaged to move the country‚Äôs biggest greenhouse gas emitter forward along what he sees as an inevitable path of carbon reduction‚Äù. The AFR also described Vesey as ‚Äúone of the most prominent business leaders to speak out on diversity, equality and violence against women‚Äù.

While Cyrus evades the Red Queen, Jafar heads to Victorian England with the White Rabbit in order to find the ones that Alice cares about.

Considered \\"one of the brightest stars of his generation\\" and a \\"darkly powerful performer,\\" Bhuller danced for London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Siobhan Davies Dance Company, and was assistant director for Richard Alston Dance Company before revitalizing Phoenix Dance Theatre as its artistic director.  Early life and dance career  The eldest of five, Bhuller was born in Singapore to a traditional Punjabi Indian family. After spending his early years in India, the family emigrated to the UK when he was six. Bhuller was introduced to dance by the teacher Nadine Senior at Harehills Middle School in Leeds. At 16, he moved to London where he completed his training at London School of Contemporary Dance with Martha Graham Dance Company luminaries Jane Dudley, Noemi Lapzeson, Robert Cohan, and William Louther. Two years later Bhuller was invited to join London Contemporary Dance Theatre (LCDT) where he would become one of the company's most critically acclaimed dancers. During his career with LCDT, 1979 to 1994, Bhuller worked with the company as a dancer, rehearsal director, teacher, and choreographer. During this period he also danced for Siobhan Davies Dance Company in 1991. After departing LDCT, he became assistant director of Richard Alston Dance Company from 1994 to 1996, after which he retired from performing to focus on creating full-time.  Choreographic and directing career  Bhuller choreographed his first work, Beyond the Law - based on Athol Fugard's Statements After An Arrest Under the Immorality Act - for LCDT soon after he joined the company. Impressed by his choreographic talent, the company commissioned him in 1982 to create a piece in honour of Pope John Paul II for a performance at Cardiff. Over the past 30 years Bhuller has been commissioned to create original works for a wide range of companies including: Scottish Dance Theatre, Rambert Dance Company, CandoCo, Nordic Dance Theatre, CeDeCe, Companhia de Bailado Contemporaneo, and Shaolin Wheel of Life, which he also assistant directed. Critically lauded work created by Bhuller includes: Heart of Chaos, Stand and Stare, Planted Seeds, Fall Like Rain, Requiem, Recall, Eng-er-land, Caravaggio: Exile and Death, Prometheus Awakens, Rites of War, and Mapping. Having choreographed five original works for the company between 1983 and 1996, Bhuller was appointed artistic director of Phoenix Dance Theatre in 2002, during which time he rehabilitated its reputation, including winning the 2006 Critic's Circle National Dance Award for Outstanding Modern Repertoire. He stepped down from leading Phoenix following a successful international tour to the US in 2006. Since leaving the company, Bhuller has returned to freelance directing, choreographing, and guest teaching throughout the US and UK at such schools as Alvin Ailey/Fordham University, New World School of The Arts, The Rambert School, The Place, English National Ballet School, Central School of Ballet, Dansh√∂gskolan, London School of Contemporary Dance, Northern School of Contemporary Dance, Terence Lewis Contemporary Dance Company, Franco Dragone‚Äôs company in Macau, Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, and Florida State University. In 1985, Bhuller directed the first of his many award- winning films - Breaking the Surface - in collaboration with the painter Graham Dean, which they sold to the UK's Channel 4. Other films include The Fall  which he co-produced through his company Singh Productions with BBC 2  the documentary Harmonica Breakdown: speaking about the dance, What About Sky for MTV and ITV Chart Show, and Another Place which focused on his mentor at LCDT, Robert Cohan. Bhuller's recent work includes the documentaries Das Model; The Dancer and Lola, Shuffle It Right, Something to do, Roughcut, and All American Alston by Richard Alston.

The Svea Velocipede was an early bicycle type invented in the 19th century by the Swedish brothers Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m and Birger Ljungstr√∂m. The bicycle employed the today well- established bicycle frame but the drive of the wheel worked according to a completely different principle. The inventors used lever, Stubs Iron Wire Gauge and eccentric instead of chainring, since the bicycle chains used at the time often cracked for a variety of reasons. The bike was driven by pressing the pedal en levers alternately, braked by stepping both pedals at the same time. The freewheel of the Svea Velocipede was patented in 1892. In connection with Alfred Nobel, the project was further developed and the product sold in a limited quantity of units in Sweden, and the United Kingdom, under the company name The New Cycle Company, to which also George Spaak was connected. It remained in serial production on the market for about 10 years until hitherto technological problems in the production of bicycle chains were overcome. Although the general preference for circular pedal mechanisms became clear with time, later bicycle models on the market would adopt its foot-operated bicycle brakes as well as its free wheeling hubs. The Svea Velocipede won a Gold Medal of the General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm in 1897, and a Silver Medal of the Exposition Universelle of Paris in 1900. The model has units represented at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology, and the Nordic Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.

The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are about two million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting with many new species still being discovered. It is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region. The following list provide the isopods of Sri Lanka. Isopods Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Isopoda Isopods also known as sowbugs, are crustaceans, that can be found throughout marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. There are well over 10,000 species of isopods described within 11 suborders. From these, about 4,500 species are marine, 500 species are freshwater and 5,000 are terrestrial forms. They are typically flattened dorsoventrally with two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen. The studies on isopods of Sri Lanka clearly studied with the separation of aquatic isopods and terrestrial isopods. Regarding freshwater isopods, the first taxonomic work was done by Fernando and Hanek in 1973. They recorded only two isopods from freshwater bodies in Sri Lanka. The two terrestrial families of isopods, Trachelipidae and Porcellionidae have been studied by Ferrara and Argano. According to them, three species of Trachelipidae and five of Porcellionidae are recorded from Sri Lanka. The following checklist on Sri Lankan isopods described 92 species within 53 genera.

Description Side view Sphaeroderma testaceum can reach a size of . These tiny beetles have a wide head, large eyes and the filiform antennae are close together between the eyes. Elytra are convex and slightly elongate and hind femora are rather enlarged. The pronotum shows coarse puncturation basally, prominent anterior corners, a well defined basal groove and two lateral notches. Elytra and pronotum are shiny light brown-orange. This species is very similar to Sphaeroderma rubidum (Gra√´lls, 1853). It can be distinguished from the previous one on the basis of a smaller size and quadrate elytra, but especially with a close study of the genitalia. Mounted specimen Biology Adults can be found from May/June to September. Pupation occurs in the spring and new adults may be seen from May. Overwintering occurs as 3rd (final) instar larvae, sometimes as imago. Both larvae and adults feed on leaves, especially on various species of Thistle (Carduus, Carlina, Cirsium, Onopordum and Cynara species), on Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), on Serratula species and on Cirsium arvense (in Canada).C.G.

Orchestra () is a British orchestra, the first professional orchestra in Europe to be made up of majority black, Asian and ethnically diverse musicians. The word Chineke derives from the Igbo language meaning \\"God\\". The orchestra was founded by musician Chi-chi Nwanoku and their debut concert was in 2015 at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.  Background  Nwanoku, the orchestra's founder, coined its name from the word \\"Chi'\\" in the Igbo language, which refers to \\"the god of creation of all good things\\", or \\"the spirit of creation\\". She was inspired by the use of the term in the novel Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. Nwanoku has acknowledged that inspiration for founding the orchestra came from a conversation with Ed Vaizey, then the UK Minister of Culture, who noted to her that she was one of the very few musicians of colour on stage in a classical orchestra. She also took inspiration from attending a London concert of the Kinshasa Symphony, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the orchestra was all-black, but the audience was almost entirely white. History The Chineke! Foundation was established in 2015, and its parallel orchestra followed in the same year, with the express purpose of providing \\"career opportunities to young Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) classical musicians in the UK and Europe\\". The ensemble debuted at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre in London in September 2015, conducted by Wayne Marshall, and highlighting works by Black British composers, such as Samuel Coleridge-Taylor‚Äôs Ballade for Orchestra and Elegy: In memoriam ‚Äì Stephen Lawrence by Philip Herbert. The orchestra was initially an entirely BME-member orchestra, but has since included white musicians. Chineke! became a resident orchestra at the Southbank Centre in 2016. The orchestra made its debut at The Proms in August 2017, conducted by Kevin John Edusei. Chineke!'s patron is Baroness Patricia Scotland QC. In 2017, the orchestra made its first commercial recording for the Signum label, conducted by Edusei. In November 2019, the Chineke! Foundation became the first-ever recipient of the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gamechanger Award, presented to an individual, group or organisation who in unique and contemporary ways has done inspirational and transformative work breaking new ground in classical music.

Sandys was many times a Member of Parliament for various constituencies including Plympton Erle and was the second son of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York and at the University of Oxford Sandys' tutor was Richard Hooker, author of the Ecclesiastical Polity, whose lifelong friend and executor Sandys became. Sandys attended the Middle Temple at the same time as Nicholas Eveleigh. Sandys was admitted to new chambers on 26 November 1591 and on 1 December 1595 relinquished his place in the latter on 18 May 1596 to Nicholas Eveleigh, who had been admitted to the Temple on 11 November 1590;Jacobean Gentleman: Sir Edwin Sandys, 1561‚Äì1629 By Theodore K.

She survived him and remarried to the lawyer Elize Hele (1560‚Äì1635), founder of Plympton Grammar School, who continued to reside with her at Parke, and whose monument with semi-recumbent effigy survives on the south side of the chancel in Bovey Tracey Church, looking directly across the altar to the effigy of Eveleigh. Death The timber-constructed Chagford Stannary Courthouse is believed to have stood on the southern side of Chagford Square, next to the present Three Crowns Hotel. It collapsed in 1617, killing Eveleigh, two of his clerks and seven others, also leaving a further 17 injured. The cause is believed to have been overcrowding and overloading of the floor timbers. Other theories have been suggested including earthquake and the curse of a dissatisfied defendant who \\"invoked the fates by asserting if his claims (which apparently were fantastical) weren't just that the court house might fall about his ears\\". The courthouse was later rebuilt on the lower side of the square.Rice, Book of Chagford The source of the story is stated by WorthWorth, R.N..

He worked three decades at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and continues to reside in Belgium. In 1971 he published a work on structuralism and in 1979 law and anthropology, asserting that the foundations of law are concealed in a specific image of a person.  Life and work Broekman, born February 16, 1931, in Voorburg, Netherlands, lives since 1968 in Belgium. He studied Sociology and Law at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden and Philosophy and Psychiatry at the Georg-August-Universit√§t in G√∂ttingen, Germany. His PhD promotion was in 1961 when he defended a thesis \\"Faktisches und Transzendentales Ego bei Edmund Husserl\\" written under the direction of Hermann Wein. That book was published 1963 by Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague, in the Series \\"Phaenomenologica\\" Vol. 12 and entitled \\"Ph√§nomenologie und Egologie\\". From 1961 until 1966 Broekman was Vice Director of the Haagse Sociale Academie, where he taught Philosophy and Social Sciences. From 1966 until 1968 he was Associate Professor Aesthetics and Contemporary Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. In those years he also taught aesthetics and philosophy at the Academies for Architecture in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, where he participated in discussions with well-known architects on the foundations of their profession. From 1968 until his retirement in 1996 he was Ordinary Professor Contemporary Philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy, University of Leuven and Ordinary Professor Philosophy and Theory of Law at the Faculty of Law of the KU Leuven in Belgium. In 1971 he established in the Law Faculty the \\"Instituut voor Grondslagenonderzoek van het Recht\\" [Institute for Research into the Foundations of Law]. From 1988 to 1994 he was dean and respectively pro-dean of the Law Faculty. Inspired by the series \\"Kolleg Philosophie\\" of Karl Alber Verlag, Freiburg i. Br., Germany, Broekman published 1971 his \\"Strukturalismus. Moskau-Prag-Paris\\", edited 1974 in English in the \\"Synthese Library\\", Vol. 65 by Reidel Publishing Cie. He was visiting professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 1972, lecturing on Marxism and Structuralism and presented his \\"Structuralism in Sociology : Its Theory And Application\\" to \\"The Association For Sociology in Southern Africa\\" in Durban, SA. From 1977 on he edited at the Alber Verlag, Germany, the encyclopedic series \\"Kolleg Rechtstheorie\\" he drafted with Meinolf Wewel. In that series he published in 1979 his \\"Recht und Anthropologie\\" [Law and Anthropology], in which the image of man was unveiled as a major constitutive factor in law. From here, new determinations pertaining to the constitution of law, to legal theory as well as to legal practice became feasible. The book was foundational for research into the field of legal semiotics, which Broekman unfolded in the second decade of the 21st century. From 1975 until 1979 Broekman directed with Hans-Georg Gadamer, Ante Pa≈æanin and Bernard Waldenfels the Project and Courses \\"Ph√§nomenologie und Marxismus\\" at the Inter-University Center in Dubrovnik (Croatia). Four Volumes resulted from its conferences; they were published by Suhrkamp Verlag in German, two volumes were published in Japanese (1982) and one in English (1984) (See ¬ß3). Parallel to his legal research, Broekman was Professor Philosophy of Medicine and Medical Ethics from 1980 to 1995 at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where he initiated lectures on the philosophy of medicine, established a research section \\"Medical Philosophy\\" and directed numerous doctoral dissertations on medicine and medical philosophy. He was president of the Dutch \\"Stichting Psychiatrie en Filosofie\\" from 1985 to 1995. Two Dutch publications resulted from those activities.Ziektebeelden, Ed. with Harald Feldmann und Philip van Haute. Peeters Leuven/Paris 1993 Schizophrenie: Het Raadsel Opgelost? Ed. with Charles F.A.Milders, Willem van Tilburg and Aart J.A. van Soest, Peeters Leuven/Paris 1997 In 1996, at the occasion of his retirement, his book ‚ÄúIntertwinements of Law and Medicine‚Äù was published. It reported about his parallel activities between Law and Medicine and underlined congruencies of the legal and the medical discourse in modern society. In 1982 was Broekman invited to be a founding member of ‚ÄúThe Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Filosof√≠a del Derecho‚Äù in La Plata (Argentina). Since those days, he lectured regularly at many universities and law schools in Argentina, Chili and Colombia. In the years 1985 ‚Äì 2006 he published essays on law and bioethics, on illness and citizenship, on transsexuality, euthanasia and related issues in the journal Jurisprudencia Argentina and other magazines. The 1998 publication Bioetica con Rasgos Juridicos (see ¬ß3) focuses upon the close ties between law, medicine and bioethics while providing insight in the relevant Latin-American discussions. Since his retirement in 1996, Broekman's scientific work unfolds almost exclusively in English language. He became a visiting professor of law at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1998 until 2005 and lectured in that period on philosophy of law, law and bioethics as well as on EU Legal Institutions.University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign College of Law In 1998/1999 he wrote his book on the philosophy of EU Law in Urbana-Champaign. In those years he also founded with Dr M. H. Foox (New York) the \\"IIS Institute\\"IIS ‚Äì Improving Institutional Skills & IIS Publishing Company, New York for the advancement of digital education programs and published five studies on that theme. His major focus was on how digital programs change the concept of interactivity, on how the virtual plays a different role in the world of electronic communication and in what ways the unfolding of a human self will touch new dimensions. In 2006 Broekman was appointed Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at the Pennsylvania State University, Dickinson School of Law.Penn State Law, Penn State University, Dickinson School of Law, University Park PA 16802 He lectured on EULaw as well as on the Principles of Civil Law and initiated the \\"Roberta Kevelson Seminar on Law and Semiotics\\" which he directed until 2013. He published with William A. Pencak two special issues of the \\"International Journal for the Semiotics of Law\\" dedicated to those Seminars and the student experiences with Legal Semiotics.Lawyers Making Meaning: The Roberta Kevelson Seminar on Law and Semiotics at Penn State University‚Äôs Dickinson School of Law, with William A.

Broekman's interest in the ‚ÄòLaw and Language‚Äô‚Äìtheme has been deepened during his exploration of legal semiotics. Connections between ‚ÄúSignifics‚Äù in the Netherlands, the UK, Germany and Switzerland in the beginning of the 20th century and ‚ÄúSemiotics‚Äù of Law in the second half of that century in the US, seem to have more importance for a philosophy of language connected with legal theory than ever was noticed. A volume of the series ‚ÄúSpringerBriefs in Law‚Äù on Roberta Kevelson that also provides a new, corrected and completed Kevelson bibliography will be published 2018.  Festschrifts Two festschrifts were published at the occasion of Broekman's retirement in 1996, one in English and one in Dutch: * Law, Life and the Images of Man.

Ramon√®de's artwork has also been featured in multiple publications. Currently, Ramon√®de is collaborating with Clarence Edgard-Rosa to develop new projects for Bobby Productions. Early life and education Ramon√®de hails from Toulouse. He first became interested in drawing at the age of fourteen, after discovering manga. Over the following two years, he developed a strong passion for animation. After meeting Romain Grandjean in high school, Ramon√®de was brought on as an animator and designer on Grandjean's 2002 stop motion short film Abraxas. Although Ramon√®de was inspired by Toy Story to pursue a career in computer animation, he changed course to pursue traditional animation after applying to Gobelins, l'√âcole de l'image. He attended there from 2002 to 2005. In 2004, he created the short student film R√©cr√© Fighter, and collaborated with classmates Pierre Perifel, Jun Frederic Violet, and R√©mi Zaarour on a second short film, Festival Qualit√©. The following year, he reteamed with Perifel and Zaarour to create his group thesis film, Le Building, which was also co-directed by Marco Nguyen and Olivier Staphylas. Le Building uses a combination of 2D and 3D animation. Ramon√®de colored most of the film's traditional animation and also handled most of its compositing. Le Building screened at numerous international film festivals and won several awards, including Best Undergraduate Animation at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. Ramon√®de has named Bruce Timm, Jamie Hewlett, Milt Kahl, James Baxter, Robert McGinnis, Mary Blair, and Miroslav ≈†a≈°ek as being among his artistic influences. Career The same year as his graduation from Gobelins (2005), Ramon√®de received credit as an animator on the short film Imago, directed by C√©dric Babouche. The following year, Ramon√®de worked as an animator on Everyone's Hero. Imago afforded Ramon√®de the opportunity to work with Perifel again, who served as one of the film's supervising animators. The two further collaborated as animators on Nocturna and The Illusionist. Other animation credits of Ramon√®de's include various French films and international co-productions, such as 99 Francs, Zarafa, Titeuf, and April and the Extraordinary World, as well as the French webseries ', and the music video for C2C's song \\"Delta\\". Ramon√®de has occasionally returned to Gobelins as a teacher and has also worked on various commercials. A 2013 commercial that he worked on for Deezer uses Mcbess characters and received a Bronze Clio Award. A 2015 project that he worked on, called Hippopolis, was directed by French artist Ugo Gattoni and serves as a companion to a scarf that Gattoni designed. Ramon√®de has been credited as an animator on Ankama's under-development television project Muffin Jack and Jeremy, and he is currently developing two series with Clarence Edgard-Rosa for Bobby Productions - Q and G.I.R.L.. Pin- up art by Ramon√®de is featured in Volume #1 of Dave Sim and Howard M. Shum's comic book series Gun Fu, which was published by Image Comics in 2005. In 2009, Ramon√®de contributed to the book Terrible Yellow Eyes, which features artwork inspired by Where the Wild Things Are. Ramon√®de also created artwork for a proposed art book tie-in to the French board game Color Warz, which in 2016, unsuccessfully sought funding through the French crowdfunding website .

The ban was imposed on Farrakhan, the leader of the black separatist Nation of Islam in the United States, in 1986. He sought to overturn the ban in 2001, relying on the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998, and was initially successful in the Administrative Court of the High Court of Justice ‚Äì the first time that an exclusion order had been successfully challenged in court. The British government appealed and in 2002 the Court of Appeal overturned the earlier decision, reinstating the ban. Farrakhan's solicitor, Sadiq Khan, later became Mayor of London. Background The Nation of Islam is an African-American religious group which came to prominence in the 1960s with members such as Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X, and came to prominence in the United Kingdom in the 1990s during the public inquiry that followed the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. The group preaches self-reliance for black people, including segregation from other races. Farrakhan caused controversy in 1984 when he called Adolf Hitler a \\"great man\\" in an interview, and two years later he was banned from entering the UK; from the 1990s onwards he used more moderate rhetoric on race. The Home Secretary is the only person who can ban a foreigner from entering the United Kingdom. Case In March 2001, Farrakhan was granted permission by the High Court to challenge his exclusion from the UK, per the recently enacted Human Rights Act. Sadiq Khan, Farrakhan's solicitor, said that there was a double standard in that white supremacists had been allowed into the UK. Mr Justice Turner, sitting in the Administrative Court (part of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court), ruled in Farrakhan's favour in July 2001, but deferred giving his reasons for quashing the ban until 1 October 2001, during which time it remained in force. The ruling was condemned by Jewish figures in the UK: Greville Janner, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, feared Farrakhan's potential impact amidst Jewish‚ÄìMuslim conflict in the Middle East. Khan said that Farrakhan had visited Israel without any issues. The government's appeal against the ruling was successful, and the decision of the High Court was overturned by the Court of Appeal in April 2002. The ruling was influenced by the legacy of the September 11 attacks, which had happened in the period between the judge's decision and the delivery of his judgment. Legacy Khan later became a Labour Party politician. During his campaign in the 2016 London mayoral election, his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith mentioned Khan's defence of Farrakhan as part of his campaign to portray Khan as a sympathiser to extremists. Khan told Jewish News that the nature of his profession as a human rights lawyer meant that he had to defend \\"unsavoury individuals\\" with whom he personally disagreed.

Created by Frances-White and Sofie Hagen in 2015, the podcast features guests on a panel to discuss topics on and related to feminism, and is recorded in front of a live audience.  Overview  The podcast was created by Deborah Frances-White and Sofie Hagen in December 2015. The idea for the podcast came from the pair having lunch together and often sharing their hypocrisies and double standards with each other. Hagen and Frances-White co- hosted the podcast until September 2016 when Hagen left. Since then a range of guests have co-hosted each episode. The podcast is recorded in front of a live audience and each episode lasts approximately 45 minutes. Each episode begins with short stories starting with the words \\"I'm a feminist, but...\\", with the episode's hosts admitting to moments where they have done or thought something that an ideal feminist wouldn't. Episodes are based around a theme, and topics of discussion have included stereotypes, hair removal, periods, not having children, or purchase of cosmetics. The presenters set themselves weekly challenges, and at the end of each episode audience members are invited to ask the panel questions. The show has featured guests such as Shappi Khorsandi, Gemma Arterton, Dawn O'Porter, and Aisling Bea. Frances-White aims to create diverse and inclusive panels of guests.  Reception  The podcast was shortlisted for an Internet Award in the 2017 Chortle Awards and nominated for Best Podcast in the 2017 Audio & Radio Industry Awards. In The Guardian's 2017 list of best podcasts, Kathryn Bromwich listed The Guilty Feminist as one of her six favourite podcasts in the 'sex, life and relationships' category.

It was executed by the British sculptor Joseph Wilton.Post, Chandler Rathfon, A History of European and American Sculpture: From the Early Christian Period to the Present Day, Volume ll, Harvard University Press, London, 1921 Commissioned in 1764 and cast in lead covered with gold leaf, the Neoclassical statue showed King George dressed in Roman garb astride a horse, the whole effect being reminiscent of the Marcus Aurelius statue in Rome. It was set up on a tall pedestal in Bowling Green Park in New York City and dedicated in August 1770. The following month another statue by Wilton, this one of William Pitt, a British politician very popular in the Americas for being responsible for the repeal of the much-hated Stamp Act of 1765 was erected. As with the King George statue, Pitt is portrayed in Roman clothes and was also located in New York. On July 9, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was first read in New York City, and to celebrate it a group of patriots pulled down the statue, and eventually melted it down to make bullets with which to fight the British. When British troops arrived in November of that year they retaliated by destroying the Pitt statue.Reynolds, Donald Martin, Monuments and Masterpieces: Histories and Views of Public Sculpture in New York City, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1988, pp.26‚Äì27 Haymarket statues (1900) The Haymarket affair statues. On May 3, 1886 police in Chicago, feeling threatened by a crowd, fired into it, killing six people. A rally was called the next day, held near Haymarket Square at which time an unknown person threw a bomb into a group of policemen, killing eight. Although it was never learned who threw the bomb, eight labor leaders were arrested, all were tried and found guilty and, after one committed suicide the day before he was to be executed, four others were hanged.The Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration for the State of Illinois, \\"The WPA Guide to Illinois, Pantheon Books, New York, 1983 pp.82‚Äì83 Several years later, after winning an 1887 competition, a monument by Johannes Gelert portraying a \\"robust policeman, in his countenance frank, kind, and resolute\\", was created. On the base were the words \\"In the name of the people of Illinois I command peace\\" though a reporter at the event had the policeman saying, \\"In the name of the law I command you to disperse.\\" The monument, a policeman standing with his arm upraised, for which the sculptor had used a policeman directing traffic as his inspiration, was dedicated May 30, 1889. At the dedication the Mayor of Chicago, DeWitt Cregier, had said, \\"May it stand here unblemished so long as the metropolis shall endure\\" words that were amazingly unprophetic. In 1900, after it had been frequently vandalized and defaced and \\"unmistakable traces\\" of an attempt to blow it up were discovered, the statue was moved to near Randolph and Ogden streets in Union Park. On May 4, 1927, on the fourth-first anniversary of the Haymarket affair, a \\"streetcar traveling at full speed jumped the tracks and rammed the statue\\". The monument was moved again, further into the park. In October 1969 and again exactly one year later attempts were made to blow up the statue. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley placed the statue under 24-hour police guard. In 1972 the statue was moved into the Central Police Headquarters, and then moved again in 1976 into the garden of the Police Training center. In 1893 the Haymarket Martyrs' Monument by Albert Weinert was unveiled in the German Waldheim Cemetery, where the four men executed, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, Albert Parsons, and George Engel, and Louis Lingg who committed suicide the day before the hanging, are buried. On September 14, 2004, another monument was unveiled, this one by Mary Brogger.

She was to win three of them (memorials to Moses Austin, Isaac and Frances Van Zandt and First Shot Fired For Texas Independence monument) but she was not able to win the Pioneer Woman statue. It is not yet clear how many plaster models were submitted, but a \\"jury of professionals\\" unanimously chose the one submitted by William Zorach, a sculptor from New York.

Bust of United States Senator Joseph McCarthy United States Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin (1908‚Äì1957) served as a Wisconsin Circuit Court judge prior to his election to the United States Senate. In 1959, a bust of Joseph McCarthy was dedicated at the Outagamie County Justice Center in Appleton, Wisconsin. Some Outagamie County officials had discussed about removing the bust from the justice center. In 2001, the McCarthy bust was sent to the History Museum at the Castle in Appleton, Wisconsin.

Raymond Memorial The Races of Mankind (1969) The Races of Mankind is a series of 104 sculptures created for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago by sculptor Malvina Hoffman, representing the various races of humankind, and unveiled in 1933. Most of the sculptures are life-sized. The works were initially housed in Hall 3, the Chauncey Keep Memorial Hall (\\"The Hall of the Races of Mankind\\"). In the 1960s such a portrayal of race became viewed negatively, as racist, and in February 1969 the Hall was dismantled and the statues were either spread around the museum or placed in storage. The museum stated that the Hall was \\"scientifically indefensible and socially objectionable\\".

The anonymous competition drew the largest number of submissions ever, 1,141, for such a competition in the United States. Shortly after the winner, Ohio native Maya Lin, a twenty- year-old female student of Chinese descent, was announced, controversy began. \\"The debate became increasingly bitter, threatening to end the project.\\" The monument was said to look like \\"a black gash of shame\\".Lopes, Sal, introduction by Michael Norman, The Wall: Images and Offerings from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Collins Publishers, Inc., New York, 1987 p. 16 \\"Lin maintains, entirely accurately, that there's no way her design would have been chosen if candidates had been identified by name.\\" Eventually the problem of what to build was resolved by adding the Frederick Hart bronze statue of three soldiers near the Memorial.

The monument was the last word.\\" The monument is now the most frequently visited memorial in Washington D.C. Captain John Mason and the Pequot massacre (1996) In 1996, an 1889 statue of Captain John Mason was removed from the intersection of Pequot Avenue and Clift Street in Mystic, Connecticut at the request of the Pequot Tribal Council. Mason led the Pequot massacre of 1637. The plaque on the statue was removed and given to the Mystic Historical Society. The statue itself was relocated to Palisado Green in Windsor, Connecticut (41¬∞51‚Ä≤29‚Ä≥N 72¬∞38‚Ä≤11‚Ä≥W), which is where John Mason lived at the time of the Pequot War. A new plaque was made, without mention of the Pequots. In 1859, a Founders Monument, containing a statue of Mason and the names of the 38 original settlers of Norwich, Connecticut, was erected at the original burial grounds at Bean Hill in Norwich. This monument is also referred to as the Mason Monument. There is a life-sized stone carving of Major John Mason on the Connecticut State Capitol building, as he was a preeminent founder of the Colony.

The neo- classical stone doorway is dated 1767 in roman numerals, and the gable stone set into it from 1612 was repainted in 2017. The entire doorway is part of the Elisabeth Gasthuis complex and has itself been declared one of the national monuments of The Netherlands. This doorway originally led to the small public garden called the Elisabeth Gasthuis tuin with an entrance to the old regent rooms. Hospital expansion over the centuries has resulted in this doorway now opening onto a large stairwell as part of the larger hospital complex. Today no longer a hospital, the various parts of the old complex are used mostly for educational purposes and residential apartments. There still is a small garden in the middle of the complex however, and another gate still leads to that garden from the other side of the block. Like other parts of the old St. Elisabeth Gasthuis complex, this door also bears the coat of arms of Haarlem with that of Elizabeth of Hungary (the three crowns). The gable stone tells the history of the hospital. On the left a monk peeks at the viewer, symbolizing one of the monks who were driven away from this place in the 1580s when it was still the minderbroedersklooster. Next on the left are the nuns of the original hospice fleeing the fire of 1576. Behind them you see the fire. Their old St. Elisabeth Gasthuis hospice burned which was located on the Verwulft. They were awarded this land, after the monks were driven away. On the right a glimpse of how the old patient care hall looked. In the middle a reminder of how the bedridden patients were brought in: two men carried them on a type of stretcher that was kept as flat as possible with a special gait that was out of step: you see that the legs of the men are positioned opposite to each other. Such stretchers and the special gait are still used for the Alkmaar cheese market today.

Te Ratana went to Palmerston Intermediate Normal School, followed by Palmerston North Girls‚Äô High School. Her work PW 1 (Tiki remix) is included in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewea collections and as part of the 2013 Auckland Triennial celebrations, her work was acquired by the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki.  Education  Te Ratana graduated from the MƒÅori Visual Arts programme Toioho Ki Apiti at Te P≈´tahi-a-Toi, School of MƒÅori Studies, Massey University. Following graduation she has remained involved with the university including as a tutor and lecturer in MƒÅori visual arts.  Career  Te Ratana works with mixed media, often creating three-dimensional structures using material such as fabrics, cardboard, wood, and fiberglass. She often works collaboratively with other artists, including creating works with her partner Ngataiharuru Taepa for over ten years. Co-created pieces include Ka kata te po (with Taepa & Hemi Macgregor, shown at the Te Manawa Art Gallery in 2011 then at the 5th Auckland Triennial) and Tu te manu ora i te Rangi (2008). Considered a leading contemporary MƒÅori artist, her works draw on her heritage and often comments on the suppression of tribal voices. Her work Ka kata te po (2011) is a response to the Urewera Raids of 2007. The piece Tu te manu ora i te Rangi explores MƒÅori cosmology through legends of TƒÅne, Rehua, Ranginui and Papat≈´ƒÅnuku, and the MƒÅori creation myth.  Exhibitions  While at university, Te Ratana participated in several high-profile group exhibitions including Purangiaho: Seeing Clearly (2001) at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki and TaiƒÅwhio: Continuity and Change (2002) at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

It educates children of both sexes aged 2 to 13. The school sits in parkland of 30 acres, which includes woodland, chalk grassland slopes and a pond. The school was founded in 1921 and is a member of the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) and it is a non-selective day school. The headmaster is Stuart Douch and the principal is Patricia Sinclair. The school has strong links with the Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin and holds its annual Harvest Festival and Christmas carol services there.  Sompting Abbotts House  Aerial view The main school is housed in Sompting Abbotts House which was originally called Sompting Manor. Sompting Abbotts and the estate around it is believed to have been inhabited since the Neolithic period. The line of the original Chichester‚ÄìBrighton Roman road runs through the school parkland. Following the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, Sompting Manor was granted in 1540 to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. In 1814, Princess Caroline, wife of the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), stayed at the manor on one of her royal visits to Worthing. It followed a stay in the town during her troubled marriage. The next day, she sailed to France from Lancing. view from south The manor, along with its estate passed to Reverend P.G. Croft in 1830. At this time, the manor contained a house with a five-bay symmetrical south front. Sompting Abbotts House was built in 1856 for Rev. Croft‚Äôs son, Henry. it was designed by the architect Philip Charles Hardwick (later to design the great hall of Euston railway station) in Neo-Gothic style for the then owner Henry Croft to replace Sompting Manor. Hardwick's design was completed in 1856. The 1875 Ordnance Survey map shows the ground to the east and south with sweeping lawns and groups of trees which remain today. Sompting Abbotts House features high slate roofs, lancet casement windows, stone mullions, octagonal towers, spiral staircases and a castellated parapet. The house is a Grade II listed building.  School history  The school was founded following World War I by the Rutherford family in 1921. Mr. A.C. Rutherford opened Sompting Abbotts House as a boys' boarding school in 1921, which lasted until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, when it was temporary closed. The school was evacuated to Cabalva Hall, Wales, and the Army took control of the house and grounds. The Sinclair family acquired the premises in 1946, following the war, and reopened it as a boy's boarding school, though it had become dilapidated in the interim. The headmaster, Nigel Sinclair, later wrote \\"It was a depressing sight. All the playing fields and lawns were an unrecognisable overgrown jungle of grass and bushes,\\" adding that most windows had been broken.\\" In 2018, a wartime letter to a past pupil, dated 1939, was discovered under the floorboards of a dormitory. The school traced its original owner to Australia. Over the years, the school has evolved. It became co-educational in 1998 and closed its boarding facilities in 2008. In total, it has had six headmasters: John Hammond, George Rutherford, Nigel Sinclair, Richard Johnson and Timothy Sinclair. The current head is Stuart Douch.  Curriculum  Entrance to Sompting Abbotts Preparatory School The school offers a curriculum that includes IT, coding and computing, art, PE, music and drama. It prepares children for the Common Entrance Examination (CEE) and other scholarship examinations to public senior schools. As of 2017 it cites a 100% success rate in the CEE since 2008 and 95% success rate for all pupils entered for a scholarship since 2008. The school is not a designated feeder school to any specific senior school. Destination senior schools to which pupils have gained scholarships, exhibitions and awards since 2007 include Lancing College, Brighton College, Hurstpierpoint College, Seaford College, Sherborne, Worth, Dulwich College, Farlington, Burgess Hill Girls and Towers Convent School.  Notable alumni  The author Alex Preston described Sompting Abbotts as \\"all of my Jennings and Malory Towers fantasies rolled into one Gothic dream of a building.\\" Other alumni include lead singers Samuel Preston (of The Ordinary Boys) and Ned Mortimer (of August and After), property developer Nicholas Sutton, cricketer and headmaster Chris Saunders, and Simon Walsh, consultant in emergency medicine at The Royal London Hospital.

History Background and establishment of Prometheus I Following the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940, Section D of British intelligence began recruiting Greeks for clandestine espionage and sabotage activity for the event that Greece might succumb to the Axis Powers in mind. Given its purpose, this activity was kept secret from the Greek government‚Äîthe dictatorial 4th of August Regime led by General Ioannis Metaxas‚Äîand the Greek military; instead, the British agents turned to elements traditionally hostile to the ruling regime, chiefly former Republicans, pro-Liberal or left-wing elements, and even Communists. The Republicans and Liberals were historically hostile to Germany and friendly to Britain dating back to the National Schism of World War I, and furthermore eager to fight in their own way since the regime had refused many Venizelist officers who had been dismissed from the military following the Republican coup attempt of March 1935 the opportunity to fight on the front. Likewise the leftists were more accustomed to clandestine and conspiratorial activity, while the British understood early on that \\"effective sabotage or guerrillas can only thrive if a revolutionary atmosphere has been created previously\\", and were thus disposed to use the anti-monarchical elements in Greece, whether Republican or Communist, for their own ends. In early 1941, using Elli Kountourioti (granddaughter of the Liberal icon, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis) as an intermediary, the British established a clandestine cell in Athens. It was led by Colonel Evripidis Bakirtzis (under the code name Œ†œÅŒøŒºŒ∑Œ∏ŒµœçœÇ, \\"Prometheus\\"), and comprised several dismissed Republican officers, such as Charalambos Koutsogiannopoulos, Dimitris Bardopoulos, and Ilias Degiannis. The cell was named but due to the German invasion of Greece and the rapid conquest of the country in April‚ÄìMay 1941, the British were not able to organize their clandestine network on a firm basis or provide them with suitable material such as radios. Following the British withdrawal, only the Prometheus group used its transmitter to send information to SOE in Cairo. That communication was delayed due to the group's lack of code books, which arrived only in November 1941 through the SOE agent Gerasimos Alexatos, but it was not until the spring of 1942 that the group's legitimacy was accepted by SOE in Cairo. It was through Prometheus that SOE became aware of the burgeoning resistance movement in Greece, with the establishment of major resistance organizations such as the National Liberation Front (EAM) and the National Republican Greek League (EDES). Prometheus II In early 1942, Bakirtzis was forced to leave Greece because his identity had been revealed to the Axis following the arrest of the British agent John Atkinson. This left Koutsogiannopoulos, Bardopoulos, and Degiannis in charge of the group, which was accepted as \\"Prometheus II\\" by SOE in Cairo in March 1942. On 3 March 1942, SOE instructed the group to prepare for the arrival by parachute of SOE agents, as well as to begin recruiting new members and establish safe places for weapons and explosives in preparation of a sabotage and guerrilla campaign. In April 1942, Koutsogiannopoulos and another associate of the group, Alekos Seferiadis, were involved in the discussions between Alexatos and prominent Republican political and military personages‚ÄîBakirtzis, Napoleon Zervas of EDES, Komninos Pyromaglou, Stefanos Sarafis, and Dimitrios Psarros‚Äîon the subject of beginning guerrilla warfare and the Republican officers' stance towards the Communist-controlled EAM. Despite having received 800 gold sovereigns from the British for the purpose of raising guerrilla forces in the mountains, Zervas proved was reluctant to do so, and was tarrying in Athens, partly because of British willingness to also fund EAM. Cairo came to consider him untrustworthy and ordered Prometheus to cut off all contact with him. Koutsogiannopoulos, fearing that this would scupper the efforts to create an EDES-led guerrilla force, went to Zervas and threatened him, virtually at gunpoint, to publicly denounce him as a traitor and collaborator over the BBC unless he left Athens to lead armed resistance. Zervas left Athens for Epirus on 23 July. The group began its sabotage activity in the area of Athens, in coordination with the British GHQ in the Middle East, in June‚ÄìJuly 1942. The main aim was to obstruct the flow of supplies to the Axis forces in North Africa. Thus Prometheus II sank one oil tanker and one cargo ship carrying ammunition, and damaged two more tankers and two more cargo ships, necessitating repairs that put them out of commission for several weeks. Later, with the aid of the naval engineer Psalidakis, the group managed to retrieve information on the German submarines to be based in the area. The group continued its activities until February 1943, when the occupation authorities broke it up. Koutsogiannopoulos was arrested but managed to escape with the aid of Ioannis Peltekis, who bribed a clerk to place an order for his release in the pile of papers that the German commandant habitually signed. During the Dekemvriana of 1944, Koutsogiannopoulos sided with the EAM against the British and government forces. As a result, in the post-war period he faced prosecution, and received no recognition for his Resistance activity.

Thought to be a male warrior since the grave's excavation in 1889, the remains have been proved to be female by both osteological analysis and a DNA study in 2017. The study concludes the artifacts buried with the woman are evidence she was a high- ranking professional warrior. That conclusion has been disputed as premature by some archaeologists and historians who say the artifacts are not evidence that women were warriors in patriarchal Viking culture. This controversy has contributed to the debate about the role of women in Viking society.  Archaeological records   Initial excavation  Archaeologist and ethnographer Hjalmar Stolpe (1841-1905) excavated a warrior's burial chamber in the 1870s, as part of his archaeological research at the Viking Age site Birka, on the island Bj√∂rk√∂ (literally: \\"Birch Island\\") in present-day Sweden. In 1889 he documented the grave as Bj 581. It has been considered \\"one of the most iconic graves from the Viking Age.\\" The grave was marked by a large stone boulder and was found on an elevated terrace where it was in direct contact with the garrison. The grave chamber was made out of wood and it was 3.45 m long and 1.75 m wide. The body was found collapsed from a sitting position, wearing garments of silk, with silver thread decorations. The goods found in the grave included \\"a sword, an axe, a spear, armour-piercing arrows, a battle knife, two shields, and two horses, one mare and one stallion\\". For the next 128 years, the skeleton was assumed to be that of a \\"battle hardened man\\". The warrior has been compared to \\"a figure from Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries\\".  Reanalysis of skeletal remains  Studies in the 1970s had questioned the assumption the skeleton was male. A 2014 osteological analysis of the skeleton's pelvic bones and mandible by Stockholm University bioarchaeologist Anna Kjellstr√∂m provided evidence that it was the grave of a woman. Some archaeologists were skeptical, citing the probability that the bones had been mis-labeled in the last century, or perhaps jumbled with bones from other nearby graves. A study led by Charlotte Hedenstierna-Jonson, published in September 2017, noted Kjellstr√∂m's \\"osteological analysis triggered questions concerning sex, gender and identity among Viking warriors\\". Hedenstierna-Jonson's team extracted DNA from samples taken from a tooth and an arm bone of the person buried in Bj 581. According to Maja Krezwinska, the skeleton was conclusively proved to be that of a woman, having two, different X-chromosomes, but no Y-chromosomes. The same study also analyzed Strontium isotopes on the skeleton, to determine the geographic profile of the individual. This determined that she has similar markers with present-day people living in areas that were under the sphere of influence of the Vikings. This has brought forward the question of whether or not the individual was originally from Birka, or if she had settled there afterwards. Controversially, the conclusion of the study was that \\"the individual in grave Bj 581 is the first confirmed female high-ranking Viking warrior\\". The authors responded to the criticism of their original study in a second article published in Antiquity, which provided additional information about their methodology and reaffirmed their conclusion.  Analysis of grave artifacts  Analysis of the contents of the grave showed that it contained a game set with a board and pieces, thought to be evidence of her strategic thinking and indicating \\"that she was an officer who could lead troops into battle\\". The Guardian reported, \\"Gaming pieces ‚Äì perhaps from hnefatafl, a sort of precursor to chess ‚Äì suggest the female warrior from grave Bj 581 was a battle strategist.\\" According to Kjellstr√∂m, \\"Only a few warriors are buried with gaming pieces, and they signal strategic thinking.\\" The evidence also points to her as a member of the military caste. The Washington Post reported, \\"The warrior was, in fact, female. And not just any female, but a Viking warrior woman, a shieldmaiden, like the ancient Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones.\\" Archaeologist David Zori noted, \\"numerous Viking sagas, such as the 13th century Saga of the Volsungs, tell of 'shield-maidens' fighting alongside male warriors\\".  Interpretations  Scholars have not agreed on the interpretation of complex Viking burial findings. Viking studies professor Judith Jesch rebutted the study's conclusion that the skeleton interred in Bj 581 was female, arguing that since the grave was excavated in 1889, bones from other graves may have been mixed together; that the inference that she was a warrior because of game pieces buried in the grave was premature speculation; and that the researchers had not considered other reasons that a female body ended up in a warrior's tomb. Authors of the Hedenstierna-Jonson paper noted that \\"Viking scholars have been reluctant to acknowledge the agency of women with weapons\\", and \\"At Birka, grave Bj 581 was brought forward as an example of an elaborate high-status male warrior grave.\\" Additionally, they cited Marianne Moen's 2011 study that concluded, the \\"image of the male warrior in a patriarchal society was reinforced by research traditions and contemporary preconceptions\\". The Hedenstierna-Jonson team considered questions about the sex identification of the remains within the context of the martial objects buried with the bones, asserting that \\"the distribution of the grave goods within the grave, their spatial relation to the female individual and the total lack of any typically female attributed grave artefacts\\" disputed possibilities that the other artefacts belonged to the family of the deceased, or to a male \\"now missing\\" from the grave. In answer to the question, \\"Do weapons necessarily determine a warrior?\\", the authors stress that interpreting the relevance of the artefacts buried with the body \\"... should be made in a similar manner regardless of the biological sex of the interred individual\\". After noting the androcentrism in archaeology and commenting on the questions some have interpreting the evidence for a female warrior, one observer wrote, The Hedenstierna-Jonson study concludes with the comment, \\"the combination of ancient genomics, isotope analyses and archaeology can contribute to the rewriting of our understanding of social organization concerning gender, mobility and occupation patterns in past societies.\\" Swedish historian Dick Harrison of Lunds University noted, \\"What has happened in the past 40 years through archaeological research, partly fueled by feminist research, is that women have been found to be priestesses and leaders, too ... This has forced us to rewrite history.\\"  Female warriors in other Viking Age sources  The image of warrior women was not foreign to the Vikings: There are several examples of female depictions where they are seen wielding weapons.  Mythology  * Norse mythology depicts a group of supernatural women warriors called the Valkyries mentioned in the Poetic Edda, who act as guardians in Valhalla and allot death on the battlefield. Although shown carrying the dying from the midst of battle, they are rarely depicted participating in combat, although they are described as carrying spears. * Shield-maidens are female warriors that take on male characteristics and attitudes, like dress and the wielding of weapons. They do this either because there is no male member of the family left, or they are escaping marriage.  Iconography  * The Oseberg tapestry depicts anthropomorphic figures in dress that resembles that of Viking Age women, holding spears and swords. * A series of brooches found in Tiss√∏, Denmark depict what are believed to be armed female figures on horseback. * A three-dimensional figure found in H√•rby, Denmark, depicts a Viking Age female figure holding a sword and shield. The public interpreted it as a depiction of a Valkyrie, but nowhere in Norse mythology are Valkyries described wielding swords (their weapon of choice being a spear). This raises questions of whether this figure could represent a human female warrior.  Literature  There are few historical attestations that Viking Age women took part in warfare: * Saxo Grammaticus, in his History of the Danes, described warrior women dressed as men and wielding weapons. * The Byzantine historian John Skylitzes records that women fought in battle when Sviatoslav I of Kiev attacked the Byzantines in Bulgaria in 971. When the Varangians (not to be confused with the Byzantine Varangian Guard) had suffered a devastating defeat in the Siege of Dorostolon, the victors were stunned to discover armed women among the fallen warriors. Saga literature has many examples of this as well: * Freyd√≠s, in the Greenland saga, is manipulative and greedy. After cheating the people she was traveling with, Freyd√≠s proceeds to murder five women with an axe. * The Laxd√¶la saga tells the story of Au√∞r, whose husband leaves her for another woman because she is always wearing men‚Äôs breeches. She decides to take her revenge and, dressed like a man, stabs him with a sword. The Laxd≈ìla saga has the broadest range of female characters out of all the sagas, and probably had an intended female audience. It is interpreted as presenting an alternative to the disenchanted lives that women were living given their limited role in society. * Herv√∂r, in the Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks, is Angantyr‚Äôs only child.

She was a pioneering player in the reform of the Uruguayan school system in the 1880s, establishing the country's first women's teacher training college, Instituto Normal de Se√±oritas. In 1916, together with her former students, she formed the National Women's Council of Uruguay. Biography Born in Montevideo in 1856, Stagnero was raised in a family with limited resources. As a result, she did not begin her formal school education until she was 12 years old, but thanks to her diligence, she matriculated four years later. In 1872, she took up a position as assistant school mistress. In 1874, she passed the examinations which allowed her to work as a fully qualified primary school teacher. In 1878, after taking additional evening classes, she was appointed to give a course in grammar and composition at the Sociedad de Amigos de la Educaci√≥n Popular, following in the footsteps of the influential politician and educationalist Jos√© Pedro Varela who had just died. She was the only woman who taught at the institution. In 1882, she founded and headed what was originally called Internado Normal de Se√±oritas, a women's teacher training college. It consisted of 15 women students from the Uruguayan provinces, all of whom were boarders. In 1898, after boarding requirements were lifted, it was renamed Instituto Normal de Se√±oritas and in 1912, in Stagnero's honour, it was given the name Instituto Normal Mar√≠a Stagnero de Munar.

By 1903 she was recognized as a journalist to whom \\"even men\\" paid their homage: The Journalist, a New York City weekly periodical about newspaper people and their work, profiled Winn in its series of prominent writers. Early life Jane Frances Winn was born in 1855 in Chillicothe, Ohio, the daughter of Thomas Winn (1825‚Äì1880) and Anna M. Winn (1835‚Äì1901). She was of Irish parentage on her father's side, and on her mother's she was of English extraction. When she was twelve years old, Winn became the editor of her grammar-school paper, the \\"Excelsior\\". She wrote the editorials, padded the \\"want columns\\" and wrote a poem each week. Career Like many women journalists at the time, Winn started her career as a teacher, teaching both botany and chemistry in her native town of Ohio. While she was teaching in high school, her sister Eleanor was teaching in the elementary school. To keep up with the work of her classes, for five years Winn took courses at Harvard University during the summer, and spent one summer at the Starling Medical College in Columbus, Ohio, studying chemistry privately under Curtis B. Howard, who was a well-known toxicologist. When the board of education would not supply a laboratory for qualitative analysis to the chemistry class Winn was teaching, Winn and her students created one of their own. They constructed test tube holders from jack-knives, and out of ink bottles constructed the alcohol lamps. One of her students, Frederick L. Dunlap, later became an instructor of chemistry at the University of Michigan and worked with chemical companies in the Chicago area. Winn made a study of the oaks of Ohio and wrote a monograph on the subject, and she was elected vice-president of the Ohio Academy of Science for 1895. Her desire to write, and a series of articles on botany, illustrated by one of the boy pupils in her class, was her introduction to newspaper work in the city of St. Louis. The young man, William Ireland, became the cartoonist of The Columbus Dispatch, and was known by the shamrock attached to his signature. Winn was one of the founders of the Century Club of her native town ‚Äî Chillicothe, Ohio ‚Äî one of the others who was a charter member being Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, well known in literature. The club, of which she was the secretary for three years, sent Winn as a delegate to the general federation convention in Denver in 1898, and stopping off in St. Louis to meet the editor of the paper to whom she had been sending her botany stories, she was engaged to take charge of the club column. Winn was the representative of her newspaper on the Board of Lady Managers for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and counted as one of her privileges to have met Cardinal Francesco Satolli, among others. Introduced to him by Archbishop John J. Glennon as a newspaper writer, he impulsively picked up a menu at a dinner in his honor at the German House, and wrote down \\"Honestas, Veritas, Caritas\\", saying, \\"Let this be your motto: 'Be honest always in what you write, tell only the truth, and love your profession so dearly that you will never fall short of your ideal of perfect fairness.' \\" Imaginative sketch by journalist Marguerite Martyn, showing herself atop a volume of Poetry by Frank Fair, with Winn hiding behind an open cover, 1914 Winn's work was club news, \\"Matters of Interest for Women Readers,\\" on the daily, and a half page, each week, under the name of \\"Frank Fair,\\" under caption \\"Women the Wide World Over,\\" including two poems for the Sunday \\"Globe-Democrat.\\" The column \\"Matters of Interest to Women Readers,\\" was finished off with a paragraph, \\"By Way of Comment,\\" often a poem. For many years, friends asked Winn to collect them in a book but she never agreed. On Sundays \\"Women the Wide World Over\\" took up a half page, and was a condensed account of what women were accomplishing, in what work they were progressing in the United States and abroad. Winn was on the staff of the St. Louis Globe- Democrat, first as women's editor, than women's sports editor and last as literary editor and head of the department of book review, while continuing to write the Frank Fair column. When she died in 1927, she was still employed at the newspaper. She was a pioneer golf writer, editor for the women's sports because she was one of the few newspaper women in the 1900s to be familiar with the game. She covered the principal women's golf events: The Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island admitted women in 1891, the first ladies golf tournament in the United States was held in 1894 and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States, soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association, was formed in 1894. As early as 1903 she was recognized as a journalist to whom even men paid their homage: The Journalist, a New York City weekly periodical devoted to the interests of newspaper people and their work, profiled Winn in its series of prominent writers: \\"Among the feminist contingent of the Globe-Democrat's staff, a lady whose work is attracting particular attention, is Miss Jane Frances Winn, who writes of women's clubs, golf, whist, botany and kindred subjects. Under the pen name of \\"Frank Fair\\" her brilliant articles are widely read, as well as are her clever contributions each week in the magazine section.\\" She was a member of the English-Speaking Union, the National Arts Club, the National Science Club and the Contemporary Club. In 1905 she wrote \\"Elsinore, or the Land of the Silver Lining\\", which was represented by child actors at the Century Theater in St. Louis under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The performance was for the benefit of the Memorial Home, Grand and Magnolia Avenue. In 1909 Winn wrote \\"Papilla or the Culprit Fairy\\", which was represented at the Odeo on May under the direction of Jacob Mahler. The proceeds were to go to the Baptist Orphans' Home. In 1915 Winn, together with Anna G. Marten, addressed the Missouri Women's Press Association during Journalism Week in Columbia, Missouri. Winn's panel was \\"The New Journalism in Its Relation to Women\\". In 1920 she addressed the Missouri Press Association in Rolla, Missouri, with the talk \\"Journalism for Women\\". In 1922, during the 25th annual dinner and business meeting of the Ohio Society of St. Louis, Winn was elected as a director. In 1926, she spoke in front of the Society of St. Louis Authors on \\"The Woman on the Job\\". In 1921 Winn, speaking on free verse as a \\"protest against old-fashioned rhymes,\\" called Walt Whitman the \\"father of the new movement\\" and Sara Teasdale the \\"Shelley of America\\". Personal life Jane Frances Winn lived with her brother, Frank T. Winn (1865‚Äì1918), who was also engaged in newspaper work, near Forest Park University. She never married, and spent the later part of her life writing. She died in 1927 and is buried with her family at Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ohio.

After attracting the attention of Virgin with their industrial cover version of Prince's \\"Kiss\\", the band signed to the label and began working on the album with producer Howard Gray, whose Sequential Circuits Studio 440 drum machine enticed the band. Gray was given free hand by Virgin on the album, which was recorded at Trident Studios. The album showcases the band's unique \\"crush collision\\" sound, incorporating sampling, noisy power chords, hard percussion, house beats, and influences from post-punk and hip hop. Lead singer Steve Elvidge's lyrics display a Northern, bitter tone, incorporating sloganeering and commenting on contemporary politics. The influential packaging was one of the first major projects by Designer's Republic. One Thousand Years of Trouble was promoted by a live tour and the release of three singles, all of which had specially commissioned twelve-inch mixes, including a remix of \\"Take It!\\" by Public Enemy. The album itself received critical acclaim but saw little commercial success. However, the album's style has since been regarded as innovative and groundbreaking, anticipating commercially successful bands like Pop Will Eat Itself, Jesus Jones, Carter USM and EMF, who became popular several years after the album's release. The album's engineers Steve Osbourne and Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent also took influence from the recording sessions in later productions. Background Age of Chance formed in Leeds in 1984. The band's first independent singles, \\"Motorcity\\" (1985) and \\"Bible of the Beats\\" (1986) were noisy post-punk songs incorporating sloganeering and snare drum snaps on each downbeat, reflecting the band's love for Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth and Motown soul. Both songs were successful in the UK Independent Singles Chart. The song \\"From Now On, This Will Be Your God\\" soon appeared on the influential jangle pop compilation C86, released with the NME in 1986. This was despite Age of Chance and other contributors like Big Flame and Stump being stylistically different to the album's characteristic indie pop sound. Age of Chance's subsequent releases saw the band meld their noise rock influences with samplers and hip hop, \\"music with an influence palpable across swathes of subsequent British pop.\\" The band took further influence from disco and Prince and changed their attire to brightly coloured lycra clothes. For the sole single from their mini-album Kiss Crush Collision (1986), which reached number 4 in the UK Independent Albums Chart, Age of Chance covered Prince's then-recent hit \\"Kiss\\", working out the music from hearing it in clubs and consulting Smash Hits for the lyrics, although changing them considerably.Age Of Chance \\"Kiss\\" 7\\", Fon AGE-5, 1986. The cover features an industrial music style, described by bass player Geoff Taylor as \\"[removing] the sex and [replacing] it with lump hammers.\\" Upon its release in November 1986, it reached number one on the UK Indie charts, and attracted the attention of Virgin Records, who signed the band with a ¬£100,000 advance, which unusually saw the band deal directly with head of Virgin, as opposed to an A&R; executive. Before signing to the British label, Age of Chance first signed with Virgin's American subsidiary. Once signed to both labels, Age of Chance began work on One Thousand Years of Trouble. Recording Howard Gray (pictured in 2010). Age of Chance told Virgin they wanted to co-produce the album, a circumstance rarely granted to bands on major labels recording their debut album. The band interviewed potential co-producers at Virgin's headquarters, ultimately settling on Howard Gray, who they discovered carrying a copy of \\"Kiss\\" in a West End bar between interviews, and who informed the band he liked their material. As Gray was an established and successful producer who had worked with UB40 and Terence Trent D'Arby, he was considered an unusual choice to produce the album, but in addition to enjoying the band, he had purchased a Sequential Circuits Studio 440 drum machine sequencer to create music similar to the band's material. The producer's prior successes allowed him to be given free rein on the album by Virgin Records. His fascination with the Studio 440 machine later inspired the name of his electronic group Apollo 440. Meanwhile, DJ Powercut (Noel Watson), an acquiantece of Gray's, joined the band as a DJ for the creation of the album and its subsequent tour. At the time, he was a London-based hip-hop DJ and host of the \\"Delerium at the Astoria\\" club night, and his reputation in the London's UK hip hop scene was strong enough that by 1987, he and his brother were mentioned by Derek B on his single \\"Get Down.\\" With Watson in the line-up, Age of Chance became one of the earliest rock groups to feature a DJ as a member. He is credited in the album's liner notes as The Almighty Power- Cut. Over a number of months, the band worked up the songs on the album in a Leeds rehearsal room. The versions of the songs played were relatively no- frills and bare compared to the final versions, and were described by Taylor as a \\"guitar/bass/samples kind of thing.\\" Later on, Gray sat in on a session in order \\"to get the general vibe,\\" and then he and the band set about recording demos of the songs in an expensive Leeds studio. Scrapped during these sessions was a work-in-progress between Taylor and Noel later described by the former as a stylistic fusion between the music of Sonic Youth and the Glitter Band with Tony Iommi-style guitar. The band used three Akai S900 samplers on the album. Gray and the band then moved to Trident Studios, London, a studio they felt was sufficient enough as it was the recording place of many iconic 1970s glam rock albums. They were joined by engineer Mark 'Spike' Stent and tape operator Steve Osbourne, and planned six weeks recording at Trident One and then another six weeks mixing the album at Trident Two. At the start of these sessions, they spent a decent amount of time experimenting with different sounds for each track, shaping the album's musical style. Having acquired three Akai S900 samplers, the band sampled television, films and sound libraries, as well as their own tracks. They had overran their scheduled time at Trident One, so spent further time recording the album in Trident Two, which caused issues with budgeting. Composition One Thousand Years of Trouble showcases the band's \\"crush collision\\" musical hybrid, combining crunchy but clipped guitar power chords, grumbling bass, blaring drumming, house beats, samples and even gospel choirs. Stewart Mason of AllMusic feels the album's sound is characterised by the prominence of the noisy guitars, pounding drum rhythms, wayward samples and loops and Elvidge's hoarse, shouted singing, which he felt recalls \\"the group's Leeds forebears the Mekons and Gang of Four,\\" while Mark Emsley of The Quietus described the album as \\"35 minutes of samples, noise, guitars, northern grit and sarcasm.\\" The record blends influences of earlier experiments with Motown sound-inspired beats, cut-and-paste sampling techniques, post-punk groups like The Fall, The Pop Group and The Fire Engines and fusions of hip hop and pop music. Elvidge's lyrics on the album are harsh in their critique of the Margaret Thatcher‚ÄìRonald Reagan era and American militarism. Each song features lyrical exclamations and shouted slogans that have been compared to terrace chants; The Quietus felt the shouted slogans are \\"a style that seems political in itself\\" which help highlight the otherwise highly germane songs. \\"Don't Get Mad...Get Even!\\" reflects the influence of house music, featuring both beats and bass-lines in a New York house style. Gray's brother Trevor played keyboards on the song, taking influence from the house music played at nightclubs that Watson performed at. \\"Ready or Not Here We Come\\" features satirical lyrics concerning American military adventurism, while \\"Hold On\\" was pitched to several television networks as potential theme music for coverage of the 1987 general election. \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise?\\", a heavy, layered song containing raspy noise and hip hop loops, addresses what the group considered to be widely-held misconceptions about the band and their sound. It was described by Angus Batey of The Quietus as the song which likely best exemplifies \\"the mixture of inspiration, madness, intuition, confidence, technical achievement and musical daring that made the band so remarkable at the time.\\" Emsley said of the song: \\"The sonic template was laid down. Discordant noise, drum machines clattering away, DJ scratches being provided by new addition to the ranks, Powercut (aka well established hip hop and later house DJ, Noel Watson), mob-friendly chants ‚Äî all matched by Steven E ranting, 'Free your mind and your ass will follow'.\\" \\"Take It!\\" defends musicians who base material on samples, while also serving as a critique on consumerism, with a repeating sonic motif. The delicate sample hooks include a decaying power chord sampled from \\"Tommy Gun\\" by The Clash, lyrics from David Bowie's \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\" and a synthesiser sample taken from \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\" by Van Halen. The spoken-word \\"take it\\" sample, often mistaken to be the voice of Ronald Reagan, was in fact a voice taken from Cashing Objections, a spoken word album containing a lecture on sales techniques that belonged to Elvidge's dad. \\"Learn to Pray\\" closes the album, wrapping up the album's politics, vitriol and sonic experimentation \\"in a churchified piece of electro-rock-gospel,\\" with Elvidge's lyrics opining that placing faith in higher powers will not satisfy people that do not stay true to themselves. Packaging The inner sleeve, designed by Designer's Republic, includes a manipulation of the Bayeux Tapestry. The album packaging was one of the first major projects designed by the Sheffield-based Designer's Republic, who had designed all the band's sleeves since \\"Kiss\\" and would go on to become an influential agency. Age of Chance asked Designer's Republic to assemble the packaging as they saw fit, and handed the design agency a copy of the go-go compilation album Go-Go Crankin' (1986) as an example of how they would like to have seen the final product. The final sleeve drew upon the band's disparate influences including Trouble Funk album sleeves and Russian constructivism. The cardboard inner sleeve of the LP features numerous mass- media related images, including a manipulation of the Bayeux Tapestry and the large rendered text \\"Listen / Crush / The Mighty Roar of Consumption, Construction & Corruption / This is the Sound.\\" The back cover features a blue background adorned with three red stars, two columns of red bombs and orange text. Like the album itself, the packaging turned out to be influential on several late 1980s bands including Pop Will Eat Itself. The Designers Republic's initial \\"first thought\\" sketch of the cover, drawn onto A4 paper, and the completed cardboard inner sleeve, are housed in the Victoria & Albert Museum collection. Singles and promotion The 12\\" remixes of \\"Two Tribes\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood (pictured) inspired Age of Chance to release remix singles from the album. In May 1987, \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise?\\" was released as the album's first single by Virgin, who greeted the song with a positive reception. Taylor recalled: \\"At that point, Virgin were simply letting us get on with things, as you might expect with any new band on the label.\\" NME later named it the 56th best single of 1987 in their year-end poll. \\"Don't Get Mad...Get Even!\\" and \\"Take It!\\" were released as further singles in September 1987 and January 1988 respectively, although none of the three singles charted on the UK Singles Chart. The first two singles were also issued as two separate twelve-inch singles with different packaging and different remixes on the A-side. These releases were inspired by Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 1984 hit \\"Two Tribes\\", which had also been released as a series of twelve-inch singles containing different remixes. The \\"Dancepower\\" and \\"Let There Be... Sonic War Sculpture!\\" remixes of \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise?\\" incorporate momentary samples of Parliament's \\"Flash Light\\" atop a time-stretched Led Zeppelin drum break. Public Enemy also contributed a remix of \\"Take It!\\", applying a skittering, muted hip hop production. Taylor later spoke of his love for the \\"Sonic War Sculpture!\\" mix, saying \\"there are some great little moments in there, Led Zeppelin fighting it out with Gary Glitter and Barry White‚Ä¶totally uncompromising. hard on the ears, but in the good sense!\\" He noted the engineer of the remix developed an ear problem and had to visit a Harley Street medical surgery. Age of Chance toured throughout the United Kingdom in 1987. The tour officially ended at the Town and Country, London on 6 December 1987, with the exception of a later-scheduled charity event. The tour included a homecoming gig on 24 November 1987 at Leeds Polytechnic. As Elvidge left the band after the tour, the concerts marked the singer's final performances with the band. Release and reception One Thousand Years of Trouble was released by Virgin Records in 1987. Although the album sold respectably relative to the band's career, it did not enter the UK Albums Chart, where it was eclipsed by strong sellers and largely failed to expand Age of Chance's audience and attract further attention towards the group. Batey felt that the album likely sold enough for a placing on the Indie Charts, where the band had built their following but were now ineligible due to their contract with Virgin, and as such the album fell below the radar. Nonetheless, the album was released to critical acclaim. Writing in his \\"Consumer's Guide\\" column in The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album a grade of B+, writing that, \\"[a]t their strongest these Leeds lads have the postsituationist aggro down,\\" noting how \\"[s]logans like 'Take It!' and 'Don't Get Mad‚Ä¶Get Even!' are presented literally, yelled over loud funk beats that combined with their wall of noise makes them white rap the way Led Zep were white blues. Advocating insurrection ain't planning revolution, but it ain't surrender either.\\" Scott Schnider of Trouser Press was more reserved, saying \\"One Thousand Years of Trouble benefits from being more gimmicky and over-the-top, with lots more sampling; even so, an album's worth of this stuff is pretty grating.\\" Barry Young of Aberdeen Press and Journal felt the \\"dull\\" album was a fusion of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's \\"more doom-laden period\\" fused with \\"a scratch version of Dead or Alive.\\" Among retrospective reviews, Stewart Mason of AllMusic named the record an \\"Album Pick\\" and wrote: \\"Abrasive, noisy, yet vibrant and intriguing, One Thousand Years of Trouble deserved more attention than it got.\\" Reflecting on the album's thirtieth anniversary, Angus Batey of The Quietus wrote that the record could likely only have been produced at its \\"precise moment in time\\" when house and hip hop were played together in club DJ sets, before the rise of the hip house fusion genre and the separation of audiences between the two genres. He wrote that the album still sounds \\"so durably excellent three decades later.\\" Writing for The Guardian, he also called the album \\"a triumph.\\" In 2005, The Word included the album in the second part of their \\"Hidden Treasure: Great Underrated Albums of Our Time\\" list, having been chosen for inclusion by broadcaster Andrew Collins. Legacy Despite being commercially unsuccessful upon release, One Thousand Years of Trouble has been cited as a groundbreaking and influential album, anticipating the musical direction of several bands later on in the 1980s. Batey wrote that, \\"with the exception of Big Audio Dynamite, no-one else was doing anything in quite the same area in 1987,\\" writing that Age of Chance \\"set a template others followed.\\" Pop Will Eat Itself began using samples in their music, Carter USM became fans of the band and EMF and Jesus Jones had worldwide hits which fused guitar pop and sampling that \\"owed a significant debt to One Thousand Years and the other records it influenced,\\" according to Batey. Pop Will Eat Itself, who Mason felt \\"photocopied\\" the sound of the album, even hired Designer's Republic to design their sleeves, with the album cover of This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This! (1989) directly influenced by the One Thousand Years sleeve. Mason reflected: Bands including Pop Will Eat Itself (pictured) took influence from One Thousand Years of Troube. Taylor conceded that Age of Chance's sound was not readily accessible at the time, saying that Pop Will Eat Itself, and in particular EMF and Jesus Jones, \\"knew how to write a catchy, accessible 3 minute pop-song, in a way that we didn't. Plus, by the time those bands were in a position to get out there with those songs, the music-biz and the general public were more ready for it. The very idea of sampling for instance, of having someone else‚Äôs vocal/guitar/chorus whatever, in your own recording, was, by the turn of the 90‚Äôs or so, pretty well established.\\" Furthering the album's influence, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis lifted the sample loop used in \\"This is Crush Collision\\" ‚Äì itself constructed from a sample from \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" by Sly & the Family Stone ‚Äì and used it in the production of Janet Jackson's 1989 hit \\"Rhythm Nation\\" instead of sampling the original Sly & the Family Stone track. Batey also writes that the album's engineers would \\"draw on the lessons learned in later life,\\" noting how Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent would later work on \\"rock-rap-sample-pop collision/collage projects\\" including U2's Pop (1997) and Bjork's Vespertine (2001), while Steve Osborne would go on to co-produce Happy Mondays' \\"dance-rock breakthrough\\" album, Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches (1990). One Thousand Years of Trouble is also regarded as one of the first rock albums to feature a DJ. In 1988, Channel 4 began using \\"Don't Get Mad...Get Even!\\" in their coverage of American football.

By Force of Arms by Billy Bennett has a similar premise. Jackson also appears in Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory: Volume 1: How Few Remain as the leader of the main army of an independent Confederacy when the United States declares war against it in 1881. Jackson is the protagonist of Stonewall Goes West by R.E. Thomas, where Jackson survives his wounding at Chancellorsville to replace Braxton Bragg at the head of the Army of Tennessee. *Caspar Vega's 2016 novel Hayfoot is about a Neo-Confederate movie star who attempts to go back in time to save Stonewall so he could be present at Gettysburg.

Written by David Lagercrantz, this is the second novel in the series not authored by the series' creator and author of the first three Millennium books, Stieg Larsson, who died of a heart attack in 2004. The novel was released worldwide on 7 September 2017.  Plot  Lisbeth Salander is serving a two month jail sentence for the crimes she committed while protecting August Balder. After threats arise against her, she is transferred to maximum security Flodberga Prison, which she finds rife with corruption. She also discovers that Bangladeshi prisoner Faria Kasi is tormented nightly by ruthless prisoner Beatrice \\"Benito\\" Andersson. One day, Salander is visited by former guardian Holger Palmgren. During their conversation, Palmgren tells her about a visit he received from a former secretary from St Stefan's, where she was committed as a child, who gave him Salander's medical files which has led him to believe she was involved in something called the Registry. Suspicious, Salander forces the Warden to let her use his computer, where she learns the Registry is a secret project that places exceptional children in specific environments to test the effects on their growth. Unable to do anything from prison, Salander asks journalist Mikael Blomkvist to investigate in her stead, pointing him to wealthy businessman Leo Mannheimer, whose name was in the Registry file she found. During his investigation, Blomkvist learns that Mannheimer had been acting strangely lately and comes to suspect that not only does he have a twin, Dan Brody, but Brody has been going around pretending to be Mannheimer. Meanwhile Palmgren, while going through Salander's file, recognizes the name Martin Steinberg and calls him. Steinberg panics and contacts his associate Rakel Greitz who, despite dying from stomach cancer, enters Palmgren's house pretending to be a nurse, poisons him and takes the file. Blomkvist arrives too late to save him, but Palmgren tells him to find Hilda von Kanterborg, a former Registry agent whose initials were in the file, before he dies. Blomkvist tracks Hilda down and, though she doesn't believe Dan stole Leo's identity, she confirms that they are twins. She also tells him that Greitz tried to take Salander away from her family as a child as part of the experiment, only for her to react violently and escape. What they don't know is she then hid in a church and saw a statue of a dragon being slain, which inspired her to fight against the unjust and later don her dragon tattoo. Blomkvist then confronts Mannheimer who, after saving him from Greitz' henchman Benjamin, reveals that he is Dan. Having grown up on a farm with an abusive adopted father, Dan found a passion for music and eventually fled to America, where he lived as a jazz musician. After being mistaken for Leo by a co-worker, he saw that they looked alike and came to Sweden to find him. After spending time together, they angrily confronted Greitz together for answers. Unfortunately, she and Benjamin caught them off guard and poisoned Leo, blackmailing Dan into burying him and taking his identity. However, Dan secretly managed to save his brother's life and help him escape. They ended taking each other's identity, with Leo living in America, while plotting revenge. While this is happening, the Warden of Flodberga makes plans to transfer Benito to another prison. Upon learning this, Benito prepares to kill Faria, which she reveals she was hired to do by Faria's brothers. However, Salander stops and severely injures her, sending her to the hospital. After she is released, Salander, with the help of Blomkvist's sister Annika, looks into Faria's history: she had been treated as a slave and object by her highly religious older brothers Bashir and Ahmed, who planned on selling her into marriage with a rich man. That fell apart when she fell in love with Jamal Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi national who was branded a heretic by Islamist extremists. Salander soon discovers that, on the two older brothers' orders, younger brother Khalil murdered Jamal, leading to Faria pushing Ahmed to his death in anger, resulting in her arrest and Bashir hiring Benito. Salander tricks Bashir into confessing on video, and convinces Khalil to do the same to the police after Bashir flees. She then plans to go after Greitz when Blomkvist tells her what he's found, only to be kidnapped by Bashir and an escaped Benito. She gets an alert out to her hacker allies, who manage to track the truck they're in and alert the police. With Faria's help, the police find them just as Salander escapes and arrest Benito, Bashir, and their colleagues. After recovering from a wound sustained in her escape, Salander confronts and subdues Greitz and Benjamin, deciding to spare the former so she can suffer the shame of her reputation being ruined as she's arrested. Faria's charges are lowered and she's presumably released. The people, Steinberg included, involved are sent to prison and, though preempted by a stock market crash, Millennium publishes Leo and Dan's story. Everyone who knew Palmgren gather for his funeral, where Salander makes a passionate, if backhanded, speech about her guardian.  Reception  A review by The Washington Post says The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye \\"intensifies the mythic elements of Larsson's vision\\" and is entertaining. However, The Guardian says that \\"There is a sluggishness to the plotting and much of the tension relies on orchestrated interruptions and delays, which irritate\\". The review in USA Today calls Salander a fascinating character, and warns potential readers the reviewer thought she was not present for too much of the novel. Paste magazine's review also noted the relative absence of Salander, asserting that Lagercrantz seemed to prefer focusing on new characters that he invented.

Life Born in Middelburg to Wilhem van Citters and Maria Kien, his uncle Caspar and nephew Willem Aarnoud were both also grand pensionaries of Zeeland. Wilhem II began his career in 1750 as pensionary of Middelburg, a role in which he also acted from 1752 to 1755 as one of the Republic's three plenipotentiary commissioners to the Barrier Treaty talks in Brussels. In 1757 he was appointed secretary of Zeeland and from 1753 to 1792 he was a 'principal participant' (i.e. commissioner) of the Dutch East India Company. In 1764 Wilhem II became representative for the first nobility of Zeeland after the death of Johan (van Borssele) van der Hooghe - the role was similar to that of deputy of the Ridderschap or knighthood in Holland. Because of the rights of the towns of Veere and Vlissingen regarding the marquisate, the role had a significant influence on nominations for the State of Zeeland. Via the influence of William V, Wilhem II gave up the post of grand pensionary in 1766 and the followed year the duke of Brunswick confirmed him as representative for the first nobility. From then until 1786 he frequently counteracted the stadtholder and the duke of Brunswick wherever possible. On the eve of the 4th Anglo-Dutch War Wilhem II offered the British delegate Yorke to pull Zeeland out of the Dutch Republic if Britain would then protect Zeeland's neutrality ‚Äì Yorke rejected the offer. The town reconciled with William V after the duke of Brunswick's departure in 1783. Against protests from his former protege Laurens van der Spiegel, Wilhem II was made secretary as deputy to Thomas de Larrey. In 1790 he was appointed ontvanger-generaal or receiver-general of the Union. He died in the Hague in 1802.

By way of example she and her husband adopted an infant, Mary Louise, in 1909 when the infant was three months old, because it was Wynekoop's \\"duty toward the race to do so.\\" At the 1910 Mothers' Congress, Wynekoop asserted that \\"'He who adopts a child does more good than Rockefeller, Carnegie, or even Florence Nightingale.'\\" Her adoption of Mary Louise, she said, showed how a busy person‚Äî in her case, a doctor, professor, homemaker, and mother‚Äî could make room in her life for an additional child whose \\"hereditary faults\\" were unknown but could become \\"a fine woman\\" when entrusted to a \\"wholesome environment and general moral training.\\" Adoption meets a heart-felt need, she concluded, to take in a needy world.Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Thu, May 5, 1910 ¬∑ Page 9 At a West End Mothers' council meeting a year later in 1911, Wynekoop stated that adoption \\"is a broadly humane act toward the little waif of a child.\\" She added that more than one child in a family is essential because \\"the first child is so largely a matter of experiment\\" and the lessons learned could be applied to the younger siblings who came along. Additionally, she believed that multiple children assured that the one child wouldn't be pampered and that parents would not be left desolate if something would happen to the first.Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Sun, Jul 2, 1911 ¬∑ Page 3 Wynekoop's advocacy for adoption became more controversial when she asserted at the 1912 Congress that \\"Every single man or woman who earns $20 a week or more should adopt a baby.\\" Responses in a subsequent telephone poll of bachelors included everything from \\"'don't-call-me-up-again-about-that-silly-rot'\\" to concern for who would care for the baby while the bachelor was at work.Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Sat, Mar 23, 1912 ¬∑ Page 6 Within a few months, however, her argument had inspired three bachelors to adopt.Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Fri, May 10, 1912 ¬∑ Page 1 Overall her conviction was something of a bombshell, however, because twenty years later several papers were still talking about it.

In 1912, she joined a team consisting of the superintendent of Chicago schools and other physicians to lecture on matters that would impact the hygiene of \\"the modern girl\\" and \\"the prevalence of certain diseases and the dangers they represent to the unborn children and innocent women.\\" Wynekoop planned to initiate a more intimate conversation on a hygiene with the women participants, but promised not to be too technical or to illustrate them.The Inter Ocean (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Wed, Jun 5, 1912 ¬∑ Page 3 Her audience on the first occasion, which consisted of \\"fashionable mothers\\" dressed in \\"stylish gowns,\\" found the lecture so difficult, however, that they \\"placed their fingers to their ears.\\" Subsequently, it was announced that future lectures for women would use \\"veiled expressions,\\" but men would hear \\"straight-from-the-shoulder talks.\\"The Inter Ocean (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Sat, Jun 8, 1912 ¬∑ Page 3  Suffrage and equality  Wynekoop gravitated toward causes that invited men and women to share equal responsibility for the health of family and society. At the 1912 Mothers' Congress, for example, Wynekoop was inspired by a speaker's vision of the inclusion of a woman on the presidential cabinet who could advocate for the welfare of children. She was so moved by the idea, in fact, that she volunteered to take a resolution to that effect to \\"the national government and to the presidential candidates with requests for interviews as to how they feel.\\"Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Wed, Mar 20, 1912 ¬∑ Page 9 In a hygiene lecture in Bloomington, IL, Wynekoop lauded the increase in public interest in child welfare and stressed the critical role parents play in rearing children who were healthy. She maintained that the \\"relationship, spiritually and mentally, of the father and mother\\" impact the child's welfare. She conceded that while women have a more demanding role in child-rearing, \\"the responsibilities of the father are truly great.\\" She recommended that both boys and girls learn \\"the importance and necessity of home-making in all its finest and dearest sense.\\"The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Fri, May 5, 1916 ¬∑ Page 8 In an address to Presbyterian women in 1918 Wynekoop, representing the Women's Section of the Board of Social Hygiene of the Army Training Camps of America, reported on educational programs, restrictions, and consequences for soldiers that aimed to do away with \\"the double standard of judging moral relations of men and women.\\" Some soldiers would need support upon returning home.

Early life  Weimar was born in Wertheim and studied there at the local Gymnasium until 1872. He went on to train as an engraver in Pforzheim, combining his studies with another four-year training course in draft-drawing and model-making at the Kunstgewerbeschule (vocational school for students working in art and design as an industry) also in Pforzheim. After this, until August 1879 he lived in Karlsruhe training at the . Following this he worked as a building surveyor for the building of the House of F√ºrstenberg in Donaueschingen. From 1881 till Summer 1882, he studied in the atelier of Karl Hammer in Karlsruhe. From June 1882 onwards, Weimar drew for the Bichweiler'sche Kunstgewerbliche Anstalt in Hamburg.  Museum career  In 1883, Justus Brinckmann, the founding director of the Hamburg Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe (Hamburg Museum of Art and Design), employed him as an assistant draftsman at the museum.Justus Brinckmann: . In: . Nr. 1. Th. G. Meissner, Hamburg 1884, S. XII (biodiversitylibrary.org [viewed 16. March 2017]). By 1888, he was the holder of a newly-created position, designed just for him, as \\"wissenschaftlicher Assistent II. Klasse\\" (scientific assistant, second class). He was Brinckmann's first and, until 1894, only colleague at the museum. Weimer cataloged the museum's existing decorative arts collection. Along with this he also created art industry equipment, calligraphic diplomas, documentation and literature. The type foundry Genzsch & Heyse published Weimar's fonts Alte Schwabacher, Leibniz-Fraktur and die Hamburger Druckschrift after Weimar's death. They first appeared in the newspaper, Die Heimat. Weimar died in Hamburg on 25 June 1917.  Photography  After he began his job in 1883, Weimar painted hundreds of the museum exhibits. These painting were used in the first \\"F√ºhrer durch das Museum durch das Hamburgische Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe (Guide through the Hamburg Museum of Art and Design)\\". After 1890, he began to use halftone reproduction methods which enabled him to produce half-tone pictures of exhibits for use in books and newspapers. At short time later, he began to produce diapositive slides for guides to the museum collection. He worked hard to become an excellent photographer. Around the turn of the century, he produced a photographic herbarium for the museum, which was published in 1901. Between 1897 and 1917, this wealth of botanical information, with its excellent sense of composition and beauty was an important resource for leaves, plants and flowers. In spring 1915, the museum gave this photographic collection its own exhibition. Photo of a Tuberose from the photographic Herbarium of the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg After it was invented in 1904, Weimar began to use the autochrome method to produce colour photographs of the museum collection. He busied himself in understanding the theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations of these new technologies. Because of his technical and artistic skills, he was often asked for advice on similar projects at other museums, including the Museum of Hamburg. Weimar was one of the first to document the beginnings of photography as an art-form and the history of photographic ateliers and their masters, particularly in Hamburg. Weimar also constructed a collection of incunabula that were either forgotten or in danger of being forgotten. In 1915, he collected his detailed research about photography in Hamburg in the book \\"Die Daguerreotypie in Hamburg 1839‚Äì1860 (The Daguerrotype in Hamburg 1839-1860)\\". The book is still held up today as both a pioneering work and as an authoritative work in the field. Together with Brinckmann, Weimar developed a special form of inventorying Hamburg's memorials and monuments. The novelty of their method was that, instead of the central feature of the description of the object being a written description, a photography was used instead. Brinckmann also tasked Weimar with not just capturing the statues in the inner city of Hamburg but also those in surrounding region, where they were in far greater danger of being forgotten and lost. At that time, the wider region of Hamburg still had a lot of older reed-thatched houses, which contained objects that it was vital to catalogue but often fell victim to fires. Houses of this type are often called Low German Houses in English works. Weimar produced many photo-series of the houses and churches of the Vierlande and Marschlande, part of the Bergedorf region of Hamburg, which he catalogued accurately and in great detail. With the same skill and care, he also documented the 1906 building of the Bismarck monument. In 1900, he had thoroughly documented the structures of St. Michael's Church, which burnt down in 1906. Weimar's studies and photographs were the basis for the rebuilding work on the church. Bismarck Monument, with the engineers who designed it, Studer und Klemann, 1906 Up until 1912, Weimar continued to develop the art and science of his photography, taking 1200 photographic plates which he labeled with the place and date the photograph was taken, along with information on the time of day, the light conditions and what lens stop he used. Alongside the image he himself produced, Weimar systematically collected daguerrotypes. Because of Weimar's work, the Hamburg Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe could say that it hosted a world-leading collection of photographs. The largest part of the collection is now housed in the , which is housed in Bergedorf Castle, the only castle in Hamburg. The majority of the photographic collection is stored in what was formally the magazine of the castle. Weimar was a member of the . His work features in the Europeana Photography Collection. Hamburg Museum has also featured his work, particularly on the historical buildings of Hamburg.  Works  * Die Daguerreotypie in Hamburg 1839‚Äì1860 (1.

This theory was proposed by Dr. Stevan E. Hobfoll in 1989 as a way to expand on the literature of stress as a construct. Hobfoll posited that psychological stress occurred in three a instances; when there was a threat of a loss of resources, an actual net loss of resources, and a lack of gained resources following the spending of resources. From this perspective, resources are defined as things that one values, specifically objects, states, and conditions. COR states that loss of these types of resources will drive individuals into certain levels of stress.  History of stress theory  COR was developed from various theories on the cause of stress. COR development branches back to Walter Bradford Cannon (1932) who was one of the first researchers to study the concept of stress as it applies to humans, specifically in how stress can be withstood. Hans Selye (1950) took on Cannon‚Äôs research on stress as a response and indicated that stress itself was designed as a way to protect the body from environmental challenges. Other researchers such as Elliot and Eisdorfer (1982) defined stress as specifically being the stimulus and not the response, which had been accepted by some of the scientific community. However, this theory is largely based on the homeostatic model of stress developed by Joseph McGrath (1970). It is in this theory that stress is defined as an imbalance between the environmental demand and the response capability of an organism.  Basic principles of COR  COR covers two basic principles involving the protection of resources from being lost. The first principle is called the Primacy of Resource Loss. This principles states that it is more harmful for individuals to lose resources compared to when there is a gain of resources. What this means, is that a loss of pay will be more harmful than the same gain in pay would have been helpful. The second principle is known as Resource Investment. This principle of COR states that people will tend to invest resources in order to protect against resource loss, to recover from losses, and to gain resources. Within the context of coping, people will invest resources to prevent future resource losses. From these two principles, COR has suggested a number of corollaries that can be applied to resource changes. They are as follows: # Individuals with higher resources will be set up for gains in resources. Similarly, individuals with fewer resources are more likely to experience resource losses. # Initial resource loss will lead to resource loss in the future. # Initial resource gains will lead to resource gains in the future. # A lack of resources will invariable lead to defensive attempts to conserve the remaining resources.  Areas of research  COR has been utilized when studying work/family stress, burnout, and general stress. In work/family stress, COR research has looked at how the distribution of one‚Äôs resources have affected their home life, with some articles finding that putting too much of one‚Äôs resources into one‚Äôs work may lead to family problems at home. Research into COR and burnout has examined how the use of resources has impacted one‚Äôs mood, with recent research finding that emotional exhaustion had the strongest relationship with depressive symptoms. In regards to general stress, research has explored how the loss of resources impacts the levels of one‚Äôs stress. COR has primarily been studied within the burnout and job fields, as the following meta-analyses will demonstrate. There is currently no meta-analyses on COR within other areas of stress research. Multiple meta-analyses have been conducted with COR, specifically related to burnout. One meta-analyses by Lee and Ashforth (1996) examined the relationship between demand and resource correlates, behavioral and attitudinal correlate, and 3 different dimensions of job burnout. It used COR as the basis for this research and found that the primacy of resource loss principle is supported. It found that, over 58 sources, individuals tend to be sensitive to increased demands rather than resources received. Job control and COR have been studied through a meta- analyses conducted by Park, Baiden, Jacob, & Wagner (2009). This study tested COR using all constructs involved in job control and burnout which included constructs of autonomy, authority, skill discretion, and decision latitude. Results indicate that the construct of job control, or the ability that one has to choose their actions from multiple options at their job, is related to depersonalization and personal accomplishment. This study stated that COR is related to burnout in this way, but further studies should be conducted that use non-human service occupations.

Lee on Traveller (also known as General Robert E. Lee and Confederate Soldier, and Robert E. Lee and Young Soldier) is a bronze sculpture by Alexander Phimister Proctor depicting the Confederate general of the same name, his horse Traveller, and a young Confederate States Army officer, formerly installed at Dallas' Lee Park, in the U.S. state of Texas. The statue was unveiled by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, removed in 2017, and sold by the city for $1,435,000 to a law firm. It now stands on a Texan golf course. Description The double equestrian statue depicts Robert E. Lee riding his horse Traveller, and a young Confederate States Army soldier astride a horse. The bronze sculpture measures approximately 9 √ó 12 √ó 5 ft (3 √ó 4 √ó 1.5 m) and rests on a Texas pink granite base that measures approximately 6 ft. √ó 12 ft. 6 in. √ó 6 ft (2 √ó 4 √ó 2 m) and weighs 7 tons. An inscription on the front of the base reads, \\"Robert E. Lee\\". Inscriptions on the base's sides read \\"A.P. PROCTOR ‚Äì 1936\\", \\"A. Phimister Proctor, Sculptor/Mark Lemmon, Architect\\", and \\"Roman Bronze Works N.Y.\\" One bronze plaque on the back of the base reads: Another reads, \\"This bronze statue of General Robert E. Lee was presented to the City of Dallas on June 12, 1936, by the Dallas Southern Memorial Association / Lee Memorial Company / Elizabeth Rembert Rogers, Chairman.\\" A third reads, \\"The soldier accompanying General Lee represents the entire youth of the South to whom General Lee became a great inspiration. He was not intended by the sculptor to be an aide-de-camp.\\" History Creation Alexander Phimister Proctor, 1919 The statue Robert E. Lee on Traveller was made by Alexander Phimister Proctor. When Proctor was hired by the Southern Women's Memorial Association to design an equestrian statue of Lee, he initially planned for the statue to depict Lee and a young Confederate States Army soldier heading into a storm with their heads down and the heads of their mounts lowered. Members of the Association were offended that the statue would depict a defeated South, so Proctor redesigned the statue to depict Lee as confidently marching forward. This new design was quickly and enthusiastically approved by members of the association and by Lee's grandson. The statue cost $50,000. Proctor eventually would come to believe that Lee \\"was never personally defeated,\\" an idea popular in the Southern United States. Proctor modeled his likenesses of Lee on old photographs while basing his likeness of Lee's horse, Traveller, on a horse owned by a friend, the general's writings, and photographs of Traveller. It took Proctor two years to complete a working model of the statue and another two years to complete the finished statue. The statue was originally planned to be put in Dealey Plaza, though it was erected in Oak Lawn Park. Unveiling The statue was unveiled on June 12, 1936, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to honor Confederate veterans. On that day, President Roosevelt gave a speech praising the general, saying: > I am very happy to take part in this unveiling of the statue of General > Robert E. Lee. All over the United States we recognize him as a great leader > of men, as a great general. But, also, all over the United States I believe > that we recognize him as something much more important than that. We > recognize Robert E. Lee as one of our greatest American Christians and one > of our greatest American gentlemen. Robert E. Lee IV handed President Roosevelt a ribbon to pull, unveiling the statue. When the president saw the statue, Proctor heard him call it \\"magnificent!\\". Then W. H. Wells, one of the remaining soldiers who fought in Lee's army, was escorted to see the president through the crowd of people attending the unveiling ceremony. American flags, Confederate flags, and Lone Star flags were flown during the ceremony. The unveiling of Robert E. Lee on Traveller caused no controversy. Yoni Appelbaum of The Atlantic contextualized Roosevelt's comments as part of a trend of American presidents praising Lee. He noted that Woodrow Wilson, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Donald Trump all complimented General Lee. Subsequent history The statue in 2014 The same year the statue was unveiled, Oak Lawn Park was renamed Robert E. Lee Park. The Dallas Morning News conducted an informal poll in 1987 to find the public's favorite statue in Dallas; Proctor's statue of General Lee came second after Robert Glen's Mustangs at Las Colinas. In 1991, the Dallas Southern Memorial Association spent $50,000 to restore the monument, which subsequently received a historical marker from the Texas Historical Commission. The statue was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program in 1992. In July 2015, the statue was vandalized when someone painted the word \\"shame\\" across its base. The vandalism occurred concurrently with protests against Confederate monuments and memorials across the United States. The statue was removed in 2017 following the Unite the Right rally where white nationalists protested the planned removal of another statue of Lee; the rally resulted in the death of a woman at the hands of a suspected white nationalist. Dallas' city council voted to remove the statue, and the city's mayor viewed the statue as a symbol of injustice. In 2019, the statue was put up for auction by the city of Dallas; money gained from the sale of the statue was to be used to fund the removal of Dallas' Confederate War Memorial. The starting bid for the auction was $450,000. The auction was won by Holmes Firm PC, a Dallas law firm which bid $1,435,000 on the statue. It was initially unclear if Holmes Firm PC purchased Robert E. Lee on Traveller for itself or on behalf of a client. According to the terms of sale, the statue cannot be displayed within Dallas city limits or be sold or given to someone who will display it within Dallas city limits. In September of the same year, the statue was installed at a golf course owned by Kelcy Warren in Terlingua, Texas, near the Mexican border crossing.

Life He was born in Vollenhove in 1759 into a rich noble family from Overijssel ‚Äì his father was Jan Arent Godert de Vos van Steenwijk, a representative in the Estates General of the United Provinces and landdrost of Vollenhove and Kuinre. Carel and his brothers Godert Willem and Jan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk all played a major part in the Batavian Revolution, whilst Carel's son Jan Arend Godert also became a politician. An ardent Patriot, he began as secretary to Pieter Johan van Berckel, the Dutch Republic's first ambassador to the United States of America, from 26 June 1783 to 8 July 1784. From 1785 to 1787 he was intendant for the lands of Drenthe and member of the region's diet. He was also colonel of the exercitiegenootschap of the village of De Wijk, but after the Batavian Revolution was initially defeated he was dismissed from all his roles. The Revolution broke out again early in 1795 when Patriots rose up (with French military support led by Pichegru) in all of the United Provinces. William V, Prince of Orange opted for exile on 19 January, leaving the field open for the Batavian Republic to be set up. Carel de Vos van Steenwijk formed a revolutionary committee in Drenthe on 7 February and twelve days later this became Drenthe's provisional assembly, of which he was elected president. A federalist, he played a major role in gaining a provincial statute for Drenthe, previously only one of the Generality Lands. On 27 January 1796 he was elected deputy for Meppel in the first national Batavian assembly and appointed to the committee charged with writing a new constitution. He was president of the assembly from 6 to 20 February 1797 and re-elected as a deputy in August 1797. A unitarist coup d'√âtat on 22 January 1798 ejected the Federalists from the assembly ‚Äì De Vos van Steenwijk was imprisoned at Huis ten Bosch until 10 July, after another coup toppled the unitarists on 12 June. He held no further posts until 4 June 1802, when he was briefly made a member of the general council for the department of Overijssel, before being made the Republic's ambassador to France on 14 September. When he returned from Paris in 1804 he was made Drenthe's representative on the legislative corps of the Republic. From 4 to 18 June 1806 De Vos acted as the Republic's grand pensionary, before Louis Bonaparte became king of Holland. On 16 February 1807 he was made a commander of the Order of the Union and in 1810 a baron of the Empire. After France annexed the new kingdom in 1811, De Vos was made deputy for Bouches-de-l'Yssel on the legislative corps of the French Empire. He was also a member of the 'syndicat' for Holland, charged with paying off the former kingdom's debts, and on 29 February 1812 he was made a commander of the Order of the Reunion. After Napoleon's abdication in 1814, De Vos van Steenwijk entered the Estates General of Overijssel then the first chamber of the Estates General of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands from 1816 until his death in Zwolle in 1830. On 28 August 1814 he was made a jonkheer and on 11 March 1821 a baron (he was also lord of Dikninge and Hogerhof).

She was the second woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and taught at Siena Heights University.Obituary in the Toledo Blade She is noted for her work on spectroscopy, and played a role in the history of understanding DNA.  Early life  Stimson grew up in a Catholic family of English and Irish descent, where she was the third child of Mary Holland and Frank Stimson. Throughout childhood, Stimson's family encountered several illnesses. Her older brother had polio, and her younger sister contracted a bacterial infection that affected her heart. Complications from the birth of twins left her mother with high blood pressure that affected her memory. Stimson helped raise her younger siblings, and taught her younger sister how to read. This experience shaped her personality as an educator.  Education and career  Stimson's family was Catholic. Her parents encouraged her siblings and her to learn about their religion; Stimson took an interest in science early on. Frank and Mary Stimson supported their children in their desire for education. When Stimson reached the age of fourteen, her parents sent her to St. Joseph College and Academy, a Catholic academy in Adrian, Michigan, run by the Adrian Dominican Sisters. She worked on \\"wound-healing hormones\\" and helped to create a new hemorrhoid cream (preparation H)\\" before studying DNA bases and structure. After graduating, she worked at St. Joseph College. She joined the Adrian Dominican Sisters and completed her education at Siena Heights College. Later she taught at Siena Heights College in Adrian and attended graduate school at the Institutum Divi Thomae. Stimson taught chemistry at Siena Heights University and served as an academic advisor.  Structure of DNA  There is a book for Dr. Jun Tsuji under the title The soul of DNA is the story of Sister Miriam Stimson and her knowledge about DNA and double helix, and she illustrated the structure of DNA in an easy-to-understand way. She also explained the relationship between cells and chemical instructions. Sister Miriam's developed the 'KBr (potassium bromide) disk technique in which she mixed samples with KBr and compressed it into a little disk. Potassium bromide was a reasonable substance that would not interfere with the infrared light, and furthermore, it is ready to meld effectively with the example. Sister Miriam's technique was demonstrated to be superior to the previously-used oil method in a number of ways; \\"there was an absence of interfering bands, lower scattering losses, higher resolution of spectra, better control of concentration and homogeneity of sample, ease in examining small samples, and possibility of storing of specimens for further studies\\".qtd. in Tsuji 120 This sort of method would have the capacity to accomplish a more exact spectrum of the compounds inside a substance and their position, which would alter infrared spectroscopy for quite a while, and furthermore affirm the Watson - Crick Model of the double helix for DNA. Because of her discoveries, Sister Miriam added to one of the best discoveries in her century, and in this way facilitated examinations including DNA structure and cancer, giving different researchers a more precise view on how DNA framed and worked.

Location The headquarters of JCRC are located on Lubowa Hill, at Plot 101 Entebbe Road, approximately , by road, southeast of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The geographical coordinates of the institution's headquarters are:0¬∞13'51.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'00.0\\"E (Latitude:0.230833; Longitude:32.566667). Overview Founded in 1990, JCRC is a collaborative effort by three Ugandan ministries to address the challenges posed by HIV/AIDS and related infections: (a) the Ministry of Health, (b) the Ministry of Education and (c) the Ministry of Defence. The institution works in close collaboration with Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MUCHS). Research JCRC focuses on HIV/AIDS research in all age groups, clinical trials of ARVs, nutritional and social interventions and the concomitant treatment of tuberculosis. The institution also carries out malaria research. The majority of the institution's research projects are in collaboration with national, regional and international organisations, including funding agencies, international health research institutions, international NGOs and universities, as well as corporate philanthropists. Governance The research centre is administered by an eight-person board of directors, chaired by Justine Opio-Epelu. Other board members include Prof. Nelson Sewankambo, the immediate past Principal of Makerere University College of Health Sciences. Prof. Peter Mugyenyi, the internationally recognized HIV/AIDS researcher and pediatrician, who founded the institution, serves as the centre's executive director. Future plans The JCRC has plans to build an international research hospital worth US$120 million in collaboration with Tokushukai Medical Group of Japan. Commitment for 70 percent funding has been obtained from the African Development Bank (AfDB). In March 2018, the institution procured an Apheresis machine, which enables healthcare personnel to extract only those selected blood components from a donor's or patient's blood, and return the non-selected components back into the bloodstream of the donor/patient. This technique is of particular significance and utility, when treating patients with sickle cell disease and HIV/AIDS.

It is native to the southeastern Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Description The green snakelock anemone averages about in height, but individuals in some areas have reached when fully extended. The broad column has rows of verrucae (wart-like outgrowths) on its surface to which coarse grains of sand and fragments of shell adhere. The oral disc has a central mouth surrounded by a whorl of long, tapering tentacles with blunt tips, varying in number from 24 to 124. When expanded, both the column and tentacles of this anemone are usually green, but brown or red individuals sometimes occur. When retracted, with the oral disc and tentacles tucked inside the body cavity, green individuals may appear black. Distribution and habitat The green snakelock anemone is found in shallow seas around the west, south, and east coasts of Australia, Tasmania and both islands of New Zealand. It is found in the intertidal zone in rock pools, under overhangs, between boulders, and in crevices. The base is firmly attached to a rocky substrate even when the anemone is in a rock pool and appears to be immersed in sand. It is often found growing close to the sand anemone.

Meanwhile, the discord between Jafar and the Red Queen reaches its breaking point. Will, with the wish Alice gave him, wishes to stop Alice's suffering. As a result, Cyrus is no longer a genie. Instead, Will is, and he finds himself trapped in the genie's bottle, even as the river carries it over a waterfall.

Kylie Peters of Den of Geek gave the episode a mixed review, saying \\"The episode is infinitely mock-able. But despite making little sense, it‚Äôs worth a mention that it did hold my interest. That interest came partially from the effort to figure out wtf was going on and partially from laughing at it, but there was some genuine interest, too. I‚Äôve come to care about some of the characters (mostly Knave), and some long-developing plot points came to the forefront. It‚Äôs not entirely bad as fluff entertainment.

A related legal concept is protected speech. Just as freedom of speech protects free expression, in many cases it similarly protects an individual from being required to utter or otherwise express a thought with which they disagree. Canada University of Toronto psychology professor and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has used the term \\"compelled speech\\" to describe Canadian federal government's Bill C-16, which added \\"gender identity or expression\\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Peterson argues that the bill would allow him to be fined or imprisoned if he refused to refer to students by their preferred gender pronouns. Legal experts have challenged Peterson's interpretation; they say that the bill would not criminalize using non-\\"preferred pronouns\\". By 2018, Daniel Woolf, the vice-chancellor of Queens University stated that \\"compelled speech\\" had become a \\"very divisive subject within the Ontario law profession\\" and was the object of much tension. United Kingdom Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right of freedom of expression, and section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, requires that as far as possible all legislation be given effect in a way which is compatible with this. In Lee v Ashers Baking Company Ltd, the Supreme Court considered whether a bakery in Northern Ireland had violated anti-discrimination law by refusing to decorate a cake with a message in support of gay marriage, with which the bakers disagreed on religious grounds. They held that although the bakery may have discriminated on the basis of the customer's political beliefs, which would in itself contravene the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998,Judgment, part III the legislation had to be \\"read down\\" in a way which would not violate the defendants' Article 10 rights, taken to include the right not to express a particular opinion. The right in Article 9 is a limited right because it permits restrictions on free speech that are necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of a legitimate aim, but the Supreme Court found that no such justification existed in this case.Ibid, part IV (The court also considered whether the defendants had discriminated based on sexual orientation, but because they concluded that they had not done, the court did not need to consider whether the relevant legislation should be similarly read down.Ibid, Part II.) Scotland During The Killing Time of the 1680s an Abjuration Oath could be put to suspects where they were given the option to abjure or renounce their allegiances. The terms of the oath were deliberately designed to offend the consciences of the Presbyterian Covenanters. Those who would not swear \\"whether they have arms, or not\\" could be \\"immediately killed\\" by field trial \\"before two witnesses\\" on a charge of high treason. John Brown was included among those executed in this judicial process by John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (Bluidy Clavers) on 1 May 1685. The wives and children of such men could also be put out of their houses if they had spoken to the suspect or refused the oath themselves. Eighteen year old Margaret Wilson and sixty-three year old Margaret McLaughlan were killed \\"without human hand\\" when they were drowned in the sea for refusing to take the Abjuration Oath.

Born in Devonport, England, Lunn moved to Canada on assignment with the Royal Navy in 1824 and remained there for the rest of his life. Lunn served in many civic and business capacities in Montreal, and worked to promote the educational interests of Protestants in Quebec at a time when education in that province was dominated by schools run by the Catholic Church. Early life Lunn was born on July 18, 1796 to Elizabeth (n√©e Heard) and William Lunn in Devonport, England. In 1819, he moved to Kingston, Upper Canada to manage supplies for the Admiralty. He married Margaret Fisher in 1821. Lunn stayed in Canada after the British decided to end their naval presence at Kingston in 1834. His wedding was noted for being the cause of a charivari that went on for three nights and resulted in the door of a police watch house being destroyed and several people arrested. Lunn was a Wesleyan and wrote to Britain in 1824 requesting missionaries, because the Canadian government at the time was not happy with the presence of missionaries from the United States. Career Lunn was one of the founders of Montreal General Hospital, and a member of the board of managers at several points between 1824 and 1886. He served on the Bank of Montreal's board of governors from 1829 to 1849. In 1829 he was a member of both the Montreal Library and Montreal Committee of Trade boards of directors. In municipal politics Lunn served as a Justice of the Peace in Montreal from 1826 to 1830. Lunn's most significant impact on Montreal was related to education. Education in Quebec in the early 19th century was dominated by the Catholic Church. In 1822 Lunn organized the British and Canadian School Society, and served as its treasurer. In 1844 he became one of the founding board members of the High School of Montreal, and in 1864 he served as chair of the Protestant Educational Association, a group that existed to promote the interests of Protestants in Canadian education. Lunn died on June 19, 1886 in Montreal. A school was named in his honour in Montreal, located on Ann Street, between William Street and Ottawa Street. The school closed down in the late 1940s.

The translation, since 1597 in the Leiden University Library, was done at the end of the 11th century by a monk of the Abbey of Egmond in the present day Netherlands. The literary text would be seen as the start of Dutch literature, were it not for the fact that the manuscript probably never left the abbey, so it couldn't have influenced later works. Until recently, based on its orthography and phonology the text of this manuscript was believed by most scholars to be Middle Franconian, that is Old High German, with some Limburgic or otherwise Low Franconian admixtures. But in 1974, the German philologist Willy Sanders proved in his study Der Leidener Willeram that the text actually represents an imperfect attempt by a scribe from the northwestern coastal area of the Low Countries to translate the East Franconian original into his local Old Dutch vernacular. The text contains many Old Dutch words not known in Old High German, as well as mistranslated words caused by the scribe's unfamiliarity with some Old High German words in the original he translated, and a confused orthography heavily influenced by the Old High German original. For instance, the grapheme is used after the High German tradition where it represents Germanic t shifted to /ts/. The Leiden Willeram contains 136 words with the oldest date in Dutch.

History and location  The church is at Calle de la Beneficencia, 18 in the Justicia neighborhood, belonging to the Centro region of the capital. Interior of the cathedral from the rear entry. However, the congregation of Redeemer is older than the building at Beneficencia. The congregation was founded in 1869 and originally met at Plaza de Santa Catalina de los Donados. Services started at the present location on 27 September 1891. The founding pastor of the congregation was Antonio Carrasco (d. 1873). The congregation was one of the founding churches of the Reformed Episcopal Church of Spain at the founding synod that Church on 2 March 1880. Built in the neogothic style, it was designed by Enrique Repull√©s Zegarra. The ground was broken for the construction of the church building on 19 March 1891 at the present location at Calle de la Beneficencia at what was formerly the barracks of Saint Matthew. The opening of the church was planned for 1892, but had to be delayed until 1893. It was during the sixth synod of the Reformed Episcopal Church of Spain, which took place from 21 to 25 September 1894, that the cathedral building was consecrated. It was also during this synod that Juan Bautista Cabrera, the Church's first bishop, was ordained bishop by three bishops of the Church of Ireland. The church was not allowed to open its principal doors for worship until 1905; during that time worshipers had to enter through a smaller side door. The organ of the cathedral was built by Juan Francisco Sanchez. It was a gift from Queen Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg. On 28 May 1967 Ram√≥n Taibo, formerly pastor of Redeemer, was consecrated as the third bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church of Spain. On 31 October 1981 Arturo Sanchez Galan was consecrated bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church of Spain at the cathedral, and there were some eight bishops in attendance. It is the oldest functioning Protestant church in Spain. Since 1995 its chief pastor is Bishop Carlos L√≥pez Lozano. According to the cathedral website, \\"The cathedral structure is one of three building structures, the central one is the cathedral itself, appropriately decorated. To its right is the old cathedral school which was closed by the Franco regime in 1939.

Early life  Kate Hamilton was born in St. Albans (town), Vermont, on June 22, 1845. Her father was John Hamilton and her mother Mary Hamiltion (n√©e Meekin). Both parents were of Scots-Irish descent. When she was eight years old, the family moved to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. When 17, Hamilton graduated from Fond du Lac High School. She went on to teach in Empire, Wisconsin, and later in Fond du Lac for about three years.  Career  Kate Pier, 1893 After her father died in 1870, her mother lived with her. With the inheritance she received from her father, she went to law school and became a lawyer. Her three daughters, Kate Hamilton Pier McIntosh, Caroline Hamilton Pier Roemer and Harriet Hamilton Pier Simonds, would also attend law school. A fourth daughter, Mary, died while a student at the German and English Academy in Fond du Lac. Mother and daughters constituted a law firm practicing first in Fond du Lac and then, in 1888, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1891 Caroline and Harriet were admitted to the bar, and in this way mother and daughters were four of the eight female lawyers in Wisconsin. In 1871 Pier began business life by assuming the charge of her mother's and her own share of a large estate left by her father. She worked from her father's office in the Darling Block, corner First and Main Streets, Fond du Lac, and from the bank and law office in which her husband had an interest. Her success brought others to her for assistance in their own affairs. As a result, from a general real estate business, in which there was naturally always a fair amount of legal work, Pier, under the advice of her friends, entered upon the profession of law, in which she paid special attention to real estate and probate law. She wanted her daughters to begin business life under her personal supervision. She started alone and knew what pioneer business undertakings meant for a woman. She wished her girls to benefit from her experience. As it was a new venture for girls to enter law schools, she desired to take the course with her oldest. Pier and her daughter Kate began their legal studies together in the law department of the Wisconsin State University, in 1886. It was a unique precedent and brought the talented pair immediately into public notice. Pier received a LLB degree on June 22, 1887, on her 42nd birthday. In 1892 she was appointed circuit Court Commissioner for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. It was the first time in the United States that judicial powers had been conferred on a woman. Pier was the first woman to vote in the Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin; it happened at an election years before women's suffrage in the United States. She was a member of the First Presbyterian church in Fond du Lac. She was a member of the Woman's Relief Corps and of the Order of the Eastern Star. She was the only honorary member of the Milwaukee Business Women's Club. She was the president of the Portia Club and Dean of Psi Chapter at Madison of the Kappa Beta Pi legal sorority. She was vice-president for Wisconsin of the National Association of Women Lawyers.  Personal life  Kate Pier, 1902 On June 25, 1866, Kate Hamilton married Col Colwert Kendall Pier (died 1895), of Fond du Lac. They knew each other since they were children and he was the first man from Fond du Lac to enlist in the Union Army. He did four years of military service under General Grant and, after fulfilling his term of enlistment, he studied law in Albany, New York. In addition to her own three daughters, assisted by her mother, Pier brought up two nephews from their infancy. They lived in the Pier homestead south of Fond du Lac which was built by Colwert Pier's father in the 1840s. She died on June 23, 1925, at the family home in Fond du Lac, and is buried in the Hamilton family plot in the Reinzi Cemetery.  Legacy  In 1982 Kate Pier was included in a book honoring 300 women from Wisconsin, released by the American Association of University Women as a part of the group's centennial celebration, Wisconsin Women: A Gifted Heritage. Pier Elementary School in Fond du Lac is named after the family.

It is part of the upper headwaters of the Nile. At 170 km long, it is one of the major rivers of Rwanda both in size and economic importance. Its upper course provides water for tea plantations in the high altitudes of north Rwanda and southwestern Uganda. Its lower course provides water for the dry areas of Nyagatare, facilitating irrigation of rice fields and other crops as well as providing water for cattle in this area for cattle farming. Course The river takes its source at Rukomo in Gicumbi district close to the town of Byumba in the high mountains of northern Rwanda. At the source, it is called the Mulindi River. This stream is very important to the economy as its valley and the valleys of its tributaries are fertile and contain major tea plantations. One of the largest tea factories in Rwanda, the Mulindi Factory is located on this river. The Mulindi flows north for 28 km and then enters Uganda. Upon entering Uganda, the river changes its name from Mulindi River to Rwabakazi River. Rwabakazi continues northward, then upon reaching the city of Kabale, the river changes its course and flows in a general southeast direction towards Rwanda. This section of the Muvumba River in Uganda (Rwabakazi River) is 55 km long. The river reenters Rwanda in Nyagatare District and takes the name Muvumba River. It then flows in the northeastern direction for 87km and empties into the Akagera River at Kagitumba, the tri- point between Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. For the last 30 km of its course, the river forms the border between Rwanda and Uganda.  Economy  The Muvumba River valley is heavily farmed. The upper course of the river in the mountains of the Northern Province in Rwanda and Kabale District in Uganda has narrow valleys that are mainly used as tea plantations. The river provides water to countless canals that serve to irrigate the plantations. As a result, the river is partially dammed in many location to control water levels and ensure the availability of water even in the dry seasons. In areas where there are no tea plantations, the valley is used for subsistence farming. Upon re- entering Rwanda, the river flows in areas of hills with gentler slopes and relatively lower altitude. The entire course of the Muvumba river valley is prone to flash flooding due to the heavy rains that fall in the mountains of its upper reaches. These have been known to bring heavy floods even in the lower parts of the river that normally do not get as much rain. These floods can often paralyze the lower course of the river, closing off roads and bridges while also causing extensive damage to crops.  Fauna and Flora  Outside of extensive farming, the wild lower reaches of the river support a sizable gallery forest. This narrow forest can be thick and almost impenetrable, and contains many varieties of savanna trees. Many bird species are found in this area, the most abundant of which are herons and egrets. Small aquatic mammals and reptiles can be found. Larger water animals such as hippopotamuses and Nile crocodiles can also be found in areas close to the confluence with the much larger Akagera River. These animals have been known to travel further upstream, especially during flooding causing casualties to the unsuspecting locals who are not used to these animals being that far upstream.

Numerous high-ranking Safavid figures originally hailed from the province, or had roots there. History Safavid control could roughly be divided into two areas. The areas in southernmost Daghestan, amongst which Darband (Derbent), were governed by officials who directly hailed from the Safavid ranks. The areas more to the north and west, where various Daghestani principalities and feudal territories existed, were governed by various local dynasts under Safavid suzerainty. The most important of these were the Shamkhal of Kumukh at the Terek River, and the ruler of the Kara Qaytaq styled with the hereditary title of Utsmi, located on the Caspian littoral. The small kingdom of Enderi, located south of the Terek, formed somewhat of a \\"buffer state\\" towards the north. In contemporary sources, its population was commonly referred to as \\"Lezgis\\". The Safavid king (shah) appointed the Shamkhal himself, but the candidate always had to be from the local princes. According to Engelbert Kaempfer, the Shamkhal also possessed the title of vali (i.e. viceroy), but \\"only as a honorific\\". Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, a member of the family of the Shamkhal of Kumukh, rose to become one of the most powerful individuals in the Safavid state. Though the Shamkhal and the Utsmi attempted at playing the Safavids, Ottomans, and Russians against each other, they were, most of the time, subject rulers of the Safavids. From 1606 till 1719, the Utsmi paid tribute to their Safavid overlords, whereas the Shamkhals did so from 1636 till 1719. During the Russo- Persian War of 1651-1653, the successful Safavid offensive resulted in the destruction of the Russian fortress on the Iranian side of the Terek and its garrison being expelled. After the issue with the Russians was dealt with, then incumbent Safavid king Abbas II (r. 1642-1666) ordered the \\"master of the hunt\\" (mƒ´r shekƒÅr-bƒÅshi) Allahverdi Khan to build new fortresses in Daghestan in order to secure the settlement of Qizilbash warriors. However, this led to an atmosphere of uncomfort amongst the Daghestani tribes. Abbas II then tried to bring the Daghestani vassal rulers under the jurisdiction of the Safavid governor of Shirvan, Hajji Manuchehr Khan. When these efforts proved to be unsuccessful, the Safavids sent a 30,000 strong army, which defeated the tribal Daghestani forces. Nevertheless, however, the result was \\"status quo ante\\". The Safavid rulers allowed their subject, the Shamkhal, to regain his post as local ruler whereas the Shamkhal sent a son, Gol-Mehr Beg as hostage to the Safavid capital Isfahan. In 1659, a Safavid army which included 2,000 musketeers (tofangchis), artillery-men (tupchis), their artillery battery (tup-khaneh) led by Aliqoli Beg the tupchi-bashi-ye jolo, was dispatched to the Daghestan province. In 1668, the province was attacked by the Cossack Stenka Razin and his men. By the late 1710s, the Safavid Empire was in a state of heavy decline, with high-profile issues on its border regions. Amongst these, was the issue related to the Shamkhal of Tarki. For years, the Safavids had not paid his customary subsidy. When the Shamkhal of Tarki then requested government troops against Russian aggrssion, the Safavid king promised him \\"a token sum of 1,000 tomans\\". As a result of this neglectance, the Shamkhal of Tarki submitted to Russian authority in 1717, facilitating the Russian invasion of Iran of several years later. In 1719, the Utsmi of the Kara Qaytaq and the Shamkhal rebelled against the Safavid overlordship. In the same year the Lezgis were already considered a threat to the northwestern regions. The Safavid government then decided to send the Safavid commander-in-chief (sepahsalar) Hosaynqoli Khan (Vakhtang VI) to Daghestan in order to deal with the issue. Assisted by the governors of Kakheti and Shirvan, the commander-in- chief made significant progress in putting a halt to the Lezgins. However, the initially successful counter-campaign was abandoned by the central government at a critical moment in 1721. The order, which came after the fall of grand vizier Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, was made at the instigation of the eunuch faction within the royal court, who had persuaded the shah that a successful end of the campaign would do the Safavid realm more harm than good. In their view, it would enable Hosaynqoli Khan, the Safavid vali, to form an alliance with Russia with an eye to conquering Iran. With the threat then left unchecked, Shamakhi, the capital of the Shirvan province, was taken by 15,000 Lezgin tribesmen aided by Shamkhal Sorkhay Khan, its Shia population massacred, and the city ransacked. In 1722, the Russian Empire capitalized on the eruption of chaos and instability, and annexed the maritime areas of the province, including Derbent, from the Safavids. After the Safavids were restored in 1729 by Nader Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah), Nader also re- established the former's hegemony over the area. In 1735, he concluded the Treaty of Ganja with the Russians, whereby they were forced to give back the territories in Daghestan back that had been taken by Peter the Great in 1722-1723. He also conducted military campaigns in Daghestan which re- subjected the Daghestani tribes, and defeated Shamkhal Sorkhay Khan, who had rebelled earlier against the Safavid hegemony. Another Daghestani chief, Ahmad Khan, sent Nader two of his daughters and his son, as a gesture of submission.

It is the first volume of a planned trilogy entitled The Book of Dust and is set twelve years before Pullman's His Dark Materials. It presents events prior to the arrival of the six-month-old Lyra Belacqua at Jordan College, Oxford.  Setting  The setting is a world dominated by the Magisterium (commonly called \\"the Church\\") an international theocracy which actively suppresses heresy. In this world, humans' souls naturally exist outside of their bodies in the form of sentient \\"d√¶mons\\" in animal form which accompany, aid, and comfort their humans. An important plot device is the alethiometer, or symbol reader, of which just six are known to exist in this world. By setting three of the alethiometer's hands to point to symbols around a dial a skilled practitioner can pose questions, which are answered by the movement around the dial of a fourth hand.  Plot  Eleven-year-old Malcolm Polstead and his d√¶mon Asta live three miles from Oxford. Malcolm works alongside fifteen-year- old Alice in his parents' inn, The Trout, close to the Priory of St. Rosamund where Malcolm helps the nuns with maintenance and cooking. One day, three men, led by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Nugent, arrive at the inn and question Malcolm about the priory. Shortly afterwards, an infant aged around six months named Lyra arrives in the care of the nuns. Walking near the river, Malcolm sees a failed attempt at a dead drop and finds a secret message. The intended recipient is Hannah, an Oxford academic specialising in the alethiometer who is secretly helping an organisation known as 'Oakley Street' in its fight against the theocratic extremism of the Magisterium. Using the alethiometer Hannah finds Malcolm and retrieves her message. The two strike up a friendship in which Malcolm assists her intelligence-gathering and she provides him with books to read from her own library. The Magisterium's influence grows. At Malcolm's school, students are encouraged to join the League of St. Alexander, and to report anybody - including teachers - who contradicts the Magisterium's religious views. Coram van Texel, also working for Oakley Street, is investigating the activities of Marisa Coulter in Sweden. He discovers that she is looking into the Rusakov field and has asked an alethiometrist to find her daughter Lyra's location. Coram is followed by a man with a malevolent hyena d√¶mon and fights him, badly wounding the d√¶mon's front leg. Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, visits the inn and Malcolm takes him to visit Lyra. To escape his pursuers Asriel borrows Malcolm's canoe, La Belle Sauvage. As a token of thanks, he returns it significantly improved. Coram warns Malcolm of an impending flood, but Malcolm is unable to convince people to act. A man named Gerard Bonneville arrives at the inn, accompanied by a three-legged hyena d√¶mon, and Malcolm sees him snooping around the priory. Heavy rain starts to fall. Alice warns Malcolm about Bonneville, whom they see trying to take the baby Lyra. As the flood arrives, Malcolm and Alice rescue the child and escape down river in La Belle Sauvage. They intend to stop at Jordan College to seek academic sanctuary for Lyra, but are prevented by the ferocity of the floodwaters. Instead, they head to London, where Lord Asriel lives, pursued by Bonneville; both Oakley Street and the Magisterium are also searching for them. They narrowly escape from Bonneville when Malcolm stabs him in the thigh and Alice shoots his d√¶mon, shattering her other leg. They take his heavy backpack. Shortly afterwards, they meet George Boatwright, a former patron of The Trout who has been in hiding with a small community since running foul of the Church. Their arrival is reported to The League of St. Alexander by one of the boys in the group, and Lyra is captured and taken to an orphanage run by a convent. Malcolm enters through the scullery and rescues Lyra. The children have two more mystical stops in the canoe. In the first, a fairy woman named Diania gives them food and feeds Lyra, whom she claims and intends to keep. In Bonneville's pack, they find his scientific papers describing the Rusakov field and an alethiometer in a puzzle box. They use the box to help them escape by tricking Diania and winning a challenge to keep Lyra. In the second, they find themselves in an elegant garden where a party is being held. Nearby, behind a wall of mist, are all the things the partygoers wish to forget. Their onward passage is blocked by a pair of massive lock gates controlled by a river giant, whom they persuade to open the gates, pretending to have authorisation from the King. The canoe ends up at a mausoleum, where Bonneville attacks again but is killed by Malcolm. Alice, Malcolm, and Lyra finally make it to London, closely followed by the forces of the Magisterium. Lord Nugent and Lord Asriel rescue them from La Belle Sauvage, which is breaking up, and Lord Asriel takes them by gyrocopter to Jordan College where he obtains academic sanctuary for Lyra and leaves her in the care of the Master. Malcolm secretly places Bonneville's alethiometer with Lyra's possessions.  Publication history  Pullman conceived The Book of Dust before the publication of Lyra's Oxford in 2003, originally as a single volume. Writing was under way by 2005, but by 2011 Pullman said that he was considering splitting the novel into two volumes, one set before His Dark Materials and the other set afterwards. In February 2017, Pullman announced that The Book of Dust had become a 'companion' trilogy. Prior to publication it had been announced that The Book of Dust was to be published by Random House Children‚Äôs Books and David Fickling Books in the UK, and by Random House Children's Books in the US. La Belle Sauvage was ultimately released on 19 October 2017 by David Fickling Books in the UK, and by Alfred A. Knopf in the US.  Reception  The novel received positive reviews. Marina Warner writing in The Guardian described it as \\"worth the wait\\", calling it \\"old-fashioned and comfy\\". The Independent said that \\"La Belle Sauvage has the feel of an extended preface; thrillingly entertaining and beautifully written, but ultimately something of an introduction to the story proper we know follows thereafter\\". The Washington Post was extremely positive, stating that \\"too few things in our own world are worth a 17-year-wait: The Book of Dust is one of them\\". The A.V. Club said that \\"even without the deep well of context of those other books of Dust, La Belle Sauvage stands on its own as a singularly beguiling work of fantasy. It's sure to be devoured by readers young and old alike\\". The New York Times took issue with flat dialogue and pacing but said that \\"even with its longueurs, the book is full of wonder.\\" The Spectator said that \\"as a tale of flight and pursuit, it‚Äôs altogether enjoyable,\\" but suggested that Pullman's larger aspiration‚Äî\\"to see off Christianity\\"‚Äîwas an impediment to his storytelling and that the metaphysical ideas around which the narrative revolves were its least successful part.  Adaptation  The novel is being adapted for the stage by Bryony Lavery and will play at the Bridge Theatre in July 2020. The production will be directed by Nicholas Hytner.

Patterson was a chief petty officer in the United States Coast Guard, recognized for saving the crew of his vessel, Point Welcome, after the skipper and executive officer were taken out of action during an aerial attack, in Vietnam, in 1966. Patterson was born in 1931, and grew up in Florida. He enlisted in the Coast Guard as a young man, and by the mid 1960s he was a chief boatswain's mate. Aerial attack on Point Welcome U.S. Coast Guard cutter Point Welcome was on a three-day patrol, near Vietnam's demilitarized zone when, during the early morning of August 11, 1966, she was attacked by a United States Air Force Martin B-57 Canberra, in a case of mistaken identity. Standard procedure for small patrol vessels, like Point Welcome, was to run without lights, after dark, in areas where enemy vessels might be encountered. The first strafing run ignited a fuel can on the vessel's fantail, which Patterson was able to extinguish. The second strafing run hit the bridge, killing the ship's captain, Lieutenant David Brostrom, and injuring the helmsman, and executive officer Ross Bell. Patterson proceeded to the bridge, and took command of the cutter, executing a series of high speed maneuvers that prevented the B-57 from hitting her again. Even though the rudder was damaged he was able to steer by differentially controlling the cutter's two propellers. When the B-57 abandoned its attack, after running out of ammunition, he proceeded to the nearest base, until new Air Force fighters arrived to continue the attack. Patterson then grounded the vessel, and ordered the crew to abandon ship. He first made sure the wounded were equipped with life jackets, and were paired with an able-bodied crew member. Patterson was awarded a Bronze Star for his actions. Legacy In 2002 the Coast Guard named the recreation center at Training Center Petaluma near Petaluma, California after Patterson. In 2007 he was inducted in the Surface Navy Hall of Fame. In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism. Patterson was to have been the namesake of the 17th cutter. However, the Coast Guard announced the seventeenth cutter was to be named after another hero, Donald H. Horsely, after a request from Patterson's relatives. References 1931 births 2010 deaths United States Coast Guard enlisted American Coast Guard personnel of the Vietnam War ","title":"Richard H.

Written by Jenny Kao and Katie Wech and directed by David Boyd, it premiered on ABC in the United States on March 20, 2014. In this episode, Anastasia's past involving Cora, the Queen of Hearts is revealed, including a secret of Will's while in present day Wonderland, Alice and Cyrus makes an unexpected trip to Storybrooke to procure an item of great importance as Jafar's plan to break the laws of magic inches closer. Plot Opening Sequence Jafar's serpent staff is shown in the forest. In the characters' past Anastasia, the soon-to-be Red Queen of Wonderland is introduced to her servants Tweedledee and Tweedledum at the castle. During a conversation with them, the Queen of Hearts, Cora, who is shocked to have been invited to the Red King's wedding, pays them an unexpected visit to meet the new Queen. Cora offers to teach Anastasia magic to make life as a royal easier at the castle, but Anastasia declines the offer as the Red King frowns on the usage of magic which separates the royals and their servants. While not pleased with Anastasia's answer, Cora leaves her offer open. As the wedding day approaches, Will Scarlet secretly visits Anastasia, hoping that Anastasia is duping the King into marrying her just to steal his jewels. As Anastasia retaliates, Cora eavesdrops on their conversation and alerts the guards to the room, not before Will leaves. Cora pays Will a visit and listen to his concern regarding not being able to fully move on from Anastasia. Will asks Cora to remove his heart so that he can never feel any form of emotion. Upon doing so, Cora keeps his heart and later shows Anastasia that Will has decided to move on and no longer loves her. Cora then proceeds to teach a now-heartbroken Anastasia magic. In Wonderland Alice and Cyrus is alerted by Tweedledum to escape Wonderland under Anastasia's orders upon the Jabberwocky's freedom. However, as they wouldn't want to give up on Will, they head into the castle via a tunnel to save both Will and Anastasia.

Dimethyl sulfoxide/acetic anhydride serves as oxidizing agent. Albright-Goldman-Oxidation (Aldehyd) The reaction does not proceed further to the carboxylic acid.  Reaction mechanism  The following figure shows the reaction mechanism: Reaktionsmechanismus Albright-Goldman-Oxidation First, dimethyl sulfoxide (1) reacts with acetic anhydride to form a sulfonium ion. It reacts with the primary alcohol in an addition reaction. Furthermore, acetic acid is cleaved, so that intermediate 2 is formed. The latter reacts upon elimination of acetic acid and dimethyl sulphide to the aldehyde.  Example  The Albright-Goldman oxidation is a particularly mild oxidation process. Thus, it is suitable for the oxidation of compounds which are sensitive to nonselective oxidizing agents, such as indole alkaloids. This reaction can also be used for sterically hindered hydroxyl groups. An example for its application is the synthesis of the indole alkaloid yohimbine: Beispiel Albright-Goldman-Oxidation  Alternative reactions  An alternative method for the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes is the Swern oxidation.

Their sound has a dream pop quality with \\"vintage psychedelic motifs.\\" Sound of Ceres explores the wonders of our living planet through the lens of a combination of mid-century lounge music, 60s pop, 70s nature documentary soundtracks, 90s shoe gaze, and modern sampling techniques. Conceptually and lyrically, the group pulls from an unusually diverse array of influences. Their debut album, Nostalgia for Infinity began as a conceptual retelling of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" inflected by synesthetic meditations on the central motifs in Proust's Lost Time that echo and refine themes from the 1962 bossa nova pop hit. Described as a response to \\"the hugeness of time and space,\\" the debut was widely praised by critics and received an 8/10 on AllMusic. The group's unique work has also garnered attention from notable artists like Marina Abramoviƒá who attended their 2017 residency in Brooklyn. The group opened several shows on Peter Bjorn and John's 2016 tour and will be opening for Purity Ring (band) on their 2017 tour. In 2018, SoC began touring with Beach House, and opened for Morton Subotnick. The light shows accompanying their live performances are, somewhat unusually, controlled and executed by the band-members themselves.

Kricher (2006) Gal√°pagos: A Natural History p. 34 Description Psidium galapageium is either a small tree or shrub that ranges up to in height and up to in diameter, with smooth, pinkish-grey bark. It has wide-spreading branches with dotted grey branchlets with reddish to white or yellowish \\"trichomes\\" or hairs. The branchlets tend to become more smooth at the edges and the bark more stringy, and the terminal branchlets and leaves are sometimes covered with a scurfy reddish bloom.Duncan M. Porter (1968) Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden: Psidium (Myrtaceae) in the Galapagos Islands Vol. 55, No. 3, p. 368-371 Its leaves are opposite and elliptic to ovate, with the tips of the leaves being acute to acuminate. The base of the leaf is narrowly cuneate and is decurrent on the stalk of the leaf. The entire leaf is glabrous and is generally darker on the upper face and paler on the other side. The leaves are generally long and wide, and the petioles, or leaf stalks, are generally long. The buds of Psidium galapageium are pear-shaped or \\"pyriform\\" and connected to the base of the branchlet, extending about out. The bud is glabrous except for a minute hole at the apex with a few trichomes protruding outward. Flowers of Psidium galapageium are white, occur on branches of recent growth, and are relatively small, being in diameter. Its berries are spherical in shape and are glabrous except for ripples created from glands in the berries. The berries are yellow when mature and turn black or a reddish-brown when dried. They are in diameter and the \\"pericarp\\", or wall of the berry is about thick. The seeds are angular, dark, and long, and each locule contains several. Habitat and ecology Psidium galapageium is formerly endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands, being found on the islands Fernandina, Isabella, Pinta, Santa Cruz, and Santiago, but has since spread to other tropical areas. It now occurs from central Mexico and Florida to Paraguay and central Brazil, as well as it was introduced widely in tropical Africa and locally in India.Ira Loren Wiggins, Duncan M.

The site consists of a collection of abandoned Jain temples, as well as a mosque heavily influenced by the architectural style of the temples. Buildings in the region date from the 12th to the 15th centuries - a period when Jain architectural expression was at its zenith. Frescoes at the Gori Temple are the oldest Jain frescoes still in existence in the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. The temples were inscribed on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status in 2016 as the Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape. Background The region around Nagarparkar forms a zone of transition between the marshes and salt-flats of the Rann of Kutch, and the dry grounds of stabilized sand dunes and nearby pink-granite Karoonjhar Mountains. The region had been mostly covered by the Arabian Sea until the 15th century, though the region around Nagarparkar formed an area of raised and perennially dry land. Nagarparkar was a centre of Jainism for several centuries, and the wealthy local Jain community built several extravagant temples in the nearby hills between the 12th and 15th centuries  considered a high point of Jain architectural expression. The region became a place of pilgrimage known as Sardhara, with Jain ascetics establishing themselves in the Karoonjhar Mountains. The Nagarparkar region was described in 1650 as the \\"most glorious of all regions of India\\".Shri Gaudi Parshvanth Stavan, Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275 Jain influence in the region began to decline due to shifting of the Arabian Sea away from centres of Jain economic activity, as silt from the Indus River deposited in the Rann of Kutch. Changes in the coast line resulted in a large-scale shift of the local Jain population in the 19th century, while remaining Jains left the area following the Partition of British India in 1947, though several of the temples continue to be maintained by the area's sizable Hindu community. Several new temples were built in nearby Rajasthan, which trace their heritage back to older sites in Nagarparkar. The remains of a number of Jain temples are popular tourist attractions and heritage sites in the region.Vanishing temples of Thar and Nagar Parkar, Ameer Hamza, Dawn, October 21, 2006 http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/gallery/archive/061021/gallery3.htm A lack of an adequate road system in the area contributed to the site's state of good preservation, though the recent construction of roadways has led to a surge of tourists, despite the lack of adequate protection at the site. In 2009, satellite imagery was employed to document the site, and to help devise a plan to manage tourism. The region was submitted by the Pakistani government in 2016 to be inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site status, not only for its architectural value, but also as reflection of Jainism as part of a commercial community based on maritime trade, and the effects of a changing natural environment around the region. Jain temples Approximately 14 Jain temples are scattered throughout the region. Gori Temple Frescoes at the Gori Temple are the oldest existing Jain frescoes in the world. The Gori Temple features several domes and canopies. The Gori Temple is located approximately 14 miles northwest of the Viravah Temple. The temple was built in 1375-1376 CE, in a Gujarati-style, and features 3 mandaps, with 52 Islamic-style domes. The temple measures 125 feet by 60 feet, and is built of marble. The entire temple is built on a high platform that is reached by a series of steps carved into stone. The interiors of the temple feature finely carved marble pillars. The canopy which offers entrance to the temple is decorated with paintings that represent Jain mythology. The frescoes at Gori temple are the oldest Jain frescoes in existence in the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent. 24 small cells are found throughout the temple, which may have been used to house representations of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism. =Significance= For several centuries, the temple at Goripur was a celebrated Jain tirtha. The temple is notable amongst local Hindus as well for its image of Parasnath. An account of its building is contained in \\"Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\\" by Pritivimala, composed in Samvat 1650 and \\"Shri Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan\\" written by Nemavijaya in Samvat 1807.Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275 According to Muni Darshanvijaya,Jain Paramparano Itihas, Munishi Darshanvijaya, Jnanavijaya, Nyayavijaya, Charitra Smarak Granthamala, Ahmedabad, 1960, p. 739-743 it was installed by Seth Godidas of Jhinjhuvad and was consecrated by Acharya Hemachandra at Patan in Samvat 1228. It was brought to Patan and was buried underground for safekeeping during a period of disturbance. It was rediscovered in 1375-76 and was stored in the stable of the local ruler. According to the texts, a merchant 500 years ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar had gone to Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under the house of a local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back. The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell asleep. In his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the Gori Parshvanth Tirth, and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar. The image is said to have disappeared in 1835. The temple was visited by Stanley Napier Raikes in 1854,Stanley Napier Raikes, Memoir on the Thurr and Parkur districts of Sind, Education Society's Press, Byculla, 1859. p. 83, Appendix B, who met local Jains to compile recent history and consulted Goorjee Kuntvujajee who had manuscripts describing the history of the temple. The temple was damaged by British troops who tried to capture a Sodha chief who had led a local rebellion. Nagarparkar Bazaar Temple The Nagarparkar Bazaar temple The Nagarparkar Bazaar Temple was built main bazar of the Nagarparkar town. The temple is remarkable for its intricately carved sculptures and paintings. The structure of the temple, including its shikhara and the torana gateway is completely intact. It was in use until the independence of Pakistan in 1947, and perhaps for some years even after that.  Bhodesar Temples The Bhodesar Temple is at the base of the Karoonjhar Mountains. Bhodesar, 4 miles from Nagar, features the ruins of three Jain temples. Bhodesar was the region's capital during Sodha rule. Two of the three temples were used as cattle sheds, while the third was noted in 1897 to be in disrepair with holes in the back. An ancient water tank, known as Bhodesar Talao, was also built in the nearby hills. The oldest temple, was built in the classical style with stones without any mortar, built around the 9th century CE, by a Jain woman named Poni Daharo. It is built on a high platform and reached by a series of steps carved into the rock. It has beautifully carved huge stone columns and other structural elements. The remaining walls are unstable and partially collapsed. Parts of the building had been dismantled by the locals who used the bricks to construct their homes. The two other Jain temples are said to have been built in 1375 CE and 1449 CE, built of kanjur and redstone, with fine carvings and corbelled domes.  Viravah Jain Temples The Viravah site is home to an abandoned, but well-preserved, temple. The Viravah Temples were 3 temples that are located near the town of Viravah, about 15 miles north of Nagarparkar. The site is near the ruins of the ancient seaport of Parinagar on the edge of the Rann of Kutch. The area once had three temples, which are said to have been founded in 456 CE by Jeso ParmƒÅra. One of the temples was in use during the British era, and is well-preserved and made of white marble. Another temple had a block of finely carved marble which was transferred to the Karachi Museum during the British era. The third ruined temple has 26 small domes surrounding a large central dome measuring 18 feet in diameter. The central dome features fine stone tracing It contains carved stone pillars with carved capitals. During construction of a nearby road, workers accidentally discovered numerous Jain statues, which were then placed by locals in the remaining abandoned temple, while others were taken to the museum in Umerkot. Architectural impact  Bhodesar Mosque The Bhodesar Mosque was heavily influenced by Jain architectural styles. The white marble mosque of Bhodesar is built in a style that was highly influenced by the architecture of nearby Jain temples. The mosque was built in 1505 CE by the Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat. The mosque features a central dome very similar to domes found on the nearby Jain temples, resting upon a square shaped edifice measuring 9.2 metres on each side. Pillars at the mosque also reflect Jain architecture, while decorative elements along the roofline were also inspired by Jain temples. Conservation The temples and mosques are protected by the Antiquities Act 1968, which was replaced by the Antiquities Act 1975. The site is managed by Director General of Archaeology and Museums. The Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh,Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh established in 2008, has undertaken restoration works at the site using private funding. The landscape was submitted by the Pakistani government in 2016 to be inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2016.

Production  Nickelodeon greenlit the animated series, under the working title The Adventures of Kid Danger and Captain Man, on March 2, 2017, and ordered 10 episodes. The series is executive produced by Dan Schneider. Previous to its television run, it debuted in July 2015 as a Nickelodeon short-form digital series, also created by Schneider.  Broadcast  The series had a sneak peek of its first two segments as part of Henry Dangers \\"Toon in for Danger\\" on January 15, 2018. The Adventures of Kid Danger officially premiered on Nickelodeon on January 19, 2018. In Canada, the series premiered on February 9, 2018 on YTV. In the UK and Ireland, the series premiered on April 9, 2018, also paired with Henry Dangers \\"Toon in for Danger\\".  Reception   Critical  Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series 2 out of 5 stars; saying that, \\"Animation suits the utterly ridiculous nature of these characters and their antics slightly better than did the live-action format, but it's still a low-tier pick for kids' viewing. If superheroes are to be judged on their eagerness to leap into action for others' sake, then Captain Man and Kid Danger are hardly worthy of sharing the title with the likes of Spiderman and Wonder Woman. When danger calls, these two are more likely to be found analyzing pieces of popcorn on a whim of looking for twins than they are hot on the trail of a baddie.\\"  Ratings   Episodes   Notes   References   External links  * 2010s American animated television series 2010s Nickelodeon original programming 2018 American television series debuts 2018 American television series endings American children's animated adventure television series American children's animated comedy television series American children's animated fantasy television series English-language television shows Nickelodeon original programming Nicktoons Television series by Schneider's Bakery Television series created by Dan Schneider American children's animated superhero television series ","title":"The Adventures of Kid Danger"},{"id":"55251036","text":"Alex Davison Bailey (February 14, 1882 ‚Äì June 18, 1968) was an American mechanical and utilities executive,Who's who in Commerce and Industry, Volume 8, 1953. p. 16 who served as the 64th president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1945‚Äì46.ASME.

She compiled an extensive catalogue of the variations of the flower found in Costa Rica which became the seminal reference work on the family Orchidaceae in the country for over a decade. There are at least five species of orchids named in her honor and in 2011, a plaque bearing her name was installed at the Lankester Botanical Garden to recognize her contributions to its development. Early life Dora Emilia de los Angeles Mora Monge was born on 24 August 1939 in Cartago Province, Costa Rica. After completing her primary schooling at Escuela Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s (Sacred Heart of Jesus School) she finished her high school studies in a school of the same name. Going on to university, she enrolled in the University of Costa Rica to study botany and attained her bachelor's degree in Biology. She studied under Rafael Lucas Rodr√≠guez, who developed the academic and scientific study of Costa Rican orchids, and graduated in 1968, becoming one of the first academically trained orchidologists in the country. Her thesis Crecimiento y desarrollo del √°pice del v√°stago vegetativo y de la hoja de Acnistus arborescens Schltdl (Growth and development of the apex of the vegetative stem and leaf of Acnistus arborescens Schltdl), evaluated a type of Solanaceae. Career In 1969 Mora became the Chair of Fundamentals of Biology at the University of Costa Rica (UCR) and then in 1973 assumed the Chair for General Biology. In 1978, she was promoted to Chair of General Botany, and the following year was named as the first director of the Lankester Botanical Garden. Under her direction, the private orchid farm was transformed into a botanical garden and research facility. She developed the first infrastructure of the garden and coordinated its landscape development, inviting scientists to conduct research activities. She is widely credited with bringing the facility to international acclaim. In 1984, Mora collaborated with Robert Louis Dressler to prepare the first course on orchidology at UCR. In 1992, she published with Lista actualizada de las orqu√≠deas de Costa Rica (Updated list of Costa Rican orchids), the first catalogue of Costa Rican orchids printed since 1937. Their work included identification of forty-six new genera and four hundred sixty-seven new species identified since Paul Standley had published Flora of Costa Rica. The meticulous work became a consultative text for all researchers wanting to study the family Orchidaceae in Costa Rica for the next decade. In 1989, her work with other scientists led to the inclusion of 300 illustrations of Costa Rican orchids, of which most samples were found in the Lankester Garden, in the series Icones Plantarum Tropicarum. She was a co-author of John T. Atwood's 1999 book Flora costaricensis on the Maxillarieae tribe of orchids native to Costa Rica, which would be her most important legacy to orchid taxonomy. Death and legacy A year before her death de Retana was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which prompted her retirement. Numerous new orchid species have been named in her honor, including: ' named by Eric H√°gsater, ' identified by , ' recorded by Robert Louis Dressler, ' described by Carlyle A. Luer, and distinguished by Calaway H. Dodson and Rodrigo Escobar. In 2011, the University of Costa Rica dedicated a plaque to her memory in the Lankester Garden.

Biography  Early years Bibey was raised in Walnut Cove, North Carolina. His dad and his mother's brothers were bluegrass musicians, and Bibey's love of bluegrass music was sparked when at age five his dad took him to see Bill Monroe in Walkertown. Bibey immediately took up the mandolin. Bibey played at fiddle conventions and contests and in two bluegrass bands with his dad. When Bibey was age 12, he and his dad recorded the album Southern Tradition. He then joined the band Interstate Exchange at age 14, which consisted of Barry Berrier (guitar), Mitch Freeman (bass), and Sammy Shelor (banjo). Bibey won the mandolin championship in 1982 at the World‚Äôs Fair in Knoxville at the age of 17. In 1983, Bibey played with Wes Golding & Sure-Fire. The New Quicksilver Bibey started playing music full-time in 1985 in The New Quicksilver with Terry Baucom, Randy Graham, and Jimmy Haley. IIIrd Tyme Out 1990, Bibey was a founding member of IIIrd Tyme Out, along with Russell Moore (guitar), Mike Hartgrove (fiddle), Ray Deaton (bass), and Terry Baucom (banjo). Bibey left three years and three albums later, and was replaced by Lou Reid and then Wayne Benson. Lou Reid and Carolina Bibey played for a time with Lou Reid and Carolina, and participated in the recording of their self-titled album in 1996. BlueRidge In 1997 New Quicksilver reformed as Baucom, Bibey, and BlueRidge. They recorded the album Come Along With Me with Ed Biggerstaff (bass), Dewey Brown (fiddle), and Junior Sisk (vocals, guitar). Grasstowne In 2006, Bibey left BlueRidge to form Grasstowne with Steve Gulley and Phil Leadbetter. The current lineup includes Bibey, Gena Britt (banjo), Tony Watt (guitar), Zak McLamb (bass), and Laura Orshaw (fiddle). Recording projects 2002, released the solo album In the Blue Room featuring Terry Baucom, Jerry Douglas, Tony Rice, Kenny Smith, Sammy Shelor, and Del McCoury. In 2013, Bibey and Wayne Benson released Mandolin Chronicles, an album of mandolin duets. Guests included Wyatt Rice, Barry Bales, Ron Stewart, Russell Moore, and Ronnie Bowman. Other projects In the early 1990s, Bibey was based out of Myrtle Beach, SC and was a part of the original cast of the country music variety show \\"Southern Country Nights.\\" In 1996, Bibey participated in the Young Mando Monsters project with Ronnie McCoury, Adam Steffey, Radim Zenkl, Emory Lester, Wayne Benson, Dan Tyminski, and Ray Legere. Gibson produced an Alan Bibey signature mandolin in 2004. Awards In 2001, Bibey won the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Instrumental Recording of the Year and the Recorded Event of the Year awards. Bibey was nominated in 2003 for a bluegrass album Grammy for the album Side By Side by his band BlueRidge. In 2007, 2009, 2010 & 2018 Alan was voted Mandolin Player Of The Year by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America organization in Nashville, TN.

It was described by √âtienne Mulsant in 1850 Due to the persistence of three distinct colour morphs that are somewhat separated geographically, it was thought that it was actually three different species: Bucolous nuytsiae Lea, Bucolus nigripes Lea and Bucolus obscurus Lea. However, Slipinski and Dolambi (2007) have shown that the male genitalia and general external characters remain constant within the different geographical morphs and synonymised the three species to one.  Morphology  thumb  Adult  This ladybeetle has a typically rounded form and has three geographically separated colour morphs; light brown/grey with a red smudge on the middle of each elytra (wing casing), dark grey with a red smudge on the middle of each elytra, and dark grey with no red smudges or spots. The head, elytra, legs and underside are entirely covered in small hairs. Though there has been no substantial evidence gathered, it has been preliminarily suggested that the morphology of this species suggests that it is a myrmecophile (tends to live in close proximity to ants/ant-liking) and it may possibly be a myrmecophage (ant eater). thumb  Pupae  Length 3.1 mm, width 2.0 mm. The pupa is covered in a dense coat of white, waxy filaments that is relatively longer and denser than on the larvae. The filaments themselves are also thicker and longer than those of the larvae, and cover the dorsal surface only. The pupae are creamy white without any apparent sclerotisation or colour pattern. The pupa is anchored inside of the last larval skin through the urogomphi. The larval exuvia, with the pupa inside, is attached underneath a piece of eucalypt bark. The entire body of the pupa is sparsely covered in a darker brown pubescence that is particularly longer and denser on pronotum. The body is segmented with eleven segments clearly visible: the three thoracic and eight abdominal segments. The body of pupa is broadly elongate with the pronotum flaring towards the mesonotum and the abdomen tapering to the terminal abdominal tergite. There are no spines anywhere on the body. = Head = The head is pale homogenously sclerotised and sparsely setiferous. The clypeolabrum is rounded and sits as a semicircle protruding down from between the large, prominent eyes; frontal part flat or weakly concave. Antenna is very short, extending to about one fourth of the distance between eye and the widest lateral margin of the pronotum; loose three-segmented club is distinctly visible; club does not have any spinules or setae. Maxillary palps well visible, last segment enlarged. The antennal segments are relatively spherical, and each antenna sits in the ventral groove along the inner margin of the eye. The eyes are approximately one eye-width apart. = Thoracic segments = The pronotum is distinctly transverse and moderately convex with its lateral sides widely explanate and extending rooflike over head and legs. Its anterior margin is straight, while the posterior one is slightly lobed medially. The elytron is homogenously and sparsely setiferous. The hindwings are glabrous. The legs are short and robust, tucked in close to the body with the forelegs tucked under the head, the midlegs tucked under the forelegs and the hindlegs tucked under the midlegs. The femora and tibiae of all legs are broad and dorso-ventrally flattened. = Abdomen = The abdomen is widest at the third tergite and curves laterally towards the ventral surface. The terga are sparsely setose with groups of longer and denser setae near the lateral corners; spiracles are not visible externally. Due to the curved abdomen, the single pair of urogomphi cannot be seen dorsally. The urogomphi are entire, unbranched and sit on the apex of the terminal abdominal tergite. They are relatively short, curving slightly inwards towards the ventral surface. The urogomphi end in a rounded club, with the club slightly wider than the stalks. These clubs are darker brown, particularly on the ventral surface, contrasting the rest of the body. Bucolus fourneti late instar larvae  Larvae  The final instar larvae can be up to twice as large as the adult, and the second to fourth instars are known to be covered in thick, white waxy filaments. Length 2‚Äì6 mm. When alive the entire dorsal surface is covered by a secretion of very thick, white, waxy filaments, with longer filaments fringing the body margin. The ventral surface is devoid of waxy filaments. The body is broadly ovate and highly dorso- ventrally flat. It is widest at the abdomen and narrows anteriorly and posteriorly. It is soft bodied and the dorsal-ventral body margin is distinctly lobed. The dorsal surfaces are yellowish white with the head and poorly developed thoracic tergal plates distinctly darker. The entire body is sparsely pubescent with longer setae clustered around the margin (on the lobes). Setose strumae, verrucae, unclustered setae and chalazae are present on the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The pubescence is dark brown and relatively straight and apically simple. Three pairs of legs are located on the ventral surface of thoracic segments. The legs can never be seen dorsally and are relatively short. = Head = The head capsule is darker brown ‚Äì a contrast to the creamy-white body. The head capsule is transverse with the sides slightly rounded, and it cannot be seen dorsally. The epicranial stem is absent with the frontal arms arcuate, U shaped and obsolete anteriorly, with the basal portion of frontal sutures fused. The antennae are very short (0.15 times the head width) and three segmented, joined to the head via a large membrane (allowing the antennae to be withdrawn into the head capsule). The terminal antennomere is highly acute and narrow, approximately 0.33 the width of the pedicel and 0.25 the width of the scape. The scape is annular and much wider than it is long. It is the shortest segment. The pedicel is longer than scape, bearing conical sensorium on the distal surface near the outer rim, and a pair of pre-apical setae on the outer rim. The pedicel is slightly longer than the terminal segment. There are two longish setae projecting up from the pedicel. The antennae can be seen dorsally from the head capsule, but not dorsally from the entire body. The flagellum is dome-shaped with apical seta and several sensilla. The small, black, three stemmata (simple eyes) sit just behind the antennae at either end of the head capsule, wide apart from each other at approximately 10 times the width of the eye apart. The inner cutting edges of mandibles are entire, unserrated and slightly sickle shaped, the apex very acute. The mandibles have a partially membranous lobe on the molar part. They are much less wide than that of the adult, and appear to be more highly sclerotised. This suggests that they are used, unlike the adult of this species, to pierce harder-shelled insect prey. The maxillary palps are three segmented and almost half as narrow as the antennae. The terminal segment is slightly narrower than the base, and the mid segment is slightly larger than the terminal segment and slightly narrower than the basal segment. The palpifer is distinct and incomplete. The two basal segments are wider than they are long whereas the terminal segment is longer than it is wide. The mala is broadly rounded apically and the stylus, with pedunculate seta, is present. The single pair of labial palps are very close together at a distance 0.3 times the width of the basal segment and sit on the front of the head in the lateral middle, directly between the maxillary palps. The labial and maxillary palps sit between and entirely below the antennae. The basal segment of the labium is very short and annular with the distal segment transverse and longer than the first segment. The palpifer is sclerotised and fused with the opposite palpifer to form a complete ring. The submentum is entirely membranous. = Pronotum = The dorsal surface of the first body segment (pronotum) has a darker brown, patchy colouration at the apex. The crown of the pronotum has a longer, denser fringe of setae than anywhere else on the body. The setae on the pronotum can be clustered or not. The pronotum is transverse and arcuates anteriorly so that it projects over the head. The dorsal plates are indistinct and are not clearly separated medially. The mesonota and metanota are transverse with rounded lateral margins that have lightly sclerotised plates. The tergal surfaces are without distinct processes and have two transverse rows of short setae and three clusters of long and short setae laterally. The pleural region has distinct multisetose struma. = Legs = The legs are moderately long at approximately 2 times the length of the head capsule. The tibiotarsus of the foreleg is 0.8 times the length of the head capsule. All six legs are sparsely pubescent, covered in short setae. The setae on the tibiae are significant longer and denser than all other leg pubescence. The trochanter and tarsi are highly reduced and unapparent in all legs. Furthermore, all femora are the longest segments of each leg. All tarsi are adorned with a single, highly sclerotised, and sickle- shaped claw with margins entire and unserrated. Each claw has a weak basal tooth. The forelegs are half the length of the second and third legs, and the foreleg has a much wider tibia. Both apices of all tibiae and femora are dark brown due to sclerotisation. This sclerotisation makes a golden-brown outline of a circle around the \\"knee\\" of the larva, where the tibiae and femora meet, the tibiae of the forelegs are highly reduced and much wider than they are long. = Abdomen = There are nine abdominal segments in total. The first eight are transverse with each tergite displaying two rows of short setae, two clusters of setae and weakly developed lateral strumae bearing several chalazae; the pleural area has several setae. Tergite IX is semicircular with the dorsal and lateral surfaces distinctly setiferous. All abdominal segments, as with all body parts except for the legs and head capsule, are creamy to yellowy white.  Range  Whilst relatively little is known about Bucolus fourneti, it is known that this species is a ladybeetle native to Australia and has been found under loose Eucalyptus bark, on Acacia and in leaf litter. Preliminary data suggests that this species is found Australia wide, though is locally sparse in population density. Since the species was discovered in 1850, Bucolus fourneti has been collected from 73 locations across Australia for various Australian state insect collections (data from Slipinski & Dolambi, 2007). The collection points for these specimens show a wide distribution for Bucolus fourneti, and this suggests that this species may be a habitat generalist. However, questions remain regarding the habitat requirements for the species, including the significance of water, altitude and the abundance of specific plant and animal families/species.  Diet  Both adult and larval Bucolus fourneti display typical ant-defensive morphologies with respect to their hairy and waxy bodies. They have been observed in the field by Slipinski (2007) to be living nearby ant trails on eucalypt trees and in the lab the larvae were seen grabbing on to ants. It is unknown if this action reflects the larva eating the ant, or merely attacking the ant for an alternative reason (for example: stress, self-defence, territoriality). Collection data suggests that this species may be eating Acacia blossoms, and other ant-ladybeetle studies suggest that this species may be eating hemipterans (Volkl, 1995; Volkl & Vohland, 1996; Sloggett et al., 1998; Takizawa & Yasuda, 2006; Suzuki & Ide, 2007).  Microhabitat  Microhabitat features are important to the survival of coccinellids. The selection of specific microhabitat qualities within a heterogeneous environment can maximize the fitness of a ladybeetle by affecting the growth rate, rate of feeding and the avoidance of inter- and intra-specific predation (Lucas et al., 2000; Ohashi et al., 2005). As Bucolus fourneti can be found in such environmental extremes (as indicated by their large range), it is possible that the microhabitat choices for this species are particularly important for thermo- and hydro- regulation. In 2007 during a microhabitat survey, Bucolus fourneti were only found co-existing on Eucalyptus blakelyi trees with the ant species Notoncus gilberti. It was observed that the larvae and pupae in particular prefer to live in the crevices and under loose bark in trees, and the adults moved about exposed above the bark during daylight hours.

Like the rest of Malaysian cuisine, Sarawak food is based on staples such as rice but there is a great variety of other ingredients and food preparations due to the influence of the state's varied geography and indigenous cultures quite distinct from the regional cuisines of the Peninsular Malaysia. Sarawak is famous for its multi-ethnic population. As the homeland of many unique communities, Sarawak has a variety of cuisines rarely found elsewhere in Malaysia. The uniqueness of Sarawak well depends on its ethnic groups. Every native group in Sarawak has their own lifestyle, traditions, cultures and also foods. Sarawak cuisine is less spicy and has a subtle in taste. It uses fresh seafood and natural herbs like turmeric, lemongrass, ginger, lime and tapioca leaves. These ingredients are not only easily available, but also add a hint of aroma, texture and freshness to the delicacies. Food is one of the most cultural identities for natives group in Sarawak with each ethnic has their own delicacies. The Iban popular with ‚Äútubu‚Äù (stems), ‚Äútuak‚Äù (alcoholic beverage made from rice wine) and ‚Äúpansuh‚Äù (dish cooked with bamboo), the Malay with ‚Äúbubur pedas‚Äù (porridge) and ‚Äúkek lapis Sarawak‚Äù (Sarawak layer cake), the Bidayuh with ‚Äúasam siok‚Äù (chicken rice that cooked in bamboo) and ‚Äúsup ponas Bidayuh‚Äù (soup dish made of tapioca), the Melanau with ‚Äútebaloi‚Äù (Sago palm crackers), ‚Äúsagu‚Äù (extracted from Sago palm) and ‚Äúumai‚Äù (raw fish mixed with lime juice) and Orang Ulu well known with ‚Äúgaram barrio‚Äù (Highlands salt), ‚Äúkikid‚Äù (broth), ‚Äútengayen‚Äù (local young leaves), and ‚Äúurum giruq‚Äù (pudding).  Ingredients  Sagu or Sago Sarawak cuisine uses rice as staples. It is most often steamed and always served with meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Rice is often enjoyed with the sauce or broth from the main dishes. Bario Rice is a famous rice in Sarawak, which is named after the Sarawakian highlands where it is cultivated. It is regarded by the natives as the best and finest rice from the highlands of Sarawak. The rice, as per the natives, is known to be eaten only by the longhouse chief on special occasions although it is now available in Sarawak restaurants. In Sarawak, rice is often fried. Nasi aruk is a traditional Sarawakian Malay nasi goring or fried rice. Unlike common Nasi goreng, Nasi Aruk does not use any oil to fry the rice. The rice must be fried for longer (compared to frying rice for Nasi Goreng) for the smokey/slightly-burnt taste to absorb into the rice.

Guns are not often used because cartridges are beyond the means of many indigenous people. Punai is another small bird the natives of Sarawak catch with sticky nets, and eat after roasting them over a small charcoal fire. Deep-fried punai is often available as part of lelapan (halal) in Miri. Jungles vegetables are found up the hills and down the valleys, and some even by the riverbanks picked out by ancestors of the natives. Palms like pantu, nipah, nibong, coconut and sago continue to be important umbut or upah or shoots the indigenous people retain as delicacies. Native cuisine differs others cuisine in its simplicity and directness of flavor. The use of wild ginger, daun bungkang and jungle leaves can bring subtle flavours to various dishes.  Method of cooking  Commonly, cooking methods adopted in Sarawakian food are menumis (stir frying), menggoreng (frying), bakar (grilling) and rebus (boiling). Each ethnic group in Sarawak has different styles of preparing, cooking, preserving and eating style of food. The Orang Ulu, for instance, using garam barrio to preserve meat, fish and vegetables which is called ‚Äúmengasam‚Äù. The Iban are cooking and eating the lulun, rice which is cooked in bamboo. Other than that, the traditional cooking methods of the Iban people also called pansoh or pansuh, which is the preparation and cooking of food in bamboo tubes. Ingredients like poultry, fish, vegetables or rice are mixed with fragrant herbs like lemongrass, tapioca leaves and bungkang leaves (a species of myrtle from the Eugenia genus), then sealed within the bamboo tubes and placed directly over an open fire. The mixture needs to be stuffed into the bamboo logs and chopped tapioca leaves are stuffed at the opening of the logs. Cooking food this way will infuse it with aroma and flavour from the bamboo tubes while keeping it moist. Geographically, the large forest area and style of living of the native groups‚Äô traditional food were created, prepared and cooked using the natural resources. These food treasures, in turn, have contributed to the uniqueness of Sarawakian cuisine.  Popular dishes Popular dishes in the state include Sarawak laksa, kolo mee, sayur midin belacan, tomato mee, ' and ayam pansuh. The state is also known for its Sarawak layer cake dessert. Each ethnic group has its own delicacies with different styles of preparing, cooking, and eating food. However, modern technology has altered the way of cooking for native dishes. Examples of ethnic foods are Malay bubur pedas (porridge), the Iban tuak (rice wine) and manok pansoh (bamboo chicken), Bidayuh asam siok (chicken rice)), Melanau tebaloi (sago palm crackers) and umai (raw fish mixed with lime juice), and Orang Ulu urum giruq (pudding).

The former is a raw seafood salad which consists of raw sliced seafood (anything from freshwater and seawater fish, prawns and even jellyfish) cured in calamansi lime juice, tossed with ground peanuts, sliced onions and chilies. For umai jeb, the raw sliced seafood is undressed, and is simply dipped into a spicy sauce for consumption.  Beverages  Teh C Peng Special  Non-alcoholic beverages  ‚ÄúTeh C Peng Special‚Äù is a local popular tea in Sarawak. Its names derived from the local speak for iced (‚Äúpeng‚Äù) tea (‚Äúteh‚Äù) with evaporated milk (‚ÄúC‚Äù). This tea is an iced concoction of brewed tea, evaporated milk and gula apong (nirah palm sugar) syrup, carefully presented un-stirred in three or more layers. Originally from Kuching, its popularity has spread to other areas of Sarawak as well as neighbouring Sabah. Sarawak also popular with White lady. White Lady is a shaved iced concoction with evaporated with milk, mango juice, longan and pineapple. Invented in 1975 by a Kuching hawker, multiple variations can be found in various hawker stalls throughout the city.  Alcoholic beverages  Tuak is a type of traditional alcoholic beverage to Sarawak's Dayak communities. It is made with glutinous rice or a mixture of fragrant rice and glutinous rice or just fragrant rice. The process of making tuak involves fermentation of the cooked rice where the starch in the rice is converted into sugar which is then fermented to produce alcohol. However, there is no accepted convention or definition on what constitutes tuak. Tuak is essentially an alcoholic drink produced by fermenting anything that contains carbohydrates, as long as it is made in Sarawak by Sarawakians. Tuak is normally served as a welcoming drink to guests, and as an important component for ritual events and festive occasions like Gawai and Christmas. Another type of a stronger alcoholic drink is called langkau, which contains a higher alcohol content because it is actually made of tuak which has been distilled over fire to boil off the alcohol, cooled and collected into containers. Bidayuh also use distilling methods to make ‚Äúarak tonok‚Äù, a kind of moonshine. The Bidayuh in particular are known for their skill and expertise in brewing tuak: ingredients for tuak variants include sugarcane (tepui), tampoi (a wild fruit with a sweet and tart flavour), pineapples and apples. Tepui is an alcoholic drink which is quite similar to tuak. Because it is made out of sugarcane juice, this alcoholic drink is both smooth and soothing drink, compared to tuak and langkau. Normally, Bidayuh people drink tepui right after the dinner.  Cakes  A colourful Sarawak layer cake Kek lapis Sarawak or Sarawak layer cake is a layered cake with unique patterns of interlaced of tasty layers and variety of flavours. It is the specialty of the Malay in Sarawak that serving during festive season and special occasion in Sarawak, Malaysia.

Historically, countries such as the United States have required that immigrants carry evidence of citizenship. Controversies within immigrant surveillance in the United States involve the alleged racial profiling committed by police departments and negligence found in detention centers.Villalobos, Jos√©. 2011. Promises and Human Rights: The Obama Administration on Immigrant Detention Policy Reform. Race, Gender & Class, 18(1/2), 151-170. Laws concerning surveillance and immigration vary by country but terrorist attacks have made the issue more prevalent.Schaefer, Agnes Gereben, et al. 2009. ‚ÄúThe History of Domestic Intelligence in the United States: Lessons for Assessing the Creation of a New Counterterrorism Intelligence Agency.‚Äù The Challenge of Domestic Intelligence in a Free Society: A Multidisciplinary Look at the Creation of a U.S. Domestic Counterterrorism Intelligence Agency. pp. 13‚Äì48.  History   The United States  = 1700s‚Äì1900s = Immigrant surveillance has been a prevalent issue throughout United States history. Historians argue that policies involving immigration surveillance are a product of nativism and can be evidenced throughout United States history.Patel, Ruchir. 2003. ‚ÄùImmigration Legislation Pursuant to Threats to US National Security.\\" Denver Journal of International Law and Policy 32.1: 83-104. The Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s is one of the earliest cases of immigration surveillance, allowing the president to act on their own discretion in regards to whether or not non- citizens were dangerous to the country because of their nationality.Schrecker, Ellen. 1996. ‚ÄúImmigration and Internal Security: Political Deportations during the McCarthy Era.‚Äù Science & Society, vol. 60, no. 4, pp. 393‚Äì426. Retrieved 2017-11-03. Congress passed its first exclusionary immigration law with the Page Act of 1875, which prohibited entry to immigrants from Asia that were thought of as undesirable, such as prostitutes and convicts.Sullivan, Laura. 2009. ‚ÄúEnforcing Nonenforcement: Countering the Threat Posed to Sanctuary Laws by the Inclusion of Immigration Records in the National Crime Information Center Database.‚Äù California Law Review, vol. 97, no. 2, 2009, pp. 567‚Äì600. In 1893, a United States Supreme Court case involving a similar issue, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, ruled that the federal government had the right to arrest and deport non-citizens if they failed to carry certification verifying their lawful residency even if there was no other crimes committed. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901 by Leon Czologosz, the son of Polish immigrants, the United States acted to exclude the entry of anarchists or those who had violet opposition to the United States government.Waslin, Michele. 2003. ‚ÄúCounterterrorism and the Latino Community Since September 11th.‚Äù In Defense of the Alien, vol. 26, pp. 83‚Äì99. = World War I = During World War I, Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1918 which ordered the deportation of immigrants that held anarchist beliefs in the United States. During the war, anti-German sentiments began increasing in the United States. The Department of Justice began placing German nationals in internment camps as a result of the war. The number of German nationals arrested during 1918 rose to 6,300. Those who were not placed in internment camps were required to register and were ordered not to leave the country. = World War II = The government began to take increasing actions against potentially dangerous immigrants during World War II. This was the result of the Pearl Harbor attack by Japanese forces. The Smith Act was enacted in 1940 and dealt with the deportation for various offenses and added registration requirements, including the fingerprinting of immigrants before being issued a visa. In addition to the Smith Act, the federal government ordered the internment of over 100,000 people of Japanese descent, many of which were immigrants. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which established legislation that authorized the payment of $20,000 to each surviving Japanese American that was affected by internment.Taylor, Sandra C. ‚ÄúThe Western Historical Quarterly.‚Äù The Western Historical Quarterly, vol. 25, no. 4, 1994, pp. 542‚Äì543. J. Edgar Hoover also ordered for the detention of Italian and German immigrants during this time because of their connections to the war. Four days before the United States declared war on Italy, government agencies began detaining German nationals and detained them in facilities for processing before their eventual internment.Chopas, Mary Elizabeth Basile. ‚ÄúThe Face of Selective Internment and the Impact of Other Wartime Restrictions.‚Äù Searching for Subversives: The Story of Italian Internment in Wartime America, University of North Carolina Press, CHAPEL HILL, 2017, pp. 41‚Äì72. President Roosevelt signed Proclamation No. 2527, which categorized illegal Italian immigrants as \\"alien enemies.\\" Though Proclamation No. 2527 only categorized illegal Italian Americans as enemies, Italians with American citizenship were also targeted for arrests. Under Proclamation No. 2526, German nationals and German Americans were also arrested and detained. = McCarthyism = After World War II, surveillance against alleged communists and foreign nationals became widespread. The McCarthyism Era began around 1947 and ended in the late 1950s. With the rise of the McCarthyism Era in the United States, anyone who had ideals that contrasted that of the United States, such as communists, would be questioned. This resulted in the deportation of approximately 850 non-citizens to Europe. This also led to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which introduced an ideological criteria. Immigrants and visitors of the United States were denied entry on the basis of political ideology, this was used to limit communism. Though the curbing of communism was the end goal of McCarthyism, many anarchists were also not widely accepted. = Post September 11 Attack = After the September 11 attacks, the United States increased its surveilling of citizens and non-citizens in order to prevent terrorism. After the attacks, the United States focused on issuing various forms of counter-terrorism, from internet surveillance to increased border surveillance. The United States government alongside some states, increased efforts to regulate immigration from the interior of the border. The proposals that have been drafted and passed by lawmakers expect individuals to demonstrate their lawful presence in the United States.Kalhan, Anil. 2008. The Fourth Amendment and Privacy Implications of Interior Immigration Enforcement. U.C. Davis Law Review 41(3), 1137-1218. With the passing of the Patriot Act, the possibility of indefinite detentions for immigrants became possible.Reza, Sadiq. 2002. ‚ÄúPrivacy and the Post-September 11 Immigration Detainees: The Wrong Way to Right (and Other Wrongs).‚Äù Connecticut Law Review 34(4), 1169-1184. The Patriot Act was enacted seven weeks after the September 11 attacks and allowed for the deportation of immigrants that were suspected of terrorist activity. Under the Patriot Act, immigrants that were considered threats to national security could also be indefinitely detained without the possibility of bond. Detention would also become indefinite if the immigrant's country did not want to receive the immigrant in question.Wadhia, Shoba Sivaprasad. 2016. \\"Is Immigration Law National Security Law.\\" Emory Law Journal 66.3: 669-696. As a result of this, multiple civil liberties organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) began to file lawsuits against federal districts to declare the detention of multiple Muslim men unconstitutional. President Donald J. Trump first announced that he would halt muslim immigration to the United States in his presidential campaign citing the San Bernardino mass shooting. Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, President Trump announced that he would follow through with his proposal of an immigration ban or registry system for Muslims living in the United States.  Surveillance methods   The United States  = State surveillance = Since 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made the enforcement of surveillance interior of the border its main priority, focusing on undocumented workers, suspected gang members, and unlawful immigrants with the final order of removal.Aldana, Raquel. 2008. ‚ÄúOf Katz and Aliens: Privacy expectations and the immigration raids.‚Äù U.C. Davis Law Review 41(3), 1081-1136. Two of the biggest operations that targeted these groups have been Operation Return to Sender and Operation Community Shield, conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) starting in 2006. In a legislative response to the September 11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) in November 2001. This required all baggage screeners to be United States citizens. The ATSA also created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) which ensures the safety of the traveling population in the United States. Passing of the ATSA ensured that many airports would have high security standards, but resulted in immigrants losing their jobs because of it. During the passing of the ATSA, approximately twenty percent of airport screeners were legal immigrants. In 2002, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it would renew the enforcement of section 265(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which required all non-citizens to report if there was a change in their address. This was met with controversy because many of those who tried to submit forms stating their change of address were not able to have their forms processed. In July 2002, it was reported that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had approximately 200,000 unprocessed change of address forms. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has issued no-match letters, which notifies employers that they have workers with Social Security Numbers that do not match the name stated in the SSA database. The program received an expansion and issued approximately 750,000 letters to employers in 2002. In turn, the earnings made by workers that are named in the no-match letters must fix the error in order to receive them. The Earnings Suspense File, an electronic holding file for wages that cannot be claimed to earnings, has not decreased in size through this method. Another technological advancement that has resulted in surveillance is E-Verify. E-Verify has the ability to determine the citizenship status of a potential employee and allows for the employer to act on their own discretion with this information. This is considered a helpful program that assists employers to protect themselves from hiring unlawful immigrants, which is punishable by law. Some critics of E-Verify argue that this further makes immigrants more vulnerable to exploitation.Goldstein, Daniel M. and Carolina Alonso-Bejarano. 2017. \\"E-Terrify: Securitized Immigration and Biometric Surveillance in the Workplace.\\" Human Organization, 76(1):1-14 = Border surveillance = Since the September 11 attacks, measures were taken to keep the borders of the United States secure. President George W. Bush signed the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. This Act provides for the increase of intelligence gathering and allows for information found to be shared among government agencies. This act focused on the security arrangements between the United States, Mexico, and Canada in hopes of preventing another terrorist attack. In addition, the Bush administration signed agreements with Canada and Mexico in order to create regional security zones, later referred to the Smart Border agreements. What was initially a four-part Action Plan turned into a thirty-point Action Plan within a year. Within the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, there have been new implementations to surveil people that cross unlawfully. Ground-level radar is used to detect movement at the border, using computer programs to determine if it is an animal versus a human.Heyman, Josiah. 2008. ‚ÄúConstructing a Virtual Wall: Race and Citizenship in U.S.‚ÄìMexico Border‚Äù Policing Journal of the Southwest, Volume 50, Number 3, 305-333. The law enforcement located at the port of entry focuses on the foot and car traffic. The documentation that is required at this port has become more difficult to forge, now requiring a biometric identification that can be found on a computer-readable strip.  Controversies   The United States  The Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment is often used to argue against the federal raids that occur in the homes of unlawful immigrants, sometimes resulting in illegal searches and seizes. The Fourth Amendment has been interpreted to signify that a warrant or probable cause is required in order to search a home, but this is not relevant when there is a suspicion that a person is violating a law. Though the Fourth Amendment was initially created to protect the home, it protects persons from public seizes more than it does private ones. If the Fourth Amendment is violated, the person can sue the officer in question for damages in federal court. In the United States Supreme Court decision, United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, it was decided that the Fourth Amendment was not violated in cases of interior checkpoints. Though this became a decision because of the importance of public interest over the protected interest of a private citizen, some would argue that this allowed for racial profiling because it permits for the inspection of suspicious persons. = Federal raids = One of the most controversial issues within immigration surveillance are the raids conducted by ICE. Though some of the programs conducted by ICE have been effective in deporting copious numbers of people, it has been met with criticism and multiple lawsuits.Antos-Fallon, Marisa. 2008. ‚ÄúThe fourth amendment and immigration enforcement in the home: Can ice target the utmost sphere of privacy.‚Äù Fordham Urban Law Journal 35(5), 999-1032. These lawsuits came after some of the homes that were raided had outdated and inaccurate information about the persons living in the residence. Immigrant rights organizations have critiqued the methods ICE uses to detain illegal immigrants, sometimes grouping criminal illegal immigrants with non- violent illegal immigrants. Some of the critics of the program believe the behavior of ICE is coercive because of how they choose to identify themselves to residents and the lack of information they offer residents, making it unclear that there is the ability to refuse consent. Those who praise the programs have done so because of the large arrest rates. Between May 2006 and February 2007, Operation Return to Sender lead to the arrest of 18,149 people. The Obama Administration oversaw mass deportations that occurred in 2014, many illegal immigrants deported were of Central American descent. = Arizona SB 1070 = Arizona was in the midst of controversy during 2010 due to its passage of Arizona SB 1070, making it a misdemeanor crime if an unlawful citizen did not carry identification that determined if they were in the country legally. This legislation also allowed for officers to attempt to determine an individuals' immigration status based on reasonable suspicion.McDowell, Meghan G., and Nancy A. Wonders. 2009. ‚ÄúKeeping Migrants in Their Place: Technologies of Control and Racialized Public Space in Arizona.‚Äù Social Justice, vol. 36, no. 2 (116), 54‚Äì72. Arizona was the first state in the country to pass legislation that penalized employers for knowingly hiring unlawful immigrants. In addition, Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, was another controversial figure at the time due to the raids he conducted in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in Phoenix. The controversies surrounding the state of Arizona called for different social organizations, such as the ACLU to challenge the law. Opponents of this law cited that it promoted racial profiling and was surveilling people unlawfully. = Detention centers = Detention centers in the United States have become a controversial topic due to the reports and allegations of mistreatment towards illegal immigrants. In 2009, the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center filed a lawsuit concerning the treatment of immigrants within a detention center in Los Angeles. The lawsuit filed by both agencies detailed that the detainees were held up to ten hours or more despite overcrowding in the detention center and without access to water or beds. In another instance, Francisco Castaneda, a Salvadoran immigrant, was denied a biopsy while in prison for eleven months for a lesion he had. He was later diagnosed with cancer and died. In 2010, the T. Don Hutto Residential Center was investigated by the DHS after it was discovered that a male detention officer was sexually assaulting women that were in his custody while they were in his sole custody. This was in violation of DHS policies and the private company that was contracted to run the facility, Corrections Corporation of America, was put on probation during the investigation process. Currently, there are no mental health resources or legal obligations to provide inmates in detention centers with legal representation.

In the US, no federal laws specifically extend post-mortem privacy protection. At the state level, privacy laws pertaining to the deceased vary significantly, but in general do not extend any clear rights of privacy beyond property rights. The relative lack of acknowledgment of post-mortem privacy rights has sparked major controversy in recent years with rapid technological advancements that have resulted in exponential growth in the amount of personal information that is stored and instantly shared online.  Law   United States  Under common law, the right to privacy is considered a personal right, meaning it applies only to the living and, consequently, does not recognize the privacy interests of the deceased. Because of this, defamation and privacy torts that are used to prevent unjust damage to individuals' reputations cannot be extended post- mortem.Banta, Natalie M. 2016. \\"Death and privacy in the digital age.\\" North Carolina Law Review, 3: 958. Retrieved October 12, 2017 (InfoTrac LegalTrac, EBSCOhost). For example, a family cannot file suit for invasion of privacy on behalf of a deceased relative as a personal right; it can only be exerted by the person whose rights are being infringed upon. In addition, the deceased do not qualify for privacy protections held in constitutional and statutory rights, such as those noted in the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Judicial justification for the termination of privacy rights at death is centered on two main points: firstly, the deceased can no longer be active agents, and secondly, the deceased are incapable of being harmed by invasion of privacy or defamation.Buitelaar, J. 2017. [null ‚ÄúPost-mortem privacy and informational self-determination.‚Äù] Ethics & Information Technology, 19(2):129. The only clear extension of postmortem privacy rights under federal law are those pertaining to property. Via Will, private property and some personal information can be passed on to heirs in accordance with the decedent's wishes. Most post-mortem privacy protection occurs on the state level. Thus, legislation and the degree of protection varies widely from state to state.  Relevant court cases  Jesse James, Jr. v. Screen Gems Inc. established that rights of privacy do not survive death. The widow of Jesse James, Jr. filed suit against Screen Gems on behalf of her late husband, claiming the use of his name in a documentary was an invasion of his privacy. The court decided her claim was insufficient because it only applied to her husband.Fennimore, Keenan C. 2012. \\"Reconciling California's Pre, Post, and Per Mortem Rights of Publicity.\\" Indiana International & Comparative Law Review 22(2): 377-409.  Medical confidentiality  Medical confidentiality is upheld through both state and federal law. Because state legislation varies considerably, Congress passed explicit medical privacy regulations in 2000 under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).Berg, Jessica W. 2001. \\"Grave secrets: legal and ethical analysis of postmortem confidentiality.‚Äù Connecticut Law Review, (1):81. However, the act only briefly mentions postmortem privacy rights, stating that all protection ceases two years after death. Moreover, no legal mandate exists regarding patients' wishes after death. During life, informed consent is the basis for managing patient medical history. However, since informed consent is no longer possible post-mortem, confidential medical information is at risk of being exploited in a number of ways. First, highly sensitive information, such as genetic information, potential health factors, or diseases, can be easily disseminated in a way the patient may not have wanted. In addition, legal consent for research on a patient's biological material no longer applies to deceased individuals, allowing such research to be conducted on deceased patients without requiring permission.Moore, Quianta L., Mary A. Majumder, Lindsey K.Rutherford, et al. 2016. [null \\"Ethical and Legal Challenges] Associated with Public Molecular Autopsies.\\" Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, 44(2): 309-318. The dissemination of autopsy records has become a significant issue in recent years. State legislation dictating the dissemination of autopsy records can be characterized into three groups: those prioritizing confidentiality, those prioritizing complete transparency, and a middle ground that limits some aspects of disclosure for privacy protection. The inconsistencies surrounding this legislation also have the potential to expose very personal medical information that can also affect the living relatives of a patient. For example, certain genetic diseases that the patient's family does not want known to the public could be exposed, which can lead to raising health insurance premiums and employment difficulties.  Case of Henrietta Lacks  Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman whose cells were removed without consent while receiving cancer treatment. Her cells became the source of the foundational HeLa cell line in the scientific world today.Jones, D. Gareth. \\"[null Genetic privacy and the use of archival human material in genetic studies - current] perspectives.\\" Medicolegal & Bioethics, 5:43-52. Lacks and her family were neither informed nor asked for consent to the use of her cells for this research. It was not until the 1980s when Lacks's medical records were made public, exposing the rest of her family's medical information as well as the fact that her family was never informed of this. The major issue surrounding the Lacks case is twofold. Firstly, at no point was consent sought for the extraction and research on Lacks's cells. Secondly, her family never received compensation for the commercial use of the HeLa cell line.  Autopsy and death scene photographs  Under the Due Process Clause, family members generally maintain the right to control dissemination of photos of deceased relatives. Privacy rights in this context only extend to the privacy of the living relatives of the decedent, not the actual deceased.Siddiqui, Mahira. 2014. [null ‚ÄúNarrowly Restricting ‚Äúclearly Established‚Äù Civil Liberties: The ConstitutionalRamifications of a Family Member‚Äôs [under]protected Federal Privacy Rights in the Dissemination of Postmortem Images in Marsh v. County of San Diego.‚Äù] Golden Gate University Law Review, 44(1): 81-99. Most court rulings regarding autopsy and death scene photos have looked to the precedent set by the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which determines under which circumstances the release of such images is appropriate and not invasive of any living person's privacy.Terilli, Samuel A., and Sigman L. Splichal. 2005. \\"[null Public Access to Autopsy and Death-scene Photographs: Relational Privacy, Public Records and Avoidable Collisions.\\"] Communication Law & Policy, 10(3): 313-348.  Case of Emmett Till  While most families wish to conceal the images of their deceased loved ones, Mamie Till Bradley, mother of Emmett Till, decided to make the photos of her brutally murdered son public in spite of officials' attempts to ignore the event.Harold, Christine, and Kevin Michael DeLuca. [null \\"Behold the Corpse: Violent Images and the Case of] Emmett Till.\\" Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 8(2): 263-86. The photos exposed the horrendous realities of racial injustice in America and became a rallying call for many influential civil rights figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Muhammad Ali. Moreover, the images forced all Americans to confront the deep-rooted racism in America despite many white Americans‚Äô attempts to remain ignorant to the despicable happenings, especially in the South.  Relevant court cases  In New York Times Company v. NASA, the D.C. District Court denied the New York Times request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for access to audio recordings of the astronauts involved in the Challenger explosion moments before the event. The major argument of the case came down to weighing public interest and the decedents' families, and the court ruled in favor of protecting the decedents' families, claiming that exposing the tapes could cause relatives of the astronauts trauma. National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish similarly found that under FOIA, the privacy rights of a decedents' relatives are both acknowledged and prioritized when disseminating autopsy/death scene photos of the deceased. This decision was made in regards to the death scene photos of Vincent Foster, a deputy counsel to Bill Clinton. Marsh v. County of San Diego determined that a prosecutor who photocopied and then released an autopsy photo of a deceased child after his retirement could not be sued under the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity. A major point in the case was whether or not Brenda Marsh had the legal right to control the dissemination of her son's autopsy photos, and though the court determined that she did, it ruled on a technicality that at the time of the events, the law had not yet been \\"clearly established.\\"  Digital assets  The past decade has seen an unprecedented amount of data being stored in online accounts. Because of the relative newness of this phenomenon, no legal mandate exists for how a person's digital assets are to be handled after death. Terms of Service Agreements between the user and the service provider remain the closest variant to this available. In order to maintain their users' privacy protection, many of these agreements make it very difficult for third parties to access such online accounts once the user has died. Yahoo!, for example, states in its terms of service agreement that the account will be permanently deleted upon the user's death.Lopez, Alberto B. 2016. \\"Posthumous Privacy, Decedent Intent, and Post-Mortem Access to Digital Assets.\\" George Mason Law Review, 24(1): 183. Google requires a lengthy process that involves getting a court order to obtain content from a deceased user's account. There is also an option to allow someone to manage the account, make it inactive, or delete it altogether once the user has died.Barwick, Elizabeth D. \\"All Blogs go to Heaven: Preserving Valuable Digital Assets Without the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act's Removal of Third Party Privacy Protections.\\" Georgia Law Review 50, (2): 593-624. Facebook has allowed for the memorialization of deceased users' accounts, which aims to maintain the privacy of the user while allowing friends and family to still interact with the account. Requesting information from the account is a long and difficult process. Recently, the company updated its policy to allow for \\"legacy contact,\\" wherein the user can appoint someone to take over their account once they die. The new policy also offers the option for the account to be permanently deleted upon death. The rigid policies of service providers have become increasingly problematic as online transactions and data storage have become more popular, and personal representatives have consequently found an increasing need to access online accounts in order to carry out estate transfers and Will orders. States began proposing legislation to address this problem in the early 2000s, and legislation favoring access to decedents' accounts became overwhelmingly supported. Delaware's Access to Digital Assets Act is an example of such legislation already passed at the state level, which grants family members of deceased individuals full access to online accounts and profiles.Gaied, Melissa. 2016. [null \\"Data after death: an examination into heirs' access to a decedent's private online] account.\\" Suffolk University Law Review, 2: 281. Retrieved October 12, 2017 (InfoTrac LegalTrac, EBSCOhost). However, stringent terms of service agreements by service providers still make access to accounts very difficult in most cases. Thus, two major contemporary legislative proposals have come forth to address the issue. In July 2014, the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) proposed the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA) to provide fiduciaries easy access to the digital accounts of their deceased clients. Twenty-six states proposed legislation based on the UFADAA; however, such legislation failed in all but one state. In response to this, NetChoice, a major rival to ULC, proposed the Privacy Expectation Afterlife Choices Act (PEAC), which included much more stringent guidelines for giving fiduciaries access to digital accounts and was overall considered to be much more privacy-centric. Only four states had proposed PEAC legislation in 2014, and only Virginia actually implemented it in 2015. Shortly after passing the UFADAA, the ULC passed a revised version (RUFADAA). This new legislative proposal incorporated more privacy centered aspects that aligned more with those of PEAC, which even gained it the support of NetChoice. Moreover, thirty-one states proposed legislation in accordance with the RUFADAA. However, critics of the new legislation contest that its transformation still not does give much consideration to a decedent's post-mortem privacy of the information kept in their account.  Celebrity images and persona   Post-mortem publicity rights  The right of publicity was created as an extension of the right of privacy. It was developed with the intent to provided unique privacy rights to celebrities or anyone whose persona or name had commercial value. Because these people are constantly in the public eye, general rights of privacy are oftentimes not applicable, thus publicity rights accommodate this situation. The right of publicity essentially grants a person the right to control the portrayal of themselves in the public eye, specifically in regard to commercial use.Decker, Michael. 2009. [null \\"Goodbye, Norma Jean: Marilyn Monroe and the Right of Publicity's] Transformation at Death.\\" Cardozo Arts & Entertainment Law Journal, 27(1): 243. Copyright laws, aimed at protecting the ownership rights of original works, contain a significant amount of overlap with publicity rights. Much like post-mortem privacy rights, no blatant federal rights of publicity have been established, leaving recognition up to individual states. Whether states have laws regarding post-mortem publicity is dependent upon whether the state classifies the right as a privacy right or a property right. If classified as a personal right, states will not recognize post-mortem rights of publicity due to the stipulation that personal rights only apply to the living. If classified as a property right, then the upkeep and transfer of publicity rights follow a similar tract as that of property.Hicks, Aubrie. 2012[null \\"The right to publicity after death: post mortem personality rights in Washington in] the wake [null of Experience Hendrix v. HendrixLicensing.com].\\" Seattle University Law Review, (1): 275. Most states acknowledge a specific duration for post-mortem publicity rights, which generally range between forty and one hundred years.Smolensky, Kirsten Rabe. 2009. \\"Rights of the Dead.\\" Hofstra Law Review, 37(3): 763-804. Because post-mortem publicity rights vary from state to state, court precedent has determined that when establishing a person's post-mortem publicity rights, the legislation of the state in which the decedent lived must be adhered to.  Relevant court cases  Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc. established the right of publicity, granting individuals control of the commercial use of their identity. Shaw Family Archives Ltd. v. CMG Worldwide, Inc. determined that Marilyn Monroe's estate did not own her post-mortem right of publicity because neither state of her residency, New York nor California, recognized post-mortem rights of publicity. In Experience Hendrix v. HendrixLicensing.com, Al Hendrix, despite being his son's sole heir, was denied the acquisition of Jimi Hendrix's publicity rights due to the fact that New York, at the time, did not acknowledge post-mortem publicity rights.  Controversy  The use of deceased celebrities' likenesses has sparked controversy, mainly regarding the potential for their image to be used in a way that is inconsistent with that celebrity's desire. This can occur through the use of a celebrity's image for advertising a product, service, or any other recreation of celebrity likeness for commercial, or noncommercial, use in a way that the celebrity would otherwise not agree to during their lifetime.Smith, Shannon Flynn1. 2013. \\"If it Looks Like Tupac, Walks Like Tupac, and Raps Like Tupac, it's Probably Tupac: Virtual Cloning and Postmortem Right-of-Publicity Implications.\\" Michigan State Law Review, (5): 1719-1761. This then raises questions about a potential violation of that celebrity's privacy because of the use of an individual's image without their consent. This can be seen in the 2012 Coachella concert, which featured a digital recreation of Tupac Shakur. The virtual clone performed on stage, rapping a song never recorded by Tupac during his life. The use of such digital cloning and other similar recreations of celebrities could become a serious privacy concern in that those being reproduced have no control over how they are being represented. Discretion regarding the use of such digital personas is entirely up to whomever owns the right to that celebrity's image, which inevitably opens up the possibility that the decedent's interest is not being prioritized.
