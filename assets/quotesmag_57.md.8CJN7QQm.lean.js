A. Campbell Preserve Co., Camden, NJ in 1894 Joseph Campbell Company canned beans advertisement in the Saturday Evening Post, 1921. Campbell Soup Company, doing business as Campbell's, is an American processed food and snack company. As the name implies, the company is most closely associated with its flagship canned soup products, however it has through mergers and acquisitions grown to become one of the largest processed food companies in the U.S., with a wide variety of products under its flagship Campbell's brand as well as such well-known brands as Pepperidge Farm, Snyder's of Hanover, V8, and Swanson. Under these brands and many others, Campbell's produces not only soups and broths, but other canned meals such as SpaghettiOs, baked goods such as cookies and crackers, beverages, and salty snacks such as pretzels and potato chips. It is headquartered in Camden, New Jersey.Courier-Post newspaper photo gallery of Campbell's Soup's early years in Camden, N.J. The classic red-and- white can design used by many Campbell's branded products has become an American icon, and its use in pop art was typified by Andy Warhol's series of Campbell's Soup Cans prints. History The company was started in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell, a fruit merchant from Bridgeton, New Jersey, and Abraham Anderson, an icebox manufacturer from South Jersey. They produced canned tomatoes, vegetables, jellies, soups, condiments, and minced meats. In 1876, Anderson left the partnership and the company became the \\"Joseph A. Campbell Preserve Company\\". Anderson's son, Campbell Speelman, split paths with his father and continued to work at Campbell's as a creative director, originally designing the Campbell's Soup Cans. Campbell reorganized into \\"Joseph Campbell & Co.\\" in 1896. In 1897, John T. Dorrance, a nephew of the general manager Arthur Dorrance, began working for the company at a wage of $7.50 a week. Dorrance, a chemist with degrees from MIT and G√∂ttingen University, Germany, developed a commercially viable method for condensing soup by halving the quantity of its heaviest ingredient: water. He went on to become president of the company from 1914 to 1930, eventually buying out the Campbell family. In 1898, Herberton Williams, a Campbell's executive, convinced the company to adopt a carnelian red and bright white color scheme, because he was taken by the crisp carnelian red color of the Cornell University football team's uniforms.Campbell's Soup History: Introduction from Campbell's official website To this day, the layout of the can, with its red and white design and the metallic bronze medal seal from the 1900 Paris Exhibition, has changed very little, with the exception of the French phrase on the top of the bronze seal that said \\"Exposition-Universelle-Internationale\\" which was changed to the English name of the exhibition as \\"Paris International Exposition\\". Campbell Soup became one of the largest food companies in the world under the leadership of William Beverly Murphy. He was elected executive vice president of Campbell Soup in 1949 and was president and CEO from 1953 to 1972. While at Campbell's Soup Company, he took the corporation public and increased its brand portfolio to include Pepperidge Farm's breads, cookies, and crackers, Franco-American's gravies and pastas, V8 vegetable juices, Swanson broths, and Godiva's chocolates. David Johnson was president and CEO from 1990 until 1997. Campbell Soup has invested heavily in advertising since its inception, and many of its promotional campaigns have proven value in the Americana collectible advertising market. Perhaps best known are the \\"Campbell's Kids\\" designed by illustrator Grace Drayton. Ronald Reagan was a spokesman for V8 when Campbell's acquired the brand in 1948. In addition to collectible advertising, the company has had notable commercial sponsorships. Among these was Orson Welles's The Campbell Playhouse, which had previously been The Mercury Theatre on the Air. After the program's adaptation of The War of the Worlds became a sensation for accidentally starting a mass panic due to its realism, Campbell's took over as sponsor of the radio theater program in December 1938. The shutdown of Campbell's Camden, New Jersey, plant No. 1 was announced in 1989 and production stopped on the night of March 1, 1991. The following day, the plant was officially closed. It was demolished on November 1, 1991. Plants in Pocomoke City (Maryland), Crisfield (Maryland), and Smyrna (Tennessee) also shut down. Plant No. 2, originally a tomato-processing plant, shut down in 1980. It was responsible for about 35% of all Campbell's products in the 1950s. Products included pork and beans, tomato juice, V-8 vegetable juice, Franco-American spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and soups (notably: beans and bacon, cream of mushroom, cream of celery, and cream of asparagus). Article in the Courier Post (1990) announcing the shutdown of Campbell's Camden factory A can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup featuring the 1900 Paris International Exposition A total of 2,800 jobs were lost, 940‚Äì1,000 of those jobs from the Camden plant. Campbell's agreed to give workers one week's payment for each year of employment as well as paying in full for six months of medical benefits, and paying half the cost for another six months. Salaried workers received one week's pay for each year of employment. Production was moved to plants in Napoleon (Ohio), Paris (Texas), and Maxton (North Carolina). In the UK and Ireland, Campbell Soup was rebranded as Batchelors Condensed Soup (UK) and Erin (Ireland) in March 2008, when the license to use the brand name expired. Premier Foods, St. Albans, Hertfordshire bought the Campbell Soup Company in the UK and Ireland, for ¬£450 million ($830 million) in 2006, but was licensed to use the brand only until 2008. Under this agreement, the US-based Campbell Soup Company continued to produce Campbell's Condensed Soup but could not sell the product in the UK for a further five years. Campbell's continues to be a major part of Camden, regularly participating in charity eventsCourier-Post newspaper photo gallery of Campbell's charity eventCourier-Post newspaper photo gallery of another Campbell's charity event in the community. In 2009, Campbell's completed the building of a new and expanded headquartersCourier-Post newspaper photo gallery of Campbell's topping-off ceremony in the city. In January 2010, Campbell's Canadian subsidiary began selling a line of soups that are certified by the Islamic Society of North America as being halal (prepared in accordance with Islamic law). Although Campbell does not have any plans to sell its halal soups in the United States, the move has drawn criticism from anti-Muslim critics in the United States. Several bloggers called for a boycott of the company, but Campbell's spokesman John Faulkner stated at the time that the company did not notice any effect on its sales as a result. In November 2007, Campbell's Soup sold Godiva to Yildiz Holding. In July 2011, Campbell's Soup decided to once again sell its product in the UK after being absent since 2008. Symingtons began manufacturing the brand under license. The new line-up comprised twelve cup soups, five simmer soups designed to be cooked in a pot of water, four savoury rice lines, and four savory pasta and sauce packets. The new range were not sold in cans, but instead in packets and boxes. Later in 2011, the canned varieties also returned to supermarket shelves with refreshed labels and new lines. In 2012, Campbell announced plans to buy Bolthouse Farms, a maker of juices, salad dressings and baby carrots, for $1.55 billion. Analysts saw this as an attempt to reach younger, more affluent consumers. From 2012, Campbell Soup has been focused on updating their image and digital marketing to increase visibility among younger generations. They hired Umang Shah to lead global social and digital marketing. He led record social engagement campaigns including #DeclareRecess and #BIGFiveO. In June 2013, Campbell acquired the Danish multinational baked goods company Kelsen Group for an undisclosed amount. Kelsen has an 85-country distribution network and is seen as providing Campbell with opportunities for international expansion, particularly into China and other Asian markets. In June 2015, Campbell Soup acquired salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet for $231 million as it looked to expand into the fresh and organic packaged foods business.Campbell Soup to buy salsa maker Garden Fresh for $231 million, Reuters, June 9, 2015 In December 2017, Campbell's completed the acquisitioncompleted the acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, LLCPacific Foods of Oregon, LLC for $700 million and announced the agreement to acquire the snack company Snyder's-Lance for $4.87 billion in cash. The latter deal is the largest in the company's history. The company announced in January 2018 that their only Canadian factory, in Toronto, would close. Production would shift to three existing facilities within the U.S. It was reported that the expected loss of jobs, as a result of the closing, would be 380. Denise Morrison served as the company's president and CEO from 2011 through 2018. On December 21, 2018, former Pinnacle Foods CEO Mark Clouse was named the next Campbell's CEO, effective January 22, 2019. Having sold over $450 million a year worth of Chunky Soup from 2004 to 2017, Campbell's asked for a trademark on \\"Chunky\\", which was approved in 2019. In July 2019, Campbell's agreed to sell its stake in the Kelsen Group for $300 million to a subsidiary of Ferrero SpA. The transfer will be completed sometime early 2020. Pop art In 1962, artist Andy Warhol took the familiar look of the Campbell's soup can and integrated it into a series of pop art silkscreens, a theme he would return to off and on through the 1960s and 1970s. The first batch in 1962 were a series of 32 canvases. At first, the cans were accurate representations of actual Campbell's cans, but as his series progressed, they became more surrealistic, with Warhol experimenting with negative-reversed color schemes and other varied techniques (many of these which would be used on other Warhol paintings of the period, such as his celebrity silkscreens of the 1960s). The silkscreens themselves have become iconic pieces of pop art, with one in particular, Small Torn Campbell Soup Can (Pepper Pot) (1962), commanding a price of $11.8 million at auction in 2006. In 2004, Campbell's themselves recognized Warhol's art by releasing in the eastern United States a limited- edition series of cans that were inspired by the coloring and silkscreen effects of Warhol's pieces. This marked one of the few times in the company's history that they would change the trade dress for their main canned-soup line in any substantial manner. In 2012, the Warhol-inspired cans returned to shelves, in an exclusive retail partnership with Target.

However, Campbell's Chunky, Healthy Request and other soups, as well as their V-8 and Tomato juices, are claimed by Campbell's to contain reduced sodium levels.Campbell's FAQ In fall 2007, Campbell's was awarded a Certificate of Excellence, for their efforts in lowering sodium levels, from Blood Pressure Canada. By autumn 2009, Campbell's claimed it had lowered the sodium content in 50% of its soups range.1st Campbell soup latest to go lower- sodium In March 2010, this claim was challenged. ABC News reported that the low-sodium variety of Campbell soup in fact contains the same amount of sodium as the regular variety, and that Campbell's Healthy Request soup contains more fat than the regular variety. In December 2009, Consumer Reports found that major canned food companies including Campbell's Soup had tinned products which had bisphenol A (BPA) levels over 100 ppb in some cases; the testing revealed that just one serving of canned food would exceed an expert's recommendation for daily exposure (0.2 micrograms per kg body weight per day). In July 2011, citing sinking sales, and a combination of: \\"consumer views and choices\\" and having \\"found no connection between sodium consumption and negative health outcomes\\" they increased the salt contents again. GMO Throughout 2012, Campbell's contributed $500,000 to a $46 million political campaign known as \\"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers\\" This organization was set up to oppose a citizens' initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. In January 2016, they decided to support mandatory labeling and announced they would label their products that contained GMO additives.\\"Campbells Soup backs plan for mandatory GMO ingredient labeling\\", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, January 8, 2016.

Biography The Bird World: Described with Pen and Pencil (1880) William Henry Davenport Adams, born in London on 5 May 1828, grandson of Captain Adams, R.N. (died 1806), was the only son of Samuel Adams (born Ashburton, in Devonshire, 1798, died 1853), who married in 1827 Elizabeth Mary Snell. He was christened William Henry, and assumed the additional name of Davenport by the desire of his great-uncle, Major Davenport. He was educated privately, under George Dawson, and became an omnivorous reader. After some experience as a teacher of special subjects in private families, he began a life of unceasing literary toil by editing a provincial newspaper in the Isle of Wight, and while still young established a connection with the London press through such journals as the Literary Gazette, the London Journal‚Äô and London Society. He made some reputation in turn as a writer of popular science, a writer for boys, a translator, and a lexicographer. He supervised a new edition of Mackenzie's National Cyclopedia, and did a large amount of reading and writing for Messrs. Black (for whom he wrote Guides to Kent and Surrey), for Blackie & Son of Glasgow, and Nelson & Sons, Edinburgh. In 1870, he founded the Scottish Guardian, which he edited down to 1878, and subsequently he projected and edited a series of volumes called The Whitefriars Library of Wit and Humour. He died at Wimbledon on 30 December 1891, and was buried at Kensal Green. He married in 1850 Sarah Esther Morgan, a Welsh lady, by whom he left two sons and two daughters, his eldest son, W. Davenport Adams, being the author of the Dictionary of English Literature (1878).

The nation‚Äôs main city, St. John's, has developed a problem with waste disposal. Untreated sewage from resort hotels travels in open sewage lines across the land and empties into the sea. Construction of a desalination plant in 1970 relieved some of the water shortage. The government of Antigua and Barbuda supports a Historical, Conservation, and Environmental Commission. There are four main protected areas, including the off shore islands of North Sound and Codrington Lagoon of Barbuda, the latter of which is a Ramsar wetland site. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the number of threatened species included 2 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 11 species of fish, and 4 species of plants. Endangered species in the nation included the Antiguan ground lizard, the West Indian whistling duck, and the Antiguan racer.

The system has 4 hospitals, over 80 medical practices, and 25 reference laboratories. With 12,000 employees including 1,600 physicians, it is one of Massachusetts' largest employers. Baystate also owns the for-profit insurer Health New England. History 1974‚Äì1983 In 1974, Springfield Hospital Medical Center merged Wesson Women's Hospital to create the 672-bed Medical Center of Western Massachusetts. In 1976, the Medical Center of Western Massachusetts merged with Wesson Memorial Hospital. The merger established Baystate Medical Center, then the second-largest hospital in New England, with 1,036 beds. In 1983, Baystate Medical Center was reorganized into three separate corporations: Baystate Health Systems, the parent corporation now renamed Baystate Health; Baystate Medical Center; and the for-profit corporation Baystate Diversified Health Services. The reorganization provided a legal framework for developing a future multi-institutional health care system and for reducing the assets that would be encumbered with the financing of a major new hospital building. 1986‚Äì2004 In 1986, Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield joined Baystate Health; in 1999, Baystate Mary Lane Hospital in Ware joined the health system. In 2004, the Visiting Nurse Association & Hospice of Pioneer Valley, now renamed the Baystate Visiting Nurse Association & Hospice, became a member of Baystate Health. To this end, a major corporate restructuring in 1997 reduced the number of governing boards across BH from twenty-one to six. On January 1, 2004, the governance structure of Baystate Health was further simplified with the establishment of a single board of trustees for Baystate Health that also serves as mirror boards for its patient care entities that had previously been governed by a separate board. 2005‚ÄìPresent In August 2016, a phishing scam of Baystate Health employees may have compromised some demographic and clinical information of as many as 13,000 patients. Baystate informed patients and stated social security numbers or financial or account information was not accessed in the scam. Components Baystate Children's Hospital Located on the campus of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, Baystate Children's Hospital, with 110 beds and 57 bassinets, provides complete critical care programs, including the region's only Pediatric Intensive Care and Neonatal Intensive Care Units. It also includes pediatric inpatient services, child life specialists, an emergency room for kids, and outpatient specialty services.  Baystate Franklin Medical Center  Baystate Franklin Medical Center is a hospital in Greenfield, Massachusetts. = History = In 1894, Dr. William Pierce and Ellen Brown rented a house at 6 Main Street and opened a private medical practice. The following year, citizens of Franklin County agreed to open Franklin County Public Hospital (FCPH). With $16,000 in community fundraising, the new hospital opened on September 9, 1895. In 1910, the hospital had raised an additional $65,000 in donations, enough to build a much larger facility on High Street. Although FCPH struggled financially during the Great Depression, it managed to expand its facilities and recruit new medical specialists. The hospital expanded further after World War II, and became affiliated with Baystate Medical Center in 1981. To reflect this new affiliation, it was renamed Baystate Franklin Medical Center (BMFC) two years later. = Current facilities and operations = Baystate Franklin Medical Center is a 90-bed hospital providing medical, surgical, obstetric, pediatric, psychiatric and behavioral health inpatient care, as well as outpatient services. With 900 employees, it is the only hospital in Franklin County and serves rural communities with appropriate specialized services. Baystate Mary Lane Outpatient Center Baystate Mary Lane Outpatient Center in Ware, Massachusetts, is a 31-bed, tax-exempt, not-for-profit hospital, providing medical, surgical, pediatric, obstetric, emergency, outpatient, and adult day care services. Founded in 1909 by the Ware Visiting Nurse Association, the hospital services communities in Western and Central Massachusetts. The hospital was renamed Baystate Mary Lane Hospital in 2006. In 2016, it was announced they will stop overnight care at the hospital. Baystate Medical Baystate Medical Center (BMC) is a hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts. = History = King's handbook of Springfield, Massachusetts - a series of monographs, historical and descriptive (1884) (14804598813) In 1868, Dr. George Stebbins, the city physician in Springfield, Massachusetts, recommended that the city establish a permanent hospital. The need for a dedicated hospital in Springfield became evident during and after the Civil War, when wounded soldiers came to the city in search of treatment. The city approved Dr. Stebbins' recommendation, and Springfield City Hospital opened two years later in a remodeled farmhouse on Boston Road. In 1886, Dorcas Chapin, the widow of Chester W. Chapin, bequeathed $25,000 of her husband's will to Springfield Hospital on the condition that an equal sum be raised. By 1907, the hospital had a main building surrounding by four wings. In the twentieth century, Springfield's population increased considerably, and Springfield Hospital further expanded Expansion culminated in a big merger in fall 1976, when Springfield Hospital and Wesson Women's Hospital joined with Wesson Memorial to form the 1,036-bed Baystate Medical Center (BMC). Today, BMC is the largest hospital affiliated with Baystate Health Systems. In 2012 Baystate Medical Center opened a new , $300 million facility that includes: a heart and vascular center; new patient care units with private rooms; a new emergency department, of . The new building also includes shell space for future growth. It was officially dedicated on February 28, 2012. The Massachusetts Department of Health certified the new building in January 2012 and new patients began to occupy the building in March 2012. = Current facilities and operations = Baystate Medical Center, Springfield MA Baystate Medical Center is currently a tax-exempt, nonprofit hospital with 716 beds and more than 4,000 employees. BMC serves as the tertiary care referral center for the region, meaning that it has a full complement of medical services and facilities. The latter include the area's only neonatal intensive care unit, a level-1 trauma center with pediatric designation, an adult cardiac surgery service with the region's only open-heart surgery capabilities, and a kidney transplant center. BMC is affiliated with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and therefore is classified as an academic hospital. In 2016, U.S. News & World Report ranked BMC the third-best hospital in Massachusetts. In March of 2020, BMC constructed a triage area outside the emergency department to address the potential surge in COVID-19 patients.  Baystate Noble  Noble Hospital is a medical center in Westfield, Massachusetts. = History = Noble Hospital Westfield, MA In 1893, Noble Hospital owes its existence to Reuben Noble. Noble was born in Westfield in 1820. He made a fortune from the city's whip manufacturing industry and unsuccessfully campaigned as a Democrat in two Massachusetts State Senate elections. Noble died on June 3, 1890. His will gifted over $43,000 for the establishment of a hospital \\"for the reception of persons who may need medical or surgical treatment during temporary sickness or injury.\\" Noble Hospital addressed the demand for a dedicated medical facility in Westfield, which was industrializing rapidly at the turn of the century. By 1905, Noble Hospital had expanded to include a surgical center and a nurse's training school. Between 1917-1920, the hospital's medical staff treated hundreds of wounded World War I veterans and Spanish Influenza patients. It grew further in the interwar period and treated airmen from Westfield's Barnes Airport during World War II. In 1956, its trustees voted to construct a new hospital building. Westfield residents enthusiastically supported this decision, raising $1,500,000 to fund the construction of this new facility. The new Noble Hospital opened in 1958, and has expanded its services substantially over the past half century. = Current facilities and operations = In 2015, Noble Hospital joined Baystate Health and became Baystate Noble Hospital. The 97-bed facility now has an emergency center, a psychiatric ward, and an ICU. Services include intensive care, diagnostic imaging, cardiopulmonary services and rehab, emergency treatment, cancer services, lab and behavioral health. In 2015, the Cleverley & Associates Community Value Index recognized Noble Hospital as being in the top 20 percent of hospitals nationwide.

History Westland Gate was designed by Guy Lowell, architect of the Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, and was built in 1902 and erected in 1905. The decorative bronze was produced by the Hecla Iron Works. The fountains were originally named the Johnson Memorial Fountain after a wealthy Bostonian, Jesse Johnson, whose widow, Ellen Cheney Johnson, donated money to erect them. The fountains consist of two large pillars caped with bronze frieze panels made of granite and Tennessee marble flanking the street with four bronze lions heads near their bases that originally spouted water. Restoration efforts The fountains were first restored in 1980.Marcus, Jon. The Complete Illustrated Guidebook to Boston's Public Parks and Gardens, (Silver Lining Books, NY, 2002),pg 54. It appears that the 1980 restoration involved either sandblasting or honing to address inconsistencies in the stone, as well as application of a protective treatment (to resist graffiti) using Browne Fund money. Boston Globe. Boston, Mass.: Dec 31, 1980. pg. 1 The gates were rededicated in a ceremony that followed this restoration in August 1980. The 1990 restoration involved cleaning of the marble, repointing and repair of cracks in the stone, application of protective treatment, and cleaning and repair of the metal components (decorative frieze, lion heads, and commemorative plaque). A new lighting system was proposed for the gates at this time, but seems never to have been installed. On May 4, 2008 a spokesperson for the Boston Parks Department stated that the \\"fountains are on a list of projects to be repaired\\". However, over a year later, the fountains still remain in poor condition and are non-functional. A new restoration effort spearheaded by the Fenway Civic Association (FCA) began in 2012, securing funding for conservation assessments, performed in October 2013.

Economy An agricultural town, the area was first developed for mechanized rain-fed agriculture in 1968. The idea was to use the fertile cracking clay soils that were not suited to traditional agriculture to try to improve food shortage problems. There was eventually enough produced in Habila to create surpluses for export. The government encouraged private investment in Habila and the land was divided into feddans (about 0.4 ha), which were then leased out to private operators. The original leases were to be left fallow after four years and new leases were to be let for adjacent fallow plots to prevent soil exhaustion. By 1979, about 147 000 ha were officially leased under official schemes sorghum but production was greatly expanded and the proportion of fallow land decreased dramatically, with about 45 per cent of mechanized agriculture produced in illegal areas by 1985. Farmers who sought quick profits eventually led the land to exhaustion.

At one end of the meridian is a square marble plaque, which corresponds to the position of the sun at the highest at midday (64¬∞35' at the location of Saint-Sulpice), during the summer solstice about 21 June. At the other end is an obelisk, which is lit near its top when the sun is at it lowest at midday (17¬∞42' at the location of Saint- Sulpice). If the obelisk did not exist, the sun disk would hit an area about 20 metres beyond the wall of the church. Usage of the gnomon The gnomon was built at the initiative of Jean-Baptiste Languet de Gergy, the parish priest at Saint-Sulpice from 1714 to 1748.Roug√©, pp.7-12The real history behind the Da Vinci code Sharan Newman p.267 Languet de Gergy initially wished to establish the exact astronomical time in order to ring the bells at the most appropriate time of day. For this, he commissioned the English clockmaker Henry Sully to build the gnomon. The equation of time -- above the axis the sundial will appear fast when compared with a clock, and below it the sundial will appear slow. The gnomon could also have been used to properly time clocks by properly defining mean time. Mean time (the time used in clocks) is only an average of true time (the time deduced from the apparent motions of the Sun in the sky, and shown, approximately, by a sundial). True time deviates from the mechanical average of a clock by as much as +/-16 minutes throughout the year. These variations are codified in the equation of time. Henry Sully however died in 1728 without being able to accomplish this larger project. He was only able to set the meridian line in the floor of the Church. The project was completed by the nearby Observatory of Paris a year later. Computation of official time The time the sun disk crosses the Saint-Sulpice meridian gives the \\"true\\" local midday at that place. In order to compute the official French time from this, it is necessary to: * add or subtract the deviation given by the equation of time. * add half a second to have the mean Paris time. * add 50 minutes 39 seconds to obtain Central European Time. * add one hour in summer to take into account daylight saving time. Alternatively, a simpler solution would be to consult an almanac giving the time of sunrise and sundown, calculate the middle point of that time-span, corresponding to the maximum elevation of the sun. This gives the official time at which the sun reaches it maximum elevation, and therefore the time the sun disk crosses the Saint-Sulpice meridian. Computation of the Paschal equinox Latin and French inscriptions at the base of the obelisk. The mentions of the King and his Ministers were deleted during the French Revolution. After this first attempt, Languet de Gergy resumed the project in 1742, this time with the objective of properly defining the Easter Equinox.Roug√©, pp.10-14 The task was given to Pierre-Charles Le Monnier, member of the French Academy of Sciences. equinoctial marker The inscription at the base of the obelisk mentions Charles Claude Le Monnier, as well as the mission of the gnomon in Latin: \\"Ad Certam Paschalis √Üquinoctii Explorationem\\" (\\"To determine precisely the Paschal Equinox\\"). The dating of Easter was modeled on that of the Jewish Passover, which marks the liberation of the Jews from Egypt and which traditionally falls in the Jewish lunar calendar on the 14th of the month of Nisan, the day of the first full moon after the vernal (spring) equinox. Roman Christians however had a twelve-month calendar, first the Julian calendar until 1582, and then the Gregorian calendar. Since the Council of Nicaea in 325, the Western Church had required that Easter be celebrated on the Sunday on or after the full moon following March 21, which at that time corresponded indeed to the vernal equinox. The Julian calendar being imprecise however, by the 16th century March 21 fell about 10 days after the vernal equinox, a problem that was solved by the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. (The Eastern Christian Church continues to date Easter by the Julian calendar.) Languet de Gergy, however, wished to verify independently the exact date of the vernal equinox through the gnomon in order to ascertain the date of Easter. Obliquity of the ecliptic The plaque at the southern end of the meridian, mentioning the work on the obliquity of the ecliptic Le Monnier further used the gnomon from 1744 to establish the variations of the ecliptic, or the variations in the obliquity of the Earth's axis. The endeavor is recorded on the plaque at the southern end of the meridian, in the South transept: \\"Pro nutatione axios terren. obliquitate eclipticae\\" (\\"for the nutation of the earth's axis and the obliquity of the ecliptic\\"). As mentioned on a brass plaque that covered the stone plaque, the obliquity of the ecliptic was 23¬∞28'40\\".69 in 1744. From 1745 to 1791, Le Monnier visited Saint-Suplice at each summer solstice and, focusing the light with a lens fixed to the opening in the stained-glass window so as to produce a sharp image of the sun on the floor, noted the exact position of the image at noon. From these observations, he calculated a variation of the obliquity of 45\\" per century (the exact figure is 46\\".85 per century). Perihelion The gnomon also permitted the determination of the date of the earth's perihelion (the moment the earth is closest to the sun in its elliptical trajectory around the sun), by measuring the size of the image of the sun cast on the obelisk and finding the time when it was largest. Perihelion occurs close to the winter solstice, during the period of the year when the sun's image at noon is on the obelisk, rather than on the floor of the church. Interpretations The obelisk (in the background), the meridian brass line on the floor, and the southern plaque Some interpretations of the gnomon at Saint-Sulpice give it an occult meaning. The author Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code describes it as \\"a pagan astronomical instrument (...) an ancient sundial of sorts, vestige of the pagan temple that had once stood on this very spot\\", despite an early modern building date of 1714, and the fact that it is an astronomical device with nothing especially pagan about it. Brown also qualifies the obelisk as \\"Egyptian\\" despite its recent date of manufacture in 1743: \\"a most unexpected structure, a colossal Egyptian obelisk\\". He also equates the Saint-Sulpice meridian with the Paris Meridian, although they are different, being several hundred meters apart: \\"Long before the establishment of Greenwhich as the prime meridian, the zero longitude had passed through Paris and through the Church of Saint-Sulpice\\".Roug√©, pp.15-19 The building of the gnomon inside the Church of Saint-Sulpice occurred at a time when Rome was relaxing its stance against the theories of Galileo Galilei, as his works were being printed in Rome with the agreement of the Holy See, and in 1757 the Pope removed the works of Galileo from the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri A similar gnomon built to calculate the exact date of Easter also exists in the Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome.Wayne Orchiston (editor), The New Astronomy: Opening The Electromagnetic Window and Expanding our View of Planet Earth, pages 302-303 (Springer, 2005).

As Prosecutor for Bergen County, New Jersey, he was indicted on misconduct charges in 1951 but was subsequently acquitted. He was born in Brooklyn, New York to George T. and Agnes T. (Goff) Winne. He grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey and graduated from Hackensack High School in 1906. He attended Rutgers College, graduating in 1910 with a Bachelor of Literature degree. He attended New York Law School and received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1912. Winne was first elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1916 and served for four terms. In 1922 President Warren G. Harding appointed him U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. His tenure was marked by many controversies over the enforcement of Prohibition in the state. He held the post until 1928, when he returned to private practice. He was appointed Bergen County Counsel in 1934 and Prosecutor in 1944. In 1950, he was removed from office as Bergen County Prosecutor by Deputy Attorney General of New Jersey Nelson Stamler, who was conducting an investigation into gambling in the county. He was indicted on 19 counts of misconduct in 1951, with the charges alleging that he had failed to crack down on illegal gambling in Bergen County. U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver, who was holding Senate hearings on organized crime, called law enforcement in Bergen County under Winne \\"a sorry spectacle.\\" One of Winne's attorneys in the trial was Joseph Weintraub, who would later serve as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. Richard J. Hughes, later Governor of New Jersey, presided as New Jersey Superior Court judge, and ruled in the pretrial phase that there was insufficient evidence to bring Winne to trial. The decision was reversed by the State Supreme Court and Winne was ultimately tried. In 1954, Winne was found not guilty on 16 counts of the indictment, and the state dropped the remaining counts. He attempted to recoup $34,000 in lost salary for the three years that he was removed from office, but he lost his case in a 5-2 decision by the State Supreme Court. Winne continued in private legal practice until his retirement in 1963. He died at the age of 83 at the Van Dyke Nursing Home in Montclair, New Jersey and was to be interred at Hackensack Cemetery.

Biography Michiel van Musscher was born in Rotterdam in January 1645 and was later baptized on 27 January. According to Houbraken, he showed a talent for drawing at a young age, and had many teachers, of which he kept a record. His first teacher was Martinus Saeghmolen in 1660 for two months, and in 1661, he took lessons from Abraham van den Tempel. In 1665 he took seven lessons with Gabriel Metsu, and in 1667 he spent three months in Haarlem to take lessons with Adriaen van Ostade. Though his entire education spanned several years, Houbraken was astonished that he became so skilled with so few hours of professional study, and concludes that he must have had a great natural talent that he practiced extensively on his own. Houbraken wrote that he moved to Amsterdam to work for Jonas Witsen, a wealthy artlover who introduced him to all of his friends as a portrait painter.

Its demolition has been regarded as an \\"architectural crime\\" and an example of \\"Brusselization\\". Building Victor Horta was commissioned by the Belgian Workers' Party to build a grandiose people's house on Emile Vandervelde Square in central Brussels. He was assisted in this project by Richard Pringiers, who was to become the appointed architect of the party. left In spite of a rather restrictive and irregular plot, along a circular square and on a slope, Horta succeeded to construct a 4-storey building with maximum functionality. It provided space for all kinds of socio-economic facilities; the ground floor was made of shops and a caf√©- restaurant; the first floor included the Party's offices and meeting rooms, as well as a library; the second and third floors welcomed various multi-purpose rooms; and the fourth floor was home to a large auditorium and concert hall seating over 2,000 people. Unlike Horta's houses, the decoration was kept to a minimum, as it was a purely functional building, mainly constructed in white cast iron (more than ) with curtain walls. Fifteen craftsmen worked for eighteen months on the ironwork. The only strikingly recognisable Art Nouveau features of the facade were the balustrades with curling lines, as well as a slight curving of the steel pillars supporting the roof. On the roof, the building was decorated with signs bearing the names of people who contributed to the socialist cause, such as Karl Marx and Leon Blum. As with Horta's houses, however, the building was designed to make a maximum use of light, with large skylights over the main meeting room. To make this construction possible, Horta drew no less than of plans. The building was completed in 1899 and was inaugurated in the presence of the French socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s. Because of the experimental combination of brick, glass, and steel, it was considered as a masterwork of modern architecture. File:Maison du Peuple of the P.O.B.

It was dismantled entirely with the idea of rebuilding it elsewhere. However, its components were scattered in vacant lots around Brussels, and it was never reconstructed. Later, structural parts of the building were used in the Horta Grand Caf√© in Antwerp and some of the original pieces can still be found in the Horta premetro station in Saint-Gilles. The loss of the Maison du Peuple was part of the trend of Brusselization, where many historic buildings were torn down and replaced by skyscrapers. The Maison du Peuple itself was replaced by a 26-floor office building, the Blaton Tower, built the year immediately after the Maison du Peuple's demolition. alt= Virtual Reconstruction Since 2014, a scientific team of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and the Horta Museum is virtually rebuilding parts of the Maison du Peuple: the entrance hall, the caf√©, the staircase, the concert hall, the Matteoti hall and the surroundings. The first results can be seen in the Horta Museum: a photorealistic 8 minutes movie and a tablet app with navigatable 360¬∞ renderings.Inauguration de la reconstitution virtuelle de la Maison du Peuple de Victor Horta See also * Art Nouveau in Brussels * Vooruit, a similar building in Ghent, built for the city's co-operative movement.

History  During the 1874 westward trek of the North-West Mounted Police, the force established its first camp (called Short Creek Camp) at this location. The community began being served by the SOO Line in 1893, permitting the coal mines in the region to become operational. Roche Perc√©e incorporated as a village on January 12, 1909. In 2010, the provincial government signed an agreement with Southeast Tour & Trails Inc. to restore Roche Perc√©e Park after being closed for over a decade. In 2011, flooding on the Souris River inundated the village, forcing its residents to evacuate. 28 of the 64 homes in Roche Percee were damaged beyond repair, and had to be demolished. ;Historical properties Roche Perc√©e Provincial Historic Site is located nearby.

Ruthilda is located about 5 km south of Highway 51 approximately 30 km southwest of the Town of Biggar The name is a blend of Ruth and Hilda, daughters of H. Alex Goodwin, an early settler.  Demographics  In 2006, Ruthilda had a population of 5 living in 3 dwellings, a 75.0% decrease from 2001. The village has a land area of and a population density of .  History  The first homesteaders arrived in the district as early as1 905. Among the first to settle in the district were Charles Fraser, Harry Hobbs, James Bowden, Harry Hannah, Bert Pugh, Tom Veitch and son Guy; George and Edward Goldie, J. Sanders and sons, John Nyquist and sons, and Alex Scott. In 1910 a site for a railway station and town site was surveyed. The village was given its name after the two daughters of Alex Goodwin, Ruth and Hilda. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway built the grade for the track in 1911; in 1912 the rails were laid and the Ruthilda train station was built. A post office was officially established on November 1, 1912. Other businesses soon followed. Construction continued through 1914 when the Ruthilda school was built. That same year, two new grain elevators were erected. On February 3, 1921 the village of Ruthilda was incorporated. A couple of years later, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool erected a third grain elevator. Despite the community‚Äôs small size, in 1925 it fielded one of the province‚Äôs most formidable baseball teams. A United Church was built in 1928 to give parishioners who had previously worshipped in a variety of places, including; private homes, the lumberyard, the school and the community hall. A second church, Glad Tidings Gospel, was open from 1936 until it closed in 1956. Several fires tore through Ruthilda over the years - in 1926, 1936, 1951 and 1959. Despite reaching a peak population of 114 in 1931, the end was already in site for the community. In 1947, one of the grain elevators was dismantled. The town still had two grain elevators in operation in the late 1970s; however the rail line was abandoned in the mid 1980s. Today, there are no elevators in Ruthilda. The Ruthilda school was closed in 1964. Children were bused to the nearby community of Plenty, Saskatchewan. Population decline soon followed. In 1966 the community boasted 85 residents, however, by 1971 that number had fallen to 48. Business closures quickly followed. Today, there are only five residents and no businesses left in the community.  Spring Water Hutterite Colony  The Spring Water Hutterite Colony was founded in 1982 near Ruthilda as a division from the Valley View Hutterite Colony in Linden, Alberta.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It is locally significant as a physical reflection of its residential architecture and the historic development of the city from its agricultural beginnings through its industrial era and current status as a small suburban city. The buildings within the district represent the wide range of architectural styles and plans popular in the city and the state of Utah between 1870 and 1954 and retain a high degree of integrity. Description The buildings are significant because they are the best depiction of the historical development of the historic central downtown residential section of Murray, and contain a high concentration of historical resources. South State Street (US-89) was the business center of Murray from the 1880s until the 1950s and many of the retail merchants, professionals and business people lived just blocks from their places of business on State Street. The variety of architectural styles in the historic district represent most of the historical eras of Murray and the majority of the buildings serve as good examples of their intended style. The district area is the most historically intact residential section of Murray. The buildings are concentrated in a compact area with little infill and maintain a cohesive historic streetscape. Soon after settlers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came into the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, families began to settle to the south around the streams. The area now incorporated as the City of Murray was part of the land to the south of Salt Lake City known as South Cottonwood. Unlike the Salt Lake City example to the north, development in Murray was not based on the Plat for the City of Zion plan (with settlement in a grid pattern around a town square). Early settlement was distributed with families living on their agricultural lands on the sides of Big Cottonwood Creek and Little Cottonwood Creek. Farming was self-sufficient, primarily raising grain to support the family and the livestock. The Atwood family historic brickyard, located to the south of Vine Street, where the ballpark in the Murray City Park is currently found, most likely provided the bricks for many of the early public buildings and residences in the historic district. Early architecture from this period would have been simple vernacular Classical examples. However, no structures from this era are known to exist in the historic district. The residents of the Murray Downtown Residential Historic District in this era were retail merchants, small businessmen, civic leaders, service workers, and professionals who lived with their families close to their businesses or offices on State or Vine Streets. An early commercial center grew up at the intersection of State and Vine Streets, the major north-south and east-west thoroughfares surrounding the historic district. A few residents had their businesses located at their houses. Donald O. Wilson was a broom maker at 4911 Center Street and Katie Wilson was a nurse at 4873 Wasatch.R.L. Folk's Utah State Gazetteer and Business Directory, 1922-23,135-6. Thomas Martin opened his general merchandise store on State Street in 1914, close to his residence at 187 East 4800 South. Chester P. Cahoon of the Salt Lake Pressed Brick Company lived directly east at 183 East 4800 South. The Brinton family, owners of Brinton Electric Company, a dealer in retail electrical appliances from 1922, lived at 433 East Vine Street. Nearby Ernest and Eugenia M. Madsen, proprietors of the family store Madsen Hardware and Furniture, lived on 401 East Vine Street. Charles Caldwell, Jr., built a house for his family at 5000 Glen Street, and opened \\"The Palace Market\\" at 4800 South and State Street. Heber B. Smith was Secretary of the Miller-Cahoon Implement Company before he opened Smith's Hardware on the southwest corner of 4800 South and State Street. He lived with his wife, Fern Smith, at the house he built in 1912 at 195 East 4800 South. Medical professionals and educators also chose this area to live and raise their families. Dr. Herond Nishan Sheranian lived at 259 East 4800 South from 1922‚Äì1933, just blocks from his Murray Hospital Clinic founded in 1927. He emigrated with his family as a child from Turkey in 1902 and worked briefly in a Murray smelter to help with medical school expenses. A chiropractor, Dr. G. H. Pace, lived nearby at 389 East 4800 South. Dr. Frank McHugh who treated Industrial Workers of the World activist Joe Hill for his gunshot wound and surrendered him to police also lived near the district. Elmo E. Boggess was a school principal and lived with his wife, Mary Ann, at 271 East 4800 South. The superintendent of schools for Murray from 1912‚Äì1928, Carl E. Gaufm emigrated with his family from Sweden as a child and graduated from the University of Utah in 1896. He was known for establishing the first high school in Murray and lived with his wife, Rhoda, at 218 East Vine Street. After his death his widow housed schoolteachers who were living there to meet the residence requirement for Murray teachers. The locally renowned musician Morris Cannegeiter who directed the Olympus Male Choir lived at 398 East Vine Street. Politicians, including two mayors and a judge built houses in the district. Charles Brown was mayor of Murray from 1906‚Äì09 and lived at 215 East 4800 South. He operated the Buster Brown store and later the Palace Meat Market. George Huscher was the first Socialist mayor of Murray from 1912‚Äì1915 and lived with his wife, Elizabeth, across the street at 264 East 4800 South. Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice David W. Moffat built the brick four-square in 1908 at 288 East Vine Street. He was an attorney and later judge for the Utah Supreme Court. His wife, Sarah Howe Moffat, helped to establish the Murray library and served on the Murray Board of Education. Three churches remain from this era in the historic district, and in all cases the original congregation has changed. The first church built, the LDS Murray First Ward Meetinghouse, is evidence of the LDS population found at that time in Murray. It was built in 1907 at 184 East Vine Street. It was heavily used and enlarged in 1928. It has been occupied since the 1970s by the Mount Vernon Academy, a non-denominational school for pre-kindergarten to grade 12 children. The other two churches were built by other religious groups, showing Murray's early relatively cosmopolitan nature due to the diverse population drawn to employment in the smelters. They are both still used for worship. The St. Vincent de Paul's Catholic Church was built in 1927 at 4900 Wasatch Street and is now owned by the Maronite Catholic Church Bishop of the Diocese of St. Maron. The Methodist Episcopal Church at 171 E. 4800 South was built c. 1915 and is now a Quaker Church. The wartime and postwar need for housing also led to remodeling single family houses to create apartment spaces. The 1908 two- story foursquare (box) at 4928 Wasatch was shared with officers needing housing from the Kearns Army Air Base during the war and in 1950 was converted into two apartments. An external closed stairway to the second floor was added to the c. 1895 Victorian Eclectic cross-wing house at 205 East Vine Street during a conversion of the single-family house to apartments in 1951.

He returns to his hometown, Broken Bow, and sweetheart Nancy Warren (Martha Hyer), to set up a blacksmith business. At the bank he sees one of the Hole in the Wall gang casing the joint. He warns the sheriff that he believes the gang will attempt a robbery that night. The sheriff arranges with the bank to move all the money to the jailhouse, but one of the gang sees them. That night Butch Cassidy (Gene Evans) and the gang raid the jailhouse, but two of them are killed and the raid fails. However, Brady is implicated in the robbery attempt and escapes town with the aid of Charlie Veer (Douglas Kennedy). Veer wants to join up with the Hole in the Wall gang and persuades Brady to take him to Cassidy's hideout, \\"The Hole in the Wall\\". Some of the gang want to lynch Brady, but Cassidy agrees to take him back. Veer divulges that the bank is planning to move the money out by train the following night. Cassidy plans to rob the train. Veer turns out to be a Pinkerton agent and goes to the telegraph office at Broken Bow to send a message to the agency to put a posse on the train. However, Cassidy is one step ahead and had already got to the telegraph operator and forces him to send a bogus message. Cassidy then kills the telegraph operator. Meanwhile Brady, having second thoughts about returning to a life of crime, attempts to stop the robbery. Veer admits to Brady that he is a Pinkerton agent and still believes there will be a posse on the train. The robbery goes ahead, but there is neither posse nor money on the train. Cassidy kills Veer and takes Nancy hostage. Brady tries to escape with Nancy, but both are recaptured by Cassidy. Believing the money is still at the bank in Broken Bow, Cassidy plans another raid. But knowing the sheriff will be waiting with a posse, he persuades Nancy to send the sheriff off on the wrong trail, or he will kill Brady. She agrees and the sheriff and his men ride out of town. Cassidy and the gang raid the town, but Nancy has mustered the womenfolk and the robbery fails. Most of the gang are killed and Cassidy is captured. Brady and Nancy are re-united.

It was incorporated on September 16, 1939 for the employees of Nashua Gummed and Coated Paper Company, now known as Nashua Corporation. The purpose of organizing the credit union was to allow both office and mill employees the opportunity to save money and obtain small loans at rates substantially lower than the banks or other savings and loan institutions. When the credit union opened for business, the office was located directly above the Traffic Department of Nashua Corporation on Franklin Street in Nashua.Cypher,Bob.(2008-03-05).\\"Triangle Credit Union - Offers a better way to ‚ÄúBank‚Äù .Nashua Telegraph.Retrieved 2009-11-18. The credit union continued to flourish with steady increases in assets and membership. As World War II escalated, the credit union experienced little growth, since buying war bonds became predominant. However, as the national economy grew, more and more people found a need to save for the future. The credit union showed visible signs of growth during 1944-45. As the veterans returned from World War II to Nashua Corporation in 1946, the board of directors voted to waive interest on all military loans. This meant that interest on loans procured by veterans before the war, from the time they entered the armed forces until they were released, would not have to be paid. At the 21st Annual Meeting in January 1960, the board of directors became affiliated with the New Hampshire Credit Union League. In November 1960, the board adopted the policy of ‚ÄúOnce a Member, Always a Member‚Äù with no limitations. Between the years 1967 and 1969, the credit union experienced tremendous financial and membership growth. This sudden surge prompted the board of directors to seek new quarters. On November 11, 1967, TFCU purchased the land and tenement house at 31-33 Franklin Street. The credit union erected a new one-story brick office building with adjoining parking lot, which was dedicated in September 1968. As part of the celebration, the credit union honored original officers and charter members. The bylaws were amended in 1968 to include members of the immediate families and employees of other Nashua Corporation facilities outside the state of New Hampshire. In November 1996, Triangle Federal Credit Union applied for a state charter. TFCU held the distinction of being the first federal credit union to change its charter as a result of the court action taken by the American Bankers Association against federal credit unions. A motion was made and seconded by the board of directors, sanctioned by the membership, to change from Triangle Federal Credit Union to Triangle Credit Union. The State of New Hampshire Banking Department awarded Triangle Credit Union with a state chartered community credit union status on January 1, 1997. The credit union's field of membership extends to any individual residing within a 25-mile radius of any of TCU branch.

She was an influential leader in the Arts and Crafts movement, not only for her stained glass work and successful studio-workshop, but also for opening doors for other women stained glass artists. She was an active participant in the suffragette movement, acting as Chair of the Artists' Suffrage League, and creating poster art to assist the movement. Early life and work St Andrew, alt= Lowndes was born in 1857, the daughter of the rector of St Mary's Church, Sturminster Newton in Dorset. She received her art training at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. When Lowndes completed her art classes, she became an assistant to prominent stained glass designer, Henry Holiday. She worked at his studio-workshop where she drew cartoons (designs) for stained glass commissions. While working for Holiday, Lowndes taught herself the techniques of stained glass. The first window she painted was a two-light window titled \\"Feed my sheep\\", completed in 1893 for St. Peter's church, Hinton St. Mary, Dorset. Lowndes lived and worked in Chelsea, where she had her own studio to work on designs, but there was no workshop nearby to complete her stained glass work. She would travel to Southwark, to the Britten and Gilson studio-workshop, where she would select the coloured glass for her commissions, paint the glass and supervise the firing and glazing of the windows. Lowdes worked as a stained glass designer for James Powell & Sons from 1887 to 1892. Lowndes was one of the first women to work professionally in stained glass in the 1890s. \\"Women, generally amateurs, might occasionally design windows and even take some part in their execution, but they rarely if ever practiced the whole art independently as a full time professional occupation\\". Lowndes and Drury alt= While working at the Britten and Gilson workshop, Lowndes met renowned stained glass artist Christopher Whall. Lowndes admired his innovative stained glass, and her early work shows his artistic influence. In 1897, with the encouragement of Whall, Lowndes established her own studio-workshop with Alfred J. Drury. Drury was the foreman at the Britten and Gilson workshop, and co-instructor of stained glass with Whall at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. The new studio-workshop in Chelsea was named Lowndes and Drury. The venture developed out of Lowndes and Drury's shared experience of working for a big studio, and they created their new enterprise to meet the needs of the new school of independent artists associated with the emerging Arts and Crafts movement. The studio- workshop would provide the technical facilities to allow artists to work on all stages of their stained glass commissions, from design to glass selection, painting and glazing. Holy Innocents Church, alt= The partnership was established with an initial investment of ¬£30 from each partner. Lowndes also provided a ¬£200 loan and additional loans of ¬£280 came from Lowndes's companion, Barbara Forbes, her aunt, Miss Alice Vivian Kaye and friend, Miss J.F. Pearson. Along with Drury's small investment, the new firm was financed in its early years by these four women. Lowndes managed the new business with Drury, but chose not to be chief designer of the workshop. Like other workshop clients, she primarily used the facilities to work on her own stained glass commissions. Her stained glass was highly regarded and in great demand at the time, and her work can be seen in parish churches throughout England and Wales. In 1906, with the need for bigger facilities, Lowndes and Drury founded the Glass House in Lettice Street, Fulham. The building at 9, 10, 11 and 12 Lettice Street was established as a stained glass studio for works commissioned by Lowndes and Drury and for use by independent artists. It was a purpose-built stained glass studio and workshop, designed by Christopher Whall and Drury. The Glass House attracted many artists, including Wilhelmina Geddes and Robert Anning Bell.

In 1899, she attended the International Congress of Women in London. In January 1907, Lowndes established The Artists' Suffrage League (ASL) to create dramatic posters, postcards, Christmas cards, and banners for suffrage events. She became its chair and Barbara Forbes, her companion, was the secretary.Lisa Tickner \\"Banners and Banner-Making\\". In Vanessa R. Schwartz and Jeannene M. Przyblyski, \\"The Nineteenth Century Visual Culture Reader\\". Routledge, 2004, London and New York. Lowndes' banner celebrating prison reformer alt= Between 1903 and 1914, the methods used by the women's suffrage movement began to change and they began to engage in public demonstrations and other propaganda activities. Lowndes' training as an artist and stained-glass designer encouraged the use of bold shapes and a love of full, rich colours, using striking combinations of green and blue, magenta and orange. She wrote a guide in 1910 to help women create their own Banners and Banner-Making, saying of the suffrage banners: \\"you do not want to read it, you want to worship it. Choose purple and gold for ambition, red for courage, green for long-cherished hopes ... It is a declaration.\\" Such banners were designed with female images like flowers, lit lamps, shells, sunrays, winged hearts; and to honour female heroines like Boadicea, Elizabeth Fry, Florence Nightingale, Marie Curie, Josephine Butler, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Bront√´ and even 'Victoria, Queen and Mother'. These were carried in their hundreds or thousands in London's Pageant of Great Women 1909, Hyde Park Rally 1910, From Prison to Citizenship 1911, Pilgrimage for Women's Suffrage 1913, and later that year at the grand funeral procession of Emily Wilding Davison, the suffrage movement's martyr who threw herself under the King's horse at the Epsom Derby. An album of Lowndes' original banner designs (detailed on paper in watercolour and often accompanied by fabric swatches) resides at the Women's Library at the London School of Economics. Lowndes was also personally active in the national Suffragette movement, including her leadership of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies executive committee.Lago, Mary. (1995). Christiana Herringham and the Edwardian Art Scene. University of Missouri Press. p. 287 She was a member of the committee of the feminist magazine The Englishwoman's Review and contributed regularly to it. Personal life Lowndes' lifelong companion was Barbara Forbes, the secretary of the Artists' Suffrage League founded by Lowndes. Throughout her life, Lowndes suffered from chronic asthma. Lowndes died in 1929 and was buried in Buxted, East Sussex, England. She left Forbes a sum of money, all her pictures, prints, cartoons, studio effects and her shares in The Englishwoman Ltd.

It was introduced by R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1952. Formally, a subset of the vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in J} of a Banach space X, sometimes called a \\"system\\", is complete if every element in X can be approximated arbitrarily well in norm by finite linear combinations of elements in \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in J}.C. Heil, A Basis Theory Primer: Expanded Edition. Boston, MA: Birkhauser, 2010. Such a complete system is overcomplete if removal of a \\\\phi_j from the system results in a system (i.e., \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in J\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\}}) that is still complete. In research areas such as signal processing and function approximation, overcompleteness can help researchers to achieve a more stable, more robust, or more compact decomposition than using a basis.R. Balan, P. Casazza, C. Heil, and Z. Landau, Density, overcompleteness, and localization of frames. I. theory, The Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006. Relation between overcompleteness and frames Overcompleteness is usually discussed as a property of overcomplete frames. The theory of frame originates in a paper by Duffin and Schaeffer on non-harmonic Fourier series.R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer, A class of nonharmonic Fourier series, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 72, no. 2, pp. 341{366, 1952. [Online]. Available: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1990760 The frame is defined to be a set of non- zero vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in J} such that for an arbitrary f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}, : A\\\\f\\\\^2\\\\leq\\\\sum_{i\\\\in J}\\\\langle f, \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle^2\\\\leq B\\\\f\\\\^2 where \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle denotes the inner product, A and B are positive constants called bounds of the frame. When A and B can be chosen such that A=B, the frame is called a tight frame.K. Grochenig, Foundations of time- frequency analysis. Boston, MA: Birkhauser, 2000. It can be seen that \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\operatorname{span}\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}. An example of frame can be given as follows. Let each of \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} be an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathcal{H}, then : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} is a frame of \\\\mathcal{H} with bounds A=B=2. Let S be the frame operator, : Sf=\\\\sum_{i\\\\in J}\\\\langle f, \\\\phi_i \\\\rangle\\\\phi_i A frame that is not a Riesz basis, in which case it consists of a set of functions more than a basis, is said to be overcomplete. In this case, given f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}, it can have different decompositions based on the frame. The frame given in the example above is an overcomplete frame. When frames are used for function estimation, one may want to compare the performance of different frames. The parsimony of the approximating functions by different frames may be considered as one way to compare their performances., STA218, Data Mining Class Note at Duke University Given a tolerance \\\\epsilon and a frame F=\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in J} in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}), for any function f\\\\in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}), define the set of all approximating functions that satisfy \\\\f-\\\\hat{f}\\\\<\\\\epsilon : N(f,\\\\epsilon)=\\\\\\\\{\\\\hat{f}: \\\\hat{f}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\\\beta_i\\\\phi_i, \\\\f-\\\\hat{f}\\\\<\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\} Then let : k_{F}(f,\\\\epsilon)=\\\\inf\\\\\\\\{k: \\\\hat{f}\\\\in N(f,\\\\epsilon)\\\\\\\\} k(f,\\\\epsilon) indicates the parsimony of utilizing frame F to approximate f. Different f may have different k based on the hardness to be approximated with elements in the frame. The worst case to estimate a function in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}) is defined as : k_F (\\\\epsilon)=\\\\sup_{f\\\\in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R})}\\\\\\\\{k_{F}(f,\\\\epsilon)\\\\\\\\} For another frame G, if k_{F}(\\\\epsilon), then frame F is better than frame G at level \\\\epsilon. And if there exists a \\\\gamma that for each \\\\epsilon<\\\\gamma, we have k_{F}(\\\\epsilon), then F is better than G broadly. Overcomplete frames are usually constructed in three ways. # Combine a set of bases, such as wavelet basis and Fourier basis, to obtain an overcomplete frame. # Enlarge the range of parameters in some frame, such as in Gabor frame and wavelet frame, to have an overcomplete frame. # Add some other functions to an existing complete basis to achieve an overcomplete frame. An example of an overcomplete frame is shown below. The collected data is in a two-dimensional space, and in this case a basis with two elements should be able to explain all the data. However, when noise is included in the data, a basis may not be able to express the properties of the data. If an overcomplete frame with four elements corresponding to the four axes in the figure is used to express the data, each point would be able to have a good expression by the overcomplete frame. Image:OvercompleteframeGuoxian.jpgAn example of an overcomplete frame The flexibility of the overcomplete frame is one of its key advantages when used in expressing a signal or approximating a function. However, because of this redundancy, a function can have multiple expressions under an overcomplete frame.M. S. Lewicki and T. J. Sejnowski, Learning overcomplete representations, Neural Computation, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 337{365, 2000. When the frame is finite, the decomposition can be expressed as : f=Ax where f is the function one wants to approximate, A is the matrix containing all the elements in the frame, and x is the coefficients of f under the representation of A. Without any other constraint, the frame will choose to give x with minimal norm in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}). Based on this, some other properties may also be considered when solving the equation, such as sparsity. So different researchers have been working on solving this equation by adding other constraints in the objective function. For example, a constraint minimizing x's norm in L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}) may be used in solving this equation. This should be equivalent to the Lasso regression in statistics community. Bayesian approach is also used to eliminate the redundancy in an overcomplete frame. Lweicki and Sejnowski proposed an algorithm for overcomplete frame by viewing it as a probabilistic model of the observed data. Recently, the overcomplete Gabor frame has been combined with bayesian variable selection method to achieve both small norm expansion coefficients in L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}) and sparsity in elements.P. Wolfe, S. Godsill, and W. Ng, Bayesian variable selection and regularization for time-frequency surface estimation, J. R. Statist. Soc. B, vol. 66, no. 3, 2004. Examples of overcomplete frames In modern analysis in signal processing and other engineering field, various overcomplete frames are proposed and used. Here two common used frames, Gabor frames and wavelet frames, are introduced and discussed. Gabor frames In usual Fourier transformation, the function in time domain is transformed to the frequency domain. However, the transformation only shows the frequency property of this function and loses its information in the time domain. If a window function g, which only has nonzero value in a small interval, is multiplied with the original function before operating the Fourier transformation, both the information in time and frequency domains may remain at the chosen interval. When a sequence of translation of g is used in the transformation, the information of the function in time domain are kept after the transformation. Let operators : T_a: L^2(R)\\\\rightarrow L^2(R), (T_af)(x)=f(x-a) : E_b: L^2(R)\\\\rightarrow L^2(R), (E_bf)(x)=e^{2\\\\pi ibx}f(x) : D_c: L^2(R)\\\\rightarrow L^2(R), (D_cf)(x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt c}f\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{c}\\\\right) A Gabor frame (named after Dennis Gabor and also called Weyl-Heisenberg frame) in L^2(R) is defined as the form \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_ {na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z}, where a,b>0 and g\\\\in L^2(R) is a fixed function.O. Christensen, An Introduction to Frames and Riesz Bases. Boston, MA: Birkhauser, 2003. However, not for every a and b \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} forms a frame on L^2(R). For example, when ab>1, it is not a frame for L^2(R). When ab=1, \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} is possible to be a frame, in which case it is a Riesz basis. So the possible situation for \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} being an overcomplete frame is ab<1. The Gabor family \\\\\\\\{E_{mb/c}T_{nac}g_c\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} is also a frame and sharing the same frame bounds as \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z}. Different kinds of window function g may be used in Gabor frame. Here examples of three window functions are shown, and the condition for the corresponding Gabor system being a frame is shown as follows. Image:WindowfunctionsGuoxian.jpgThree window functions used in Gabor frame generation. (1) g(x)=e^{-x^2}, \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} is a frame when ab<0.994 (2) g(x)=\\\\frac{1}{cosh(\\\\pi x)}, \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} is a frame when ab<1 (3) g(x)=I_{[0,c)}(x), where I(x) is the indicator function. The situation for \\\\\\\\{E_{mb}T_{na}g\\\\\\\\}_{m,n\\\\in Z} to be a frame stands as follows. 1) a>c or a>1, not a frame 2) c>1 and a=1, not a frame 3) a\\\\leq c\\\\leq1, is a frame 4) a<1 and is an irrational, and c\\\\in(1,2), is a frame 5) a=\\\\frac{p}{q}<1, p and q are relatively primes, 2-\\\\frac{1}{q} , not a frame 6) \\\\frac{3}{4} and c=L-1+L(1-a), where L\\\\geq 3 and be a natural number, not a frame 7) a<1, c>1, c-[c]-\\\\frac{1}{2}<\\\\frac{1}{2}-a, where [c] is the biggest integer not exceeding c, is a frame. The above discussion is a summary of chapter 8 in. Wavelet frames A collection of wavelet usually refers to a set of functions based on \\\\psi : \\\\\\\\{2^\\\\frac{j}{2}\\\\psi(2^jx-k)\\\\\\\\}_{j,k\\\\in Z} This forms an orthonormal basis for L^2(R). However, when j,k can take values in R, the set represents an overcomplete frame and called undecimated wavelet basis. In general case, a wavelet frame is defined as a frame for L^2(R) of the form : \\\\\\\\{a^\\\\frac{j}{2}\\\\psi(a^jx-kb)\\\\\\\\}_{j,k\\\\in Z} where a>1, b>0, and \\\\psi\\\\in L^2(R). The upper and lower bound of this frame can be computed as follows. Let \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(\\\\gamma) be the Fourier transform for \\\\psi\\\\in L^1(R) : \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(\\\\gamma)=\\\\int_{R}\\\\psi(x)e^{-2\\\\pi ix\\\\gamma}dx When a,b are fixed, define : G_0(\\\\gamma)=\\\\sum_{j\\\\in Z} \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(a^j\\\\gamma)^2 : G_1(\\\\gamma)=\\\\sum_{k eq0}\\\\sum_{j\\\\in Z} \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(a^j\\\\gamma)\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(a^j\\\\gamma+\\\\frac{k}{b}) Then : B=\\\\frac{1}{b}\\\\sup_{\\\\gamma\\\\in[1,a]}(G_0(\\\\gamma)+G_1(\\\\gamma))<\\\\infty : A=\\\\frac{1}{b}\\\\inf_{\\\\gamma\\\\in[1,a]}(G_0(\\\\gamma)-G_1(\\\\gamma))>0 Furthermore, when : \\\\sum_{j\\\\in Z}\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(2^j\\\\gamma)^2=A : \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(2^j\\\\gamma)\\\\overline{\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(2^j(\\\\gamma+q))}=0, for all odd integers q the generated frame \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_{j,k}\\\\\\\\}_{j,k\\\\in Z} is a tight frame. The discussion in this section is based on chapter 11 in. Applications Overcomplete Gabor frames and Wavelet frames have been used in various research area including signal detection, image representation, object recognition, noise reduction, sampling theory, operator theory, harmonic analysis, nonlinear sparse approximation, pseudodifferential operators, wireless communications, geophysics, quantum computing, and filter banks.

Subtropical plants dominate the Gran Chaco in the north, with the Dalbergia genus of trees well represented by Brazilian rosewood and the quebracho tree; also predominant are white and black algarrobo trees (Prosopis alba and Prosopis nigra). Savannah-like areas exist in the drier regions nearer the Andes. Aquatic plants thrive in the wetlands of Argentina. In central Argentina the humid pampas are a true tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The original pampa had virtually no trees; some imported species like the American sycamore or eucalyptus are present along roads or in towns and country estates (estancias). The only tree-like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen Omb√∫. The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black color, primarily mollisols, known commonly as humus. This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth; however, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial agriculture. The western pampas receive less rainfall, this dry pampa is a plain of short grasses or steppe. Most of Patagonia lies within the rain shadow of the Andes, so the flora, shrubby bushes and plants, is suited to dry conditions. The soil is hard and rocky, making large-scale farming impossible except along river valleys. Coniferous forests in far western Patagonia and on the island of Tierra del Fuego, include alerce, cipr√©s de la cordillera, cipr√©s de las guaitecas, huililahu√°n, lleuque, ma√±√≠o hembra and pehu√©n, while broadleaf trees include several species of Nothofagus such as coihue, lenga and √±ire. Other introduced trees present in forestry plantations include spruce, cypress and pine. Common plants are the copihue and colihue. In Cuyo, semiarid thorny bushes and other xerophile plants abound. Along the many rivers grasses and trees grow in significant numbers. The area presents optimal conditions for the large scale growth of grape vines. In northwest Argentina there are many species of cactus. No vegetation grows in the highest elevations (above ) because of the extreme altitude. Many species live in the subtropical north. Prominent animals include big cats like the jaguar and puma; primates (howler monkey); large reptiles (crocodiles), the Argentine black and white tegu and a species of caiman. Other animals include the tapir, peccary, capybara, bush dog, and various species of turtle and tortoise. There are a wide variety of birds, notably hummingbirds, flamingos, toucans, and swallows. The central grasslands are populated by the giant anteater, armadillo, pampas cat, maned wolf, mara, cavias, and the rhea (√±and√∫), a large flightless bird. Hawks, falcons, herons, and tinamous (perdiz, Argentine \\"false partridges\\") inhabit the region. There are also pampas deer and pampas foxes. Some of these species extend into Patagonia. The western mountains are home to animals including the llama, guanaco and vicu√±a which are among the most recognizable species of South America. Also in this region are the fox, viscacha, Andean mountain cat, kodkod, and the largest flying bird in the New World, the Andean condor. Southern Argentina is home to the cougar, huemul, pud√∫ (the world's smallest deer), and introduced, non-native wild boar. The coast of Patagonia is rich in animal life: elephant seals, fur seals, sea lions and species of penguin. The far south is populated by cormorants. The territorial waters of Argentina have abundant ocean life; mammals such as dolphins, orcas, and whales like the southern right whale, a major tourist draw for naturalists. Sea fish include sardines, Argentine hakes, dolphinfish, salmon, and sharks; also present are squid and king crab (centolla) in Tierra del Fuego. Rivers and streams in Argentina have many species of trout and the South American golden dorado fish. Well known snake species inhabiting Argentina include boa constrictors and a very venomous pit viper named the yarar√°. The hornero was elected the national bird after a survey in 1928. Environmental issues The largest oil spill in fresh water was caused by a Shell Petroleum tanker in the R√≠o de la Plata, off Magdalena, on January 15, 1999, polluting the environment, drinking water, and local wildlife. The major environmental issues in Argentina are pollution and the loss of agricultural lands. The soil is threatened by erosion, salinization, and deforestation. Air pollution is also a problem due to chemical agents from industrial sources. The water supply is threatened by uncontrolled dumping of pesticides, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. Argentina has a renewable water supply of 276 cubic km. In 2002, some 97% of all city dwellers and over 70% of rural dwellers had access to improved water sources. In 2000, about 12.7% of the land area contained forest and woodland. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), threatened species included 32 types of mammals, 55 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 30 species of amphibian, 12 species of fish, and 42 species of plants. Endangered species in Argentina include the ruddy-headed goose, Argentinean pampas deer, South Andean huemul, puna rhea, tundra peregrine falcon, black-fronted piping guan, glaucous macaw, spectacled caiman, the broad-nosed caiman, Lear's macaw, the guayaquil great green macaw, and the American crocodile. Protected areas In 2003, about 6.6% of the total land area was protected. Argentina has four natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Los Glaciares, Iguazu National Park, Peninsula Valdes, and Ischigualasto/Talampaya National Parks. There are 14 sites designated as Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance.  Government bodies  The principal environmental responsibilities are vested in the Ministry of Public Health and the Environment; the Subsecretariat of Environmental Planning in the Ministry of Transportation and Public Works; and the Subsecretariat of Renewable Natural Resources and Ecology within the Secretariat of State for Agriculture and Livestock.

During the 1960s he was a member of the Park Place Gallery in Soho, New York City, which exhibited many influential and significant artists of the period. He was a leader of the minimalist movement in the 1970s.  Early life  Leo Valledor was born and raised in the Fillmore district of San Francisco. His cousin was San Francisco artist Carlos Villa. From 1953 until 1955, Valledor was a student at the California School of Fine Arts (known currently as San Francisco Art Institute) under auspices of a scholarship.Rinder, Lawrence \\"Everything Pellucid: The Paintings of Leo Valledor\\" Leo Valledor: Selected Works, 2006 However, as art historian Paul J. Karlstrom wrote, \\"Despite a year as a scholarship student at CSFA, Valledor was largely self-taught, but he was gifted and quickly developed a gestural abstract style reflecting the influence of Mark Tobey. In addition to Tobey, his earliest influences were Paul Klee, Arshile Gorky, and Bradley Walker Tomlin.\\"Karlstrom, Paul J. \\"Valledor and Villa: Separate Artistic Roads to Identity\\" Asian American Art: Starting from Here Stanford University Press, 2008. At the age of 19 in 1955 he had his first solo show \\"Compositions\\" at the historical Six Gallery. He showed his \\"Black and Blue Series.\\"Karlstrom, Paul J. \\"Valledor and Villa: Separate Artistic Roads to Identity\\" Asian American Art: Starting from Here Stanford University Press, 2008 When he moved to New York City in 1961 he became a member of the influential Park Place Gallery in SoHo, further delving into his avant garde interests of minimalism and conceptualism. It was considered the first gallery in SoHo, and included artists like Edwin Ruda, Mark di Suvero, Peter Forakis, and Forrest Myers. In New York at the Kaymar Gallery in March and April 1964 Valledor also exhibited with Sol LeWitt and Donald Judd.Humblet, Claudine, La Nouvelle Abstraction Americaine 1950-1970: Troisieme Tome. Neil Williams Estate, 2003 p. 1903 He also had a solo show at the Graham Gallery on Madison Avenue in New York City. In 1968 Valledor left New York returning to San Francisco. He exhibited there at such establishments as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the San Francisco Art Institute.\\"Career\\" Leo Valledor: Selected Works, 2006 He was at the vanguard of the minimalist painting movement in the mid 1970s, and later in the seventies he exhibited at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Daniel Weinberg Gallery, M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Valledor became the Art Exhibition Director and teacher at Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. He was a guest teacher at the University of California, Berkeley. He created a roof mural for the Department of Public Works approved by the San Francisco Arts Commission. He received his first National Endowment for the Arts Artist Fellowship Grant in 1981, and received another grant in 1982. In the eighties he received a California Arts Council artist-in-residence grant in the South of Market community. He also taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. He lived in the city of San Francisco until his death in 1989.\\"Career\\"Leo Valledor: Selected Works, 2006 He was survived by his wife Mary Valledor and his son Rio Valledor.  Reflections on his work: critics and historians  Art critics have placed his work in context with the work of Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, and Leon Polk Smith.http://www.togonongallery.com/artists/artists_leovalledor.html Other art historians, like Frances Colpitt, have found his work to be in relation to Frank Stella. Colpitt states, \\"Less assimilable to Op art experiments of the early 1960s, Valledor's shaped canvases are more reminiscent of Frank Stella's contemporaneous work... But Skeedo (1965) is so quirky and radically shaped that it seems without precedent...\\" Colpitt, Frances \\"Affiliations: Space Explorers\\" p. 64 Art in America, February 2009 Art critic Knute Stiles reviewed Valledor's shows in San Francisco in the 1976: \\"He is one of a dozen modernists who subscribe to one or another of the subgroups of what might be called International Style Geometric abstraction. His work has a classical or pure form-oriented bent, but in the early '60s he emerged as a pioneer of the Minimalism which was to dominate that decade.\\" Stiles, Knute Art in America November, December, 1976 \\"Between Sound & Space: The Paintings of Leo Valledor from 1959-1989\\" Leo Valledor exhibition October 4-November 8, 2008 at the Togonon Gallery Valledor's work explores the juxtapositions of colors and geometric forms as metaphors for the interplay of elements in the natural world, as Lawrence Rinder explains: > We all know that at one time (especially in San Francisco) jazz, abstract > expressionism and what's known as Beat poetry were all part of one culture. > It may be a cliche but it was a powerful reality. One thing helped to > explain the other: one thought, different languages.

In the 1840s Samuel Colt > began experimenting with underwater mines fired by electric current and in > 1842, he blew up an old schooner in the Potomac River from a shore station > five miles away.National Park Service: Torpedo Defense: COAST DEFENSE OF THE > POTOMAC History \\"Torpedoes\\" were in use during the American Civil War when such devices were made famous with the order given by David Farragut at Mobile Bay. After that war similar mines were being contemplated or put into use by other nations. In 1869 the United States Army Corps of Engineers was directed by Secretary of War William Belknap to assume responsibility for torpedoes for coastal defense.Bogart That responsibility continued through the formation of the U.S. Torpedo Service as part of the United States' seacoast defenses. In the United States, modern naval mine development began in 1869 at the Engineer School of Application under Major Henry Larcom Abbot at Willets Point, New York.Berhow, pp. 333-374 Eventually, after calls for \\"rifled cannon\\"Chester A. Authur - Second Annual Message to Congress to cover the torpedo fields became reality, that service and the Corps of Engineers turned over responsibility to the newly formed coast artillery branch in 1901, which became the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps in 1907. The terms \\"mine\\" and \\"torpedo\\" were used interchangeably until modern usage began separating the term with \\"mine\\" applied to static explosive devices and \\"torpedo\\" to self-propelled or \\"locomotive torpedo\\" weapons. Even during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War the interchangeable terms caused confusion.The Use of Mines by the Spanish Navy In Britain, the term 'Submarine Mine' was used. Fixed minefields to defend harbours were the responsibility of the Royal Engineers (RE), which formed special companies of Submarine Miners to maintain them. Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke, Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882‚Äì86, found that he did not have enough Regular Army engineers to man all the minefields being installed so he decided to utilise the part-time soldiers of the Volunteer Force. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country, where the Submarine Miners might be drawn from the Regular RE, the Militia, or the Volunteers.Beckett, pp. 184‚Äì5.Short et al, pp. 1‚Äì4.Westlake, pp. 15‚Äì16. The Submarine Miners were also to the fore in developing searchlights to illuminate the minefields. By 1907 the War Office had decided to hand responsibility for the minefields to the Militia, but several Volunteer units were converted to Electrical Engineer Companies employing their lights for coastal artillery control and, eventually, anti-aircraft defences.Short et al. Operation A controlled mine (at left), with the distribution box that connected it and the other mines in its group to the mine casemate on shore. Unlike naval mines that are dispersed at sea, the controlled mine field location is chosen so that it could be under observation. The exact location of the mines was required so that they could be fired from the mine casemate when a target vessel was plotted by observers to be within the mine's effective range. For this reason the mines were \\"planted\\" in predetermined locations with electrical connection through cables to the firing location. The complex of mines, cables and junction boxes required maintenance. Specialized vessels to undertake the hazards of planting mines and maintaining the electrical cables were used. In the United States a type of vessel termed mine planter was developed, builtArmy Ships - The Ghost Fleet - Coast Artillery Corps Army Mine Planter Service and deployed in 1904. By 1909 more mine planters were under construction and deployment had reached the San Francisco fortifications.The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay These were assisted by smaller vessels. In the last stages of such coastal defenses during the Second World War the U.S. Army Mine Planter Service (USAMPS) mine flotilla usually consisted of two planters, four Distribution Box Boats and a small fleet of yawls and launches.Ft. Miles Army Mine Planters In the Royal Navy controlled mines were often laid alongside anti-submarine indicator loops during both World Wars; the US Navy used a similar strategy in at least World War II.Indicator loops website A dozen specialized vessels known as \\"Indicator Loop Mine Layers\\"‚Äîincluding three Linnet-class minelayers and nine smaller vessels‚Äîmuch like the U.S. mine planters, were built for the Royal Navy immediately before and during WWII. Similarly in Japan four Hashima-class cable layers were built between 1939 and 1941 for mine planting duties.

It was established by the city council to manage prostitution in the city. For a time it was one of the nation's largest vice districts with venues ranging from brothels to gambling halls. The area was officially shut down in 1941 resulting from the mobilization for World War II. The term sporting was a common 19th-century euphemism for gambling and/or prostitution. Many communities around the U.S. used this term; brothels were often referred to as sporting houses. Boundaries The District contained approximately 10 blocks of the city. Its boundary was described as follows in a tourist guide: History Della Moore, one of Fannie Porter's prostitutes, and outlaw Kid Curry During the earlier years of the state, San Antonio was Texas' largest city. One of the city's most important business leaders was Jack Harris, who established the Vaudeville Theater and Saloon in 1872, in what would later become the Sporting District. The saloon, which was the city's first business to utilize the fledgeling Electric Company in 1882, quickly became the most popular entertainment venue in the city, offering liquor, live theater, and gambling.Evett; Handbook of Texas. Soon other entertainment entrepreneurs, including prostitutes, appeared nearby. The Theater's location, the corner of Soledad and Commerce, became known as \\"Fatal Corner\\", owing to the violent crowd that the saloon attracted.Selcer (2004) ch. 2. The Sporting District was formally established in 1889 by the San Antonio city council to contain and regulate prostitution. The area became home to brothels, dance halls, saloons, gambling parlors, and other illegal, or at least vice-oriented, businesses. City officials did not officially condone the activities but rather unofficially regulated them. The area also included many legitimate businesses including hotels and restaurants. By the early 20th century, the District had become so large that, not only was it the largest red-light district in Texas, but it was one of the largest in the nationMaxwell (1996), p. 135. (third in the nation by some accounts). Brothels were required to pay $500 annually in licensing fees. In 1911 businesses in the area provided the city with approximately $50,000 ($,000 in today's dollars) annually in licensing fees. The most successful brothels boasted amenities such as ballrooms and orchestras. Because of the area's size a \\"Blue Book\\" was published as a tourist guide for visitors. The 1911‚Äì1912 edition listed 106 vice entertainment venues as well as many other businesses. In contrast to the relatively raucous red-light districts in other parts of the country, San Antonio's was known for being relatively subdued and civilized. Despite its fame and economic significance however, very little was recorded about the District because neither city officials nor journalists were typically willing to acknowledge knowing about the illegal activities. An unusual facet of San Antonio's red-light district was the lack of racial segregation in the District.McComb (2008) p. 13. Despite the general segregation that permeated society in Texas, establishments in the Sporting District generally catered to black men just as much as white men. Between the world wars, particularly during the Depression, the District deteriorated as higher-class prostitutes abandoned the area in favor of working as call girls in hotels.Humphrey; Handbook of Texas. Violent crime and theft in the area grew. With the arrival of World War II, the District gained the disapproval of the local army leadership, particularly Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was then the Third Army's chief of staff at Fort Sam Houston from August to December 1941. The District was finally shut down in 1941 by San Antonio Police Commissioner P.L. Anderson, with the strong approval of Major General Richard Donovan. In July 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed into law a federal ban on prostitution near naval and army bases. Despite the closure, San Antonio continued to be a major center of prostitution until well after the war. Major venues The Jack Harris Vaudeville Saloon and Theater, circa 1880 The Sporting District contained numerous entertainment venues. The Vaudeville Theater and Saloon was one of the first and most prominent. Another famous venue was Fannie Porter's Sporting House, which was actually located a block outside the borders of the district as defined by the city. Apart from being a well-established brothel, the home became a hideout for the gang of famed outlaw Butch Cassidy.Selcer; Handbook of Texas. Other well-known venues included the Mansion, the Beauty Saloon, the White Elephant Saloon, and the Buckhorn Saloon.Selcer (2004) pp. 82, 230.Everett; Handbook of Texas See also * Barbary Coast, San Francisco * Chicken Ranch (Texas) * Fannie Porter * Free State of Galveston * Gambling in the United States * History of vice in Texas * Sporting District (Omaha, Nebraska) * Storyville * Vaudeville Theater ambush Notes References * Texas State Historical Association. * Texas State Historical Association. * Texas State Historical Association.

In 1916, Britain and France concluded the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, which proposed to divide the Middle East between them into spheres of influence. The formal objective of the League of Nations Mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire, which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century.

In the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Syria agreed to withdraw its troops from the occupied areas and to turn them into demilitarized zones.

In the US, the release of the album perpetuated the fact that The Beatles, either as a group, or as solo artists, have released or charted at least one song or album every calendar year since 1964. Reception The album debuted at number 58 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, with 7,965 copies sold in the US during the first week of release. The album also charted on the Top Internet Albums chart in the US. As of February 2010, the album has sold over 30,000 copies worldwide. Reviews for Y Not were mostly mixed. Review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a score out of 100 based on critic ratings, rated the album 60 out of 100, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes of the album: \\"that friendly, shambling sound is Ringo, something Y Not proves without a shadow of a doubt by sounding virtually interchangeable with its immediate predecessors [...] Starr is all about cheerful reminders of happy times filled with Peace Dreams and memories of \\"The Other Side of Liverpool.\\"\\" Erlewine concludes that \\"like there was on Liverpool 8, there is charm to Starr‚Äôs tried and true: exciting it is not but it‚Äôs as comforting as an old friend who doesn‚Äôt change, he just stays the same.\\" Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine rates the album two out of five stars. He writes that \\"it's nice to imagine that Ringo Starr's post-Beatles inability to produce much of consequence stems from his band-established character [...] this failure, as especially evidenced on Y Not, seems more predicated on some dearth of actual songwriting talent than the near-novelty quality of his persona.\\" Although he contradicted that \\"to like it might even feel like charity, and would be excusable if the album's only fault was being mired in silliness\\", Cataldo added: \\"Flush with broad sentiment and a messy spread of good feelings, Y Not finds the funniest Beatle on the outside of the joke.\\" In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis opines that \\"the importance in life of sustained effort along a particular direction\\" is \\"a thought that's inescapable listening to the latest release from former Beatle Ringo Starr.\\" He also states that \\"he spends a bit of time here simply banging away happily [...] But the heart of the 10-song collection comes from his continued exploration of how to hold on to noble ideals in the face of ever-rising cynicism and violence.\\" Lewis concludes that \\"he holds securely to an upbeat perspective that borders on clich√© [...] that's somehow reassuring coming from the guy who's spent most of his life in an intimate relationship with time.\\" Track listing #\\"Fill in the Blanks\\" (Richard Starkey, Joe Walsh) ‚Äì 3:14 #*featuring Joe Walsh #\\"Peace Dream\\" (Starkey, Gary Wright, Gary Nicholson) ‚Äì 3:34 #\\"The Other Side of Liverpool\\" (Starkey, Dave Stewart) ‚Äì 3:23 #\\"Walk with You\\" (Starkey, Van Dyke Parks) ‚Äì 4:42 #*duet with Paul McCartney #\\"Time\\" (Starkey, Stewart) ‚Äì 3:49 #\\"Everyone Wins\\" (Starkey, Johnny Warman) ‚Äì 3:54 #*a re-recording of a song originally released in 1992 as a B-side #\\"Mystery of the Night\\" (Starkey, Richard Marx) ‚Äì 4:05 #\\"Can't Do It Wrong\\" (Starkey, Gary Burr) ‚Äì 3:45 #\\"Y Not\\" (Starkey, Glen Ballard) ‚Äì 3:49 #\\"Who's Your Daddy\\" (Starkey, Joss Stone) ‚Äì 2:29 #*featuring Joss Stone Personnel * Ringo Starr ‚Äì lead vocals, drums, keyboards, piano, acoustic guitar, backing vocals, percussion * Steve Dudas ‚Äì guitar * Benmont Tench ‚Äì Hammond organ, piano * Michael Bradford ‚Äì bass guitar * Bruce Sugar ‚Äì engineer, co-producer, keyboards * Keith Allison ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals Guest musicians * Don Was ‚Äì bass guitar (\\"Who's Your Daddy\\"), upright bass (\\"Can't Do it Wrong\\") * Joe Walsh ‚Äì guitar (\\"Fill in the Blanks\\", \\"Peace Dream\\" and \\"Everyone Wins\\"), bass guitar, backing vocals (\\"Fill in the Blanks\\") * David A.

Grace wrote the lyrics and music for the album's eleven titles. The album was recorded in France, Brazil, and in the USA with the Victory Riders, who played with Grace on her first tour; her parents also appear on the album. Made for Change is musically more ambitious than Hall of Mirrors; it explores a large array of sounds and styles, reflecting Grace's love for traveling. The album also echoes Grace's commitment to preserving the environment, since it was largely inspired by a concert held in the middle of the Amazonian rainforest, as a protest against deforestation. 1\\\\.

Usdane South Regional Award from abilityone.gov The company employed over 100 severely disabled people to manufacture and co-pack several private label brands and its own brands - Millstone Traditions, Granny Bunt and Beachhouse Seafood. On average, their brand portfolio reached more than four million people around the world daily. AMP was the first non-profit agency in the country to operate a USDA approved (PL No. 47-011-02) facility for the production of manufactured goods sold to the feeding programs of the US Government and private industry. AMP utilized the manufacture of food items to create opportunities for severely disabled in the development of work skills, vocational services and a better quality of life. It ceased operation in late 2011 following accusations of fraud and lying about the ingredients in a product. Background The company operates under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act , a U.S. federal law mandating that all federal agencies purchase specified supplies and services from non-profit organizations employing blind persons or others with severe disabilities,NISH named after Senator Jacob K. Javits, who led efforts to expand the Wagner-O'Day Act of 1938.Ronald Reagan: 50th Anniversary of the JWOD Act, 1988 Senator Javits led the efforts to expand the older law, which applied only to blind persons, and covered supplies but not services. The effort succeeded in spite of objections raised by organizations representing the blind, as expressed for example in Resolution 68-04American Council Of The Blind passed in 1968 by the American Council of the Blind. The federal agency charged with administering the program is currently known as the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. The agency decides which commodities and services the government should purchase under the JWOD Act. The program it oversees, known for over three decades as the JWOD Program, was renamed \\"AbilityOne\\" by Congress in 2006. AMP is the first non-profit agency in the country to operate a USDA-approved facility for the production of manufactured goods sold to the feeding programs of the US Government and private industry. They manufacture over 125 different varieties of dry mixes, dairy blends and oil products for federal customers such as the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense. AMP also produces for the private sector and participated in the reinvented federal procurement Prime Vendor program by delivering to full-line food distributors who are contracted to deliver to federal installations. History AMP first began in 1992 as ARC- Diversified, the first non-profit corporation in the United States to operate as a USDA-approved manufacturer of goods sold to government and private feeding programs. While running as ARC-Diversified, the company managed to be recognized for their ventures by the USDA in 2004 as the Jarvis-Wagner-O'Day Contractor of the Year. ARC-Diversified helped the severely disabled through the development of work skills and a better quality of life. However, in July 2006 the company filed for bankruptcy shortly after two directors resigned. Attempting to raise the price of cooking oil for sale to government organizations, USDA officials contested that the attempt to raise the bid was the result of inflated executive compensation totaling more than $1 million. Negotiations between ARC and the USDA stalled production and led to credit problems and layoffs. After the bankruptcy was filed, ARC closed its doors. The former executives settled the judgment in March 2008, agreeing that the judgment was based upon liability for \\"errors, omissions, negligence and breaches of duty\\" in connection with their positions with ARC, and not based upon actual fraud.ARC Diversified bankruptcy updateARC lawsuit settled against former directors from herald-citizen.com The company was resurrected as American Manufacturing and Packaging in 2008 through the help of a group of investors, rehiring many of the employees that were laid-off during the bankruptcy. As of November 2009, AMP has gained back many of its former customers and has been working to stabilize production, operate transparently, and continue to supply jobs to individuals with severe disabilities. As of June 2011, officials with American Manufacturing and Packaging confirmed that a number of employees were temporarily furloughed. \\"Production operations continue with reduced staffing,\\" the press release goes on to say. \\"The company is working to resume full production in the near future.\\" Information as to how many employees have been furloughed, how long the furlough is expected to last and the reasons behind the furlough were not made public. According to public files with the Excluded Parties List System, the USDA Farm Services Agency has suspended AMP's contract \\"pending completion of investigation or legal proceedings pursuant to FAR 9.407-2, GPO Instructions 110.11A or 39 CFR 601.113 and based on an indictment for, or adequate evidence of, the commission of fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, false statements or other offenses indicating a lack of business integrity or adequate evidence of any other cause of a serious and compelling nature.\\" The EPLS is a website provided by the GSA (General Services Administration) for the purpose of efficiently and conveniently spreading information on parties that are excluded from receiving federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain federal financial and non- financial assistance and benefits.

He specializes in late 19th and early 20th-century American political and diplomatic history with a particular focus on presidential history. His 2009 biography of Woodrow Wilson was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Cooper is Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Education Cooper graduated in 1957 from Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington D.C. In 1961 he received his bachelor‚Ä≤s degree summa cum laude from Princeton University, where he wrote his senior thesis under the supervision of David Herbert Donald. After graduating from Princeton he enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University, where he received a master's degree in history in 1962 and a Ph.D. in history in 1968. At Columbia he studied under Richard Hofstadter. As Cooper later explained, \\"For graduate study, I chose Columbia because I wanted to work with Richard Hofstadter. The way he had blended political and intellectual history particularly excited me.\\" Teaching career Cooper began his teaching career at Wellesley College, serving as an assistant professor of history from 1965 to 1970. He moved to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1970, where he taught for 39 years. He chaired the Wisconsin history department from 1988 to 1991. During his years at the University of Wisconsin, he held two endowed professorships, serving first as the William Francis Allen Professor of History and later as the E. Gordon Fox Professor of American Institutions. His teaching interests focused on American history since the Civil War era. To that end, he taught introductory and upper division courses on Gilded Age and Twentieth Century America as well as graduate seminars in U.S. political history. Books and awards Cooper's many awards include the Guggenheim Fellowship (1979‚Äì80) and the Fulbright Professorship in United States History, Moscow State University (1987).See C.V. In 1996 he received the University of Wisconsin-Madison Alumni Association Award for Outstanding Faculty Member. His most recent book, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography, was published in 2009. The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.Biography or Autobiography In his books, Cooper described Wilson as an activist president, even more so than Theodore Roosevelt. For example, in an interview, Cooper observed that: :\\"I had learned from studying him in comparison with TR [Theodore Roosevelt] how bold a leader Wilson was‚Äîfar bolder than his rival, public images to the contrary notwithstanding. From his Princeton presidency onward, Wilson had mounted audacious initiatives. Intervention in the war, the Fourteen Points, and hammering together the League were his boldest ones in foreign policy or any sphere.\\" Cooper, 2020. But Cooper also pointed out Wilson's shortcomings. In his 2009 biography of Wilson, Cooper concluded: :\\"In the end, much about Wilson remains troubling. He shared his shortcomings with Abraham Lincoln, who likewise approved massive violations of freedom of speech and the press, and Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner who fathered children by a slave mistress, and Franklin Roosevelt, who approved an even worse violation of civil liberties, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. A consideration of Wilson poses the same ultimate question as does that of those other towering figures in the presidential pantheon: do his sins of omission and commission outweigh the good he did, or do his great words and deeds overshadow his transgressions?\\"Cooper, Woodrow Wilson, p. 11 Cooper encouraged fellow historians to pursue subjects that fascinated them. In a post-retirement interview, he noted that \\"what I have enjoyed most has been pursuing things that have simply fascinated me. My list of biographical subjects speaks to that fascination, as do the events I have studied. Some historians may make their way mainly out of a sense of obligation or duty, but I think being attracted to a subject for its own sake brings vigor and insight.\\" Media appearances Cooper was the Chief Historian for the 2002 PBS documentary Woodrow Wilson, which was produced by KCET. He also served as a program advisor for the award-winning Ken Burns documentary The Roosevelts, which aired nationally on PBS in 2014. Selected bibliography * Cooper Jr, John Milton, ed.

They have become an annual rite of passage for single Jews in their 20s and 30s. For these people, the Matzo Ball also functions as an annual reunion of sorts, offering a chance to see fellow attendees each year. While some party-goers admit that they attend with an eye toward flirting, romance, or at least finding a short-term makeout or sexual partner, others maintain that they go only to spend time with friends, dance, drink cocktails, and because of a lack of other options on Christmas Eve.Joel Stein, The MatzoBall Is the Season's Hottest Not-Christmas Party, Bloomberg Businessweek, December 17, 2015 (Drinking at the Matzo Ball, though, is not officially endorsed by the event organizers.) Christmas Eve events such as the Matzo Ball also tend to draw some young American Jews \\"out of the woodwork\\" for drinking and socializing who are: (1) otherwise difficult to draw into involvement with the Jewish organizations,Jack Werthheimer, The New Jewish Leaders: Reshaping the American Jewish Landscape, University Press of New England, 2011, p. 7 and (2) are perceived as more dateable or hip than people who attend typical Jewish events. Event The first Matzo Ball event was held in Boston in 1987 and organized by local social figure Andrew Rudnick. As a Boston University senior in political science and part-time bartender in 1986, Rudnick attended a Jewish young professionals Christmas Eve gathering at a local hotel, where he found a staid atmosphere similar to a high school prom, with women on one side of the room, and men on the other. The environment, including the strong lighting, waits to purchase drink tickets and to receive a drink, bad music, and stale latkes were not conductive to meeting people and having fun.James Kirchick, Matzoball Memories: My uncle, godfather of the Jewish singles business, created a Christmas Eve tradition, Tablet Magazine, December 22, 2014 Following that incident, Rudnick began developing the idea for hosting an event the next December 24 at the nightclub he then bartended part-time at, Metro. He and his friends built up awareness of the upcoming event through word of mouth, especially through fraternities and sororities with Jewish memberships, posters, and flyers hand-distributed, including at malls. Some coverage of the event by local radio DJs, who invited Rudnick on-air to promote it, and Rudnick's on-air exaggerations about expected ticket sales, helped spread the word and 2,000 people attended the first Matzo Ball. Rudnick soon quit his job in commercial real estate to focus on the organization and event, and expanding to other cities. The name of the event and the name of the organization were created on-the-spot in 1987. The event name was inspired by Rudnick's Irish-American coworker's question about Jewish cuisine, and the organization's name was thought up by Rudnick and his Italian-American nightclub bosses, Boston entertainment mogul brothers John and Patrick Lyons, who were concerned about offending both Jews and Christians with the stereotypical name Matzo Ball for an event being held on Christmas Eve, and harming the club's reputation.Heather Robinson, MatzoBall Founder Launches 'MatzoBowl', New York Jewish Week, April 3, 2013 Other names for the event considered by Rudnick were 'Tribe Trot' and 'Heeb Hop', both of which were rejected upon the recommendation of Rudnick's mother, who also found the name Matzo Ball to be cute. After a successful repeat of the event on Christmas Eve 1988, Rudnick expanded to New York and Boca Raton in 1989, and added Chicago, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles in 1990.Jenny Singer, The Titan Of Jewish Singles Events Reveals Tips For Finding Your Soulmate, The Forward, November 30, 2017 The event has permeated American Jewish consciousness, even winding up in fiction,Francesca Segr√®, Daughter of the Bride, 2006, pp. 243‚Äì244Shana Liebman, Sex, Drugs & Gefilte Fish: The Heeb Storytelling Collection, Grand Central Publishing, 2009, p.

A ticket purchased at the door can cost $30‚Äì40. Attendance at the New York event can average from 1,100 to 1,700 people, with an entry line forming outside the venue 30 minutes before the scheduled start time. Crowd sizes at smaller venues, like in Boca Raton, can be 800 to 1,000 people, but with a crowd that arrives later, leading to a long line for entry at midnight. The event typically begins roughly at 9 p.m. and runs through the last call time for the state/locality (although the nominal, official start and end times given for Matzo Ball as of 2018 are 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.), with peak attendance and flirting at approximately midnight.The Matzo Ball: No, It Isn't Something to Eat, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 17, 1993, p. 3GStephen Heyman, Matzo Ball Offers Singular Senation for Jewish Partyers, Palm Beach Post, December 26, 2004Heather Robinson, Reflections on the matzo ball, New York Blueprint, December 26, 2013Kate Wertheimer, If you're single and Jewish, mingle at LA's Christmas Eve Matzoball, Time Out Los Angeles, December 14, 2014 Rudnick has observed that the best use of the night is to speak to many potential romantic or business contacts over the course of the night, and to follow up and stay in touch with them over the following months to see what develops, instead of spending the entire night talking with only one person. In some cities in the past, ticket prices had included hors d'oeuvres and sometimes a ticket for a free drink, sometimes limited to early arrivals.Melissa Arseniuk, Nightlife: Seven Nights, Vegas Seven, December 23, 2010, p. 65Nicole Lyn Pesce, Monday in New York, New York Daily News, December 24, 2007, p. 30 The crowd is often well-dressed.Sarah Baicker, Jewish at Christmas?, NBC 10 Philadelphia, December 19, 2008 The recommended attire is the same as an attendee might wear to a popular nightclub on a Saturday night, termed \\"fashion forward\\", and that is comfortable to dance in. =Associated activities= Some party-goers to Christmas Eve singles events \\"pregame\\" with friends at home before arriving at the event.Jessica Yadegaran, Christmas Eve party alternative: Latke Ball, Contra Costa Times, December 10, 2007 In some cities, the Matzo Ball has been linked officially or unofficially to other Jewish events on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, such as volunteering at local food banks. Rudnick and SYJP have also experimented with a variety of other activities, including Christmas Day pool parties at the same hotel as the Miami Matzo Ball, after-work networking events, singles cruises, Valentine's Day and Passover-linked parties, a magazine, a video dating service, and, in 2015, a dating app called MatzoMatch that used LinkedIn profiles instead of Facebook profiles as the underlying content source so as to allow for filtering by education and work.Daniel Schere, I Jew! Interfaith marriage is on the rise, but so are alternative ways for Jews to meet Jews, Baltimore Jewish Times, November 12, 2015 =Co-sponsorship= The original official organizer for the Matzo Ball events was Rudnick's Society of Young Jewish Professionals, but as of 2018, it is nominally organized under Mazel Events, LLC. During the 2010s, an occasional event sponsor of the MatzoBall was JDate (even during those periods when JDate organized its own competing Christmas Eve event in Los Angeles, 'Schmooz-a-Palooza'). As of 2018, the Matzo Ball is sponsored by dating app JSwipe,Press Release, Jewish and Single?

At various times, the Matzo Ball has experimented with dividing some of its venues by age into different rooms or even separate adjacent venues, even giving unique event names, like \\"The Big Chill\\" and \\"MatzoBall Plus\\", to the party catering to 30-somethings seeking a less-noisy environment.Marshall Heyman, The Matzo Ball Night Out, Wall Street Journal, December 24, 2011Eve Zibart, Matzo Balls on Christmas Eve, Washington Post, December 24, 1993, p. N13 While many attendees choose to go to the Matzo Ball with a group of friends, there are also many party-goers who prefer to go on their own, which also frees them from possible disastrous consequences of bad wingmanning by a friend. =Atmosphere= Rudnick's formula for the Matzo Ball atmosphere is to find a large venue that can handle the large crowds, and for the lights to get dimmer and the music to get louder gradually over the course of the night.First Person: The Search for the Better Matzo Ball Leads to a Tour of Manhattan Debauchery, JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency), December 27, 2006 This allows for easier mingling and conversation earlier in the night before the hip-hop and dance/house music becomes loud enough to encourage dancing.Deborah Schoeneman, Have a Ball with Matzo or Monster's, New York Post, December 20, 2001 Rudnick rejects the aspects previously associated with Jewish social events, including name tags, announcements, and live bands, because they would be a distraction from mingling, and can inhibit conversation. Rudnick believes that using nightclubs as a venue helps to ensure that the attendees enjoy their night even if they don't make a romantic connection. Events held at more customary locations of the past for Jewish singles events, like synagogues or hotel ballrooms, or with more formal matchmaking features like name tags and formal conversation times, can lead to an undue stress on meeting a long-term partner, while a nightclub with dancing and music is more likely to lead to a good time regardless of romantic outcome. In addition, the event provides access to nightclubs that might otherwise be difficult to gain admission to on a regular night. Locations Rudnick and SYJP expand the Matzo Ball to new cities when they believe that have found the infrastructure and potential clientele of young, upscale Jewish people necessary to make the event successful.

The event makes real meeting potential Jewish romantic partners, instead of simply viewing their photos and swiping on them in a Jewish dating app or website, like JSwipe or JDate ‚Äì although Rundnick has partnered with both brands as sponsors at various times and advertised through them.Rachel Kurland, What It's Really Like to Attend the MatzoBall, The Jewish Exponent, December 30, 2015 The ability to instantly have a in-depth conversation with a person deemed attractive makes a relationship more likely. The socializing and flirting that takes place at the Matzo Ball gives rise to many romantic relationships., and Rudnick believes that this opportunity to meet other Jewish singles helps prevent intermarriage, while the ensuing in-faith marriages and Jewish babies that result are an effective force against assimilation. Rudnick states that \\"countless\\" marriages have resulted from meetings at various Matzo Balls (and stopped counting after reaching the 1,000 mark). Rudnick himself met his wife at a Matzo Ball in 1997, where she tended bar.Plans Under Way for holiday 'Matzo Ball' in Boca, Elsewhere, Boca Raton/Delray Beach News, November 4, 2007, p. 6A, available via Google News Rudnick finds that people who attend a Matzo Ball event tend to be motivated to meet other Jewish singles, which makes the events a conducive environment for finding someone for a relationship. As of the mid-2010s, there is a \\"second generation\\" of Matzo Ball attendees ‚Äî children born to parents who first met at the Matzo Ball in previous decades ‚Äî who are now old enough to attend.Hannah Orenstein, What It's Like to Attend a Jewish Singles Dance on Christmas Eve, Cosmopolitan, December 28, 2015 Rudnick also attributes some of the success and popularity of the Matzo Ball to the fact that the attendees are able to party in a venue that is very trendy and that can be otherwise difficult to be admitted to. Competitors There are also a number of competitors to the Matzo Ball, and other events organized in cities where no Matzo Ball is held. The competition among the Christmas Eve parties has occasionally been stiff, especially during the \\"Matzo Ball wars of the early 90s\\", with use of similar-sounding event names, touts and bouncers to chase away those touts outside events, and ticket dumping to \\"crush\\" the competition. The Ball A major competitor to the Matzo Ball, and often confused with it,Emily Shire, The Craziest Date Night for Single Jews, Where Mistletoe Is Ditched for Shots, The Daily Beast, December 26, 2014 has been known simply as \\"The Ball\\", which began in 1994 under organizer LetMyPeopleGo.

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on June 19, 1975. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 23, 1977 and is also part of the larger Old Village Historic District. The property was settled in as early as 1785 along the banks of the River Raisin, and it was the first piece of land settled by European explorers. There have been two different houses on the property since 1785. The first house on the property was built by early-French explorer Francois Navarre, who was the first European to settle the area that would later become Monroe. The property was given to Navarre from the native Potawatomi tribe and served as the center of the new settlement. The Navarre House was famously used as the military headquarters for James Winchester, who commanded his troops during the ill-fated Battle of Frenchtown during the War of 1812. The house had several different owners, but its namesake comes from Dr. Alfred Sawyer, who was a famous early proponents of homeopathy. Dr. Sawyer lived on the property from 1859‚Äì1870. When the Navarre House was demolished in 1873 to make way for the current house, it was the oldest structure in the county. The Sawyer House, built in Italianate architecture, replaced the Navarre House on the property in 1873. Timbers from the original Navarre House were used to create the stair banister in the Sawyer House. While Dr. Sawyer did not live in the house after 1870, the property remained in his family's ownership. His daughter, Jenny Toll Sawyer, gave the house to the city of Monroe in 1938. The house was used by a variety of organizations, such as the Monroe County Historical Museum, Red Cross, the Camp Fire Girls, and the Boy Scouts. The house stood empty before a group of citizens pooled their private funds and restored the building, and creating an organization whose main reason for existence was the maintenance of the historic structure. Today, the house remains owned by the City of Monroe and is available for public use through the custodial group, called The Sawyer Homestead, a 501(c)3 group who collects rent to fund the house's upkeep.

It was nation-state officially designated the United Mexican States (, ). The First Mexican Republic lasted from 1824 to 1835, when conservatives under Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna transformed it into a centralized state, the Centralist Republic of Mexico. The republic was proclaimed on November 1, 1823 by the Constituent Congress, months after the fall of the Mexican Empire ruled emperor Agustin I, a former royalist military officer-turned-insurgent for independence. The federation was formally and legally established on October 4, 1824 when the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States came into force. It was bordered on the north by the United States and Oregon Country (or Columbia District); on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Central America, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary, 3rd ed., Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, Merriam-Webster; p. 733 Although the region of Central America gained independence when Mexico did and was part of the territory of the Mexican Empire, it chose not to join Mexico's federated republic and was allowed to do so. The Federal Republic lasted almost twelve years with constant struggles between the main political parties. The Conservatives, landowners, the army, the Catholic Church, and former monarchists sought a strong central government and a nation-state with an official religion. Liberals were republicans favoring a limited government power divided among the federated states and a secular nation. The conflict between these two competing visions of nationhood caused severe political instability and violence for the next 65 years, until the Porfiriato (1876-1911). \\"Independence transformed Mexico from Spain's largest and most prosperous colony to a sovereign nation suffering economic decline and political strife.\\"Stevens, Donald Fithian. Origins of Instability in Early Republican Mexico. Duke University Press 1991, p. 1. The republic was ruled by two triumvirates and nine presidents. Insurgent general Guadalupe Victoria was the only president who completed his full term in this period and in almost 30 years of independent Mexico. As in the early U.S., the president and vice president were elected separately and the men did not have to be of the same party. President Guadalupe Victoria was a liberal federalist, while his vice president, Nicol√°s Bravo, was a conservative centralist.Bazant, Jan. \\"From independence to the Liberal Republic, 1821-1867\\" in Mexico Since Independence, Leslie Bethell, ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 9. During the First Federal Republic army intervened in politics regularly, setting a pattern that lasted until the mid-twentieth century, with army generals predominantly serving as presidents of Mexico. General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna repealed the Constitution of 1824 on October 23, 1835, and the Federal Republic became a unitary state, the Centralist Republic. The unitary regime was formally established on December 30, 1836, with the enactment of the seven constitutional laws. Independence and immediate aftermath Flag of the Army of Three Guarantees, 1821 The Spanish overseas possession of the Viceroyalty of New Spain lasted for 300 years, from 1521 with the fall of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and the foundation of Mexico City until the collapse of the viceroyalty in following years of civil war and military stalemate. An insurgency for independence from Spain lasted from the initial 1810 mass revolt, led by secular cleric Miguel Hidalgo and continued under another secular cleric, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, and carried on the hot country of Mexico's south by Vicente Guerrero. Augustin Iturbide, a royalist military officer born in New Spain of Spanish parents, made a strategic alliance with insurgent leader Guerrero under the Plan of Iguala, in which the former foes fought in tandem to oust Spanish rule. The plan proclaimed Mexico a nation-state; Roman Catholicism as the sole religion; the equality of Spaniards those born in Mexico (Americanos), thereby abolishing colonial-era legal racial designations; and was to be a constitutional monarchy. The joint forces of the insurgent guerrillas and the royal army formed the Army of the Three Guarantees, and royal rule collapsed in New Spain. The incoming viceroy Juan O'Donoj√∫ signed the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, recognizing New Spain's independence. Iturbide entered Mexico City in triumph on September 27, 1821. The new, independent nation-state was named the Mexican Empire. Rise and fall of the First Mexican Empire Flag of the Mexican Empire, 1821-23 Elite American-born Spaniards in New Spain had no real experience with exercising political power other than on their city councils, so that monarchy was the familiar form of rule. No European of royal blood stepped in to assume the royal title in Mexico. A minority of the Constituent Congress in search of stability chose as monarch the general Agust√≠n de Iturbide, who had led the war effort against Spain. He was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico on May 18, 1822. Political turmoil ensued, with Iturbide dissolving the Constituent Congress in October 1822 and jailing the legislators. Several members were jailed simply for expressing their disagreement with Iturbide. When Iturbide eliminated the elected Congress, he established an appointed National Board in its place. The dismissal of the Congress, the dictatorial style of government adopted by the Emperor, and the absence of solutions to the serious problems that the country was going through increased the conspiracies to change the imperial system. The military men sent to crush the opposition instead proclaimed against Iturbide and issued the Plan of Casa Mata, which sought to create a new constituent assembly. Generals Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and Guadalupe Victoria drafted the Plan of Casa Mata in December 1822, which was proclaimed on 1 February 1823. It appealed to the political subdivisions of Mexico who sought local autonomy and home rule.Rodr√≠guez O., Jaime, \\"Plan of Casa Mata\\", in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 2, p. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Several insurrections occurred in the Mexican provinces beginning in December, but they were all put down by the Imperial Army, except for Santa Anna's forces in Veracruz. Santa Anna had previously made a secret agreement with General Ech√°varri, the commander of the Imperial forces. By this agreement, the Plan of Casa Mata was to be proclaimed throughout Mexico on February 1, 1823, and Ech√°varri was to switch sides to join the insurgents. This plan did not recognize the First Mexican Empire and called for the convening of a new Constituent Congress. The insurrectionists sent their proposal to the provincial delegations and requested their adherence to the plan. In the course of just six weeks, the Plan of Casa Mata traveled to such remote places as Texas, and almost all the provinces supported the plan. Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata, which was later joined by Vicente Guerrero and Nicol√°s Bravo. Iturbide was forced to reinstate the Congress, and in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated on March 19, 1823. However, the restored Congress declared the appointment of Iturbide void ab initio, and thus refused recognition of the abdication. On 8 April, the Congress declared the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of C√≥rdoba void as well. With that the Empire was dissolved and the country declared its freedom to establish itself as it saw fit. Provisional Government of Mexico (1823-1824) The forced abdication of the emperor made the debate about how Mexico should constitute itself as a nation-state an urgent issue. It decided on a federated republic, which was the preferred form of government for most of Mexican provinces. The Bourbon Reforms of the eighteenth century had created administrative districts, intendancies, which decentralized power from the viceroy in Mexico City and empowered the intendants to communicate directly with the crown about their issues, rather than having Mexico City convey information. With this, provinces found themselves with a level of home rule that they were reluctant to give up when New Spain threw off Spanish rule and established the constitutional monarchy. With the end of that bridging period between Spanish monarchical rule and the Mexican monarchy, regions of Mexico sought to reassert their autonomy. For historian Timothy Anna, \\"the transition federal republic was the real 'revolution' because the old gave way to the new in Mexican history.‚ÄùAnna, Timothy Forging Mexico, 1821-1835. University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. x In the period after abdication, Mexico opted to form a federal republic, much as the United States had already done (and later Canada did), a practical and workable solution \\"that allowed competent national government and an effective regional voice [which] was a delicate balancing act requiring frequent revision.\\" 1824 Constitution of Mexico Constitution of 1824 Flag of the Federal Republic. Note: the eagle no longer wears a crown Lorenzo de Zavala, liberal federalist who played a major role in drafting the new constitution Following the abdication of Iturbide as emperor, a second constituent congress convened to draft a formal constitution. The Constitution of 1824 empowered regions of Mexico to assert their political power, resulting in a constitution that reinforced radical federalism, \\"with a weak national government fiscally dependent upon the states.\\" It was weak foundation for the new sovereign state to confront challenges.Josefina Zoraida V√°zquez, \\"War and Peace with the United States.\\" p. 341. Conservatives who supported traditions rooted in the colonial order, especially centralized power of the state, were concerned about the framework of the strongly federalist constitution favored by most liberals. However, liberal intellectual Jos√© Mar√≠a Luis Mora lamented that Mexico, as well as other new Latin American republics established \\"solid governments.\\" He opined \\"The reply is too easy: these [new republics] have not from adopted the representative system anything but the forms and its exterior apparatus. They have tried to unite intimately the despotic and miserable laws and customs of the old absolutism with the principles of a system in which all must be liberty and openness.\\"quoted in Hale, Mexican Liberalism, p. 105. Key elements of the constitution were: :1. The Mexican nation is sovereign and free from the Spanish government and any other nation. :3. The religion of the nation is the Catholic Church and is protected by law and prohibits any other. :4. The Mexican nation adopts as its form of government a popular federal representative republic. :6. The supreme power of the federation is divided into Legislative power, Executive power and Judiciary power. :7. Legislative power is deposited in a Congress of two chambers--a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Senators. :50. Political freedom of press in the federation and the states (paragraph 1). :74. Executive power is vested in a person called the President of the United Mexican States. :75. It provides the figure of vice president, who in case of physical or moral impossibility of the president, exercise the powers and prerogatives of the latter. :95. The term of the president and vice president shall be four years. :123. Judiciary power lies in a Supreme Court, the Circuit Courts and the District Courts. :124. The Supreme Court consists of eleven members divided into three rooms and a prosecutor. :157. The individual state governments will be formed by the same three powers. Creating new institutions Map of Mexico in 1824 with its 19 states and 5 territories States had to create a functioning political system, which under the constitution was to have powers divided between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new system had to grapple with creating a new legal system and deciding who was a citizen. The 1821 Plan of Iguala signaled a new direction for an independent Mexico, calling for the abolition of class distinctions and legal racial categories, while continuing traditional lack of equal standing for women. In the new federated republican era, equality before the law meant eliminating noble titles and special privileges (fueros) of particular groups. The result in theory leveled differences between classes. The transition from royal civil and criminal courts to a court system in the new order was not easy. Crown edicts no longer had force and new legal codes had not yet come into being. No one knew what laws were valid, there were vacancies in judgeships, and few trained lawyers. States were accorded the power over most civil and criminal legal matters. The separate court of the mostly Spanish merchants, the consulado, was abolished, but the military and ecclesiastical courts remained in place as part of their fuero.Green, The Mexican Republic: The First Decade pp. 70-71. For members of indigenous communities, the removal of colonial-era protections of their community lands and their access to the special General Indian Court made them more vulnerable in the new federated republican order. Spain and Spaniards in Mexico Fort of San Juan Ul√∫a, last bastion of Spanish military power, finally taken by Mexico in 1825 Although the last viceroy of New Spain signed the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, Spain refused to recognize the loss of it valuable colony. Spanish military officers in Cuba, territory controlled by Spain, offered to mount a reconquest of Mexico. Spain still controlled the coastal fort of San Juan Ul√∫a until 1825. Spanish agents sought to assess the political situation in Mexico in the 1820s, looking for an opening to reassert control. \\"The Spanish government vacillated between planning military reconquest and seeking other means to achieve a negotiated return to Mexican dependency.\\" Many Spaniards did remain in Mexico after independence, but elite Mexicans viewed them warily, particularly those who had fought in the royalist army. This is despite the pledge of the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of C√≥rdoba guaranteeing equality between peninsular- and American-born Spaniards. All in Mexico were to be Mexican citizens, but with the question of the standing of the Spaniards was in doubt. There was strong anti-Spanish sentiment in the country, but expelling them challenged the tenets of liberal ideology, which stressed equality before the law. A leading liberal, Jos√© Mar√≠a Luis Mora, a diocesan priest and liberal intellectual, was opposed to Spaniards‚Äô expulsion on ideological grounds, but also on practical grounds, since Spanish merchants had been vital to the flourishing of the colonial economy.Charles A. Hale, Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora. New Haven: Yale University Press 1969 pp. 100-101. In 1827, Mexico expelled remaining peninsular-born Spaniards, called disparagingly gachupines. In 1829, a Spanish expeditionary force was launched from Cuba, with the expectation that many Mexicans would support it. The Spaniards were wrong.Christon Archer, \\"Fashioning a New Nation\\", pp. 318-19. Politics in the era of Guadalupe Victoria General Guadalupe Victoria, federalist liberal and first president of Mexico Lucas Alam√°n, Conservative politician and intellectual The lack of political experience of Mexican elites prior to independence and their sharply held opposing views meant that political life was both highly polarized and chaotic. Two leaders emerged, articulating the views of the two main political views. Lucas Alam√°n from the time he was a young man representing New Spain at the Cortes of C√°diz in 1812 until his death in 1853 was the voice of Mexican conservatism. Conservatives did not repudiate colonial-era institutions and sought a way to recreate what they considered the order and stability of that era, and were proponents of centralism, that is, a strong central government. Lorenzo de Zavala was the early voice of Mexican liberals was from Yucat√°n and emerged as a spokesperson for a Mexico that looked beyond the traditions and constraints of the colonial era, and were proponents of federalism, that is, for empowerment of states over the central government. The constitution of 1824 had enshrined federalism as its organizing principle, so that conservatives, who had supported Mexican independence but favored a strong central government, found themselves reviled as opponents of progress by the liberals.Green, The Mexican Republic, p.50 The first election immediately after the promulgation of the 1824 brought two heroes of independence to the fore as candidates. Guadalupe Victoria was considered a ‚Äúnatural choice‚Äù for the presidency. His opponent for the election was another hero of the insurgency, Nicol√°s Bravo. Both men ran restrained campaigns, and were, in fact, occupied with peacekeeping in the post-independence period. Bravo, however, signaled that he was opposed to the states‚Äô rights of federalism and moved to protect Spaniards still in Mexico. Victoria won the indirect election, carrying all the northern states, most in favor of federalism. He served his entire four-year term, a feat not duplicated for decades. The fact that it lasted did not mean it was effective. It had no clear cut program of its own and was generally passive.Green, The Mexican Republic, p. 141. Mexicans had no experience with electoral democracy, not least those considered their leaders. In the absence of a tradition of political parties, Mexican elites sorted themselves into rival rites of the Freemasons in the mid 1820s. Many conservatives, including Alam√°n, were affiliated with the Scottish Rite Masons, the elite group that was most sympathetic to the Spanish system. Many liberals, including Zavala and Vicente Guerrero, were affiliated with the York Rite Masons. The Yorkinos functioned as \\"the first political party for laboring people\\"Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 154. and became a vehicle to mobilize the popular classes, organizing them for political purposes. Since Masonic meetings were carried on in secret, politics took on the air of secrecy and conspiracy, but the Yorkinos in particular generated published propaganda, so that their views were widely disseminated throughout the country with the formation of Yorkino lodges.Green, The Mexican Republic, pp. 87-89 Foreign interests became involved in Mexican politics through the rival Masonic lodges. Joel Roberts Poinsett, the U.S. government emissary to Mexico, involved himself in Masonic politics on the side of the Yorkinos, viewing them as most favorable to U.S. interests. The British envoy, Henry G. Ward and other British diplomats quietly worked with the Scottish Rite Mexican politicians.Green, The Mexican Republic, p. 66. Pro-Spanish elements in Mexico sought the reinstatement of Spain's rule in Mexico. In January 1827, conspirators to bring that about were exposed and jailed, which led to the expulsion of Spaniards in December 1827. Other political agitation in the period saw the formulation of the Plan de Monta√±o in Tulancingo by Col. Manuel Monta√±o to dissolve \\"secret societies,\\" in particular the Yorkinos, expel the U.S. Ambassador Joel Roberts Poinsett, who meddled in Mexican politics promoting the Yorkinos, and renovate the Victoria cabinet to displace Yorkinos who served in it. The legislature in Veracruz supported the plan. President Victoria put Vicente Guerrero in charge of combating the small group of armed elite rebels. Nicol√°s Bravo had joined the rebels and was captured, along with Monta√±o. Guerrero argued for leniency for Bravo, who was sent into exile. The Veracruz legislature was not dissolved, despite their support for the plan. The rebellion and the government's suppression of it discredited those who had wanted a centralist government with an authoritarian head of state. They were forced to moderate their stance for the time being and join with those opposing the country's populists led by Guerrero.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, pp. 157-58 Election of 1828 Manuel G√≥mez Pedraza, elected the second president of Mexico Presidential elections in Mexico were indirect, with state legislatures casting the votes for candidates. Unlike the election that brought Guadalupe Victoria to the presidency, the 1828 election saw that partisan conflicts of the new republic in raw form. Once again leaders from the war of independence stood for election, Vicente Guerrero, the insurgent leader of the south who had kept alive the idea of Mexican independence, and Manuel G√≥mez Pedraza, who had fought against the insurgents for independence and participated in the capture of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. Other candidates were Anastasio Bustamante, Melchor M√∫zquiz, and Ignacio Godoy. Guerrero was a liberal, with a wide popular following. G√≥mez Pedraza was the choice of the conservatives, although he was a moderate and a Yorkino. The Masonic lodges that had come to prominence as the stand-ins for political parties during Guadalupe Victoria's presidency were mobilized during the 1828 election. However, there was no direct campaigning by candidates. Guerrero refrained from public speaking, in part because he was still suffering from the effects of a war wound in his chest, but more importantly so that those serving in state legislatures would not be dissuaded from voting for him because of his strong following in the popular classes. Guerrero's following came to be called the \\"People's Party,\\" which supported broad male suffrage, support for decisions of municipalities, and support for federalism and against the power of Mexico City. Their campaign literature extolled his record as a hero of the insurgency.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 159. The opposition to Guerrero was not just politically conservative in its stance, but openly racist and raising fears about his mixed-race, black and mestizo followers. Carlos Mar√≠a Bustamante, the ideologue for G√≥mez Pedraza, raised the specter of Mexico becoming like Haiti, the former slave colony of France that overthrew European rule.Vincente, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, pp. 159-69 G√≥mez Pedraza won the election, but under duress he renounced his victory on 3 December 1828 and went into exile. Liberal adversaries included General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, who supported Guerrero. The election was annulled, and under the Plan de Perote, Vicente Guerrero assumed the presidency in 1829. Presidency of Vicente Guerrero (1829) Vicente Guerrero Guerrero became president on 1 April 1829, with conservative Anastasio Bustamante as his vice president. The legitimacy of Guerrero's presidency was in doubt from the beginning, since the 1828 election results were annulled under pressure of a liberal revolt, and G√≥mez Pedraza, the duly elected president, was forced to renounce office. Some traditional federalists leaders, who might have supported Guerrero, did not do so because of the electoral irregularities.Green, The Mexican Republic, pp. 162‚Äì63. In his farewell speech from the presidency, Guadalupe Victoria cordially endorsed his old friend and fellow liberal insurgent Guerrero.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 179. For Guerrero's supporters, a visibly mixed-race man from Mexico's periphery becoming president of Mexico was a step toward in what one 1829 pamphleteer called \\"the reconquest of this land by its legitimate owners\\" and called Guerrero \\"that immortal hero, favorite son of Nezahualcoyotzin\\", the famous ruler of prehispanic Texcoco.Quoted in Hale, Charles A. Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora. New Haven: Yale University Press 1968. p. 224. The nasty racial slurs and disparagement of his character in the campaign of 1828 did not let up when he assumed the presidency. In his inaugural address, he pointed to his long service to the nation fighting for independence, but also importantly to his holding of high office in independent Mexico. He said, \\"The representatives are to be found in all classes of the people, and the true titles of superiority, the only ones that cause distinction and preference, are discovered wherever talent and virtue appear.\\"Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 177. In his first address to congress, he pledged that \\"the administration is obliged to procure the widest possible benefits and apply them from the palace of the rich to the wooden shack of the humble laborer.\\" He went on to extol liberal values of equality before the law and rewards for those with talent and virtue.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 178. The national treasury was empty and future revenues were already liened. Spain continued to deny recognition of Mexico's independence and threatened reconquest. Guerrero's supporters were strongly anti-Spanish and there had already been one order for their expulsion under the Victoria government. Guerrero called for the establishment of public schools, which would give access to education of Mexico's popular classes. In the colonial era, education was exclusively in the hands of the Catholic Church and the main beneficiaries were elite men. Guerrero also called for land title reforms, industry and trade development, and other programs of a liberal nature. Now president, Guerrero championed the causes of the racially oppressed and economically oppressed. He ordered an immediate abolition of slavery on September 16 of 1829. In central Mexico, there were few black slaves, so that the gesture was largely symbolic, but in the Mexican state of Texas, where Anglo-American slave-holding southerners were colonizing, the decree went against their economic interests. During Guerrero's presidency, the Spanish tried to reconquer Mexico, but they failed, being defeated at the Battle of Tampico. Church-State relations Vice President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, who enacted significant reforms restricting the Catholic Church The Spanish monarchy had the full power to appoint clerics in its overseas possessions through the papal grant of the Patronato Real. When Mexico obtained its independence, Roman Catholicism continued to be the only permissible faith. However, the question of the power of appointment of clerics was highly contested. The Mexican government asserted that the right passed to the new national government, in what was termed the Patronato nacional. With Spain not recognizing Mexico's independence, the papacy claimed that the patronato reverted to itself, the original grantor. The Spanish crown had systematically replaced elite American-born Spaniards in positions in the civil and religious spheres, so that anti-Spanish sentiment now fell on Spanish clerics. When Mexico expelled peninsular-born Spaniards in 1827, many bishops and other members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy left, leaving all high church positions vacant until 1840. The lack of bishops and parish priests meant that the connection between Mexican Catholics and the institution of the church was damaged, weakening its authority and its influence among the vast number of poor parishioners. During the early 1830s, under vice president Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, the Mexican state undertook an early reform of church-state relations, with the backing of Mexican liberals. The missions in the northern regions were secularized and their resources confiscated, the educational system, previously in the hands of the Church, was secularized; the state ceased collecting tithes, a 10% tax on agricultural output, on behalf of the church, and declared monastic vows were no longer binding. President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna reasserted his role as head of state and cancelled the anti-clerical measures, but they were a precursor to the mid-nineteenth-century liberal Reform.Timothy J. Henderson, \\"Church and State, 1821-1910\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, pp. 253-54. Conflicts with Indigenous peoples in Northern Mexico  The 1832 boundaries of Comancheria, the Comanche homeland In Alta California during the late colonial era the Franciscans had established missions from San Diego in the south to the San Franciscan bay area in the north. In 1824, indigenous in four central coast missions revolted against ill-treatment by non-indigenous authorities. The Chumash revolt was suppressed, the mission indigenous pardoned and urged to return to the missions, but the revolt was serious and challenged the narrative of peaceful mission indigenous. The republic would largely adopt Spanish colonial policy with regard to the Apache, establicimiento, or the system by which the Spanish sought to settle the Apache and make them sedentary by offering these Apaches de Paz (Peaceful Apaches) goods and land in exchange for peace and abandonment of nomadic lifestyle. The Mexican state followed the practice of its Spanish colonial predecessor, with inadequate military resources to suppress the northern indigenous groups that did not recognize outsiders sovereignty over their territory. Mexico faced an insufficient defense network against the Comanches and Apaches in the Northern States. Even going so far as to include a royal signature, pre-Republican Mexico reinstated Spanish Indian policies to the letter. While some peace treaties did exist between locals and los indios, the peace did not last long, as Apaches would often simply take their violence elsewhere when villages proved to be too difficult to raid. With these ineffective policies in place, combined with an ever-evolving and adapting Comanche Empire,Tutino, John. 2013. \\"4. Globalizing the Comanche empire.\\" History & Theory 52, no. 1: 67-74. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed April 21, 2017). the Early Republic faced a formidable foe with an inadequate infrastructure. The lack of appropriate defense against raids might not have been so large of a problem for the Republic, if establicimiento had not all but been forgone by the 1830s, with post-independence 1820s economic instability causing many regions to drastically reduce rations to the Apaches de Paz. The Apache were supplied with guns by US American merchants. Goods including guns and shoes were sold to the Apache, the latter being discovered by Mexican forces when they found traditional Apache trails with American shoe prints instead of moccasin prints. The cycle of heightened violence between Mexicans and Apaches further destabilized the Republic, with bloody and violent suppression of Apaches. Discontent among the northern Mexican states reached a peak in 1837, when the governor of the Sonora declared that \\"the United States has already as much as declared a state of war between our two nations\\" with regard to both the annexation of Texas and the illegal enterings/selling of weapons committed by United States' citizens.  End of the First Mexican Republic  General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna Under Mexican army General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, a former federalist turned centralist and eventual dictator, the conservative forces in Mexico suspended the 1824 Constitution and replaced it with the Siete Leyes (\\"Seven Laws\\") in 1835. The Seven Laws transformed the federated republic into a unitary state known as the Centralist Republic of Mexico. Several states openly rebelled against these changes. Northern Coahuila y Tejas, San Luis Potos√≠, Quer√©taro, Durango, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n, Yucat√°n, Jalisco, Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas all disapproved. Civil war quickly spread across the Mexican states, and three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucat√°n. The Texas Revolution was already underway when the Siete Leyes came into force, and the new powers of the Mexican central government were yet another grievance for their movement.

The main building on the complex dates back to 1789, and is claimed to be the oldest surviving wooden residential building in the state. However, architectural analyses of the Biddle and McGulpin houses on Mackinac Island indicate they could date back as far as 1780. The Navarre‚ÄìAnderson complex was established by the early French settlers Francois Navarre and John Anderson, who were among the first to settle the area of present-day Monroe. In addition to the main building, which also served as a house, the cookhouse building was built in 1810. The original barn is no longer standing, but a 1790s replica was built on the complex.

He developed Barrington Plaza, at the time the largest privately built apartment development in the western United States. Early life Lesser was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family. He attended Hollywood High School and was very successful at making extra money selling magazines. On graduation, he turned down a supervisory job offer from the magazine company, instead joining his father's women's clothing manufacturing business. Business career Early career Whilst working in his father's women's clothing business, Lesser addressed the lack of merchandising and enlarged the business through bulk sales to volume dealers. He left in 1945, when he was drafted into the army. After he came out of service, in 1947 he purchased ranches which produced meat and fruit in anticipation of the removal of WWII price ceilings on fruit, profiting when they were just five days after the purchase. A couple of years later he sold the ranches and purchased a group of gas stations and associated businesses. His self-service stations were ultimately merged with the Sunset Oil Company, where he served briefly as vice-president until his retirement aged 36. Concurrent with his gas station business, in 1950-51 he was involved in Torrance Gardens, a 437 unit real estate development venture in Torrance, California.

Lesser made use of the Capehart Act to secure funding to build housing for military personnel, developing over 3,000 units at 14 military installations across the US, with a total construction value of $35 million. He developed an industrial centre near the Los Angeles International Airport in 1956-1957, leasing buildings worth $9 million. He began development of another $7.5 million extension to a Convair site in San Diego in 1959, also to be leased to the company. He purchased the Beckman Instrument Plant at Newport Beach, worth over $12 million, in 1958, and leased it to the Hughes Aircraft Company. In 1959, he was brought in as a partner in Ben Deane's Barrington Plaza development, subsequently becoming the sole sponsor and buying out Deane in June 1961. The plaza was completed in 1962, and comprised 712 apartments in one 27 and two 17 story buildings, making it both the largest, and the tallest, privately built apartment complex west of Chicago. The original application for a $14 million Federal Housing Administration loan was described as the largest single application for an insurance commitment under the urban renewal program ever filed in the United States; the actual initial loan was $15.2 million towards the end of 1959. Along with San Diego developer Irvin Kahn, in 1960 he developed two motels on the Shelter Island reclamation project costing $5.7 million. He participated the 1961 Casa Conejo development, in the Conejo Valley, and was the largest developer there, building 1,000 homes. In association with Irvin Kahn, and others, Lesser was heavily involved in developing bowling complexes in California, with the Los Angeles Times suggesting that he was the most active developer in this area by 1962. In 1964, he developed an $118 million off- campus student residential center for California State University, Los Angeles, which housed over 3000 students. He initiated a 22-story, 236 unit apartment structure named \\"Lesser Towers\\", in 1962, when it was budgeted to cost $7 million. Development setbacks caused by litigation caused the project to stand idle in the early stages of construction for more than three years. In 1965, a new builder was brought in to finish development. Lesser purchased the Phillips Ranch near Pomona in 1964 for $17.5 million. At 2,241 acres, it was one of the largest parcels of undeveloped land in Los Angeles County. He intended to build 10,000 homes over five years, with planning to be completed by the end of the year. Following two years of losses, Lesser resigned as chairman of Louis Lesser Enterprises in 1967 and accepted a bailout from Henry Salvatori, at which point the company was renamed Western Orbis Company.  Personal life  He was married to Jeanne Lesser, from sometime before 1945, until her death in 2006. They had four children, Craig, Therese, Kathy and Francine. Lesser died on 29 January 2013.

It is the UK Governments position that the UK cannot disengage from Afghanistan and retains an active military presence (particularly Helmand province) because of the continued terrorist threat facing Britain and the world.The Prime Minister Gordon Brown speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies on Afghanistan - National Security and Regional Stability, 4 September 2009, accessed: 16 October 2009, Building a strong Afghan state is a long and difficult task.Operations in Afghanistan: Our Strategy, Ministry of Defence, http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/OperationsFactsheets/OperationsInAfghanistanOurStrategy.htm The Liberal-Conservative coalition government (May 2010 - Current) has declared that Afghanistan is the UK's top foreign policy priority.  Strategic Threat  In 2001 the Taliban regime in Afghanistan enabled Al-Qaeda to plot terror around the world and this led to tragic consequences of 9/11. As the Taliban were removed from power and Al-Qaeda, including their training camps, was driven from Afghanistan by Coalition forces, Al-Qaeda has relocated to the remote mountains of Pakistan's northwest frontier province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).Letter to Rt Hon Alan Williams MP, Chairman of the Committee, from the Prime Minister, dated 11 July 2009, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmliaisn/257/9071602.htm The main threat continues to originate from Al-Qaeda and the Pakistan part of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Al-Qaeda retains some contacts and provides limited support to the Afghan-Pakistan insurgency, principally through the provision of training for foreign fighters and military expertise; continues to view Afghanistan as fundamental in the establishment of a pan- Islamic caliphate; and therefore a peaceful and stable Afghanistan would be a severe propaganda blow and strategic failure for Al-Qaeda. If the Taliban are allowed to undermine legitimate government in either Afghanistan or Pakistan, that would enable Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups to have greater freedom and a sanctuary from which to train, plan and launch terrorist attacks across the world - and would have longer term implications for the credibility of NATO and the international community - and for the stability of both this crucial region and globally. The UK's position, both under the Labour Government (April 2009 - May 2010) and the Liberal-Conservative coalition governmentMr David Cameron, Prime Minister's Statement on Afghanistan, 14 June 2010, http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/statements-and-articles/2010/06/pm- statement-on-afghanistan-51813 (May 2010 - current), is that the prevention of terrorism on the streets of the UK, America and other countries depends on providing stability in the region spanning the Afghanistan-Pakistan border through strengthening the authorities in both Pakistan and Afghanistan to defeat Al-Qaeda, and also the Pakistan and Afghan Taliban. In July 2009 the Director-General of the UK Security Service estimated that three quarters of the most serious plots against the UK have links into this region. As of June 2010, the Prime Minister stated that the threat to the UK from Al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and Pakistan has reduced, primarily due to the current strategy, although this was assessed as not yet irreversible. As of May 2011 it was the UK's position that there was still a threat that Al-Qaeda could reestablish itself within the region and therefore a continued military presence was still needed.  The Strategic End State  The UK, under both the Labour (April 2009 - May 2010) and Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition (May 2010 - current) Governments, considered the end-state to be the long term denial of both Afghanistan and Pakistan as a base for Al-Qaeda under Taliban authority.  Tactical Threat  In 2006, the UK deployed (approx) 3000 troops in Helmand province, Southern Afghanistan. During 2006-2009 the UK forces were stretchedReadiness and recuperation of the Armed Forces: looking towards the Strategic Defence Review, House of Commons Defence Committee, Fourth Report of Session 2009‚Äì10, 2 February 2010, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmdfence/53/53.pdf and ISAF did not possess sufficient manpower to clear, hold and thereby extend security and governance to the wider Regional Command South. Further, other NATO members were unable to provide additional forces and Afghan Security Forces were in their infancy. The US surge of additional troops, equipment and resources of 2009/10 into Southern Afghanistan, increased the ISAF presence within Helmand to 20,000 US Marines, with approx 8,000 UK forces. Hence, up until the US surge, its focus on more highly populated and urbanised areas in Helmand province. The surge and continued growth of the Afghan Security Forces have enabled a rebalancing of the ISAF presence in the main populated areas in Helmand. This has facilitated the concentration of UK forces within a smaller geographic area, therefore since August 2010 it is the UK's position that it has the number of troops and the right level of equipment to fulfil the strategy.The Secretary of State for Defence (Dr Liam Fox), Statement to the House of Commons, 14 February 2011, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110214/debtext/110214-0002.htm#11021413000002 During 2006-2009 the Taliban did not possess the means to defeat ISAF through conventional means, and ISAF did not possess sufficient soldiers per population for an effective counter-insurgency strategy this enabled a stalemate situation in which the Taliban, to a greater extent than ISAF, through operating as a guerrilla force, has tactical freedom of manoeuvre and safe-havens from which to operate in central Helmand. The Taliban having failed in 2006 and 2007 to defeat international forces by conventional means, have more than doubled their Improvised explosive device (IED) attacks over the past year and this remains the greatest challenge. International casualties for September 2009 were almost double September 2008, and three quarters of these were due to IEDs. Helmand is where the insurgency is concentrating its efforts, with over a third of the violence in the whole of Afghanistan (figures as of July 2009). The stalemate situation resulted in Southern Afghanistan in July 2009 being largely ungoverned by legitimate elected authority, it was instead governed by a shadow Taliban government.The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband), House of Commons Debates, 16 July 2009, Volume No. 496, Part No. 113, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090716/debtext/90716-0010.htm In July 2009 the Afghan army and police could not yet maintain control of Afghanistan without direct assistance from ISAF. Whilst the 1,600 mile (2,600 km) Afghan-Pakistan border (the Durand line) is porous in many places and allows the free flow of militants. By June 2010 the Afghan Police were assessed to be ineffective or barely able to operate in 6 of the 13 key provinces in General McChrystal's plan. By February 2011, Afghan Government control has increased from six districts to 12 out of a total of 14 within Helmand; this progress was attributed to the troop surge and increased Afghan security forces.Prime Minister David Cameron, House of Commons Debate Transcript: Column 853, 2 February 2011, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110202/debtext/110202-0001.htm#11020248000010  The UK's Approach  The UK's approach, under both the Labour (April 2009 - May 2010) and Liberal-Conservative coalition (May 2010 - Current) governments, is based on the tenets of the Comprehensive approach (or Interagency approach in US parlance), whereby success will require a combination of military, economic and political solutions pursued together. It is part of a wider coordinated and integrated military-civilian counter-insurgency strategy with its international coalition allies and Afghan authorities. It involves global co-operation as well as joint and complementary action on both sides of the border region separating Afghanistan and Pakistan. The UK's position under the Labour government (April 2009 - May 2010) was to continually adapt and improve its strategy for Central Helmand to achieve the end state and did not seek to prematurely disengage from the region. It is the UK's position that long-term stability depends on the Government of Afghanistan being able to sustain its own security, offer representative government at all levels, improve economic prospects for its people, and play a constructive role in the region. The tactics utilised by ISAF and the Afghan security forces to gradually extend security and stability are: * Clear. Removing insurgents from an area; * Hold. Providing sustained security through sufficient forces and resources per population; * Build. Building both Afghan governance and development, delivered in an integrated manner. The UK's stated objectives from April 2009 - May 2010 have developed under the Liberal-Conservative coalition government (May 2010 - Current), the following reflect the position:  Afghan Security  End State Objective: A secure Afghanistan in which the Afghan Government and civilian population are protected from sources of instability and violence. Transition of lead responsibility of security. In the near term the UK seeks to provide the underpinning stability and security to create space for the development of the Afghan authorities to a point where they are able to provide, on a sustainable basis, the capability and governance to manage their own security in order to support the political settlement in ending the insurgency and continue to prevent the use of Afghanistan as a base from which terrorists can plot and launch attacks. Unlike the previous Labour Government, that did not state a definitive time schedule for achieving objectives within their overall strategy, the current coalition government (May 2010-current) have declared that the UK will begin to transfer lead responsibility for security from the UK to the Afghan government in early 2011, with the intention for the full transfer to be completed by the end of 2014.Prime Minister Mr David Cameron and President Karzai Press conference, 8 December 2010, http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/12/press- conference-with-president-karzai-57937 This will allow British troops within a combat role to withdraw from Afghanistan by 2015, which was described as a \\"firm deadline\\".Mr David Cameron, Prime Minister, Press conference at the NATO Summit in Lisbon, 20 November 2010 However, the transfer of security responsibility for districts and provinces to Afghan control will happen as soon as they are ready based on the conditions on the ground and not timetables. Over time there will be greater Afghan autonomy and responsibility. As part of this UK forces will support: * Offensive military action. ISAF must conduct Offensive military action during Clear and Hold against the insurgents who continue to pose a major threat to the legitimate Afghan Government either with the support of, or in support of, the developing Afghan security forces until they are able to sustain their own security. * Isolating the insurgents from support of the Afghan population. Isolated insurgents without the support of the Afghan population, undermining the insurgents capacity both to regenerate, which includes its ability to recruit and adapt. It is the UK's position that an Afghan lead is vital for both security operations and for building support. * Training, mentoring and development.

Once the Afghan authorities are capable of sustaining their own security and the lead responsibility for security has transitioned to Afghan control by the end of 2014, the UK will continue to support the elected Afghan government via its developing long term partnership plan militarily, politically and economically.  Afghan Governance  End State Objective: Effective, legitimate Afghan governance at every level, working with the confidence of local communities, to help them to shape their own future by providing a political voice for all Afghans, with consistency, not corruption, at its heart. * Effective Governance. Supporting the development of educated, capable Afghans willing to take on a role within the Afghan Government and Civil Service. * Rights and Civil Society. The development of both a system of rights reflecting the will of the Afghan people and a civil society that will hold the Afghan Government to account at all levels. * Justice and dispute resolution. Development, by Afghans, of impartial and accessible systems of justice and dispute resolution that respond to the desire for predictable and non-corrupt justice applied equally to the governing and the governed. This includes the development of both the formal sector and informal community based sector. * Isolating the insurgent shadow governance mechanisms. Isolated Taliban shadow governors, institutions and dispute resolution, undermining the perceived legitimacy of the insurgents with the Afghan population. * Political Settlement. It is the UK's position that the realisation of a long term stability in Afghanistan is achieved through a political settlement that enables the population to 'feel that it's their government, their country and that they have a role to play'. It is the UK's position that this cannot be achieved through military means alone,The UK's Foreign Policy Approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Fourth Report from the Foreign Affairs Committee session 2010-11, Response of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, May 2011, http://www.official- documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8064/8064.pdf although the UK considers it important to the political process to maintain \\"intensified military pressure\\". Increasingly from early 2011, the UK considers that Afghanistan is not in a vacuum, that a regional settlement is required that needs to consider its relationships with its neighbours and the long-term implications of the settlement in the region in order to generate constructive relationships supporting sustainable stability. The UK considers that: : # The process must be led by the Afghan Government and supported by the UK. : # The political settlement will comprise many initiatives involving multiple parties and regional leaderships, appear \\"messy\\", but ultimately \\"Afghan-based, Afghan- focused and Afghan-dependent\\". : # Those Taliban and insurgents who are not ideologically committed to Al-Qaeda, reconcilable to the basic tenets of the Afghan constitution and the concept of democratic government, willing to reject and renounce violence should be reintegrated and reconciled with Afghan society. : # Those who are irreconcilable need to be dealt with by military means.  Afghan Development  End State Objective: An Afghan Government able to maintain the support of the Afghan population by being responsive to its needs and delivering meaningful economic and social progress enabling the Afghan population to feel that they have more of a stake in their well being. * Essential services and Quality of Life. The UK must support the development of education, health care, electricity, clean water, jobs and economic development, alongside fair justice. * Economic Liberty. The Afghan population able to exercise their economic liberty inside a free market.  Afghan- Pakistan co-operation  End State Objective: Extending the writ of the Pakistani authorities over the Northwest frontier province and FATA. * Comprehensive approach. Complementary strategies and co-operation between ISAF, and Afghan and Pakistani forces on either side of the border region involving a comprehensive approach based on security, governance and development. The UK considers that the \\"greatest strategic challenge is security in the wider region, including security in the vulnerable cross- border area\\".The Secretary of State for Defence Mr Philip Hammond, Statement to Parliament, 18 October 2011, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111018/debtext/111018-0001.htm#11101851000004  References   External links  * Operations in Afghanistan: Our Strategy War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) ","title":"Strategy for Operation Herrick"},{"id":"25126800","text":"Bluegrass Album, Vol. 3 ‚Äî California Connection is a third album by bluegrass supergroup, Bluegrass Album Band, released in 1983.

Gonzalo Fonseca (2 July 1922 ‚Äì 11 June 1997) was a Uruguayan artist known for his stone sculpting. He originally studied to be an architect at the University of Montevideo, but discovered modern art in 1942 after working in the Taller Torres-Garcia workshop. He studied painting in the workshop until 1949, and became interested in pre-Columbian art during that time. Fonseca is frequently associated with the movement Universal Constructivism. Biography Fonseca was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in July 1922. He traveled to Europe in the 1930s, and was exposed to archaeology, anthropology, and history. Fonseca also taught himself to sculpt in stone and paint with watercolor. In 1939, he began studying architecture at the University of Montevideo. However, in 1942 Fonseca left the University to work with Joaquin Torres-Garcia. While working at the Torres-Garcia workshop, he became more diverse in his techniques, trying sculpting, painting, ceramics, and drawing. During the course of the 1940s, Fonseca traveled through Peru and Bolivia, studying art with other members of the Torres-Garcia workshop. In 1950 he left Uruguay, and traveled through several countries in Europe and the Middle East. Fonseca worked in excavations run by Flinders Petrie in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and traveled through Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. These archeological digs would prove fundamental in his future artworks. While living in Europe, he worked in ceramics as well as painting. He met and married Elizabeth Kaplan, from New York City, in the mid-1950s (and divorced two decades later) and moved to Manhattan in 1958 after being awarded a Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. He had four children, Quina, Bruno, Caio, and Isabel with Elizabeth Kaplan, two of whom (Bruno Fonseca and Caio Fonseca) became renowned artists. Their youngest child Isabel Fonseca became a writer. In 1962 Fonseca had his first exhibition in the United States, at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. This exhibition contained mostly flat compositions, as was common with the works done by the Torres-Garcia workshop at that time. Fonseca also created wooden reliefs for this exhibition, which laid a foundation for his three-dimensional art. He began working in New York and in Italy, near Carrara. It is in the 1970s that he focuses on painting towards sculpture and on three-dimensional architectural forms. He started working on large scale pieces mostly of marble, and recycled limestone from New York's demolished buildings. In 1983, he became a citizen of the United States. During the late 1970s and 1980s he became more focused on towers, such as Torre del recien nacido (\\"Tower of the Newborn Child\\") and Torre de los vientos. He had few solo shows throughout his career, but several group exhibitions in which he became known for his stone sculptures of modern influenced architectural forms. He died in Italy at the age of 74 in Seravezza, Italy, in his studio. Iconology As a Universal Constructivist, Fonseca sought to focus on art outside of nationality. This is clear in the amount of traveling and excavating he did, not trying to define a national identity but rather a universal identity, free of false stereotypes. Fonseca's influence on his art derived from a fascination with history and cultures, and his early training as an architect helped him realize and formulate his sculptures. His pieces offer a sense of mystery, and yet a deeper meaning. Fonseca's sculptures take architectural reference as well as that of ancient ruins and what he studied while taking part in excavations. This causes the viewer to recognize and identify parts of the sculpture, perhaps relating them to the characteristics of a building or home. But the way in which he manifests these pieces still leaves something to be defined by the viewer in relation to time and space. His works do not automatically construct a definite time period in the viewer's mind, leaving it to the imagination as to what it may or may not represent in time and space. Fonseca was very interested in the nature and history of the stones used in his sculpture. While working in the quarries, he would notice the changes in the stone due to climate. It is said that the fragile nature of many of these stones is why Fonseca had so few exhibitions: sand did not travel well. Fonseca's sculpture has two clear features. The first is the intimacy that causes one to relate innately to his works. The other feature is the grandeur in his sculpture, strengthened by the simplicity of the geometric forms. His art is known as \\"a journey through the history of archeology.\\" The archeological basis stems from Precolombian architecture as well as Eastern Mediterranean, and even New York City architecture. It was clear that archeology spread through all of Fonseca's work. Fonseca's artworks also tend to be a labyrinth of thought. Some of the works contain inscriptions that may give a glimpse, but do not truly allow much insight into his mind. There are many stairways and ladders in his sculptures, which lead to tombs such as the quarries he worked in. Fonseca shared that these ladders also show the \\"descent into the infernos.\\" Selected artworks Torre de los vientos (\\"Tower of the Winds\\"), 1974. This sculpture was constructed as a tribute to the Greek architect Andronicus. Andronicus had built a tower in Athens to commemorate the gods of the winds. Fonseca's tribute had four sides, each side with Latin inscriptions indicating the four different kinds of winds in Greek mythology. The four winds are the North wind known as Boreas, which brought hail; the East morning wind known as Eurus; the South wind known as Noto, which brought sorrow; and the mild wind from the West known as Zephirus, which was feared by the sailors. The dome on top likely symbolizes the center of the world, with its inscription Onphalos. El Pilar (\\"The Pilar\\"), 1986, 1990, 1997. This sculpture was precisely carved and was placed in three separate contexts: Seravezza, Italy, Pietrasanta, Italy, and the entrance of Uruguay's Pavilion at the XLIV Biennale Di Venezia. It contains a ladder, which is common in Fonseca's work, which is known to relate to both the Hebrew ladder of Jacob and also the ladders in the quarries he excavated in. Columbarium Major, 1976. This sculpture is known for its contrast in change of scale. There are multiple cuts into the wood filled with geometric forms, as well as his well-known stairways. This artwork also contains \\"betilos\\", known as sacred stones. La Casa (\\"The House\\"), 1963. This artwork was a relief painting with engravings of ladders and figures. It also included wood-carved objects hanging from the top corner of the painting. Graneros III, 1971‚Äì1975. This work was part of horizontal, heavy slabs that were displayed as urban projects for participants to interact with. It was carved of red travertine marble. It mimics the form of an actual grain store, but also refers to a store of knowledge, with the grain representing the knowledge. XIX Olympiad Fonseca designed and created a 12-meter high concrete tower as his contribution to the \\"Route of Friendship\\" (Spanish: La Ruta de la Amistad) of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was titled Torre. This structure recalls the shape of the Malwiya, the spiral minaret of the Great Mosque of Samarra. It is hollow, and was later converted into a studio, then used as an artists' exhibition space from 1997 to 2004. The XIX Olympiad was significant in that these were the first Olympic Games held in Latin America. The \\"Route of Friendship\\" contained nineteen concrete sculptures on the highway surrounding the capital. This was a collaboration of architect Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and German sculptor Mathias Goeritz. The goal was to give a universal quality to the Games with sculptures from around the world. This structure is not to be confused with La Torre de los Vientos, or The Tower of the Winds, which was built in 1974 as a tribute.Wendl, Karel.

The Hi- MAX was originally produced by TEAM Incorporated of Bradyville, Tennessee. After that company was bankrupted by a lawsuit production passed to Ison Aircraft also of Bradyville, Tennessee and next to JDT Mini-MAX of Nappanee, Indiana. The company was renamed Team Mini-Max in 2012 and moved to Niles, Michigan. Development The Hi-MAX was developed from the mid-winged Mini- MAX family of single seat kit aircraft and it shares many similar features with the earlier design. The Hi-MAX is predominantly constructed from wood truss with plywood gussets and covered with doped aircraft fabric. The windshield is Lexan and the side windows are removable for warm weather operations. The aircraft features a short-span wing of only and a fiberglass engine cowling. The wing and horizontal stabilizer are both strut-braced, the tail with struts above the horizontal tail surface to the fin. The aircraft has conventional landing gear, with wheel pants as an option. The company claims that a builder can complete the aircraft in 350‚Äì400 hours from the kit. The aircraft was originally intended to meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including that category's maximum empty weight. It was only able to achieve that low empty weight with the Rotax 277, which provided marginal performance. The standard specified engine today is the Rotax 447 which results in a empty weight and places the aircraft in the US Experimental - Amateur-built category.

Childhood and early bands  Constantinou was born at Charing Cross Hospital in London and at the age of three he moved to Plymouth. He went to Plymouth College before a brief spell at Plymouth Art College. He performed with school and garage bands supporting 1970s artists such as King Crimson, Snafu, and Sassafras. His professional career started when he joined Diz Watson, the renowned exponent of New Orleans blues/Professor Longhair-style piano and barrel house blues, as bass player. In 1977, he formed the rock band The Drill. Acting as co-writer and bassist, they first signed to Ebony Records before moving to RCA Records for a string of singles, several of which were produced by Chas Chandler.John Earls, \\"The artist formerly known as Chris de Niro\\", Classic Pop magazine, p. 78-81, issue 19, October/November 2015  Music career   1980s: Chris De Niro era  In 1982 Constantinou joined Adam Ant's live band as bass guitarist and backing vocalist in time for the Friend or Foe album tour and the video for the single Desperate But Not Serious. He also took a minor acting role as Toulouse Lautrec in the video for Ant's 1983 single Strip.Liner notes, Adam Ant Hits VHS compilation, CBS Fox Video 649950, 1986 Ant later pared down his eight- piece touring outfit to a four piece which first appeared on TV performances of Ant's UK top 5 single \\"Puss 'N Boots\\" in late 1983 before becoming a full time touring/recording unit in mid 1984. Under the pseudonym Chris De Niro, Constantinou became an integral part of the mid-1980s \\"Ant/Marco/Wiczling/De Niro\\" line up which recorded the UK Top 20 single \\"Apollo 9\\" and parent album Vive Le Rock, both of which were produced by Tony Visconti. Constantinou's performances in Ant's band included Top of the Pops, Saturday Night Live, American Bandstand and, on stage, Radio City Music Hall and 1985's Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium. Parting with Ant in 1985, Constantinou spent time with SF Go, a Miles Copeland III-managed band he had formed with Danny Kustow (TRB, Glen Matlock).  1990s: JackieOnAssid era  At the beginning of the 1990s, Constantinou formed a band with Bow Wow Wow's Annabella Lwin, fronted by Annabella with Chris as co-writer, bassist and backing vocalist. They built a substantial following hit singles like Do What You Do (Sony, 1994), a dancefloor hit thanks to remixes from Farley & Heller and Junior Vasquez. The project was produced by Steve Lironi (Fun Lovin' Criminals, Happy Mondays). In this period, Chris also had a songwriting partnership with Guy Chambers. Chris took centre stage to form post-punk outfit JackieOnAssid in 1996. As lead singer, songwriter and bassist, JackieOnAssid toured Europe three times, released two albums (2001's 4Play and 2002's Zip Me Up) and supported Iggy Pop. The videos for these singles were directed by award-winning British film maker Paul Hills. He later featured the band's Meditation Man single in his 2003 movie The Poet (Dougray Scott/Laura Elena Harring).  2000s: The Wolfmen era  In 2004 Chris began work on his project, The Wolfmen for which he handled lead vocals, co-writing, bass and various other instruments. It saw him reunite with another former Ant, songwriter/guitarist Marco Pirroni, to blend a sound described by Mojo magazine as \\"exuberant filth... Chris and Marco do growing old disgracefully with style.‚Äù Constantinou played on The Slits' EP, Revenge of the Killer Slits in 2006 and co-wrote tracks \\"The Wolf Is Getting Married\\" (Single 2012) \\"I had a Baby\\" (Album track 2012) for Sin√©ad O'Connor's album, How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?, released in March 2012. A collaboration with Daler Mehndi in 2007 materialized in the Bhangra / rock single Two Eyes (Do Naina), which topped the BBC Asian Network charts.  2010s: The Mutants era  In January 2013, Chris Constantinou developed in a discussion with Eugene Butcher, editor from the magazine Vive Le Rock, and Dave Collins the idea of an album set out to retrace the roots of punk, new wave and ska, featuring all-star punk musicians. It materialized in the creation of the musical supergroup The Mutants, with Chris Constantinou and Paul Frazer as core members, later also joined by Rat Scabies. After a series of initial projects (like Nuclear Wasteland, made at the disaster site in Chernobyl), the first album, Rhythm and Punk Review, was released in July 2014. A subsequent album, Tokyo Nights, released in May 2015, had all the songs fronted by a rotating set of Japanese guest stars. The third album, Your Desert My Mind (October 2016), is a collaboration with a series of guests from the Californian desert rock scene, among them David Catching from Eagles of Death Metal, Chris Goss from Masters of Reality, Brent DeBoer, Peter Holmstr√∂m and Zia McCabe from The Dandy Warhols, Sean Wheeler from Throw Rag and Victoria Williams. The album was recorded at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California. In October 2016, The Mutants also went on a tour in California together with the guests Chris Goss, Sean Wheeler and Bingo Richey. As a guest musician, Chris played flute with The Dandy Warhols, Holy Holy (the album The Man Who Sold the World Live in London), Brant Bjork & Sean Wheeler, Andreas Grega (the albums Mikrouli Mou and Vallar Av Sn√∂), and Nerina Pallot (the album Fires). He also guested on bass in the 2016 UK Station to Station tour by Earl Slick and Bernard Fowler. In June 2016, he released with The Mutants the mini album Time For a Drink (post Production Courtney Taylor-Taylor & Brandon Eggleston).

He was part of the revivalist movement of the Lutheran Church in the 19th century, ran the Lutheran faith-based newspaper Lutheran Observer, founded the Lutheran faith-based Missionary Institute (Susquehanna University) in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and assisted in the founding of the Gettysburg Seminary. Early life Benjamin Kurtz was born February 28, 1795, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His family came from a line of German Lutheran ministers and religious affiliates. His uncle, Dr. John Daniel Kurtz, was one of the founders of the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of America, and had studied under Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, founder of Muhlenberg College, and served as a minister in York, Pennsylvania and Baltimore, Maryland. His grandfather, Dr. John Nicholas Kurtz, a clergyman from Lutzelinden, Nassau-Weilburg, Germany and a graduate from the University of Halle, arrived in Pennsylvania on January 15, 1745 and served as a minister in Tulpehocken and York, Pennsylvania. Kurtz began his studies in Harrisburg Academy, where he, by the age of fifteen, would become an assistant teacher. At the age of eighteen, Kurtz began studying theology at Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and two years later was licensed to preach. At that time, in 1815, he became an assistant preacher to his uncle, John Daniel Kurtz, then a pastor at Baltimore. That same year, he became a pastor at Hagerstown, Maryland, where he remained for sixteen years. In 1831, he moved to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to lead a ministry, where he would remain for another three years. In 1833, Kurtz retired from active ministry duties and took charge of the Lutheran Observer, a post which he held for nearly thirty years. In 1838, he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Washington College in Washington, Pennsylvania, and in 1858, that of LL. D. from Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio. Legacy Kurtz was regarded as one of the most eloquent men of his time. He was a zealous advocate of revivals, and had very little sympathy with the confessional writings of the Lutheran church. For this, Wilhelm Sihler of the Missouri Synod criticized Kurtz, terming him \\"apostate\\" and asserting that Kurtz and other like-minded leaders of the General Synod were \\"open counterfeiters, Calvinists, Methodists, and Unionists...traitors and destroyers of the Lutheran Church\\".Bente, F. American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, 116. Kurtz was one of the founders of the General Synod and of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, and for more than thirty years was one of the trustees of Pennsylvania College and of the board of directors of the seminary. He was also the founder of Missionary Institute (now Susquehanna University)Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge at Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. During his two European tours, in 1825 and 1846, he contributed interesting incidents and reminiscences to the Lutheran Intelligencer and to the Lutheran Observer. A General Synod leader, he was twice its president. He collaborated in Samuel Simon Schmucker's (q.v., Vol. X) Definite Synodical Platform, and championed doctrinal positions differing from the Lutheran Confessions. He was also a prominent Lutheran publisher, publishing religious topics regarding faith and religious child rearing. Susquehanna University alt= Benjamin Kurtz founded the Missionary Institute in 1858, and led the institution as its first president from 1858 to 1865, during which he was also the first professor of the Theology Department. In 1895, the Missionary Institute merged with its sister college, Susquehanna Female College, to form Susquehanna University.

The entire region is known to have cold winters and warm summers, leading to a winter deciduous forest dominated by tall broadleaf species. The vegetation is separated into three distinct associations: Appalachian oak, pine-oak, and mixed mesophytic. The mixed mesophytic is found on the Appalachian Plateaus and has a great diversity of vegetative species, including American beech, tuliptree (or yellow-poplar), several basswoods, sugar maple, sweet buckeye, red oak, white oak, and eastern hemlock. The pine-oak forests are found along the sandy Coastal Plains and have a think shrub understory. The Appalachian oak forests are found east of the mountains and in mid-range elevations and are dominated by white oak and northern red oak. The upper elevations of the mountains also have a distinct northeastern hardwood forest where species such as birch, beech, maple, elm, red oak, and basswood, hemlock and white pine can all be found. The highest elevation points are vegetated mainly by spruce-fir forest and meadows. The Adirondack Mountains in the far northeast of the United States are part of the Eastern forest-boreal transition zone between the boreal forests of the north and the deciduous forests of the south. Here a mixture of red spruce, fir, birch, maple, and beech are found. The mammal species found throughout the Northeast United States are similar to those of the Southeast and include whitetail deer, black bear, bobcat, gray fox, raccoon, eastern gray squirrel, fox squirrel, eastern chipmunk, white-footed mouse, pine vole, and cotton mouse. The Northeast has a very abundant bird population. Common game birds found in the region are turkey, ruffed grouse, bobwhite, and mourning dove. Other non-game birds found in abundance include the cardinal, Carolina wren, wood thrush, summer tanager, red-eyed vireo, blue-gray gnatcatcher, and tufted titmouse. In the mountain range other commonly found species include red-breasted nuthatches, black-throated green warblers, golden-crowned warblers, flickersworm-eating warblers, brilliant hooded warbler, golden-crowned kinglets, northern juncos, pileated woodpeckers, downy, hairy, and red-bellied woodpeckers, Louisiana waterthrush, wood thrush, ovenbird, summer tanager, and rose-breasted grosbeak. Common reptiles are the box turtle, common garter snake, timber rattlesnake, and 27 different species of salamanders. Species that are unique to the Adirondack Mountain range habitat are longtail shrew, boreal (southern) redback vole, gray-cheeked thrush, spruce grouse, and gray jay. =Ecotourism opportunities= The three different mountain ranges (Appalachian, Smoky, and Adirondack), ample coastlines, and the diversity of wildlife species, especially bird species, allow for many opportunities in ecotourism to develop. Southeast The Southeastern United States is dominated by a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of South Florida, which is designated as a tropical savannah. In the Southeastern US, long, hot, and wet summers (though still sunny), and mild winters create a lush landscape with many evergreen forests, especially from South Carolina south to central Florida. South Florida's tropical climate has a wet season from May through October, when the Bermuda High dominates and creates a deep flow of tropical air, and a dry season from November through April, when semi-arid conditions, sunshine, and dry weather prevail. Although the risk from a tropical cyclone in any one spot is small, there is also a risk of a hurricane from June through October. The typical vegetation in the Southeast is forests, with much of the sandy coastal regions dominated by old growth forests of loblolly pine, longleaf pine, shortleaf pine and slash pine. Some areas near the coast have subtropical evergreen forests with southern magnolia, Live oak, and palms in thick, jungle like areas, especially in parts of Florida and the coastal areas of Georgia. Inland areas have deciduous forests usually consisting of various pine species along with oak, hickory, sweetgum, blackgum, red maple and winged elm. The main grasses found in the Southeast are bluestem, panicums, and longleaf uniola, with dogwood, viburnum, haw, blueberry, American beautyberry, youpon, and numerous woody vines being common as well. The Gulf Coast area is bordered by salt marshes dominated by the marsh grass Spartina. In southern Florida the habitat is known as tropical savanna. Here plants must adapt to hot rainy conditions in summer, and dry nearly drought conditions in winter. As such, everything from cactus to towering palm trees are found across central and south Florida. The Florida Everglades is the \\"River of Grass\\", and seasonally flooded river grassland with 15 foot pythons and home to the American crocodile. This is region characterized as having open expanses of tall grasses, such as sawgrass and three-awns, interspersed with hardy, drought-resistant trees and shrubs. Many tropical trees found in the nearby Caribbean are found in southern Florida. Many native palms are found across southern Florida, including coconut palms (the only area they can grow on the US mainland). Cypress forests are extensive in this region, along with mangroves along the coastal areas. Off the coast of southern Florida and the Florida Keys the only coral reefs on the US mainland are present. Manatees are found in estuaries and channels throughout the state. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many hundreds of tropical fish species, some found only in Florida waters. Many Lizards and snake species are found in Florida. To the north in the southeast, many indigenous mammals are found. The greater southeastern USA is home to 70% of all bird and plant species found on the North American mainland. Many mammals inhabit this region including wolf, coyote, fox, raccoons, squirrels, eastern gray squirrels, cottontail rabbits, armadillos and opossums. Bobwhite and wild turkey are the main game bird that can be found in the region. Other very common birds found in the Southeast are mourning doves, pine warbler, cardinal, summer tanager, Carolina wren, ruby- throated hummingbird, blue jay, hooded warbler, eastern towhee, and tufted titmouse. Many non-game migratory birds and migratory waterfowl are common as well. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is also native to the region. Numerous species of reptiles and amphibians can be found here as well, such as the American alligator, common and alligator snapping turtles, fence and glass lizards, and salamanders. The forest snake species found include cottonmouth moccasin, copperhead, rough green snake, rat snake, coachwhip, and speckled kingsnake. Midwest =Environment and wildlife= The Midwestern United States is central and located inland. The area was once covered in glaciers. It is varied in geography and environment, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Great Lakes and the Great Plains, farther west. The Great Lakes states (Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) form a large drainage basin that feed into the lakes. The Great Plains states (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) are mainly prairies. Much of the land is used for farming. Forest zones in the region are a mix of pine trees, yellow birches, sugar maples, and American beech trees. The oak-hickory forests fade into prairie, but trees are still found near water sources. Soil is extremely varied, including peat, clay, silt, and sand. Many of the birds such as ptarmigan, migrate south for the winter. Other mammals in the region include gray squirrels, who feed on the acorns from the oak-hickory trees, fox squirrels, chipmunks, and prairie dogs. =Ecotourism opportunities= To protect the Great Plains wildlife, the American Prairie Foundation has established the American Prairie Reserve in Montana. It aims to restore bison, prairie dogs, and ferrets in the area. By restoring the prairies, the Foundation aims to improve enjoyment of the land and incur economic benefits through tourism to the area. Forging ecotourism cooperation partnership amongst foundations like the American Prairie and world natural heritage sites like the Chitwan National Park or Mt. Everest in Nepal may prove to be even more supportive towards making our planet a beautiful place to live in. Northwest The Northwest of the United States is dominated by the Cascade Mountain range and is characterized by cool winters that are very cloudy, and cool to mild summers. Rainfall ranging from 30 to 150 inches per year. These heavy rains have led to the growth of coniferous forests that include Douglas-fir, western redcedar, western hemlock, grand fir, silver fir, subalpine fir, whitebark pine, Sitka spruce, and Alaska cypress, along with an abundance of thick shrub understory. Along the coastal regions, however, glaciers and rivers dominate, leading to riparian forests that have broadleaf species such as black cottonwood and red alder. Common mammals include Sitka deer, Roosevelt elk, mountain lion, American black bear, Douglas squirrel, red tree vole, and Townsend's chipmunk. Important game birds are ruffed grouse and blue grouse. Other non-game bird species found in this region are winter wren, Townsend's warbler, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and spotted owl and marbled murrelet which rely on the old growth forests found in this region. The Pacific treefrog, Pacific giant salamander, northern alligator lizard, and rubber boa can also be found here. =Organizations in the Northwest= Oregon is home to several organizations that support businesses who follow ecologically sustainable practices. Some of these organization are Salmon-Safe (http://www.salmonsafe.org/), Oregon Environment Council (http://www.oeconline.org/), and SkiGreen (http://skigreen.org/). These organizations consult with businesses and communities in the Northwest to help promote such practices. Organizations such as Salmon-Safe, support businesses that use ecologically sustainable practices and will certify companies that comply to these standards. Southwest The southwest of the United States is the most arid region of the nation and this allows for a very different set of ecosystems and natural habitats to exist. Ecotourism in the southwest of the United States focuses around the natural areas of the Grand Canyon, Colorado River, desert areas and the Pacific Ocean. This part of the country has numerous herds of wild horses and burros which roam the wild lands of Nevada. Alaska Alaska's Boreal forest contains many varieties of tree, primarily black and white spruce but also including balsam poplar, aspen, and paper birch. It is the coldest terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Fire is common and is often caused by lightning or humans. Burnt organic materials enrich the soil, and the regrowth of vegetation allows for biodiversity. It is home to Arctic ground squirrels and northern flying squirrels, marmots, woodchucks, and birds such as gray jays, boreal chickadees, northern flickers, red-tailed hawks, and boreal owls. The climate in this region is very extreme, with exceptionally cold winters and hot summers. The Arctic tundra is flat and treeless, with extensive marshes and lakes. Winters are long and cold and the short summers also remain cool. A layer of permafrost, or frozen soil, lies beneath the tundra's surface. Permafrost limits plant growth since their roots are unable to reach very deep. Cottongrass-tussock is the most widespread type of vegetation in the region. Global warming poses a threat to this region and its permafrost. Alaska is home to a large brown bear population, including grizzly bears and Kodiak bears. Black bears and moose live throughout the state. Polar bears live along the coast in the Arctic tundra region; caribou are also concentrated in the tundra. Hawaii Being a chain of individually formed volcanic islands, the ecosystems of Hawaii are extremely numerous and diverse, including deserts, beaches, coral reefs, and rainforests. Hawaiian tropical rainforests are found on windward mountain slopes. Coral reefs are located close to the shore of the islands. The coastlines are rough and the climate is tropical and remains fairly steady due to the ocean and trade winds. Shrubs are found in the coastal lowlands. They are topped by forests sloping up the mountains. There are four major types of forest, varying with level of moisture. There are dry forests, wet forests, and those composed of ohia and treelike ferns and the koa tree. Bogs are found near the mountain tops. Hawaiian wildlife is unique in that the majority of it is endemic, or found only in that specific region. This is due to Hawaii's geographic isolation. Species arrived via wind, water, or flight. As a result of small populations and environmental and climatic variation within small areas, many endemic species are considered vulnerable or endangered. The Hawaiian goose, nene, is classified as vulnerable. The yellow hibiscus flower and the Hawaiian honeycreeper, po‚Äôouli, are endangered. There are many seabirds such as boobies and petrels. There are a few introduced mammals, such as the Hawaiian wild boar, and very few reptiles, including no native snakes.

The Polish people lived under the rule of the Russian Empire, the Austrian Empire and Prussia. Russian-ruled Poles The major part of the difficulties that the Pope faced with regard to the Polish people concerned those who were ruled by the Tsar. They faced discrimination and persecution at the hands of the government, which enforced Russification and attempted to separate priests and people from their church.Andrey Micewski, Cardinal Wyszynski, A biography, Harcourt, New York, 1984, p. 3 For the sake of good relations with the government, Pius opposed the Polish nationalist movements that were often making those relations tense. On the other hand, his protests against the government's actions in its Polish provinces were so strong that they led to an intervention by the Austrian Empire, another of the powers who had taken over part of Poland, with the aim of getting the Pope to be silent on the matter. Attempt to find middle ground Faced with problems from revolutionary movements in his Papal States, Pope Pius first tried to position himself in the middle, strongly opposing revolutionary and violent opposition against the governing authorities, while appealing to these for greater Church freedom. After the failure of the Polish uprising in 1863, he sided with the persecuted Poles, loudly protesting their persecution, infuriating the Tsarist government to the point that all Catholic sees were closed by 1870.Josef Schmidlin Papstgeschichte,K√∂stel-Pusztet M√ºnchen, 1922-1939, vol. II, pp. 213-224 Opposition to Polish protests Pope Pius opposed Polish protests in 1860 against Russian rule in the part of Poland that fell to Russia in the partitions of Poland, protests allegedly stimulated by the anti-papal mysticism of philosopher Andrzej Towia≈Ñski and influenced by Adam Mickiewicz. Nor was he pleased with patriotic anti-Russian sermons by the Polish clergy. This was interpreted as bowing to Russian interests and selling his Polish faithful. On June 6, 1861, Pope Pius IX wrote to Archbishop Antoni Melchior Fija≈Çkowski, complaining against unjust accusations by Polish nationalists and enumerating all he had done for the Polish people in the Russian Empire.Acta et decreta Pii IX, Pontificis Maximi, Rome, vol. III, p. 243 The Pope repeated his position, that Poles living under Russian rule had to obey Russian laws, while the Russian government had to provide religious freedom. Polish moderation and religious freedom His dualistic appeals for Polish moderation and religious freedom did not appease either party. Russia felt strong on its territory, and Poles had national aspirations, for which they used Catholic churches to meet, talk and inspire emotions with patriotic songs. Continued incidences convinced the assembled cardinals in the Vatican on December 7, 1861, that the conflict was political in nature. Religion was simply a pretext for national Polish aspirations. They advised the Pope to be reluctant in his utterances.L. Boudou, Le S. Si√®ge et la Russie, Paris, 1890, vol. II, p. 138 Conflict inside the Church and with Russia The conflict continued inside the Church and with the Russian government, which, however, established diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1861. When the Catholic metropolitan, supported by Antoni Melchior Fija≈Çkowski, banned patriotic Polish songs in churches, he was labelled a traitor, without gaining much support from the government. The mutual mistrust, persecution and the opening and closing of monasteries and dioceses continued in the following years.Boudou II, 188 However, since the papal delegate was not allowed to have any contact with the clergy, Pope Pius IX recalled his nuncio in 1863.Josef Schmidlin Papstgeschichte,K√∂stel-Pusztet M√ºnchen, 1922-1939, vol. II, p. 219 After the Polish upraising in the same year, Pope Pius IX on April 22, 1863, wrote to the Tsar, protesting the expropriation of Church properties, forced conversions, the jailing of the clergy. Tsar Alexander II replied that only politically revolutionary elements were punished. On August 20, the Pope protested and ordered a prayer novena for the persecuted Church. But the persecutions worsened: 330 priests were deported, a war tax was imposed on the clergy, and 114 Catholic monasteries were closed. 1863 encyclical Protests by Pope Pius enraged the Tsar and his regime, and led to an Austrian intervention, urging the Pope to be silent in the interest of the Polish Catholics. The Pope abstained from public protests but issued an encyclical July 30, 1863, in which he praised the heroic fight of the Poles and enumerated destruction and persecution activities by the Russian authorities.Acta III, 65, I In the aftermath, Russia closed the dioceses of Kamieniec Podolski, and banned or exiled bishops and administrators in Warsaw, Che≈Çm and other dioceses. On November 15, 1863, the Vatican published a White Book with some one hundred documents, detailing the conflict. Russia answered with a break of the concordat on December 6, 1863. By 1870, not a single bishop from the Polish provinces of the Russian empire was left in his own diocese.

Early life Cecil Hincks was born on 18 February 1894, in the township of Maitland, South Australia, the son of miller Henry Stephen Hincks and his wife Emily Frances Picton (n√©e Parkins). He was educated at Port Victoria Public School and the Collegiate School of St Peter, and followed his father into the flour milling trade after completion of his schooling, while training with the cadets and citizens' force. In 1914, he was considered to try out for the Port Adelaide Football Club, but his trial was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I.Stock, Jenny Tilby; 'Hincks, Sir Cecil Stephen (1894 - 1963)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, 1996, pp 454-455. Military career World War I At the outbreak of the war, the Hincks family was living in the town of Gawler, north of Adelaide. Hincks travelled to Morphettville, where he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 28 August 1914 and was assigned to the South Australian 10th Battalion's 'G' Company as a Lance Corporal.Richards, Anne: Gawler's Soldiers: A portrait of six of the first young men from Gawler to enlist for service in the First World War, 1914-1918 , Gawler Public Library, 2009. Hincks served with the 10th Battalion in the Gallipoli Campaign, coming ashore at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 ahead of the main landing of Australian forces. On 28 April, Hincks was promoted to Corporal, and on 4 August to Sergeant. In September 1915, Hincks was evacuated to Mudros after he was found to be suffering from influenza and an intestinal disease. In October he was admitted to hospital in Cardiff, and nearly a year later he was discharged from hospital in Salisbury and returned to rejoin his unit at the Western Front on 23 August 1916. At the Battle of Lagnicourt, part of the Battle of Arras in 1917, Hincks received gunshot wounds to his legs and chest, and was sent to Rouen where his condition was assessed as \\"dangerously ill\\". He was evacuated to England to recover, and after surgery over the following year, his injured leg was amputated. In 1918, he married Gladys Lottie Merritt in Surbiton, Surrey. He remained in England on extended sick leave for most of 1919, but left to return to Australia on 10 December. He was discharged from the 10th Battalion a year later on 13 December 1920. His marriage to Gladys ended in divorce shortly afterwards. World War II Lieutenant Hincks served as an Australian Army recruiting officer during World War II, working out of the Central Recruiting Depot (CRD) in Yorketown. He was promoted to Temporary Captain and transferred to the Reserve of Officers in August 1941, and was discharged on 16 May 1946.HINCKS, CECIL STEPHEN, World War II Nominal Roll, Department of Veterans Affairs. Retrieved 18 November 2009. Political career Following his discharge from the army, Hincks worked for the Wheat Harvest Board before setting up his own grain and insurance management business and starting a farm. He was a member of several charitable organisations, and a state councillor in the Returned Sailors' Soldiers' [and Airmens] Imperial League (1922‚Äì1946). At the South Australian state election in August 1941, Hincks was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly, representing the electoral district of Yorke Peninsula for the Liberal and Country League. After serving on a committee to inspect and assess land for the Federal government for soldier settlement, Hincks was assigned to the related portfolios as Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Repatriation on 17 April 1946. Despite his poor health, Hincks was respected and admired for his hard work in the portfolios, which he held until his death in office from cancer on 1 January 1963.

A professor of speech and theatre, he wrote an early textbook on radio announcing, and was instrumental in the creation of the university's radio station, KWGS. Henneke also wrote the TU fight song when he was an undergraduate student at the school. Henneke has been cited as one of the most influential figures in the university's history. Early life and education Henneke was born in St. Louis, Missouri. After graduating from Tulsa Central High School, he enrolled at the University of Tulsa in 1931, with plans to become a journalist. In 1932, as a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, Henneke entered a contest, sponsored by a local clothing store, for a new fight song for the school's athletic teams, the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Henneke won the contest and a $25 prize. He had not written a song before; he later said that the opening sounds of his composition were inspired by the sounds his family's Hoover vacuum cleaner made when he performed his household chores. His winning entry, \\"Hurricane Spirit Song\\" (now also commonly known as the \\"Hurricane Fight Song\\"), remains in use today. Henneke graduated in 1935 with a bachelor's degree in English, and later received a master's degree in theatre from the University of Iowa and a doctorate in speech from the University of Illinois. Academic career Offered a job with the Tulsa World after graduation, Henneke instead began teaching speech and theater at TU in 1936. He created a radio quiz show, \\"Going to College,\\" which aired nationally from 1945 to 1952. Henneke was instrumental in the founding of a radio station for the university, which commenced operations in 1948 as KWGS, its initials in honor of Tulsa oilman William G. Skelly, who supplied the funding. Henneke's textbook, the Radio Announcer's Handbook first published in 1949 and revised in 1959, was reportedly the first textbook on radio announcing. He also wrote another textbook, Reading Aloud Effectively. Henneke became academic vice president of the university in 1953, and was named its 16th president in 1958. He was the first TU alumnus to become president of the university. He was credited with upgrading TU's faculty and academic reputation: during his tenure the university established new doctoral programs, increased the proportion of faculty with doctorates, started new publications including Petroleum Abstracts and the James Joyce Quarterly, developed a North Campus center for petroleum engineering research, and expanded many other facilities. Henneke also initiated the university's efforts to obtain a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa; after it was chartered in 1989, Henneke was inducted as an alumni member in 1991. Also during his presidency, the university received a $34 million gift from the estate of Tulsa philanthropist J.A. Chapman, which greatly improved the school's previously difficult finances. After his tenure as president, Henneke returned to teaching in 1967 as a professor of humanities. He retired in 1979, having spent the first 48 years of his adult life at TU as a student or faculty member. He was named TU's \\"president emeritus\\" in 1982. He continued to write and teach extensively, including numerous articles, a weekly column in the Tulsa Tribune, and a radio lecture series on KWGS. In 1990 he published a biography of 19th century actress and theatrical manager Laura Keene, best known for her production of the play Our American Cousin, which Abraham Lincoln was watching on the evening of his assassination at Ford's Theatre. One reviewer of this book commented that it would \\"rectify shoddy theatre history\\" and \\"re-inscribe\\" Keene's place in that history. Henneke also published a book-length poem entitled A Ravenna Mosaic. Henneke married Ellen Eaves in 1940; she died in 2004. Also in 2004, his 90th birthday was honored with a proclamation by Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry naming it \\"Dr. Ben Graf Henneke Day\\". After Henneke's death in 2009, current TU president Steadman Upham commented, \\"No one has had a greater impact on the University of Tulsa than Ben Henneke.\\" References External links *Ben Graf Henneke: Celebrating over 70 years at the University of Tulsa at University of Tulsa website (retrieved November 16, 2009). *President Emeritus Ben Henneke, 1914-2009 at University of Tulsa website (retrieved November 16, 2009). *Voices of Oklahoma interview with Dr. Ben G.

It is not a story completely of the Titanic, it mixes fiction with real people that were alive during the Titanic era.  Plot  A girl named Jane Taylor lives with her mother and four other sisters (Mimi, Amelie, Emma, and Blythe). Her mother, Maude, is a medium. They live in America in the late 19th century. Jane's father has recently died of Smallpox, and her mother is in grief. One day, they go to a park to meditate, and Mimi & Jane go for a walk. Their mother decides to go to a little place named Spirit Vale. They soon take a train to New York city when, suddenly, the ground starts splitting apart and shaking. An earthquake starts, buildings start shaking and Mimi gets a bad headache. But a man named Nikola Tesla rescues them, and they watch him smash a small device. He explains that he has been destroying things and this earthquake machine is one of his ideas. He believes that everything vibrates and at different frequencies, you can travel between time and different worlds. They are amused. Tesla becomes Jane's ultimate role model, and she collects newspaper clippings about him over the years. Maude moves them to Spirit Vale, where they are going to stay at the inn for a bit. The inn is already fully booked, but, Maude \\"contacts\\" the husband of the inn's owner, Aunty Lily, and she lets them stay. When they stay in Spirit Vale Maude opens a business where she \\"contacts\\" the spirits and practices the movement known as Spiritualism. There she changes everyone's name to Oneida Taylor. Maude becomes very well known and is the center and buzz of Spirit Vale. Everyone comes to see her and get readings and many other things. As the years pass many more things are added to her sign outside the home they share. They soon move out of the hotel and into their own house. In 1911, Mimi and Jane run away to New York City, where Jane falls in love with Thad who is Tesla's assistant. Mimi gets a job as a companion to a wealthy French woman, Ninette, and she goes to travel with her to Europe. As Jane boards her train to return to Spirit Vale, Thad learns that Jane is only 16, 4 years younger than him. He doesn't write to Jane like he promised her. Jane gets very sad over Mimi's departure and Thad. Maude is devastated and blames Jane for running away with Mimi and her departure. After Mimi has been gone for a while, she finally contacts her family while they are in London, England for a spiritual convention for mediums, psychics, etc. It is there that it is proven that the twins, Amelie and Emma, have their mother's gift of being able to speak to the dead after having Queen Victoria speak to Conan Doyle. Mimi reveals that she is going to be sailing on the Titanic, and Blythe wants to go with her. After much convincing, she is allowed to go. Mimi is in first class, and Blythe is in second class. When W.T Stead predicts that the Titanic will sink and Mimi and Blythe are on it. Jane, Amelie, and Emma get on it to try to talk them into getting off of the boat when Jane bumps into Thad, who is on the ship with Tesla. He is overjoyed to see her, and he tells her he made a mistake in not being with her. Jane, Amelie, and Emma are convinced the ship won't sink, so they stay on. Mimi announces that she will be having her wedding to her mistress's butler on the Titanic. Just before the wedding, Thad reveals to Jane that he loves her. She feels the same way, and Mimi is happy for her sister. During the wedding, Tesla wants to show off his newest invention. It's supposed to break ice. Jane recognizes it as the earthquake machine. When he used it, it malfunctioned and the rudder cracks. This causes the rudder to not function properly and the iceberg to hit the ship. They start telling people to get on lifeboats. They realize that Amelie is missing, so Mimi, Jane, Emma, and Thad go looking for her. Tesla tells Thad and Jane to follow him. He says he has an invention that could save everyone. It's a time machine. Mimi finds Jane in the bottom of the ship with Tesla and Thad. She tells her to get into the lifeboats, but she stays. Tesla's machine partly works and Jane finds herself in the water. She sees a floating chair and she gets on it. She finds Amelie and Emma in the water. Tesla helps them up onto the overturned table he was on. Mrs. Brown's life boat spots them and they pulled Emma and Amelie on board. Emma dies of hypothermia. Amelie had two broken legs and frostbite on her toes. Nobody can find Mimi or Thad. Amelie goes to the hospital. She starts to talk, but says that Emma is talking. Jane recalls Emma saying \\"I won't leave\\", just before she dies. Two years pass by. Mimi and Thad, though no bodies were found, are said to have drowned. Jane, now 19, gets a job as a reporter. She sees a picture on a newspaper of two people that survived the sinking of the Titanic in the water all these years. Jane thinks they look like Thad and Mimi. She begs her boss to let her do this story, and he lets her. She goes to them and finds that they are Mimi and Thad. When they were in the time machine, it didn't send them a few minutes into the future, it sent them a few years. Although to everyone else, Mimi and Thad had been gone years, to them it only seems like a few minutes. They all get on a train, and Jane reluctantly tells Mimi that her husband is dead. Jane, Thad, and Mimi ride back home together, where the book ends.

The Gedeo Zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR) is named for this people. They speak the Gedeo language, which is one of the Cushitic languages.  Overview  According to the 2007 Ethiopian national census, this ethnic group has 986,977 members, of whom 75.05% live in the SNNPR and 24.84% in adjacent parts of the Oromia Region. Almost one in sixteen‚Äî6.24% -- live in urban areas. Culture The culture of the Gedeo is distinguished by two features. The first is the baalle, a tradition of ranks and age classes similar to the Gadaa system of the Oromo people. Beckingham and Huntingford describe the system as seven grades that span a 10-year period of birth, creating a 70-year cycle.C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford, Some Records of Ethiopia, 1593-1646 (London: Hakluyt Society, 1954), p. 210 Asebe Regassa Debelo provides oral traditions showing that the Gedeo acquired the practice from the Guji Oromo, with whom they have had, historically, a close relationship.Asebe Regassa Debel, \\"Ethnicity and inter-ethnic relations: The 'Ethiopian experiment' and the case of the Guji and Gedeo\\", Master's thesis in indigenous studies, University of Troms√∏ (2007), pp. 49f On the other hand, their agricultural economy is based on cultivating ensete, as is their neighbors the Sidama people, whose language is closely related to theirs. From a geopolitical point of view, the Gedeo are Horners, and from an ethnic point of view, they are Cushites.Debelo, Asebe Regassa. Ethnicity and inter-ethnic relations. The ‚ÄòEthiopian experiment‚Äôand the case of the Guji and Gedeo. MS thesis. Universitetet i Troms√∏, 2007  History  The origin of the Gedeo is not well known. Tadesse Kippie Kanshie mentions one story in which the Gedeo trace their origin to the aboriginal tribe called Murgga-Gosallo, perhaps the earliest people to have lived in the area.Tadesse Kippie Kanshie, Five thousand years of sustainability? A case study on Gedeo land use (PhD dissertation: May 2002), Treemail publishers, pp. 22-31 Another Gedeo tradition traces their origins to one Daraso, who was the older brother of Gujo the ancestor of the Guji Oromo, and Boro ancestor of the Borana Oromo, two pastoral groups who live to the east of the Gedeo;Asebe Regassa Debelo, \\"Ethnicity\\", p. 43 this tradition may have its origins in an Oromo practice of mass adoption of indigenous ethnic groups, known as guddifacha.Asebe Regassa Debelo, \\"Ethnicity\\", p. 57 Daraso is said to have had seven sons from two wives, from whom were descended the seven Gedeo clans: Doobba‚Äôa, Darashsha, Gorggorshsha, Hanuma, Bakarro, Henbba‚Äôa and Logoda. These are organized into two classes or \\"houses\\": shoole baxxe (the senior) to which the first four belong and sase baxee (the junior) to which the last three belong. The shoole baxxee comprises more than twenty-five sub-tribes while the sase baxxe consists of ten sub-tribes, all of which are exogamous. To these seven clans specific roles were attributed, which meant only a given clan or sub-clan contributed members from its ranks for the role of leadership while other clans or sub-clans performed duties associated with ritual, traditional medicine, etc. Accordingly, the Aba Gada used to be chosen from the Logoda and Henbba'a clans. Incorporation into expanding Ethiopia empire in 1895 led to numerous social upheavals. In areas where the Gedeo \\"submitted peacefully\\" local administration was not disturbed, but in those that required military action, military governors ruled and at times became feudal lords. The incorporation seriously affected their socio-economic, political and cultural autonomy. For instance, the Gedeo were barred from using their baallee tradition in their day-to-day lives, except in religious rituals, leading to social disintegration, and loosened the social ties amongst the different tribes. Those who fought against the Ethiopian empire had their land confiscated and were reduced to gebbars, the Ethiopian equivalent of serfs. The local landlords, known as naftagna and balabat, were entitled to take one- third (siso) to one-half (gama) of whatever the gebbars produced. The landlords emphasized production of coffee due to its importance as a cash crop‚Äîto the benefit of the landlords, not the Gedeo peasantry. On top of this, the gebbars and their families were required to perform unpaid work for the landlords. The gebbars also had to contribute asrat (one-tenth of the total produce) to the Ethiopian Church. The landlord also controlled the social life of a gabbar, requiring them to seek his permission before proposing a marriage for his children or to send his children to school. However, one authority holds that the greatest administrative action that changed the lives of the Gedeo was during the 1920s when measurement of land through qallad (a rope or leather thong about 66‚Äì67 meters long) was introduced. The process of measuring land brought many hitherto unoccupied lands, and formerly forested areas that had been under the control of the traditional authorities, into the hands of the national authorities. This forced the ordinary Gedeo to abandon their traditional lands where they grew ensete (as the landlords claimed rist and maderia rights over measured lands), and towards peripheral areas in search of unoccupied and forested lands. This migration led to assimilation of different clans, eliminated traditional no-man's zones and encouraged clearing of forested areas for the purposes of growing mixed coffee and ensete.\\"Ethiopian Village Studies: Adado, Gedeo\\", p. 4 Protestant missionaries arrived in the early 1950s. They established two churches, the Ethiopian Kalehiywot Church and Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekaneyesus. Of these, the Ethiopian Kalehiywot Church attracted the bulk of the Gedeo population and exerted a far-reaching influence. The missionaries found their evangelical work quite easy, for they had only to substitute the Christian God for the Mageno, the Supreme Being of the Gedeo. Moreover, before the Christian missionaries arrived there was virtually no formal education among the Gedeo. The handful of government schools were in the towns. The missionaries quickly identified this gap and used it to their advantage, establishing Bible and elementary schools. Gedeo were so eager to learn how to read and write, that elementary schools had to offer evening classes for the adults, lit by kerosene lamps. As Tadesse Kippie Kanshie writes, \\"These schools not only taught religious cadres but also cadres of change.\\" The landlords, well aware of the consequences, were vehemently opposed to any education of the Gedeo, and worked against the efforts of the missionaries, by limiting their movement in the countryside in various ways. While the missionaries relied on the help of their converts to circumvent the effect of these limitations, the local elites also struck against them. Some, such as Murtti Obese, one of the first converts to evangelize to the Gedeo south of Dila, lost his life in 1970 while in the remote areas of Hagere Mariam woreda, and Tesfaye Argaw was murdered while on a similar mission in the lowlands. Related to this was the effort of the Gedeo to regain their lost rights. In the 1950s, Gedeo elders were selected and presented a petition to Emperor Haile Selassie in Addis Ababa, but to no avail. The Gedeo clashed with the Ethiopian Army in 1960 at Michille hill near Dilla. With traditional weapons like spears against modern firearms, the Gedeo killed 68 government army and officials, while the latter killed 86 Gedeo peasants, \\"a small number considering the state‚Äôs level of military power,\\" Asebe Regassa Debelo notes with some satisfaction.Asebe Regassa Debelo, \\"Ethnicity\\", p. 51 Nevertheless this defeat led to government persecution of local Protestants. Church leaders were accused of inciting the people against the feudal government and church gatherings were banned. Further, government authorities forcibly resettled Gedeo in Adola, Hagere Mariam (Bule Hora) and other Guji Oromo territories located far from the homelands of the Gedeo.Asebe Regassa Debelo, \\"Ethnicity\\", p. 49 While the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie at first led to improved conditions, such as land reform, but these improvements did not last. Cheating and deceiving had become \\"normal\\" ways used by most town merchants in dealing with Gedeo peasants. They were told by Political Commissars when to harvest, when to sell and whom to sell to, and these officials eventually tried to enforce agricultural collectivization on the Gedeo. In response, farmers clashed with government soldiers in 1981 near Rago-Qishsha. Politics Besides the baalle system, before their conquest by the Ethiopian Empire in the 1890s, the Gedeo lived in a federation of three territories called Sasserogo, or \\"three Roga\\". These Roga, Sobbho, Ributa and Rikuta, shared one Aba Gada, which was similar to the Oromo office, and every eight years was passed to a new office holder in the next age set at a ceremony also known as baalle. According to Gedeo tradition, all leadership positions from Aba Gada at the top down to the office of Hyiticha were assumed at the baalle ceremony, while specific roles were held by specific clans or sub-clans.\\"Ethiopian Village Studies: Adado, Gedeo\\", CSAE: Ethiopian Village Studies, June 1996 (accessed 18 November 2009), p. 2 When boundary lines were drawn between the new SNNPR and Oromia administrative units during the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, much territory originally belonging to the Guji Oromo, including the Qallu compound (galma) in Wenago, was given to the SNNPR. The local Guji Oromo were dissatisfied with this arrangement, and unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the office of then Prime Minister. This led to violent clashes in Hagere Mariam woreda between the Guji and Gedeo in April‚ÄìMay 1995. The federal army attempted to intervene between the two to stop the fighting, but only succeeded in becoming the target of Guji militants.Asebe Regassa Debelo, \\"Ethnicity\\", pp. 73-78 Gedeo-Oromo clashes Conflict between the Guji Oromo and the Gedeo people in Gedeo Zone since 2018 led to Ethiopia having the largest number of people to flee their homes in the world in 2018, with 1.4 million newly displaced people.

Fisher in W. S. Gilbert's The Happy Land in 1873 Walter Henry Fisher (1848 - 1 January 1893) was an English singer and actor of the Victorian era best remembered as the creator of the role of the Defendant in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1875 opera Trial by Jury. Beginning in the 1860s with much promise in comic plays, classics, Victorian burlesque, and as a versatile singer in opera and operetta, Fisher seemed headed for lasting stardom alongside his wife Lottie Venne. His career was limited, however, by his struggle with alcoholism, ending in the 1880s, and he died at age 44. Gustave Slapoffski described Fisher as \\"probably the finest comic opera tenor the English stage has ever known\\".\\"Slap's Baton\\", The Sunday Mail, 31 July 1927, p. 12 Early life and career Born in Clifton, Bristol, in 1848, Fisher was the middle of three children of Mary Ann n√©e Powell (born 1817) and James Fisher (1812‚Äì1896), a miniature portrait artist and photographer.Powell, p. 1381881 census for BristolG√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Walter Fisher: 'The English Dupuis'\\", Kurt of Gerolstein, 11 July 2020 Fisher studied singing with Signor Catalani and was singing as a concert tenor by 1863, aged 15, in the Bristol Athenaeum. He went on to sing at local events, particularly with the Bristol Volunteer Artillery Corps Dramatique for whom he sometimes performed in drag in female roles, gaining a local reputation as both an excellent singer and actor. In 1866 in Bristol he performed in Guy Mannering as Henry Bertram, followed by other roles at that theatre, such as Laertes in Hamlet, Malcolm in Macbeth and Sir William Brandon in Richard III.Powell, pp. 67 and 90 A scene from The Happy Land, showing Gladstone (Fisher), Lowe and Ayrton. He began his professional stage career in 1868 at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, in F. C. Burnand's burlesque Paris and as Rodolphe (Max) in Der Freisch√ºtz and then at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, as Don Ottavio in Little Don Giovanni, Lord Woodbie in The Flying Scud, Don John in Much Ado About Nothing and Osbaldistone in Rob Roy, among others, and still sang in concerts, including a performance of Haydn's Fifth Mass in Bristol. Soon afterwards, he joined Captain Disney Roebuck's touring company in classic plays (The School for Scandal, East Lynne, The Ticket-of-Leave Man, The Lady of Lyons, David Garrick and The Rivals), pantomime, burlesque and operetta, sometimes playing opposite his future wife, Lottie Venne. With Venne he went back to the Theatre Royal, after which, Fisher played in Glasgow and Nottingham. To distinguish himself from another Walter Fisher, in the early 1870s he adopted the middle name Henry. Fisher and Venne next appeared with Francis Farlie's burlesque company, for whom he appeared as Montpesson in Caste. At Nottingham they acted together in a burlesque of Chilp√©ric in which he played the King and Venne was Fr√©d√©gonde. They remained at Nottingham into early 1872 and married on 20 March 1872. Peak years  Fisher first appeared in London in 1872 as Ambroise Valamour in Broken Spells at the Court Theatre, followed by other roles there, including Sergeant Klooque in a revival of W. S. Gilbert's Creatures of Impulse, opposite Venne's Peter. The next year, in the same house, he played the dual role of Ethais and The Right Honourable Mr. G, an impersonation of W. E. Gladstone, in Gilbert's burlesque The Happy Land. Fisher's interpretation of Gladstone was appreciated by audiences but was revised on the order of the Lord Chamberlain. Fisher continued to play in comedy roles at the Court and then with Henry Neville's company at the Olympic Theatre, but made his first London appearance in light opera as Marasquin in Girofl√©-Girofla at the Philharmonic Theatre in 1874.Stone, David. Walter H. Fisher at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 23 December 2003, accessed 18 November 2009 The Observer wrote of his performance, \\"It was for him a hazardous task to essay a character which is identified with Mario Widmer, one of the most fascinating jeunes premieres at present on the stage: and it is gratifying to say that Mr. Fisher suffered little if at all by comparison\\".The Observer, 4 October 1874, p. 3 Fisher's good looks and pleasing voice had led him to a successful early career \\"at the Philharmonic, Royalty, Olympic and other theatres [where] he became the original exponent of many notable operatic and dramatic works by Messrs. Montague, James and Thorne, he was selected [to create] the part of Jack Wyatt (Two Roses) in the provinces.\\"Powell, p. 139 Punch magazine called him the \\"British Jos√© Dupuis\\". A scene from Trial by Jury. The Defendant (Fisher), with his guitar, clings to his new love. Fisher joined Selina Dolaro's company at the Royalty Theatre in January 1875, where he played Piquillo, the tenor lead, in Jacques Offenbach's La P√©richole.Stedman, p. 130 In March, when Richard D'Oyly Carte produced an accompanying piece there, Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury, Fisher was the original Defendant. Rutland Barrington later wrote of Fisher, \\"He had a charming and sympathetic voice, and was one of the very few tenors it has been my good fortune to meet who could act as well as sing.\\"Barrington, Rutland. Chapter four, A Record of Thirty-five Years' Experience on the English Stage, Grant Richards, London (1908) Fisher next returned to the Olympic, where he had another long run in The Gascon. In 1876, after another stint as The Defendant, he went on tour with Carte and Dolaro, repeating the roles of the Defendant and Piquillo and played Ange Pitou, the leading tenor role in La fille de Madame Angot, as well as the Costermonger in Carte's own one-act operetta, Happy Hampstead. During this engagement, however, he \\"became unreliable\\" (a euphemism for alcoholism) and, despite his \\"delightful\\" performances and good notices from the critics, Carte asked him to leave the company, as \\"the disease was too deeply rooted for permanent cure\\". Later in the year, however, he was back in London with Charles Wyndham at The Crystal Palace, then returned to the Olympic. Fisher was engaged again by Carte in 1877 for Tita in Thibet as Brum opposite Kate Santley at the Royalty, where he also played the title role in Orpheus in the Underworld and reprised his role as the Costermonger in Happy Hampstead.Royalty Theatre programme, January 1877 In 1879 he was Hector in Madame Favart opposite Florence St. John at the Strand Theatre and on tour.Bogue, D. \\"April 1879 ... Madame Favart\\", Dramatic Notes: An Illustrated Yearbook of the Stage, Volumes 1‚Äì3, p. 80 (1883) In 1881, he toured in the title role of Billee Taylor, among other pieces,The Manchester Guardian, 13 September 1881, p. 8 and appeared in Bristol with his old company.Powell, p. 120 He then toured with Emily Soldene as Giletti in Madame l'archiduc and Fritz in La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein. Fisher created the role of Rev Henry Sandford in The Vicar of Bray at the Globe Theatre in 1882.Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, 23 July 1882, p. 1; and Pall Mall Gazette, 28 July 1882, p. 2 Later years Fisher toured with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the baritone role of Archibald Grosvenor in Patience with Carte's principal touring company in the Autumn of 1883. He then apparently took more breaks from the stage before and after again appearing in Bristol for a time. He finally reappeared with a D'Oyly Carte touring company in 1887 and was soon playing other baritone roles, Captain Corcoran in H.M.S.

After moving to New York City from Redwood City, California, where he grew up, he appeared in five Broadway musicals in the 1940s and 1950s. Early years Wood was born in Seattle, Washington to Cyril Percival (Percy) Wood (b. August 18, 1883 in Gonzales, California; d. May 12, 1963 in San Jose, California) and his wife, Edith Florence Chamberlain (b. June 11, 1880 in Oakland, California; d. June 18, 1960 in Belmont, California). They were wed at Trinity Episcopal Parish Church in Seattle on November 6, 1909. Edith Florence Chamberlain Wood is a descendant of John Howland who was among the 102 passengers arriving at Plymouth aboard the Mayflower in 1620. Cyril Percy and his bride resided for one year in Susitna, Alaska where Cyril was an early day official for the Northern Commercial Company. He served as secretary to William Fairbanks, vice president of the Northern Commercial Company, shortly after the turn of the century, and accompanied him on his annual inspection tours of company posts. Later, he was Northern Commercial Company Agent at Iditarod, Alaska and Kodiak, Alaska where the family resided for eight years and one year respectively. Charles was born while the family was on one of many visits to Seattle during this period. The family finally left Alaska in 1919 and resided in Seattle for a year before settling in Redwood City in 1920. Wood attended Lincoln Grammar School in Redwood City and went on to graduate from Redwood City's Sequoia Union High School. Upon moving to New York City to pursue a career as a professional performer, Wood met and, in 1942, married Adelaide Marchena (b. October 15, 1915 in New York City; d. November 1, 1982 in New York City), a native of Manhattan and a first generation American, the daughter of Carlin and Adelaida Marchena, both of Barcelona, Spain. Career Wood appeared on Broadway in five musicals between 1945 and 1953. These included three original productions: Up in Central Park (1945) starring Wilbur Evans and Noah Beery Sr.; originating the role of Hortensio in the hit musical Kiss Me, Kate (1948) starring Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk and Harold Lang; and as Morrie in Wish You Were Here (1952) starring Jack Cassidy, Patricia Marand, Sheila Bond and introducing newcomer Florence Henderson. Kiss Me, Kate was the only Cole Porter musical to reach 1,000 performances during an original run and garnered five 1949 Tony Awards, including the first in the Best Musical category. In addition to original productions, Wood appeared on Broadway in two revivals: Sweethearts (1947) starring Bobby Clark, June Knight and Marjorie Gateson; and Sally. Wood also appeared in the NBC-TV Hallmark Hall of Fame live color telecast of Kiss Me, Kate on November 20, 1958. A black-and-white kinescope of the telecast (Episode #8‚Äì2; Hallmark #29) was released on DVD (Release date: February 8, 2011). The telecast starred Drake and Morison (two of the show's four original leads) and also featured Jack Klugman. Although Wood appeared just as he had in the Broadway original a decade earlier, the role he created was played in the broadcast by Jerry Duane. However, Wood sings Hortensio in the 1949 cast recording which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (class of 1998) and was also inducted into the National Recording Registry (class of 2014). Military service Charles Wood served in the Army of the United States. He was inducted on January 22, 1942 at Fort Dix, New Jersey. He received an honorable discharge on October 18, 1944 at Fort Dix, New Jersey: *Name: Charles W. Wood *Rank: Staff Sergeant *Serial Number: 32 203 979 *Military Unit: Headquarters Battery 899th Field Artillery Bn, Ft Leonard Wood, Mo. Personal life In 1945, shortly after he was cast in Up in Central Park, Wood and his wife moved into an apartment in Midtown Manhattan within walking distance of the Theater District. They continued to reside there until 1972 when the 7-story building was demolished to make way for a residential high-rise tower. During that time, they raised their five children: Charles Jr. (January 30, 1943 ‚Äì August 28, 2008), Dianne (2/3/1944 ‚Äì), Barbara (5/6/1947 ‚Äì), Ronald (October 19, 1951 ‚Äì) and Debra (December 19, 1952 ‚Äì). His family includes: # Older brother, Cyril Chamberlain (\\"Cy\\") Wood (b. November 3, 1911 in Susitna, Alaska; d. June 23, 2001 in Topanga, California) # Older sister, Mary Wood (b. January 2, 1915 in Iditarod, Alaska; d. July 21, 2009 in Sacramento, California) # Younger brother, Alfred Russell Wood (b. June 10, 1917 in Iditarod, Alaska; d. January 1, 2000 in San Luis Obispo, California) # Younger sister, Patricia Wood (b. November 19, 1919 in Seattle, Washington; d. December 29, 1998 in San Jose, California) # Younger brother, Richard Calvin Wood (b. December 24, 1924 in Oakland, California; d. February 1, 2008 in Phoenix, Arizona) Virginia Louise Chamberlain Denny (a cousin of the six Wood siblings), was the wife of Victor Winfield Scott Denny Jr., a grandson of David and Louisa Boren Denny of the famed Denny Party who are credited with having founded the city of Seattle in the mid-Nineteenth Century, having named the new city after Chief Seattle (a.k.a. Si'ahl; Sealth) who they negotiated with after having claimed land in the area. Death Wood died in 1978, at age 62, in New York City at the former Beekman Downtown Hospital in Lower Manhattan, of complications resulting from a stroke he had suffered two years earlier.

The soldier expresses his or her commitment in every area of life, but more specifically through the ministry and work of a local Salvation Army corps. Covenant Salvationist Soldiers are considered by their peers to be covenanted warriors exercising 'holy passion' to win the world for Jesus. The covenant, known as the Soldier's Covenant, is a lifelong commitment to God through The Salvation Army that is fleshed out by a full book of Orders and Regulations called Chosen to Be a Soldier Chosen to be a soldier : orders and regulations for soldiers of the Salvation Army by Salvation Army. Publisher: London : Salvation Army, International Headquarters, 1989, ¬©1977. , published by the International Headquarters of The Salvation Army. There is also a complete book, formerly called the Handbook of Doctrine, reprinted as Salvation Story in 1998, and in 2010 became Handbook of Doctrine available as a free download that explains the doctrines to which the soldier subscribes. The text of the covenant, which is quoted below, reflects the Army's determination to remain faithful to its standards and principles. All Soldiers (including officers of all ranks) are urged from time to time to re-read the solemn undertakings to which they have set their hand and to reaffirm before God their dedication to Him and to The Salvation Army, so that their lifestyle and service will be in keeping with the Soldier's Covenant. Enrollment of Soldiers Having completed 'recruits classes', been approved by the Pastoral Care Council and having signed their Articles of War, a soldier is publicly enrolled under The Salvation Army flag usually as part of worship of a Salvation Army corps. The soldier makes a public declaration by reading the articles aloud and will often first wear a Salvation Army uniform on this day. An Officer of The Salvation Army, usually the corps officer of the corps into which the soldier is being enrolled, normally conducts this ceremony. Uniform Soldiers are encouraged to wear the uniform as a sign of covenant community. The uniform is a visible profession of faith in Jesus Christ and identifies the wearer with the Christian faith. The uniform also identifies the wearer as being a person who can be called upon to discover more about the Christian faith. The uniform differs according to rank, nationality, and activity engaged in. The Basic Uniform for most territories is Men White Shirt, Navy Blue Jacket, Navy Blue Trousers, Navy Blue Tie, Navy Blue Peaked Cap, Ladies White Blouse Navy Blue Jacket, Navy Blue Skirt, A white or blue gilded brooch, Navy Blue Bowler style hat, In Summer (May - September) Soldiers wear Summer Uniform which involves Ladies opting to wear an open neck blouse. Men wear short sleeves. All Soldiers wear epaulettes which are Navy blue for Soldiers and pale blue for Songsters and Bandsman. Some Female soldiers now opt to wear trousers in lieu of a skirt. In most countries it is expected that Men remove their caps when indoors and Ladies keep their hats on whether indoors or out. However, there has been a decline in recent years of both men and women wearing headdress. It is likely in coming years that the cap and hat will be phased out. Criticisms  Many Christians (including Salvation Army adherents) object to the tradition of soldiership for various reasons. The most prominent objection is the age at which children may be enrolled, i.e.: 14 years of age, even though this is the age many young people in other denominations are confirmed in their faith and become official members of the church. Such opponents argue that it is immoral or deceptive to ask a child to sign a lifelong covenant at that age, particularly when they are too young to legally engage in some of the activities singled out in the Articles of War (consuming alcohol, smoking, etc.). Junior Soldiers The Salvation Army takes seriously the capacity of children to have an authentic Christian experience. A Junior Soldier is a boy or girl who, having professed conversion, having signed the junior soldier‚Äôs promise, and being between the age of 7 and 13, becomes a Salvationist. In some places Junior Soldiers also wear a form of uniform which differs according to the locality. A Junior Soldier uniform for a boy would be a white collar shirt, navy blue dress pants, black shoes, navy socks, Junior Soldier pins and tie. A Junior Soldier uniform for a girl would be a white collar shirt, navy blue skirt/skort, navy tights, black shoes, Junior Soldier pins. In Australia Junior soldiers have opted to wear a polo shirt reflecting the colours of The salvation Army flag (either blue, yellow or red). This gives the Juniors Soldier a sense of individuality while still belonging to the Junior corps. Often a uniform is not worn, but a Junior Soldier wears a badge (pin) with rings to indicate which level of activity or projects each Junior Soldier has attained (similar to a bar on a military medal). The 'Junior Soldier promise' reads this: \\"I know that Jesus is my Saviour from sin. I have asked him to forgive my sins, and I will trust him to keep me good. By his help, I will be his loving and obedient child, and will help others to follow him. I promise to pray, to read my Bible, and to lead a life that is clean in thought, word and deed. I will not use anything that may injure my body or my mind, including harmful drugs, alcohol and tobacco.\\" Enrollment Statistics According to The Salvation Army Year Book 2008 as of 1 January 2007 there are 360,222 junior soldiers and 1,082,166 senior soldiers in The Salvation Army. Additionally, in the 2010 Year Book numbers have increased - Junior Soldiers total 378,009 and Senior Soldiers total 1,122,326 internationally. In 2017 Junior Soldiers number 411,327, while there are 1,182,100 Soldiers. As at 2010 The Salvation Army was active in 120 countries, and by 28 October 2016 that had increased to 128 countries.

Colavecchio (January 1, 1942 ‚Äì July 6, 2020) was an American casino counterfeiter known as \\"The Coin\\". While residing in Rhode Island, Colavecchio defrauded several Atlantic City and Connecticut casinos until his arrest and initial conviction in 1998. He had led a gang which fabricated numerous slot machine coins using hardened steel dies of the originals, and was revealed when casinos began to notice a surplus of coins on their gaming floors. Sentenced to seven years, Colavecchio was released in 2006. He was arrested by the FBI only a few months later after having resumed his activities, and released on a $25,000 surety bond. His counterfeiting equipment was auctioned off on eBay following his arrest, and crimes were the subject of a documentary series Breaking Vegas from The History Channel, where he was portrayed by Angelo Fierro. Due to the initial success of his crime, casinos have slowly phased out tokens, replacing them with paper vouchers. Today slot machines will dispense a paper voucher when a play cashes out. The vouchers are then redeemed for cash at kiosks located next to the cashier. Colavecchio collaborated with Andy Thibault, a private investigator and city editor for the Republican-American newspaper in Waterbury, Conn., and Franz Douskey, a professor at Gateway Community College, to write a memoir, ‚ÄúYou Thought It Was More ‚Äì Adventures of the World‚Äôs Greatest Counterfeiter, Louis The Coin.‚Äù It was published by IceBox Publishing LLC in 2015.

They have programs that promote incentive-based tools to encourage landowners and businesses to participate in voluntary conservation practices. The goal is to restore fish and wildlife habitat, improve water quality, and protect open space while maintaining the working landscape of farms, forestland, and communities throughout the state. History Stewardship Partners co-founder Chris Bayleyhttp://www.stewardshippartners.org/bios/bayley.html ran in a political campaign in the late 1990s that took him around the state of Washington where he was introduced to agriculturalists. Here he started to see the reluctance of landowners to listen to \\"outsiders\\" telling them how manage their land and the disconnect between government policy and landowners. In 1999 Stewardship Partners set out on a mission to become a catalyst for a new cooperative model and to help landowners preserve the environment. In addition to cooperation, their other focus was to be a catalyst for local action and to develop models that others could follow. Since their inception in 1999, they have assisted hundreds of landowners, community groups, and businesses in Washington State to implement habitat restoration, environmental planning, and sustainable resource management. Programs and accomplishments Stewardship Partners serve as liaison between private landowners and businesses and the technical, financial, and marketing resources available from governmental and non- governmental sources to help steward the environment. Their projects restore fish and wildlife habitat, improve water quality, protect open space, and \\"green up\\" the built environment while maintaining working landscapes of farms, forestland, and livable communities throughout the state. Salmon- Safe The Salmon-Safe Certification Program recognizes farm operations who adopt conservation practices that help restore native salmon habitat in Pacific Northwest rivers and streams. Salmon-Safe farms protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, and watershed health. The independent eco-label is gaining national recognition and appears on products including wine, dairy, produce, and fruit. In the four years that the Salmon Safe Certification program has been established in Washington State over 60 farms and 25 vineyards have been certified. Stewardship Partners is working on expanding the Salmon-Safe program to include golf courses and residential developments.http://www.salmonsafe.org/ Snoqualmie initiative In the Snoqualmie Valley there has been 18 land-owner based habitat restoration projects with Valley farms, restoring seven miles of river bank.

In 1992, 112 specimens existed in the wild, and a recovery plan was implemented. The Aleutian shield fern is the only native plant of Alaska on the federal endangered species list. As there are fewer than 150 plants known to exist, it is a very rare North American plant. It was listed as endangered in 1988. Polystichum aleuticum was first described in 1938, but it could not be located again until 1975 when a group was identified on Mount Reed on Adak Island. A second, third, and fourth population, all on Mount Reed, was located in 1988, 1993, and 1999, respectively. Searches on other Aleutian Islands since 1988 have failed to identify additional populations. Distribution It is unlike any other known shield fern found in North America, and originally it was questioned whether it even belonged to the genus Polystichum. However, it was found to be similar to a dwarf Polystichum species native to southwestern mountains of China and the Himalayas. Description The Polystichum aleuticum fern is described as erect and approximately six inches tall. It usually found growing alone, rather than in groups. It has a fibrous root with dead leaf remnants attached. Its leaves, visible during the growing season, are light or dark olive green, and tapering. Each of its fronds has 15 to 25 pairs of leaflets (pinnae) that are either sessile or have short stalks and are 4 to 8 mm in length. The upper leaflets each have one spore-producing sori (sometimes two) on the leaflet under surface that is protected by the indusium, a flap of tissue. The spores are produced in July and August.

He is a pre-eminent authority on the legal systems of Russia, other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Mongolia. He is also extensively involved in the fields of public and private international law.Dickinson School of Law http://law.psu.edu/faculty/resident_faculty/butler Butler is a noted bibliophile and bookplate collector. Married 1961 Darlene Mae Johnson (1939‚Äì1989), with two sons William III, (b. 1965) and Bradley (b. 1973); Married 1991 Maryann Elizabeth Gashi (b. 1955).  Education  Butler received his education in the U.S. In the early 1960s he attended lectures of John N. Hazard (1909‚Äì1996) offered at Johns Hopkins University SAIS and, while at Harvard Law School, worked with Harold J. Berman (1918‚Äì2007), the founders of Soviet legal studies in the West. There he developed his interest in Soviet law and in international and comparative legal studies. He is the holder of the following university degrees: A.A., Hibbing Junior College, 1959; B.A., The American University (School of International Service), 1961; M.A., The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 1963; J.D., Harvard Law School, 1966; LL.M., School of Law of the Academy University of Law, Institute of State and Law, Russian Academy of Sciences, 1997; Ph.D., The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 1970 (for his dissertation \\"Soviet Union and the Law of the Sea\\", which was later published); LL.D., University of London, 1979.  Academic career  After serving two years (1966‚Äì68) in Washington, D.C. as Research Assistant at the Washington Center for Foreign Policy Research, Johns Hopkins SAIS, working on a research contract for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and a further two years (1968‚Äì70) as Research Associate in Law at the Harvard Law School, working in Soviet, Chinese, and Western approaches to international law, in 1970 W. E. Butler was elected to the established Readership in Comparative Law at the University of London, tenable at University College London, and elevated to a personal chair in 1976 as Professor of Comparative Law. Till the late 1980s he pursued principally an academic career, although he acted as consultant to governments and international organisations. His early research pursued the interface between Soviet law and the international legal system, a subject which he later broadened to address comparative approaches to international law. The key books of this period included: The Soviet Union and the Law of the Sea (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1971); The Merchant Shipping Code of the USSR 1968 (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1970) (with J. B. Quigley, Jr.); Northeast Arctic Passage (Leiden, Martinus Nijhoff, 1978); an edition of P. P. Shafirov, Discourse on the Causes of War between Russia and Sweden (Dobbs Ferry, Oceana Publications, 1973); Comparative Approaches to International Law (1978); Documents on Socialist International Organizations (1978); Russian Law: Historical and Political Perspectives (Leiden, A. W. Sijthoff, 1977); The Soviet Legal System (in co-authorship with John N. Hazard and Peter B. Maggs; 3d ed.; Dobbs Ferry: Oceana Publications, 1977; new ed., 1984) and Soviet Law (London: Butterworths, 1983; new ed., 1988). In 1982 Butler founded the Centre for the Study of Socialist Legal Systems, University College London, which in 1993 was renamed The Vinogradoff Institute and in 2005 was removed to Dickinson School of Law. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Laws, University College London (1977‚Äì79) and of the University of London (1988‚Äì90). He has been Visiting Professor of Law at New York University Law School, Harvard Law School, Washington and Lee School of Law, and the Moscow State University. For many years he was a member of the Council of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, including one term as Vice-Chairman. He is the author, co-author, editor, or translator of more than 3,500 books, loose-leaf services, articles, and reviews on Soviet, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Tajik, Uzbek, Kazakh, Baltic, and other CIS legal systems. His articles have been published in the leading law reviews of the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, and the United States. In 1985 he delivered a cycle of lectures at the Hague Academy of International Law on \\"Comparative Approaches to International Law\\". During the late years of perestroika in the Soviet Union and then in the post-Soviet period he took active role in law reform as a recognised expert on many areas of law. Butler's principal treatise is Russian Law (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1999; 2d ed., 2003; 3d ed., 2009), which gives a comprehensive account of the history, sources and all branches of Russian law, as well as its place within international context. It was cited by the United States Court of Appeals in 2004. Butler maintains that the transition from a planned economy to a market economy is one which no State has previously undertaken in human history, and Russian law is the principal vehicle of this transition. He is of the view that CIS legal systems are currently in search of their legal identity and therefore present a unique laboratory of comparative law approaches. Among salient titles of recent years which pursue these themes are: * Russian Foreign Relations and Investment Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006) * The Law of Treaties in Russia and Other Member Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (Cambridge University Press, 2002) * Foreign Investment Law in the Commonwealth of Independent States (London, Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2002) * Russian-English Legal Dictionary (Ardsley: Transnational, 2001) * The Corporation and Securities Under Russian and American Law (with Maryann E. Gashi-Butler) (Moscow: Zertsalo, 1997). He has published a number of works in the Russian Federation, including the Russian-English Legal Dictionary (Moscow, Zertsalo, 1995; 2d ed., 2001) and edited editions in the classics of Russian legal history, amongst them a revised edition of V. E. Grabar's History of the literature of international law in Russia, 1647-1917; an edition of Shafirov's Discourse on the law of nations, Kamarovskii's work on an international court, and Catherine II's Nakaz, usually in collaboration with Professor V. A. Tomsinov (Moscow State University). His translation of the Ukrainian Criminal Code was published by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev (2001). His translations of the Russian Civil Code, Family Code, Tax Code, Land Code, Labor Code, and Criminal Code have appeared in parallel Russian and English texts (Moscow, JurinfoR) in large editions. In addition to original works he has engaged extensively in the translation of Soviet and post-Soviet legislation. Mostly these appeared in the quarterly journal Soviet Statutes and Decisions (White Plains, New York, Sharpe Publishing) and in looseleaf services published by Oceana Publications and, since 2006, by Juris Publishers in New York. In total he has published translations of more than 2,500 normative legal acts adopted in the former Soviet Union, all CIS countries, and Mongolia (a full bibliography is contained International and Comparative Law: –ê Bibliography, London: Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2005). As a result, the largest body of English translations of post-Soviet legislation has been created of academic quality. Although Butler is not the only scholar who has contributed to the translation of Russian legal texts, it is mainly due to his efforts that the Western law student or lawyer has now more available to him in English translation concerning the Russian legal system than for any continental European jurisdiction. He founded the quarterly journal Sudebnik (1995‚Äì2007) and serves on the editorial boards of the principal English- language journals, law reviews, and yearbooks devoted to Russia and other CIS legal systems. Commencing in 2004, he became the founding editor of Russian Law: Theory and Practice, issued by the Russian Academy of Legal Sciences (2004‚Äì2009) and Consulting and Book Review Editor, elevated from 2008 to co- editor (with Professor Michael Palmer) of The Journal of Comparative Law (London, Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2005-). In October 2003 he was elected a Trustee of the Hakluyt Society and has served as a Member of the Committee for Central and Inner Asia attached to The British Academy since its inception and as a member of The Bentham Committee since 2003. He has been appointed editor of Bentham's works on international law.  Helping law reform in CIS countries  Commencing with Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and onwards, Butler became more deeply involved in consulting activities, providing expertise for the legal reforms in the USSR and its successor states. In 1989 he was appointed Special Counsel and Chairman of a Working Group attached to the Commission for Economic Reform of the USSR Council of Ministers. In this capacity he evaluated key draft perestroika legislation and was co-author of the Draft USSR Law on Pledge which, in May 1992, was the basis for legislation enacted by the Russian Parliament and then of similar laws adopted in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The same Working Group prepared the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation on Trust Ownership, adopted 24 December 1993 and still in force. From July 1992 to February 1993 he was seconded as Senior Legal Counsel to the Russian Federation State Committee for the Administration of State Property, where he headed a small team of legal specialists to prepare draft Russian laws on trust ownership, securities and investment funds, joint-stock societies, full partnerships, Kommandit partnerships, and limited responsibility partnerships. He served as a member of the European Union Joint Task Force on Law Reform in the Independent States together with leading Russian, European, and CIS jurists and was a co-author of the Report produced by this Task Force. In October‚ÄìNovember 2002 he acted as a Consultant to a health project in Russia for the Department for International Development of the Government of the United Kingdom, and in Spring 2003 completed a substantial report for International Family Health Foundation on the legal regime of harm reduction programs in Russia. In 2003 he completed a major study for the Department for International Development, published separately in the English and Russian languages as: HIV/AIDS and Drug Misuse in Russia: Harm Reduction Programmes and the Russian Legal System (London, DFID/IFH, 2003). Pursuing the same subject, in 2009 the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Moscow published his study on the legal aspects of substitution therapy in Russia. He has advised numerous governmental bodies and international organizations on various aspects of law reforms in the CIS countries. Among them were the World Bank, the Office of the Legal Adviser, United States Department of State, the United States Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Social Security of the United Kingdom, the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the authorities of Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, as well as banks, large corporations, and industry associations. In addition, he has advised on and given formal legal opinions on all aspects of Russian and Soviet Law before English and American courts, tribunals, and arbitral tribunals. In particular, in February 2005 he appeared as a legal expert before the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston within the litigation between Russian oil giant Yukos, on the one hand, and Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, on the other. In his statement before the court Butler said that there was no treaty between the US and Russia on the mutual recognition of legal rulings. That essentially meant Russian authorities were under no obligation to comply with any US rulings in the Yukos case.Lawyers Spar in Yukos Bankruptcy Hearings http://www.templetonthorp.com/ru/news874 In May 1995 he was elected to a five- year term as a member of the Russian International Court of Commercial Arbitration, and re-elected for further terms in 2000 and 2005.

Its current status is undetermined.

The 373rd participated in attacks on airfields, coalyards, docks and warehouses, oil refineries and fuel dumps; as well as attacking shipping in the East and South Seas, the Formosa Strait and the Gulf of Tonkin.Chennault's Forgotten Warriors, pg 329. The B-25 Mitchell-equipped 341st Bombardment Group, was based at Yangkai from Jan 1944 to Sep 1945. Units of the 341st (11th Bombardment Squadron, 22nd Bombardment Squadron, 491st Bombardment Squadron) flew missions from Yangkai, Kweilin and Liuchow against targets in Japanese-occupied China, Burma, Thailand and French Indochina. Primarily targets were Japanese river shipping, road convoys, airfields and other targets of opportunity, as well as sea sweeps over the offshore shipping lanes following the China coast and also attacked Japanese targets on Hainan Island. The Group's crews became quite proficient at destroying bridges in using their variation on 'Skip' and 'Glide' bombing. The 11th and 22nd had converted to A-26 Invaders for their final missions from Yangkai in late July and early August 1945.Group and individual Squadron records, 1944-45. Yangkai was also used by Air Transport Command as a supply hub in South China and also as a terminal for air shipments (Station 14, India, China Wing) from India over \\"the Hump\\".

However, both series received generally negative reviews from critics and suffered from low ratings. CBS announced its decision to cancel both series on May 20, 1989. The final episode of Live-In aired on May 29, 1989.

More specifically, it refers to a device used to crush or grind apples as part of the overall juice production. The mills used to manufacture, ferment, store, and ship juice products are usually located near apple orchards. Historically, the types of structure and machinery have varied greatly ‚Äî including horse powered, water driven, and machine operated mills. The presses can be fixed or portable. Cider mills were subject to legal proceedings in New York state in the 1800s over whether they were \\"fixed to freeholds\\" and other cases addressing legal designation as to what kind of property a cider mill is. Use Cider-making takes place in numerous countries and regions. As with the cider itself, the various techniques used in milling and pressing the apples vary with each cider-making tradition. In most traditions, cider milling traditionally takes place in two stages: first, milling or grinding the apples into a pulpy mass called pulp, and a second stage, pressing the pulp to release the juice or \\"must\\". The remaining solids after juice extraction is \\"pomace\\" or \\"pommage\\". Some mills provide custom pressing of a farmer's apples. In this way, apple varieties can be blended to make a cider of mixed juice types, for instance, a combination of sweet and aromatic juices. Various types of apple are recommended for making cider. Alcoholic cider can also be produced and is known as hard cider or applejack. Cider is stored and fermented in wooden barrels, carboys, stainless tanks, or glass jugs. In 19th-century New England, apple farmers paid a mill owner a fee to crush apples into juice. A typical cider mill would look like many other small barns and sheds, with a set of large doors in the center of the longer side. Most cider mills were 20-30' long by 20-25' in width.http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?DocID=1010 Includes illustrations of old cider mills. At Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, 19th-century cider mill equipment is still used to make cider. In The Marble Faun, author Nathaniel Hawthorne contrasted the wine-making in Italy with the cider-making process of \\"New England vintages, where the big piles of golden and rosy apples lie under the orchard trees, in the mild, autumnal sunshine; and the creaking cider-mill, set in motion by a circumgyratory horse, is all a-gush with the luscious juice.\\" Operation Milling Milling, grinding, or crushing can take various forms, depending on the quantity of apples to be crushed and the mode of power available. The earliest and most basic form of cider mill consists of little more than an enclosed area where apples are pounded by large wooden pestles. In England, Jersey, and northern France, the traditional form was a \\"horse-mill\\" or \\"stone mill\\". A horse-mill consists of a circular trough made of stone, in which is set either one or two large stone wheels called \\"runners\\". At the center is a pivot point or \\"nut\\". A horse is harnessed to the outside of the wheel, and driven in a circle, slowly grinding the apples to a pulpy mass called pommage. Through the early 19th century, this was the dominant form in England. By the early 20th century in Britain, however, the stone mills had largely fallen out of fashion, increasingly replaced by the roller mills, though they continued to be the primary form in France. Though the stone mill had been introduced to and used by the American Colonists, its usage was not well recorded, and by the end of the 19th century it was essentially unknown in the United States. In Germany, apples were traditionally grated by hand rather than crushed. A later innovation was the toothed roller-mill. These mills use toothed cylinders made of stone or metal to grind the apples into pomace. Such mills are portable, and produce a pomace that is finer than that of the large horse-mills. It was first introduced to England in 1689 by agriculturalist John Worlidge, who adapted it from the sugar-cane crushers used in the West Indies. Yet as of the beginning of the 19th-century, such mills could not handle the same quantity in bulk as the horse-driven mills. Pressing After the apples have been ground into pomace, the pomace must be squeezed to extract the juice. This is done in a device called a cider press, which like the cider mill, takes various forms. One form is a large horse-operated lever press or screw press. This method was common in Britain, Jersey, and northern France, as well as the United States. This form involves either of two methods to hold the loose pomace in place as it is pressed. The first is to use alternating layers of straw and pomace, creating a mixture known as \\"cheese\\". The other is to wrap the pomace in cloth. The German tradition used smaller, hand-operated lever presses in the same manner. An alternate form is the \\"hand press\\" (sometimes called a \\"Continental Press\\" in England), a small screw-press operated by hand. These presses dispense with the various methods of covering the pomace, and instead use a container made of wooden staves. By the turn of the 20th century, hydraulic presses had begun to be introduced. After the juices had been extracted, the leftover pressings are variously known as \\"math\\", \\"cake\\", \\"powz\\", \\"mure\\" or simply \\"pommage\\". It might either be watered and pressed again to produce a weak cider known as ciderkin, or when still fresh, used as animal feed.

MPA requires that a second authorized user approve an action before it is allowed to take place. This pro-actively protects data or systems from an undesirable act. Architecture Existing methods to protect data and systems from the malicious insider include auditing, job rotation and separation of duties. Auditing is a reactive method meant to discover who did what after the fact. Job rotation and separation of duties are limiting techniques meant to minimize prolonged access to sensitive data or systems in order to limit undesirable acts. In contrast, MPA is a pro-active solution. An advantage MPA has over other methods to protect from undesirable acts by a malicious insider or inexperienced operator is that MPA is pro-active and prevents data or systems from compromise by a single entity acting alone. MPA prevents the initial undesirable act rather than dealing with a breach or compromise after the fact. Application Multi-party authorization technology can secure the most vulnerable and sensitive activities and data sources from attack by a compromised insider acting alone. It is somewhat analogous to weapons systems that require two individuals to turn two different keys in order to enable the system. One person cannot do it alone. Another example is to consider access to a lock box in a bank. That access requires multiple parties, one the lock box owner and another a bank official. Both individuals act together to access the lock box, while neither could do so alone. MPA, in like manner, ensures that a second set of eyes reviews and approves of activity involving critical or sensitive data or systems before the action takes place. Multi-party authorization is suitable for a wide variety of applications. MPA can be implemented to protect any type of sensitive data in electronic form or any activity within a network infrastructure or computerized control system. An electronic health record is an example of a data record that could be protected by MPA. Multi-party authorization provides pro-active protection from undesirable acts by the inexperienced technician or malicious insider.

She was a dramatic soprano who had a brief but stellar public career especially in London and Paris in the middle years of the 19th century.Georges Favre, Une grande Cantatrice Ni√ßoise: La Vicomtesse Vigier (Sophie Cruvelli) 1826‚Äì1907 (√âditions A. et J. Picard, Paris 1979). She was admired for her vocal powers and as a trag√©dienne. Both Verdi and Meyerbeer created operatic roles with the intention that she should first perform them.This article uses some information derived from German Wikipedia, where the sources are generally but not specifically attributed. Origins and training Sophie Cr√ºwell was the daughter of a Protestant Bielefeld familyMost sources say her father was a Protestant minister, but some call hers a 'merchant family': Dagmar Gieseke, Public Archivist of Bielefeld (Stadtarchiv und Landesgeschichtliche Bibliothek), states that Cruvelli's father was a Tabak-fabrikant (see external link). of comfortable means. She showed an early disposition towards music, and she and her sister Marie (later a mezzo-soprano) and her brother (later a baritone) were encouraged and assisted to training by the family.G. T. Ferris, Great Singers Series 2, 'Sophie Cruvelli' (Appelton and Co., New York 1891) Ferris on Cruvelli complete at Gutenberg Sophie and Marie commenced their vocal studies with Louis Spohr in Kassel.Stated in German Wikipedia: source not specified. In 1844 their mother took the girls to Paris to continue their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, and then with the distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni.Ferris, Great Singers. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Cr√ºwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that if she was going to do nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan.Ferris, 'Sophie Cruvelli'. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris. In Milan she first went to audition with the impresario Bartolomeo Merelli, but was so struck with fright that she could not produce any sound at all. After this she resolved to return to Bielefeld: but the (later famous) teacher Francesco Lamperti took the situation in hand, and under his guidance her voice and powers returned and flourished.Charles E. Pearce, Sims Reeves ‚Äì Fifty Years of Music in England (Stanley Paul, 1924), pp. 160-61 (footnote). Some sourcesE.g. Elizabeth Forbes, 'Sophie Cruvelli' (short biography) attribute her debut to Venice at La Fenice, as Odabella in Verdi's Attila. She appeared in that role at Udine on 24 July 1847, and later as Lucrezia in I due Foscari in the same theatre. Later in 1847 she was singing Odabella in Rovigo, and it was there, at the end of that year, that Benjamin Lumley heard and ('struck with the splendid voice, the impulsive dramatic temperament, the spirit, and the captivating person') recruited her for the season of 1848 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, of which he was the impresario. The family objected that she was too young to face the English public, but Lumley was urged to proceed by the tenor Rubini: 'I tell you plainly, and with deep conviction, that you are making an excellent acquisition. A most beautiful voice ‚Äì give her good models and a good maestro'. Sophie herself was delighted with the proposals. In the winter of 1847 she made several appearances at La Fenice.Benjamin Lumley, Reminiscences of the Opera (London, Hurst and Blackett 1864), 204‚Äì05, 211. Cruvelli, who was becoming a distinctly striking and beautiful woman, developed a reputation for romantic eccentricity. It was relatedTold by the critic Maurice Halperson, cited in Alan Walker (Ed), Living with Liszt: from the diary of Carl Lachmund, an American pupil of Liszt, 1882‚Äì1884 Issue 4 of Franz Liszt studies series: Volume 4 of Dance & Music (2nd Edn, Pendragon Press, 1995), , p. 29 and note 6. that she was one of those young women who followed Franz Liszt 'from city to city, attending his concerts in a front row seat, much to his annoyance. Her prima donna rivals had nicknamed her \\"Mme. Hinterlist\\" ‚Äì meaning both \\"after Liszt\\" and \\"perfidious\\".' If the depth of her friendship with Liszt was unproven, her relations with the married singer Agardi Metrovich are more directly in evidence.Letter (60) of Helen Blavatsky referring to Metrovich's statement that Cruvelli was his mistress. London, Milan, Trieste Cruvelli made her London d√©but at Her Majesty's Theatre for Lumley on 19 February 1848 as Elvira in Verdi's Ernani with two other debutants, Signor Cuzzani (a Berlin favourite) as Ernani, Giovanni Belletti as Silva, and the tenor Italo Gardoni, London's young favourite, in the baritone role of the King (for good measure). Cruvelli at first experienced 'sudden and awful nervousness' before the thronged audience, but soon settled and was a decided success.Lumley, Reminiscences, 212‚Äì13. Next she appeared as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia with Gardoni, Belletti (as Figaro) and Federico Lablache as Bartolo. There followed (14 March) the British premiere of Attila (in which Cruvelli had already distinguished herself), with Belletti, Gardoni and Cuzzani. If Italy thought the work Verdi's masterpiece, London didn't like it. H. F. Chorley wrote: So instead, I due Foscari was revived for Cruvelli's appearance with Filippo Coletti. A brief illness delayed her performance of Lucrezia Borgia, but the cast of Gardoni (Gennaro), Luigi Lablache (Alfonso) and the debutante Mlle Schwarz (Orsini) made it worth waiting for. All this occurred before Easter 1848.Lumley, Reminiscences, 212‚Äì216. H. F. Chorley at this time said she had 'youth ‚Äì a presence commanding, if somewhat peculiar ‚Äì a superb voice, almost three octaves in compass ‚Äì and a fervour and ambition which it could not then be foreseen would take their after-forms of reckless and perverse eccentricity.'H. F. Chorley, Thirty Years, 24 Jenny Lind was then the London rage, and Cruvelli now appeared as the Countess to Lind's Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro, with Lablache, Coletti, Belletti and Bouche, and with Mlle Schwartz as Cherubino. Later that season Cruvelli sang Abigaille in Nabucco. Eugenia Tadolini was also making her debut, but did not maintain the foothold in London which Cruvelli achieved. 'It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant.'Lumley, Reminiscences, 224‚Äì25. The whole season culminated in Lind's Farewell. Cruvelli had a short spell in Bellini's Norma at the Royal Opera House in Berlin, and then sang from November 1848 until March 1849 at the Teatro Grande in Trieste, mainly in Verdi's Attila, Ernani and Macbeth, and in Don Pasquale. At the end of 1849 she sang Odabella in Verdi's Attila as the leading lady at the opening night of La Scala in Milan, and through the ensuing season (1850) made no fewer than sixty appearances there in Attila, Nabucco, Ernani, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Norma and Vincenzo Capecelatro's David Riccio.See German Wikipedia (source not specified): Elizabeth Forbes, Sophie Cruvelli. In the same year she appeared at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa in Verdi's new opera Luisa Miller, and repeated her Ernani, Nabucco, Attila, and Norma.G. Tanasini, R. Iovino & B. Mattion, I paleoscenici della lirica: cronologia dal Falcone al nuovo Carlo Felice (SAGEP, Genova 1993), 479‚Äì603. In Milan and Genoa she made a great sensation. 1851‚Äì1852: Th√©√¢tre-Italien (Paris) and Her Majesty's (London) Portrait of Sophie Cruvelli by (1852) Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne When Benjamin Lumley also became impresario of the Paris Th√©√¢tre-Italien in 1851, he engaged Cruvelli and the tenor Sims Reeves for both London and Paris. Reeves made his own Paris debut in the winter season in Linda di Chamounix, with Henrietta Sontag,Pearce, Sims Reeves, p. 160. and then went on to partner Cruvelli in her debut there, in April 1851, in Ernani.Pearce, Sims Reeves, 99. This was a sensation, and in Paris she also sang Norma, La Sonnambula, Fidelio and Semiramide. It was however at Her Majesty's, London on 20 May 1851, that she and Reeves won very great acclaim for their Fidelio, the first of five performances which established her in the public mind as a leading trag√©dienne: critics compared her with her great predecessors in the role, Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient and Maria Malibran.For a description of her Leonore, see Joseph Bennett, Musical Times January 1900. Gardoni and Calzolari led the Chorus of Prisoners. For this production, musical recitatives were composed by Michael Balfe imitating Beethoven's style, pointing the content of the dialogue with motifs drawn from the principal arias.Wm. Alexander Barrett, Balfe:His Life in Music (Remington & Co, London 1882), 196‚Äì197. Most appreciated them, but James William Davison, critic of The Times, was angered because he claimed that Cruvelli had altered the music 'in such a way as to bring it within range of mediocre capabilities.'Jennifer L. Hall-Witt, 'Critics and the elite at the opera' in Cyril Ehrlich, Christina Bashford and Leanne Langley (Eds), Music and British culture, 1785‚Äì1914: essays in honour of Cyril Ehrlich (OUP 2000), p. 142. (Quoting The Times, 26 May 1851) Chorley, never an admirer, thought this was the turning-point, where her decline began.'Up to this time there had been some improvement in the arrangement and command of the admirable materials given to the lady by Nature; but henceforward the misuse of them increased so steadily, and with it her exactions and caprices as an artist, that it was a case of relief ‚Äì not of regret ‚Äì when she left the stage.' Chorley, Thirty Years Musical Recollections, II, 143. A more detailed criticism is given on pp. 173‚Äì74. Then three performances of Norma, in which Cruvelli gave herself free rein, generated much enthusiasm in London. Cruvelli sang at Buckingham Palace on 7 June 1851, and was invited again the following year.'Buckingham Palace Concert Programmes 1837‚Äì60', Elizabeth Costa collection, Cup.403.w.6 The London season included the premi√®re of Sigismond Thalberg's opera Florinda, which did not survive despite a cast including Cruvelli, Reeves, Calzolari, Coletti and Lablache, and despite a royal visit to the performance. This was the London debut of Sophie's sister Maria Cruvelli, in a contralto role. But Cruvelli's successes continued there with Le nozze di Figaro with Sontag, Fiorentini, Coletti, Ferranti and Lablache, and in Ernani with Sims Reeves.Lumley, Reminiscences, 314‚Äì16. Linda di Chamounix was given with both Cruvelli sisters, 'which was less congenial to the wild and passionate nature of the charming Sophie than any of her more tragic parts.' Michael Balfe's opera Les Quatre fils Aymon based on The Four Sons of Aymon was given, as I quattro fratelli as a benefit for the composer, and was a triumph: 'Cruvelli, aided by Gardoni, Pardini, Coletti, and Massol, secured a most effective and spirited execution for the work.'Lumley, Reminiscences, 320. The Her Majesty's concerts took place, including a notable performance of the trio 'Don't tickle me I pray' with each part triplicated, with sopranos Cruvelli, Sontag and Jenny Duprez, tenors Reeves, Calzolari and Gardoni, bassi Lablache and others.Pearce, Sims Reeves, p. 164. Cruvelli had 'extra' performances of Il barbiere and La Sonnambula (sung during the season by Sontag), and was considered to have been the star of the very illustrious 1851 season at Her Majesty's.Lumley, Reminiscences, 316‚Äì321. Late in 1851 Cruvelli went to the Th√©√¢tre-Italien for the winter, and the following spring returned to London to sing with Gardoni and Lablache, appearing in La Sonnambula and Il barbiere di Siviglia, Ernani and Fidelio. However, the affairs of the theatre were failing, a situation fed by rumour and despondency. Lumley's company made valiant efforts: the stalwarts, Cruvelli, Lablache, and Gardoni sang Norma, and were powerful attractions.Lumley, Reminiscences, 334‚Äì35. Lumley had achieved the remarkable coup of booking the soprano Johanna Jachmann-Wagner to sing at Her Majesty's in May 1852, but she (or her father and agent Albert, Richard Wagner's brother) were bribed by a better offer from the Covent Garden management and broke their contract.Lumley, Reminiscences, 335‚Äì36; see also H. Jachmann (trans. M.A. Trechman), Wagner and his first Elisabeth (Novello & Co, London 1944). A lawsuit followed. The \\"Flight of Cruvelli\\" In the midst of this crisis Sophie Cruvelli, the surviving mainstay of the company, suddenly disappeared from London, on the day she was to have sung Lucrezia Borgia.Lumley, Reminiscences, 340‚Äì342. \\"Where's Cruvelli?\\" became a burlesque by-word. She had fled to Germany, and in time reports came in that she was singing in Wiesbaden, and then that she was singing Fid√®s in Le proph√®te at Aix-la-Chapelle. This was the original so-called \\"Flight of Cruvelli\\", and for the time being put an end to her London appearances. Yet when Verdi wanted to cast Cruvelli as Violetta for the premi√®re of La traviata, which was presented with a different singer in Venice in March 1853, he was unable to do so because she was still under contract to Lumley.Julian Budden, Le Opere di Verdi: Dal trovatore alla forza del destino (EDT srl 1986), p. 127. 1854‚Äì1855: L'Op√©ra and Covent Garden During 1853, Sophie Cruvelli made appearances at the Th√©atre-Italien and became a favourite of Emperor Napol√©on III, despite, or perhaps assisted by, her reputation for mischievous ill- temper and unreasonableness.Anent this, see a story in New York Times, 20 January 1884: Mme. Cruvelli in a temper She was increasingly admired by Giacomo Meyerbeer, and in January 1854 she was (with his support) engaged by the Paris Op√©ra at the hitherto highest ever fee of 100,000 francs (about ‚Ç¨600,000) for eight months. She sang Valentin in Les Huguenots before the Emperor and an audience of the great and famous, scored a triumph, and continued with Julia in Spontini's La vestale and with Rachel in Hal√©vy's La Juive.See Elizabeth Forbes, 'Sophie Cruvelli' (short biography), who cites Dwight's Journal, iv (1853‚Äì4), 150‚Äì51. With each role, Cruvelli's stature as a trag√©dienne was increasing. Early in 1854 she was offered the title role in a new opera by Charles Gounod, La nonne sanglante, but declined it. The role was instead offered to Palmyre Wertheimber, a new singer from the Op√©ra-Comique who had made her debut at the Op√©ra as Fid√®s in Le proph√®te and was much admired and praised by Th√©ophile Gautier.Gourret 1987, p. 41; Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 5022. Cruvelli, meanwhile, returned to London for engagements at Covent Garden, where she sang Desdemona in Rossini's Otello (with Antonio Tamburini and Giorgio Ronconi), Leonore (in Fidelio) and Donna Anna (Don Giovanni). Chorley, who never admired her, called it 'an inroad, the result of which in no respect bore out her popularity in the Haymarket.'Chorley Thirty Years, 211. She then went back to Paris to sing Alice in Robert le diable, and through that summer and autumn was the reigning goddess at the Op√©ra. She was required to sing only two nights a week and was receiving a very substantial fee for each performance. By autumn, rehearsals were under way for a new Verdi opera written specially for her, Les v√™pres Siciliennes. Her performance of Les Huguenots , scheduled for the beginning of October 1854, was eagerly awaited. Achille Fould, a senior political minister, increasingly involved himself in her public and private affairs. Wertheimber's premi√®re of La nonne sanglante, with Louis Gu√©ymard, was set for 18 October 1854.Andrew Gann, 'Th√©ophile Gautier, Charles Gounod, and the massacre of La Nonne sanglante,' Journal of Musicological Research 13, no. 1-2 (1993), 49‚Äì66; Anne Williams article re La Nonne sanglante; Stephen Huebner 1990, pp. 40‚Äì42, 285‚Äì287. The Op√©ra administration under Nestor Roqueplan was fragile, despite having had direct State funding; a recent series of new productions had all done poorly. Verdi, Les v√™pres Siciliennes, and the \\"Second Flight\\" A crisis was precipitated when, just before the performance of Les Huguenots scheduled for 9 October, Cruvelli drew her fees and disappeared (her second \\"Flight\\"), taking with her some compromising letters from M. Fould. A distraint was put on Cruvelli's possessions, and a forfeit of 300,000 francs was threatened, but she did not reappear for a month. La nonne sanglante was performed and was moderately successful with receipts averaging over 6,000 francs per evening, but was widely condemned for its libretto. The absence of Cruvelli prompted Verdi to threaten to cancel the premi√®re of the Sicilian Vespers,Letter from Verdi to Roqueplan of 28 October 1854, quoted in Budden 1978, p. 179. and on 6 November Roqueplan, who had run up a deficit of 900,000 francs, was asked to resign, and his adversary Louis Crosnier (former director of the Op√©ra- Comique) replaced him on the 11th.Huebner 1990, p. 40‚Äì41; Harding 1973, p. 87 (900,000 francs); Levin 2009, p. 382 (11 November). In October 1854 the rumour was that Cruvelli had fled to Brussels to be married to Baron Vigier, a Parisian of immense fortune.For example, see: Worcester Journal 21 October 1854, p. 5 or \\"Why Mdlle Cruvelli ran away\\", Sussex Advertiser, 24 October 1854, p. 3. For Verdi, his time at the Op√©ra was one of the most frustrating he had ever experienced. Not only was the librettist, Scribe, unresponsive to his pleas for revisions, until finally, with no premiere in sight and the mysterious disappearance from rehearsals of Sophie Cruvelli who was to sing H√©l√®ne, he was forced to write to the Opera's director, Louis Crosnier: \\"To avoid the catastrophe that menaces us ... I see but one means and I do not hesitate to propose it: dissolution of the contract\\".Verdi to Crosnier, in Kolodin, p. 7 However, with Cruvelli's re-appearance, Verdi persevered for over six months until the opera was finally given its premiere in June 1855, by then having spent close to two years in Paris working on the opera. Cruvelli reappeared as miraculously as she had gone, and on 13 November she sang Les Huguenots: at first there was some hissing, but she rapidly won over the audience by the power of her performance, and triumphed magnificently with receipts climbing to more than 9,000 francs for her first few appearances. The distraints and threats of fines were forgiven. The delayed premi√®re of Les v√™pres Siciliennes, in which she sang H√©l√®ne, took place on 13 June 1855 at the Op√©ra, with Marc Bonneh√©e and Louis Gu√©ymard. This was her last great triumph on the public stage. Performances continued through the year: Charles Santley, en route to Italy to commence his own studies with Lamperti or Nava, delayed in Paris for a day to hear Cruvelli in the Sicilian Vespers on 31 October 1855. On first hearing her, he had thought her a goddess: now he was somewhat disenchanted.Charles Santley, Student and Singer: The Reminiscences of Charles Santley (Edward Arnold, London 1892), 48‚Äì49. Cruvelli after Les v√™pres Crosnier withdrew La nonne sanglante after its eleventh performance on 17 November, saying that 'such filth' would not be tolerated. Wertheimber departed the Op√©ra to sing outside of Paris and only returned later, after Cruvelli's retirement.Huebner 1990, p. 40‚Äì42; Anne Williams; Gourret 1987, p. 41; Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 5022. Gann has speculated that the closure of Gounod's opera may have been at least partly motivated by prima donna politics.Cited by Anne Williams. Meyerbeer maintained steady contact with Cruvelli:Robert Ignatius Letellier (Ed), The Diaries of Giacomo Meyerbeer: The years of celebrity, 1850‚Äì1856 (Fairleigh Dickinson Univ. Press, 2002) . he intended the character of Selika, his 'L'Africaine', to be performed by her, and was working on the score during her final season. However, when she withdrew from the stage he set it aside and did not return to it for long afterwards.Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Musical Memories translated by Edwin Gile Rich (Small, Maynard & Co., Boston 1919), Chapter XX, 'Meyerbeer'. Retirement Sophie Cruvelli in 1875. (Collections of Fratelli Alinari Museum & Palazzoli, Florence) In January 1856 Sophie Cruvelli married Baron Vigier (who later became viscount) and retired from the public stage, at the height of her powers. However she did make further appearances after 1858, mainly in splendid Benefit concerts at her winter residence, the Villa Vigier in Nice, where for many years she drew together the international high-society of the Second Empire in her Salon, the 'Cercle de la M√©diterran√©e'.Elizabeth Forbes, 'Sophie Cruvelli', short biography. These concerts included an annual performance of Norma, the proceeds of which were given to the poor.New York Times, 16 May 1895: article on Sophie Cruvelli (on her presentation to HM Queen Victoria) This was the reason why, in 1874, Pope Pius IX awarded to her, the papal Golden Rose (Rose of Virtue), though she was a lifelong confirmed Protestant.Information from German Wikipedia: source not specified. At one such charity concert in 1881 she became indisposed, and Emma Calv√© stepped in and sang in her place, giving her first public performance.A. Gallus, Emma Calv√© ‚Äì Her Artistic Life (R.H. Russell, New York 1902). In 1881 in Nice, Cruvelli organised the first performance of Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin in France, and herself sang the role of Elsa. It was a bold and sumptuous presentation, and took place in the context of a benefit performance. She remained a figure of public importance into her later life, and was presented to H.M. Queen Victoria (at whose invitation she had sung in 1851, 1852 and 1854) once more in 1895.New York Times, 16 May 1895 (as above). After a visit to the Opera House in Monaco (then newly set up under Raoul Gunsbourg), Sophie Cruvelli died aged 81 on 6 November 1907 in the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo. Her grave memorial is in the P√®re Lachaise cemetery in Paris.Precise details from German Wikipedia: source not specified.

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site and added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1982. The complex itself consists of four buildings. The centerpiece of the district is St. Mary Church at 117 North Monroe Street. The church traces its origins to the St. Antoine aux Rivi√®re Raisin, which was founded on October 15, 1788, and it is the oldest church in Monroe County. The current site was constructed in 1834, consecrated in 1839, and renamed in 1845. That year, the church fell under the leadership of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit, and the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was founded in Monroe the same year. In 1846, St. Mary Academy was an all-girls educational facility built down the road from the church, while Monroe Catholic Central was an all-boys school built right next to the main church. These two schools merged in 1986 to form the coeducational St. Mary Catholic Central (SMCC) high school, which stayed in the heavily expanded Monroe Catholic Central building next to the church at 108 West Elm Avenue. It remains there to this day as the largest building in the historic district and the largest private school in the county. The original church building remained unchanged from its completion in 1839 until it was expanded in 1903. The Brothers of the Holy Cross residential building was constructed in 1870, and the St. Mary Parochial Elementary School was completed in 1903. The current rectory was added to the north side of the church in the 1920s. All of these buildings have their own unique architecture. With only some additions to the SMCC building, the remaining buildings on the complex have remained largely unchanged since the 1920s. Today, St. Mary Church is one of the most important religious institutions in Monroe. The St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District is bordered to the west by Borgess Avenue, to the north by West Willow Street, to the south by Elm Avenue, and to the east by North Monroe Street (M-125) for an area of about 60 acres (24 hectares). The district is located across Elm Avenue from the George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument and across North Monroe Street from the East Elm-North Macomb Street Historic District. The church complex is also located just across the River Raisin from the Old Village Historic District.

He was the patriarch of the prominent Genesee Valley Wadsworths. Early life James Wadsworth was born in 1768 in Durham, Middlesex County, Connecticut. He was the youngest of the three sons of John Noyes Wadsworth, Sr. by his second wife Esther Parsons. His uncle and namesake was James Wadsworth. James' other brothers were his eldest half brother John Noyes Wadsworth Jr., by his father‚Äôs first marriage to Susan Camp, and his elder full brother William Wadsworth (1765‚Äì1833). James and his brothers are scions of the prominent Wadsworth family of Connecticut, and being a descendant of one of the Founders of Hartford, Connecticut, William Wadsworth (1594‚Äì1675), who under the leadership of Pastor Thomas Hooker helped found that city in June 1636. James Wadsworth was a graduate of Yale University in 1787 at the age of 19. Career After graduating from Yale in 1787, Wadsworth traveled north to Montreal, Quebec in Canada to teach for a year. While away his father, John Wadsworth, died and left his sons a substantial inheritance, estimated to be nearly $15,000 each (over $225,000 in modern terms). James moved back to Connecticut to manage his inheritance. The Genesee Valley Upon his return to Connecticut in the spring of 1789, James and his brother William were summoned to the home of their father‚Äôs prominent and wealthy second cousin, Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth of American Revolutionary War and Continental Congress fame, in Hartford. Jeremiah was considered one of the wealthiest men in Connecticut at the time and was interested in investing in, and financially backing, the efforts of Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, who in the previous year purchased more than of land from the Iroquois Six Nations in Western New York State, known as the \\"Phelps and Gorham Purchase.\\" Jeremiah adjudged James as having \\"ambition,\\" \\"clear mind,\\" and a \\"tenacious will,\\" and so wanted James and William to be Land Agents on his behalf and to personally move to this virgin territory to survey and improve the land while promoting its settlement as well as manage his investment. In return, James and William were offered at his cost ($0.08 per acre) and reduced price for any further purchases, as well as a fee for the sale of Jeremiah‚Äôs land. James and his brother William accepted Jeremiah‚Äôs proposal and the following spring, in May 1790, 22-year-old James, his brother William, a black woman named Jenny, Gad Wadsworth, a relative who was in charge of the chattel, and several ‚Äúaxe men‚Äù headed west to the Genesee Valley. After several difficult weeks of travel by rivers, streams and over land by Indian trails, they arrived on the banks of the Genesee River at a place the Seneca nation called Big Tree on June 9, 1790. They claimed the land and built a log cabin in a meadow near the east bank of the Genesee River about half a mile west of the present site of \\"The Homestead\\" at Geneseo, New York. Beyond the settlements near Fort Niagara, they were the first Europeans to establish a permanent settlement west of Seneca Lake. Both James and his brother William had an innate sense of honor and integrity, even to a fault, as James was involved in two separate duels. James was a theorist, planner, colonist and lover of books while William was more down-to-earth, a working farmer, militia officer and a \\"man with the common touch.\\" James was the more scholarly of the two, and had a shrewd mind for business and a talented negotiator, while William was a rugged hands-on type with a natural penchant for husbandry, agriculture and public duty. After the first trees were felled and the log cabin was completed at Big Tree (later renamed Geneseo), Wadsworth immediately began the work for which he was to excel. Starting in the spring of 1791, James traveled to New York City to begin advertising for the sale and settlement of Genesee Valley lands. He then traveled on to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, visiting Massachusetts, and returned to Connecticut, all while frequently encouraging settlement by offering incentives for prospective settlers. In February 1796, James sailed to England to promote settlement, but the dismal economic state of affairs in England prevented any headway. So he proceeded ‚Äú...to examine the state of agriculture and view the manufacturing towns.‚Äù While in Europe, James went to the Netherlands, and met with the proprietors of the Holland Land Company, securing a future deal with them for lands west of the Genesee, once the company had secured the Indian title to these lands. In December 1796, James returned to New York, remaining in New York City and further soliciting settlers. Late the following summer, he returned to the Genesee Valley escorting several settlers. When James returned, he found his brother, William, had built a large proper cobblestone house for their occupancy, quite different from the first small log cabin they had lived in for over six years. On August 28, 1797, James and William were the host for the Treaty of Big Tree. This treaty effectively extinguished the Indian title to the land west of the Genesee River and created ten reservations for the Seneca in New York State. By 1800, James and William had acquired , most of which was leased to tenant farmers with the option to buy. William served as Town supervisor for 21 years, and built around them an agricultural community based on enlightened principles of soil conservation, selective stock breeding, scientific agricultural methods, aesthetic preservation and public education. Educator Wadsworth was known as a man who cherished education and learning throughout his life. He was heavily involved in the promotion of teacher training in Geneseo and starting a primary school there, seeking out the school master, the greater part of whose wages would he paid himself. In January 1829, he wrote former clerk, Philo Fuller, a State Assemblyman, to urge the passage of legislation to establish county high schools with well- educated teachers. James wrote to him: \\"To improve the common schools in this state, the employment of more able instructors is indispensable.\\" He lobbied the State's superintendents of public instruction. In 1830, James was selected to represent Livingston County at a New York State Corresponding Committee at Utica, New York. He pressed two issues in particular: \\"Are Common Schools Worth the Money Paid?\\" And \\"Whether to Establish an Institute to Train Teachers.\\" At another meeting in January 1831, he was elected Vice President of the Eighth Senatorial District to investigate the need for institutions for teacher training. On March 11, 1833, James invested $6,000 of his own capital toward what he hoped would be a start toward the funding of school libraries. James created a trust to compile, print and distribute to the trustees of each common school in New York State courses of popular lectures \\"adapted to the capacities of children\\" which could be \\"conveniently read in half an hour.\\" The lectures were to be on six subjects: On the Application of Science for the Arts, On Agriculture and Horticulture, On the Principles of Legislation, On Political Economy, On Astronomy and Chemistry, and On the Intellectual, Moral and Religious Instruction of the Youth of this State by Means of Common Schools. He also underwrote the cost of publishing and distributing John Nicholson's The Farmer's Assistant and John O. Taylor's The District School in 1834. In 1838, New York Governor George W. Patterson wrote, ‚ÄúIn regard to the origin of the School District Library System of this state, I will say to you, that the whole credit belongs to the Honorable James Wadsworth, of Geneseo...\\" Patterson insisted that he had just performed his \\"duty\\" to obtain a bill permanently earmarking funds for school libraries, over what he considered violent objections. Rather, \\"the credit of all that has been done belongs to the praise-worthy efforts of Mr. Wadsworth.\\" Wadsworth wanted a library \\"open and free for the gratuitous use as well of the inhabitants of the County of Livingston\\" and also wanted a new public library to be located in Geneseo. He privately funded the Geneseo Atheneum in 1842, which opened with books, scientific equipment and mineral specimens, which were to be available to all. He opened this library to promote \\"the moral and intellectual instruction of the young and the diffusion of science and literature.\\" His own books and specimens became the basis for it and the library/museum was later renamed the Wadsworth Library.

The film won five awards at various film festivals, including Best International Documentary at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, best feature-length documentary at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and the Golden Gate Award for Documentary Feature at the San Francisco International Film Festival. Although the film was generally well received, it was also controversial and reactions from audience members and critics were sometimes very angry. The film was produced with the support of The New Israeli Foundation for Cinema and Television.Yoav Shamir, Checkpoint, 2003; end credits Synopsis Checkpoint is shot in cin√©ma v√©rit√© style with no narration and very little context. Shamir himself is absent from the film except for one scene in which a border guard asks him to try to make him \\"look good,\\" and Shamir asks how he should do that. The camera films people trying to cross at various checkpoints. At some, such as the high-tech fortress like that at the Gaza Strip crossing there are hundreds of people crowded, waiting to get through. At others such as at South Jenin there is just a truck blocking the road while Palestinians trickle by. Interactions vary, ranging from mundane to mildly frustrating to maddening in their unfairness. Sometimes people show their identification cards without incident but much of what Shamir has chosen to include are the messier incidences. A school bus full of kids (averaging around eight years old) the viewer sees several times and passes at South Jenin quite regularly (the bus driver says everyday) is emptied and told that it cannot proceed. A family is separated because a border guard does not see the need for the father to accompany his family to the doctor because he is not sick. A woman sends her crying children back home on their own because their papers are not in order. Hundreds ignore soldiers at one place and walk through to town, many carrying nothing but groceries. On the way to Nablus an ambulance is stopped and each passenger is forced to explain what their need for treatment is. A soldier calls Palestinians animals while they wait at Kalandia checkpoint in the snow. Sometimes the soldiers are obviously playing around with the people they are monitoring but often it seems that they are following arbitrary orders outside their control. The situation is only worsened by the fact that rarely does either party speak the same language: The entire film is spoken in patches of Arabic, Hebrew and English. Significance Checkpoint is a part of the independent digital documentary movement in the early 2000s, thanks to the introduction of relatively inexpensive digital tape-based video cameras and the sudden affordability of powerful desktop video editing systems.Baker, Maxin, Documenting In the Digital Age, 2006, Oxford, Focal Press This in-the-trenches filmmaking lent itself to direct cinema or cin√©ma v√©rit√©, a definition that spans from reality TV to the Pennebaker films of the 1960s. Even the astoundingly popular documentaries in the 2000s such as Fahrenheit -9-11 and Supersize Me may have been driven by narrative and personal point of view, but their camera style certainly draws on the v√©rit√© trope of letting reality play out before the camera. Recalled as The Year of the Documentary, these films came out in 2004 during a convergence of new media possibilities and world conflict including 9-11, as well as tensions in the Middle East during the Second Intifada, according to Paul Falzone in his dissertation, Documentary of Change.Falzone, Paul, \\"Documentary For Change\\" Dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 2008 ‚ÄúFrom this conflict emerges a generation of muckraking filmmakers and a new style of documenting filmmaking,‚Äù wrote Falzone. Maxine Baker in her book, ‚ÄúDocumenting in the Digital Age‚Äù goes a bit further. She refers to the digital revolution as no less as explosive as the Lumiere Brothers‚Äô invention of the Cinematograph during the turn of the 19th Century. According to Falzone, a specific kind of documentary was forged by filmmakers looking to challenge mainstream media‚Äôs interpretation of events. She observed that this new batch of films tended to replace the protagonist with antagonist. In Checkpoint‚Äôs case, the director Shamir replaced the antagonist with the subject, which in turn served as the antagonist. But while the director may have omitted narration or any stated point of view, he sticks to the v√©rit√© technique of hammering home a focused point. Checkpoint follows the looming sense of futility from shutting down access between two groups of people. In an interview with Documentary Film Quarterly in 2004, Shamir says, ‚ÄúEverybody is like a victim; the soldiers, the Palestinians. I want to show what effects the occupation has on the Palestinians but even more what the effects are on society.‚ÄùDocumentary film Quarterly, Issue 52, 2004 14-15, \\"Purposeful Film Making\\" Awards The film received five festival awards, including Best Feature Documentary at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Best International Documentary at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival and the Golden Gate Award for Documentary Feature at the San Francisco International Film Festival.

Print.\\"Kansas the Plainskeeper.\\" The Nature Conservancy 2006: 5. Print. Early life and education Lloyd Hulbert was born in Lapeer, Michigan on June 27, 1918. He attended college at Michigan State University and in 1940 earned a bachelor's degree in Wildlife Conservation. During World War II he chose, instead of fighting, to volunteer for the Civilian Public Service.1. Hulbert, being a Quaker, was a pacifist for moral reasons.[5]Pauly, Philip J. Fruits and Plains-The Horticulture Transformation of America. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 2007. Print. People in the Civilian Public Service were conscientious objectors to the war who worked in the United States in the areas of soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, social services and mental health. While in the Civilian Public Service, Hulbert performed range reseeding research in Montana and worked as a 'smoke jumper'. A 'smoke jumper' is a \\"wildland firefighter who specializes in parachuting to fires in remote areas.\\" \\"His experiences as a smoke jumper fueled a subsequent interest in the role of fire in natural ecosystems which became a major focus of his research in later years.\\" Hulbert received his Ph.D. in Botany and Plant Ecology from Washington State University in 1953. \\"His dissertation research at Washington State [University] concerned ways to accelerate succession on rangelands from introduced biomes such as cheatgrass to indigenous perennial species.\\" Work at Kansas State University and the Foundation of Konza Prairie Hulbert began working at Kansas State University in 1955 as an assistant professor of botany and plant pathology. He received \\"subsequent promotions to associate and full professor,\\" over the next few years. \\"Nine faculty in five departments at KSU began meeting in 1956 to discuss the need for a prairie area for ecological research to complement the prairie areas being used to study livestock production.\\" Hulbert and other faculty drafted a report in 1958 that led to increased support for ecological prairie research. Lloyd HulbertHulbert had a particular interest in researching the Bluestem, or tallgrass, prairie, which \\"had existed in a state of dynamic balance for at least 10,000 years.\\"Popper, Joe. \\"Life on the Konza.\\" The Kansas City Star 7 June 1987. Print. Hulbert hoped to learn about how the prairie was \\"self-sustaining and stable, yet in less than 200 years of agricultural use, the same land ha[d] begun to change. Vital nutrients [were] constantly [being] lost. Erosion ha[d] become serious.\\" The highly productive agricultural zone‚Äîthe 'corn belt' is located where there used to be prairie so it was very important to learn about the soil in that area.\\"Mother Nature's Grass Roots Laboratory.\\" Topeka Capital-Journal 2 Nov. 1986. Print. In the mid-1960s Hulbert spent 18 months trying to find an area of prairie that would be suitable for his ecological research.Reichman, O. J. Konza Prairie A Tallgrass Natural History. Lawrence: University of Kansas, 1987. Print. Once an appropriate area was found, Lloyd Hulbert and biologist Richard Marzolf went to Washington D.C. to try to get federal funds, but were unsuccessful. The Nature Conservancy was interested in providing funds and after negotiations with landowners, the first portion of land was bought. It \\"consist[ed] of 916 acres in Geary County north of Interstate 70 [and] was transferred to the stewardship of Kansas State University by the Nature Conservancy on 30 December 1971.\\" More land was bought over the next several years, also by the Nature Conservancy (through an initially anonymous donor, posthumously credited to Catherine Ordway), so that the total land was in 1977. This land was named Konza Prairie at the request of Catherine Ordway. Konza Prairie is still used to perform long term research carried out by KSU biology department and also allows visiting scientists to come to conduct their own research. Hulbert was the first director of Konza Prairie, and served as director until his death. Research Hulbert was known for his research of Bluestem prairies, prairie-forest relationships, fire on grassland and fire's effects on soil. Many experiments that were done on Konza Prairie were about how fire affects the prairie ecosystem as a whole. Numerous plots of land were set aside and it was decided how often each plot of land would be burned‚Äîwhether it be each year, every two years, every 4 years, every ten years or never burned. Konza Prairie Biological Research StationOne experiment was about how burning affects increased production and flowering. There were several variables tested to try to find out why there was such an increase in production and flowering after burning, variables such as warming of the soil, an increase in the surface light intensity and an increase of ammonium nitrate in the soil. These variables were all found to increase production and flowering, but not as much as increases after a burning.Hulbert, Lloyd C. Causes of Fire Effects in Tallgrass Prairie. 1988. Web. Another experiment of Hulbert's, that took place over ten years, was about how highland and lowland, as well as fire, affects the biomass produced by the prairie. The biomass was much larger on lowland sites that had been burned than on lowland sites that had not, but there was only a small difference between highland sites being burned or not burned. Unburned areas, however, had much greater amounts of woody plants. Family and later life Hulbert was given several awards for his dedication in the study of Bluestem prairie and work in helping to create Konza Prairie. He received the Nature Conservancy's Oak Leaf Award in 1977 and the President's Stewardship Award in 1978. He was also awarded the prestigious Sol Feinstone Environmental Award (given annually \\"to only five individuals whose voluntary efforts contribute to environmental improvements\\") in 1986. He and his wife Jean had four sons, Steven, Mark, Thomas, and John.1. \\"Lloyd C. Hulbert.\\" The Manhattan Mercury 27 May 1986. Print. Hulbert died on May 23, 1986 (at the age of 68).

On 4 July 1904, at Larderello, Piero Ginori Conti powered five bulbs from a dynamo driven by a reciprocating steam engine using geothermal power. In 1905 he increased power production to 20kW. This system improved to the point that in 1916 it distributed 2750 kW of electricity in the entire area surrounding the village, including nearby cities of Volterra and Pomarance. With a new international reputation, Larderello was visited by Marie Curie during the First World War. In 1912, he succeeded his father-in-law, who had no male heirs, as the majority shareholder of the family business. This year sees the installation of the first geothermal power plant in Larderello, and the merger of three companies competing in the production of boric acid into a new company, the Societ√† Boracifera di Larderello. This restructuring strengthens the family's control of the company's stock and compensates for the increasingly stiff competition from America and the decline of boric acid production. Fascism's influence on business The geothermal electricity project was put on hold until 1921, after the war and years of social unrest were calmed by the arrival to power of Benito Mussolini, of whom the Ginori Conti / Larderel families were big supporter. The first general campaign in favor of the strike at Castelnuovo near Larderello broke out in 1915, in spite of the care that \\"prince-father,\\" faithful to the principles of Larderel, offered to the wives and children of the workers who were on the battlefront. After the war, in which his children and wife (a nurse) served, the first strike hit the various establishments in the Larderello S.p.A., except Larderello itself: the resistance of the worker's union ran from 9 May to 9 June and continued sporadically until October 1920. The work resumed with enormous social losses for the workers: 400 employees were laid off, health care stopped being free, and a paid salary ceased to be guaranteed in case of illness. Moreover, workers now had to pay rent for their homes, were enrolled in the National Fascist Party (PNF) and came under surveillance and guard by members of the same PNF. The area fell under fascist influence from Larderello, until the creation of the tenth combat battalion on 16 October 1920, the first and only in the area until 1922. In October that year, the workers participated in the march on Rome. Tuscan fascists built local networks through the various sports clubs or other diversions already set up under the influence of philanthropic Larderel and Ginori Conti. Later Years On 27 March 1931 the first fumarole exploded with a force and a roar so constant that local residents sealed doors and windows to be able to sleep. The noise was such as to be heard in the cities of Volterra and Massa Marittima, 25 km away. In 1936, Ferrovie dello Stato opened a new 60 MW power, producing two million pounds of water vapor, in addition to natural gas (93% carbon dioxide, 2.5% hydrogen sulphide, 4.5% of residual fuel). The prince, many times deputy of Volterra (1896‚Äì1919) and senator of the Kingdom in 1919, was now assisted by his eldest son John (1899‚Äì1972) [1], doctor of chemistry, general manager of establishments, and his youngest son Frederick (1909‚Äì1975), Deputy Director General and Director of Research Laboratory, which opened in 1938. The independence achieved by the Societ√† Boracifera di Larderello and emancipation from the two groups hitherto hegemonic power system Societ√† Ligure Toscana di Elettricit√† and the Societ√† Electrica Valdarno, then merged into Selt-Valdarno, explains the growing interest of the Ferrovie dello Stato for the boric acid plants. After the signing of several agreements after 1932, the Societ√† Boracifera di Larderello finally passed into the hands of the Ferrovie dello Stato in 1939. Despite the war, the Ferrovie dello Stato generated further research into steam and electricity generation, will peak production at 900GWh in 1943. Death Piero Ginori Conti, held in high esteem by the Duke, was made a Grand Cross and Grand Cordon of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, and in 1939, Minister of State. That distinction earned him a state funeral celebrated in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, on 5 December 1939. He left his children a legacy worth 15 million liras at the time, in real estate and securities. Family The prince was widowed in 1925. He remarried to a French woman named Odette Guillemard. From the first marriage he had four sons and two daughters; from the second, a single daughter. The prince was also a Rotarian in the early years of Rotary International in Italy. He became governor of the then District 46, in the year 1928-1929 as well as Chairman of the RC of Florence.

He was part of a wider campaign against German Jews that became a central feature of nationalist politics in Imperial Germany in the late nineteenth century. Early politics The foundation of the Christian Social Party by Adolf Stoecker in 1878 helped to galvanise anti-Semitic activity in Germany and brought Liebermann von Sonnenberg, then an officer in the German Imperial Army, to politics. He came to the fore in 1880 when he was central to the organisation of a petition calling for the removal of the Jews from all public positions.Richard J. Evans (2004) The Coming Of The Third Reich, Penguin, p. 25, The petition attracted as many as 225,000 signatories.Jack Wertheimer (1991) Unwelcome Strangers: East European Jews in Imperial Germany, Oxford University Press, p. 31, Joining with Bernhard F√∂rster, the brother-in-law of Friedrich Nietzsche, he set up the Deutscher Volksverein (German People's League) in 1881 to support the anti-Semitic agenda. The group struggled for support as it focused on a single issue that spawned a number of movements at the time and it declined further when F√∂rster left for Paraguay in 1886 to set up his ill-fated Nueva Germania project.Karl Dietrich Bracher (1970) The German Dictatorship, Penguin, pp. 59‚Äì60, Leadership Following a June 1889 conference of anti-Semites in Bochum Liebermann von Sonnenberg set up his own political party, the Deutsch-Soziale Partei, which became the Deutschsoziale Reformpartei when it merged with Otto B√∂ckel's Deutsche Reformpartei in 1894.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2005) The Occult Roots of Nazism, I.B.

Delivering a two and a half hour lecture on the Talmud he was confronted at its conclusion by Jacob, bearing a copy of the Talmud and demanding Liebermann von Sonnenberg read out the passages he had referred to in his lecture. When Liebermann von Sonnenberg admitted that he could not read even a letter of the Hebrew language, Jacob chided him for speaking about a book which he could not even read and delivered an impromptu lecture of his own refuting the arguments previously advanced. After this pattern was repeated a few more times Liebermann von Sonnenberg was forced to cancel his tour.Walter Jacob (2007) The First Book of the Bible, Genesis, KTAV Publishing House, p. vii, Conservatism His conservatism proved a problem for Liebermann von Sonnenberg when he purchased the newspaper Antisemitic Correspondence from Theodor Fritsch and promptly lost most of the readership after he dispensed with Fritsch's attacks on leading German figures and organised Christianity.Richard S. Levy (2005) Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, p. 22, Liebermann von Sonnenberg's only rhetoric in this vein was directed against Germany's Roman Catholic population when he questioned their patriotism by suggesting that every Catholic had \\"his feet in Germany but his head in Rome\\".Herbert Arthur Strauss (1993) Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism 1870-1933/39, Walter de Gruyter, p. 111, Reichstag Liebermann von Sonnenberg was one of the candidates elected and he soon became noted for his attempts to introduce a bill to ban all Jewish immigration during every session of the Reichstag.

The four square league Rancho Laguna Seca was granted to Juan Alvires in 1834. As a result of financial difficulties, Rancho Laguna Seca was sold to William Fisher in 1845. William Gulnac, grantee of Rancho Campo de los Franceses and Fisher's brother-in-law, acted as Fisher's agent.Fisher Ranch House, Coyote Creek Park William Fisher (1810-1850) was born in England and settled in Massachusetts. In 1830 he left as mate on a vessel bound for the West Coast with a load of hides and tallow. He married Liberata Cese√±a (1818 - 1905) in 1834 and continued his trading business in Baja California. In 1846 he decided to return, with his family, to Alta California and establish his home in the Pueblo of San Jos√©. William Fisher was offered, but declined, the office of alcalde, probably because of continuing poor health and his involvement in raising cattle on the rancho and operating his mercantile business in San Jose. Declines Alcalde In 1849, because of deteriorating health, William sold his mercantile store in San Jose to his clerk, Josiah Belden, and returned to the rancho, where he died in 1850, at the age of 40, leaving the rancho to his wife, Liberta Cese√±a, and six children.

Abandoned since its deactivation in 1939, it survives as a hollow shell near the existing skeleton tower. History Green Island attracted attention beginning in 1820 when celestite, a source of strontium, was discovered there during a boundary survey. The United States government purchased the island in 1851, and in 1854 the first lighthouse was built, a wooden structure of which no definite image remains.The image here, taken from an 1889 book, purports to depict the first light; other accounts, however, describe it as resembling the Cedar Point (Ohio) Light, which had a central tower arising from the roof of the structure. This light was equipped with a reflector system. The lighthouse caught fire on December 31, 1863, during a ferocious storm in which the temperature dropped to minus 25 degrees. The lighthouse keeper, Charles Drake, his wife and daughter were forced to take refuge in an outhouse, wrapped in a pair of comforters, after an unsuccessful attempt to quench the fire with buckets of lake water. Drake's son Pitt, attending a party at Put-in-Bay, was dissuaded from braving the storm; the next day he went with a rescue party to the island to find nothing standing but the outhouse. Though suffering from exposure, the three refugees were found alive. The following year a new light was erected, a two-story limestone residence with a square tower applied to one end. In later years a small barn was added to house livestock belonging to the keeper; newspaper reports state that one keeper also maintained a team of greyhounds which pulled his children across the ice to school by sled. In 1889 a boathouse was constructed at the northeast corner of the island, and a walkway, originally of planks but later of concrete, was run the length of the island to link it to the light. By 1900 mining on the island had ceased, and in 1926 the light was automated and the residence abandoned. In 1939 a new steel tower, considerably taller than the old light, was erected on the extreme southwest corner of the island. The old light was discontinued, and at some point vandals set it afire, leaving only the tower and the shell of the house standing among the trees which have grown up in the pasture which once surrounded the station.

While it can be used to carry out many malicious and criminal tasks, it is often used to steal banking information by man-in-the- browser keystroke logging and form grabbing. It is also used to install the CryptoLocker ransomware. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation, it became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009 security company Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek. Similarly to Koobface, Zeus has also been used to trick victims of technical support scams into giving the scam artists money through pop-up messages that claim the user has a virus, when in reality they might have no viruses at all. The scammers may use programs such as Command prompt or Event viewer to make the user believe that their computer is infected.  Detection  Zeus is very difficult to detect even with up-to- date antivirus and other security software as it hides itself using stealth techniques. It is considered that this is the primary reason why the Zeus malware has become the largest botnet on the Internet: Damballa estimated that the malware infected 3.6 million PCs in the U.S. in 2009. Security experts are advising that businesses continue to offer training to users to teach them to not to click on hostile or suspicious links in emails or Web sites, and to keep antivirus protection up to date. Antivirus software does not claim to reliably prevent infection; for example Symantec's Browser Protection says that it can prevent \\"some infection attempts\\".  FBI crackdown  FBI: The Zeus Fraud Scheme In October 2010 the US FBI announced that hackers in Eastern Europe had managed to infect computers around the world using Zeus. The virus was distributed in an e-mail, and when targeted individuals at businesses and municipalities opened the e-mail, the trojan software installed itself on the victimized computer, secretly capturing passwords, account numbers, and other data used to log into online banking accounts. The hackers then used this information to take over the victims‚Äô bank accounts and make unauthorized transfers of thousands of dollars at a time, often routing the funds to other accounts controlled by a network of money mules, paid a commission. Many of the U.S. money mules were recruited from overseas. They created bank accounts using fake documents and false names. Once the money was in the accounts, the mules would either wire it back to their bosses in Eastern Europe, or withdraw it in cash and smuggle it out of the country. More than 100 people were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering, over 90 in the US, and the others in the UK and Ukraine. Members of the ring had stolen $70 million. In 2013 Hamza Bendelladj, known as Bx1 online, was arrested in Thailand and deported to Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Early reports said that he was the mastermind behind ZeuS. He was accused of operating SpyEye (a bot functionally similar to ZeuS) botnets, and suspected of also operating ZeuS botnets. He was charged with several counts of wire fraud and computer fraud and abuse. Court papers allege that from 2009 to 2011 Bendelladj and others \\"developed, marketed, and sold various versions of the SpyEye virus and component parts on the Internet and allowed cybercriminals to customize their purchases to include tailor-made methods of obtaining victims‚Äô personal and financial information\\". It was also alleged that Bendelladj advertised SpyEye on Internet forums devoted to cyber- and other crimes and operated Command and Control servers. The charges in Georgia relate only to SpyEye, as a SpyEye botnet control server was based in Atlanta. Possible retirement of creator In late 2010, a number of Internet security vendors including McAfee and Internet Identity claimed that the creator of Zeus had said that he was retiring and had given the source code and rights to sell Zeus to his biggest competitor, the creator of the SpyEye trojan. However, those same experts warned the retirement was a ruse and expect the developer to return with new tricks.

Artis Historicae Penus (Treasury of the Art of History, 1579) is a compilation of 18 ars historica works brought out in 1579 by the late Renaissance Basel printer Pietro Perna. This compendium in octavo appeared in 2 volumes with a copious index. A third volume adds the final work by , often missing in library collections as a separate edition. Three years earlier, in 1576, Perna brought out a single volume in the same format that ran to 1140 pages and featured the central work of Jean Bodin in its title, along with twelve other authors. Perna writes a letter to the lover of histories (Historiarum amatori Typographus). Editor Johann Wolf dedicates the second collection to Frederick I of Wurttemberg. He states that he has included all the princely dedications and prefaces of the single works from the source editions for the sake of completeness. In addition to the two standard Greek texts of the ars historica translated into Latin, the authors, editors and translators are an international list of the most notable humanist writers on history of the period. There are several Catholics, but those closest to the Perna press were Protestants. Among them are six Italians, four Germans, three Frenchmen, a Spaniard and a Hungarian. As humanist members of the Renaissance Res Publica Litterarum all wrote in Latin, though Stupano translated Patrizi's Dieci Dialoghi for Perna.

The ars historica and its classical exempla were important pedagogical tools for the education of princes, treasured for the lessons in statecraft found in histories. They also served as an antidote to the influence of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. The Counter Reformation polyhistor Antonio Possevino fathered a Jesuit ars historica to replace the influence of Bodin and the heterodox authors of the Perna collection in his Bibliotheca selecta 1593 and expanded it to an Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam 1597.

Howard, 1987 He worked as a carpenter in Brooklyn, New York. Taft entered a New York militia unit, rising to the rank of captain by the year 1855. In the same year Taft stood for political office in Brooklyn. He was nominated by the Know Nothing Party for the state legislator. Later the Whig Party also nominated him. The New York Times compared him to a man given an elephant who does not know what to do with it.The New York Times, September 21, 1855, September 25, 1855, October 13, 1855.

War Service The 5th New York Independent Light Artillery was organized in Brooklyn, New York on August 15, 1861. Elijah Taft was commissioned its commander as a captain later in the year.Differing dates appear in New York in the War of the Rebellion, vol. 2, p. 1574. The battery was intended to serve with the Excelsior Brigade on BG Daniel Sickles. The 5th New York Battery sometimes was called the First Excelsior Light Artillery. The 5th New York was mustered into the federal service on November 8, 1861. It departed for Washington, D. C. eight days later and stayed there, encamped near the Capitol, until March 1862.New York in the War of the Rebellion, vol. 2, p. 1571. Then the gunners left for the Peninsula Campaign of MG George B. McClellan. It was assigned to the Reserve Artillery of the Army of the Potomac under Col Henry J. Hunt. The battery's equipment not having arrived, Taft, his officers and men served with other batteries at the Battle of Yorktown, the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. The 5th New York sailed from Harrison's Landing on August 9, 1862, arriving at Falmouth, Virginia. Fully equipped, the battery joined the Reserve Artillery attached to V Corps under Col William Hays, The battery was engaged at the Battle of Antietam, firing from two different positions against Confederate guns on the other side of Antietam Creek, one near the Middle Bridge and one farther to the left. Taft's battery next served in the Reserve Artillery under Col Hays at the Battle of Fredericksburg. It was one of the batteries lined up overlooking the Rappahannock River to support the federal army's crossing of the river. In the Chancellorsville campaign he served under Cpt William M. Graham and BG Robert O. Tyler. In May 1863 his battery fired across the river not far from where it was positioned in December to cover the crossing of VI Corps at the beginning of the Second Battle of Fredericksburg.Charles S. Wainwright, Diary of Battle, ed. Allan Nevins, New York: Harcourt, 1962, pp. 185-186. After Chancellorsville, the Reserve Artillery was reorganized into brigades. Taft was assigned command of the Second Volunteers brigade, composed of four batteries: 1st Connecticut Heavy, Battery B: Capt Albert F. Brooker; 1st Connecticut Heavy, Battery M: Capt Franklin A. Pratt; 2nd Connecticut Light Battery: Capt John W. Sterling; 5th New York Independent Battery under Taft. During the Gettysburg Campaign, two batteries were left in the rear areas of the army. The other two, led by Capt Taft, arrived on the Gettysburg battlefield. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Taft's batteries arrived on July 2 about 10:30 A.M. and were held in reserve until they moved into position. The 5th New York was sent to the Evergreen Cemetery at about 3.30 P.M. This was part of Gen Hunt's effort to cover all Confederate angles of approach to Cemetery Hill. The guns were engaged from 4:00 P.M. until dark. Four guns of the battery were south of the Baltimore Pike firing at Confederate batteries on Benner's Hill. Two guns fired westward. The battery remained in place on the morning of July 3. One gun on Baltimore Pike burst, but the other three relieved the section firing westward against the Confederate guns on Seminary Ridge. They remained in that position until the close of the battle. The 5th New York lost 1 man killed and 2 wounded. The battery's monument stands in the Gettysburg National Cemetery. The 2nd Connecticut Battery under Capt. John W. Sterling reinforced the III Corps line until late in the day on July 2. Later it retired and on July 3 formed line under Ltc Freeman McGilvery on the left of II Corps on Cemetery Ridge. After Gettysburg, Taft command his reserve artillery brigade in the Bristoe Campaign and at the Battle of Mine Run. At the beginning of the Overland Campaign of 1864, Maj John A. Tompkins took command of the brigade, and consequently Taft resumed command of his battery. The battery participated in the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania in the Reserve Artillery, but it was assigned to V Corps at the Battle of Cold Harbor. The 5th New York was sent to the defenses of Washington on May 19, 1864. It was in XXII Corps in July 1864; and in the artillery brigade of VI Corps in August. Next Taft was sent with his guns to serve in the Army of the Shenandoah under MG Philip H. Sheridan. In the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Taft's battery was assigned to XIX Corps. He commanded the Artillery Reserve of the corps at the Third Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Fisher's Hill. When Maj Albert W. Bradbury took command of the Reserve, Taft resumed command of his battery, which was assigned to the first division of the corps. The battery fought at the Battle of Cedar Creek under Capt Taft. Thereafter the battery remained, with Taft as commander, in the Department of West Virginia. The 5th New York was mustered out of service at Hart's Island near New York City on July 16, 1865. Taft received brevet rank of major to date from March 13, 1865.New York in the War of the Rebellion, vol. 2, p. 1574. Post-War Taft filed for a pension in 1886.

In the early 1970s, the forecast office moved from the University of Chicago to a location on west Pershing Rd. The 300 Watt transmitter was located on the roof of the six story building where it remained until 1975 when the transmitter was relocated to the Sears Tower (now Willis Tower).History of NOAA Weather Radio KWO-39 in Chicago NOAA.gov.

Before 1997 it was known simply as Saint-Cl√©ophas. History In 1897, the Parish of Saint- Cl√©ophas was formed when it separated from the parish of Saint-F√©lix-de- Valois. It seems that the name of Saint Cl√©ophas was suggested by √âdouard- Charles Fabre (1827-1896), archbishop of Montreal, to honour Cl√©ophas Beausoleil (1845-1904), who was House of Commons member for Berthier from 1887 to 1899. That same year, its post office opened and a year later the Parish Municipality of Saint-Cl√©ophas was established. In 1997, the parish municipality changed status to municipality and changed its name to Saint- Cl√©ophas-de-Brandon in order to distinguish it from a namesake municipality in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region.

Bucci, 42 U.S.P.Q.2d 1430 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), an early Internet domain trademark infringement case heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, established the theory that hosting a site under a domain name that was the registered trademark of a third party constituted trademark infringement. The case was also important in determining what constitutes \\"Use in Commerce\\" under the Lanham Act in cyberspace. Although these holdings were modified and overruled by various American courts following the decision, Bucci stands as a seminal case for being one of the first cases to address these issues.  Parties Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. is the U.S. affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The organization receives its funding from governmental grants and contracts as well as private contributions. Planned Parenthood has been using the Planned Parenthood mark since as early as 1922 and registered the mark in the 1950s. At the commencement of the action, the Planned Parenthood mark was considered strong, famous, and incontestable under federal trademark law. Richard Bucci, at the time of the decision, operated a daily Catholic Radio program in Syracuse, New York. Bucci operated websites at www.catholicradio.com and www.lambofchrist.com. Background information On August 28, 1996, Bucci registered the domain www.plannedparenthood.com. The site's homepage, as operated by Bucci, contained the text \\"Welcome to the PLANNED PARENTHOOD HOME PAGE!\\" The page also included a scanned cover of the book The Cost of Abortion by Lawrence Roberge. The site also included a text version of the book's foreword and afterword, quotes about the book, a section about the author, and the author's contact information. Planned Parenthood filed a request for preliminary injunction citing trademark infringement under ¬ß¬ß 1114, 1125(a) and 1125(c) of the Lanham Act. Opinion of the court The question before the court was whether Bucci's use of the PLANNED PARENTHOOD trademark in the website's domain name violated the Lanham Act's provisions. Trademark Infringement: Federal trademark law makes it a violation for a party to \\"use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\\" . The court interpreted the \\"Use in Commerce\\" provision broadly to be co-extensive with Congress' commerce clause power under the Constitution. Accordingly, even though Bucci wasn't selling anything on his website, the court held that he violated this provision. First, the court held Bucci was in violation because he was helping Roberge \\"plug\\" his book. Second, by promoting anti-birth control information, Bucci was providing a \\"service\\" to site viewers. Third, because Bucci had the domain name, people looking for Planned Parenthood's services may abandon their search for the legitimate Planned Parenthood site, and this interfered with Planned Parenthood's services.Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Bucci, 42 U.S.P.Q.2d 1930 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). Trademark Dilution: The Lanham Act also provides that the owner of a famous mark can enjoin a party's \\"commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.\\" . Although Bucci claimed that his use of the mark was not commercial, the court held that the use was commercial for three reasons: 1) Bucci was involved in promoting a book; 2) Bucci was a non-profit activist who solicited funds; 3) Bucci's actions were designed to do commercial harm to Planned Parenthood. Because these actions were held to be commercial, the court found that the domain name diluted the PLANNED PARENTHOOD trademark. Impermissible Implied Sponsorship: Under Federal trademark law, a party infringes a mark if the use \\"is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person.\\" The court held that because Bucci offered information relating to anti-abortion materials and solicited funds, he was acting commercially and therefore violated this provision. Likelihood of confusion: Finding that Lanham ¬ß¬ß 1114, 1125(a) and 1125(c) were applicable, the court applied Second Circuit's eight factor Polaroid balancing test in determining if the use was likely to cause confusion.Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1961). Because the bulk of the factors weighed in favor of Planned Parenthood, the court decided that a preliminary injunction was appropriate. Bucci's Defenses: Bucci argued that he was protected because his usage of the mark was both parody and protected by the First Amendment. As for the parody defense, the court held that it did not apply because the initial site viewing did not contradict an internet user's assumption that the site was operated by Planned Parenthood. For the First Amendment defense, the court held that because Planned Parenthood wanted only to restrain Bucci's usage of their mark as a domain, and not his actual speech, the defense did not apply. Conclusion The defendant was barred from using the Planned Parenthood mark, making \\"colorable\\" imitations, representing the defendant (by offering information, products, or services), and from taking any other action in creating confusion for internet users or consumers in relation to the Planned Parenthood mark. Subsequent proceedings Bucci appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In a non-substantive summary order,Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Bucci, 152 F.3d 920 (2nd Cir. 1998) (affirming district court by summary order). the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's reasoning and upheld the injunction. Bucci then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but certiorari was denied.Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Bucci, 525 U.S. 834 (1998) (denying certiorari). Following the denial of certiorari, the domain was transferred to Planned Parenthood in early 1999.Network Solutions, WHOIS search on plannedparenthood.com. Subsequent legal developments In Ford Motor Co. v. 2600 Enterprises, 177 F. Supp. 2d 661 (E. D. Mich. 2001), the court narrowed the Bucci holding by stating that the mere usage of a mark in a domain name in itself is not commercial, emphasizing Bucci's plugging of the book.Ford Motor Co. v. 2600 Enterprises, 177 F. Supp. 2d 661 (E. D. Mich. 2001).Ford Motor Company v. 2600 Enterprises, Citizen Media Law Project (Feb. 13, 2008). In Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F. 3d 770 (6th Cir. 2003), the Sixth Circuit declined to strictly follow the Bucci holding by stating that one of the reasons Bucci infringed was that Bucci adopted another party's mark without any other changes in the domain name and that the mere incorporation of a trademark into a domain was not, in itself, infringement.Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F. 3d 770 (6th Cir. 2003).Dardia, Taubman Co. v. Webfeats., Citizen Media Law Project (Sep. 7, 2007). In Bosley Medical Institute, Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit looked not just at the nature of a potentially infringing webpage, but also the nature of the outbound links from the page, before determining that there was not a use in commerce.Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2005). Because there has been no Supreme Court decision on the issue of what exactly constitutes a \\"Use in Commerce\\" under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law. However, because there have been so many divergent opinions and fact specific determinations from subsequent cases, it is not likely that the case would be strictly followed by other courts.

Stern. The program focuses on the life of Mark Lilly, a social worker employed by the Department of Integration, in an alternate reality version of New York City inhabited by monsters and other creatures. Daniel Powell served as executive producer and Aaron Augenblick as supervising producer and animation director. Ugly Americans aired on Comedy Central from March 17, 2010 to April 25, 2012 with a total of 31 episodes over two seasons. A video game based on the series (Ugly Americans: Apocalypsegeddon) was released in 2011 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and received mostly negative reviews. Production history Ugly Americans premiered on March 17, 2010 on Comedy Central. The series is based on a webseries by Devin Clark entitled 5 On with Alan Whiter, which was later developed by former The Simpsons writer David M. Stern. It was picked for seven episodes in May 2009 and renewed for an additional seven episodes to air in October 2010. The show's second season premiered on June 30, 2011. The cast includes Matt Oberg as Mark Lilly, Kurt Metzger as Mark's zombie roommate Randall Skeffington, Natasha Leggero as Callie Maggotbone, Mark's demon boss and \\"office fling\\", Randy Pearlstein as wizard Leonard Powers, Michael-Leon Wooley as Twayne Boneraper, a demonic bureaucrat, and Larry Murphy as Francis Grimes, a law-enforcement officer. The second season returned on Wednesday, March 14, 2012 at 10:30 p.m. In March, 2013, it was reported that Comedy Central will \\"not [be] moving forward with production on a new season of the series\\". On May 29, 2013, an update on a potential third season was posted on the Ugly Americans Facebook page stating that \\"the network did everything in their power to keep the show alive by trying to find outside financing\\", but ultimately failed, meaning that the show will not continue but they are seeking other avenues to keep the story and characters alive. The series features a stark, flat visual style which Variety Brian Lowry noted \\"vaguely resembles the EC Comics of the 1950s (think Vault of Horror)...\\" Plot An upbeat, mild-mannered man named Mark Lilly moves to Manhattan, which is inhabited by humans and a wide variety of non- human and demonic species. He gets a job as a social worker at the Social Services Division of the Department of Integration, an organization that specializes in the integration of the non-humans that live in Manhattan. Mark lives with a lazy, over-sexed zombie roommate and has a wizard co-worker and a demon boss. His succubus girlfriend, who also works at the Department of Integration, is the daughter of Satan and a human who \\"looks like Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby\\". Mark struggles to stay cheerful and politically correct while working with his bizarre and frequently dangerous companions. Characters Main characters * Mark Lilly (voiced by Matt Oberg) ‚Äì A 21-year-old guy at the Department of Integration's Social Services Division and a newcomer to Manhattan. While attending college, Mark was a brother of the Zeta Psi Fraternity. In the pilot, he had recently moved into his first apartment, a two-bedroom he found on Craigslist. His roommate became a flesh- eating zombie in an ill-conceived attempt to pick up a woman. Despite the frustrations of his job where his boss Twayne Boneraper downsized Social Services to two people in the pilot in order to shift funding to Law Enforcement, Mark maintains a positive attitude. He has an on-and-off relationship (sometimes within the same day) with his immediate superior, a moody succubus named Callie Maggotbone. Despite his lax attitude towards his personal life, Mark is dedicated to his job and the people he looks after, coming into conflict with the anti-immigrant Francis Grimes during the course of his attempts to help immigrants in need. Because Mark is completely undereducated about the different species that inhabit New York, he often makes mistakes with his cases, which is a major theme throughout the series. Mark also has an unhealthy obsession with eggs, and likes Ferris wheels, and on regular occasions has stated his intention to name his children Ethan and Desiree. As of the end of the second season, Mark and Callie are \\"engaged to get engaged\\". * Randall Skeffington (voiced by Kurt Metzger) ‚Äì Mark's roommate, who became a zombie in an attempt to win over a cute girl with a zombie fixation, only to find out she had moved on to warlocks. Now, the unemployed and undead Randall spends his days doing odd jobs to pay the rent (including making amateur, hidden-camera pornographic movies of Mark and Callie having sex). He often uses a catch phrase of sorts by groaning the word \\"crap\\" in a way stereotypical of a zombie moan for brains. Randall hails from South Jersey, a fiercely anti-zombie community, so he has been forced to hide his condition from his parents (especially his father, who fought in the Human-Zombie Civil War). Due to his zombie nature, Randall is frequently losing body parts to decay, forcing him to find replacements at local flea markets. Like other zombies, Randall finds the smell and taste of human flesh appealing. In \\"Treegasm\\", Randall's penis was shown to be a living creature in its own right. He has admitted that he has been living his sexual life so long that he is indiscriminate in choosing sexual partners, in one instance a toaster. He sometimes gets cravings for flesh, causing him to go temporarily insane with desire, and is in a program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous to deal with his cravings (mentioned in \\"An American Werewolf in America\\"). He has rarely missed an opportunity to consume Mark's body parts when it appeared he had been killed or otherwise didn't need them. In \\"Blob Gets Job\\", he mentions to Mark that he only has two working taste buds. He also has a bad habit of using Mark's things without permission. * Callie Maggotbone (voiced by Natasha Leggero) ‚Äì A succubus who is Mark's immediate superior, and his on- again/off-again girlfriend. In between romantic interludes with Mark, she berates him for being so caring and sensitive, although she loves it when he talks about how violent and malicious she is. She is the half human/half succubus daughter of the Devil and a human mother who was drugged by a cult and forced to bear his child, although this was retconned in the episode \\"Callie and her Sister\\" as a marriage of convenience: Her father got out of an arranged marriage to Twayne's mother and her mother got to have the child she always wanted. Callie is frequently marginalized with her demon side, and displays drastic mood swings and physio gnomic morphing between her demonic and more human appearances. Although she is drawn to Mark because he is nice, she feels in her heart that she will inevitably end up with someone like Twayne Boneraper, despite being repulsed by the idea, although she seems indifferent to the fact that such a union would bring about the end of humanity. She dislikes her father, seeming to be more turned on by Mark after believing her father hated him but has shown to deeply care about her mother, going to her to seek advice. Being a female demon, her body goes through a process called Painful Mortal Shedding, in which the toxins in her body cause her to shed her skin for a new one, during which she becomes increasingly deranged where the only thing that can numb the pain is sex. In earlier episodes she is shown to be overly possessive of Mark, and can shape shift. Unlike all pure demons, Callie has a soul, though she can remove it at will, although doing this seems to make her a full demon since when she does remove it, she changes into a large demonic beast. According to Mark's calendar, her period is three weeks long. Due to her demon side, she gets aroused by the sight of physical injury. At the end of the second season she asked Mark to be \\"engaged to be engaged\\" to her. * Leonard Powers (voiced by Randy Pearlstein) ‚Äì A wizard whose path has led him to a desk job at New York's Department of Integration. This suits Leonard just fine, as his primary goals in life are to drink heavily and not rock the boat. He hasn't done any real work in over three years, usually just literally throwing his case files out of a window, relying on Mark and his union, The Wizard's Guild, to cover for him. Leonard bears much resentment to his older but younger-looking brother, the famous magician Christ Angel (a parody of Criss Angel), due to Christ's abuse of Leonard during their childhood. Leonard has a soft spot for Mark, although this may be because Mark covers for him so much. Despite this he appears to have a vast array of knowledge when it comes to the different types of beings that live in New York, as he often explains the importance of something Mark finds pointless or odd, and seems fairly competent at spell-casting, when he bothers to actually focus on it. In one day he became a tuna canner in Alaska, addicted to spray paint, and gained a lot of weight, and was worshiped as a god in D√† Nang, Vietnam, claiming he really needed structure to function properly. In the episode \\"Kong of Queens\\", Leonard mentions to Mark that he currently lives at the YMCA, though in \\"Kill, Mark... Kill!\\", it is shown that he lives in an apartment in a townhouse. * Twayne Boneraper (voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley) ‚Äì A demonic, mid-level government bureaucrat who is the Director of New York's Department of Integration. Twayne loathes Mark's case files and would rather vaporize them than help them, but cannot, because infiltrating the U.S. government appears to be part of some larger demonic plan. Nonetheless, he despises Social Services and their compassionate ways, so in the pilot, he slashes the department down to just Leonard and Mark, the only two he could not get rid of, Leonard due to his union and Mark due to filling the token \\"Bleeding Heart\\" position, in order to allocate most of its funds to law enforcement. Despite his imposing appearance, Twayne often relies on Callie to make sure the department runs properly. Mark has referred to him as a \\"total douche nozzle\\". He also suffers from a severe case of glossophobia and shows signs of being a Momma's Boy, as seen in \\"Hell for the Holidays\\". Whenever he is under great stress he thinks of ponies, often repeating the word \\"ponies\\" aloud to make himself happy. He is also treated with little respect from the other demons, as they often look annoyed when he joins them. Twayne comes from a very well known and prestigious family and is very rich, although he doesn't seem to know how much he has, as when asked how he could afford to write Leonard a check for 1 billion dollars, he asked \\"How much is 12 zeroes?\\". Like most demons, he bleeds white snakes. Twayne's birthday is March 8, 1941 making him aged 70 as of 2011. He is often shown to be a child at heart, like when he and a little girl went to a fair and became BFF's. * Francis Grimes (voiced by Larry Murphy) ‚Äì The head of Department of Integration's Law Enforcement Division, and like Twayne, has utter disdain for non-humans. Preferring to think of them all as \\"illegal\\", he hunts down those who have strayed from the proper bureaucratic procedures that provide a path to U.S. Citizenship ‚Äì at which point Mark must step in to help. As young man, he was an officer of the New York Police Department, but was fired because he kept ruining his partner's sting operations. Grimes' encounters with unruly creatures have left him with a lifetime's worth of both physical scars, such as his missing kneecap, and emotional ones, as that stemming from his broken marriage. Thus, he naturally detests Mark and anyone else who sympathizes with the immigrants. Grimes commands a small but well-funded goon squad that operates out of the D.O.I.'s \\"force floor\\". He has a daughter who in the first season, became a vampire and got married. His relationship with his wife is complex, given that after 15 births (all daughters) Grimes's wife left him and married \\"The Count.\\" He likes to collect model trains and also moonlights as a hospital security guard and contract hit-man. He is also shown to be attracted to older women in \\"Better Off Undead\\". In the second season finale \\"Mummy Dearest,\\" it is revealed that his mother is a Mummy and that he is Egyptian. Grimes has powers of some sort as he is able to perform a ritual to summon Anubis to get rid of his mother. Recurring characters * Croatian Man (voiced by Devin Clark) ‚Äì A man from Croatia. Works in a hospital as a candy striper, but dreams of becoming the President of the United States. Mark once described him as a sociopath. It is revealed in \\"Any Given Workday\\" that his real name is \\"Goran\\", though he only lets his friends call him that. * Doug ‚Äì A very timid giant humanoid koala that lives as a human. He never talks, has no genitalia, and is usually seen in the background. He is usually mistreated by others, or in the wrong place at the wrong time. He almost always is seen weeping, whether frightened, overjoyed, or otherwise emotional. It is indicated in \\"The ManBirds\\" that Doug has a tendency to wander off. A still drawing in the end credits of the episode \\"Kong of Queen\\" portray him firing a rifle in a 1930s zoot suit and hat. The scene resembles Saddam Hussein firing his rifle into the air during a military parade in December 2001. Turns out that photo was actually foreshadowing that \\"Doug\\" is none other than a dangerous former assassin, who abandoned his work after he was responsible for a massacre in Bolivia, in which many women and children perished. Consumed by guilt, Doug moved to the U.S. under a new alias and tried starting his life anew. He still feels very guilty about the aforementioned incident and it is hinted his gentle and timid nature is a direct result of the past trauma. However, he still retains most of his assassin skills (especially when provoked). His dream is to fly. * Erik (voiced by Randy Pearlstein) ‚Äì A robot with senses and emotions, though more often than not has a cynical viewpoint. He is able to read punch cards, but is annoyed that everyone assumes he can. His dream is to be a human boy. It is possible that he is a former human who was murdered and became a robot to survive as stated during the last episode but it is unknown if this is true as this was all part of an elaborate practical joke on Mark. * Great Brain (voiced by Randy Pearlstein) ‚Äì A living brain from Canada. He works as a counter-top sponge, and is usually the first to voice his opinion. He and his wife have a complicated relationship and enjoy playing mind games on others, which is aided by their telepathic powers. * Martin ‚Äì A two-headed worm creature. Works in a coffee shop. Oddly for their species, the heads see themselves as equals, while usually the right dominates the left and treats the left as a slave. They are possibly in love with each other. * Toby (voiced by Pete Holmes) ‚Äì A fish man. He reproduces by fertilizing a pile of eggs. Likes to point out negative or depressing facts. * Aldermach \\"Mac\\" Maggotbone (voiced by Larry Murphy) ‚Äì Callie's father and the highest ranking demon in Hell. He shows signs of having mysophobia, and wishes that Callie had been born a boy. Rather than being specifically Satan himself, \\"The Devil\\" seems to be a title that's passed onto a next candidate, like positions in royalty or government, and one that he'd like to pass down to Callie. It is possible that he is acting as a host for Satan by letting a snake with multiple mouths live inside him. He is an avid fan of the perpetually snake bitten New York Jets, possibly a play on the old expression, \\"God is a Yankee fan\\" and is seen frequently in New York Jets attire and cheering for them on television. His real name is Aldermach Maggotbone (his name most likely based on Adrammelech).episode 16 \\"Callie and her Sister\\" * Rosie (voiced by Julie Klausner) ‚Äì Callie's human mom, separated from Callie's father the Devil. Though it's originally claimed that she was impregnated with Callie when in a cult, she actually sold her soul to Aldermach shortly after they first met so that she could have a baby. However, she truly loves her daughter, claiming Callie was the best thing to come from the union. Rosie's relationship with Aldermach is shown to be strained most of the time with one episode revealing they argue almost constantly, but her relationship with Mark is much better. Her character appears to be modeled after Rosemary Woodhouse from the movie Rosemary's Baby as the story of Callie's conception is similar to the story in the movie and the character looks like Mia Farrow who played Rosemary in the movie. * Grimes' Goon Squad ‚Äì Shown doing all of Grimes dirty deeds when he is not around. Loyal to Grimes, but not afraid to leave him behind if it means their lives, just as Grimes would them. * Girl Anchor ‚Äì A news anchor that reports on New York. Always seen smiling even when saying horrible things. * Melchior (voiced by Randy Pearlstein) ‚Äì Leonard's hologram. Originally used by Leonard as a means to communicate with Mark when he is away, or to perform menial tasks for Leonard, but took on a life and personality of his own in \\"Kill, Mark... Kill!\\". * Buddha ‚Äì A walking, talking Buddha who has golden skin, wears a prayer beads necklace and always bares his large belly. * Medusa ‚Äì A gorgon, a woman with green snakes for hair, a green rattlesnake's tail for lower body and light blue skin. * Amoeba ‚Äì An amoeba that reproduces asexually, yet still manages to get laid frequently. Minor characters * Krystal ‚Äì The girl Randall turned zombie for. She is constantly changing attractions to different species and was already out of her zombie phase when Randall got back to her after going zombie. However, Randall continues to stalk her, having problems admitting the relationship is over, let alone that it never started. * Kid Wizard (voiced by Devin Clark) ‚Äì A kid wizard (or Kizard for short) resembling Harry Potter. Has appeared on Top Wizard. He is often portrayed as a jerk and giving people the finger. * Ratso Demon ‚Äì A nod to Dustin Hoffman's character Enrico \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo from Midnight Cowboy, this demon wears a trench coat, has a five o'clock shadow and slicks his hair back. Ends every sentence with \\"ova heah\\". * Mark's Mom ‚Äì Seen to have slept with Clark Dungaree. Mark has dreamed about her in crotchless panties. * Lillith Maggotbone (voiced by Julie Klausner) ‚Äì Callie Maggotbone's sister in the episode \\"Callie and Her Sister\\" who was born very shortly after Aldremach and Callie's human mother got back together for a very short time. Lilith was born one day after she was conceived in Mark Lilly's apartment on a pool table. Due to a massive amount of hormone injections her mother was taking, so she also aged at an accelerated rate of one year per day. After Lilith was born, Aldremach decided to make Lilith marry Twayne Boneraper instead of Callie. Lilith appears to be more evil than Callie due to the constant use of her powers to harm people. Episodes The first episode premiered on March 17, 2010, following the 14th season premiere of South Park, \\"Sexual Healing\\". It was watched by over 2 million viewers. On April 21, 2010 Comedy Central announced that they had ordered 7 additional episodes of Ugly Americans, to begin airing in October 2010. On December 15th, Comedy Central announced that they picked up the show for a second 14-episode season, which was later expanded to 17 episodes. The first 10 episodes of the second season aired in the summer of 2011 following Futurama and the remaining 7 episodes aired from March 14, 2012 following South Park. Production Pre-production was handled at Brooklyn-based Augenblick Studios, and then the animation for the first season and the first half of the second season was produced in Flash and handled at Cuppa Coffee Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The animation for the second half of season two was handled by Markle Productions and Solis Animation in Toronto. Sound Design and Mixing was done at Great City Productions in New York City. David M. Stern was the showrunner for the first season, and took on this position until the end of the first half of the second season. Starting with \\"Journey To The Center of Twayne\\", the role of showrunner was taken over by Daniel Powell, Jeff Poliquin and Erik Richter, with Stern remaining as a consultant. On May 29, 2013, the show's producers announced the series' cancellation via the show's Facebook page, saying: \\"the network did everything in their power to keep the show alive by trying to find outside financing. We came very close but unfortunately some legal technicalities kept any deals from going through.\\" The possibility of the show continuing via other mediums, such as web shorts or graphic novels, was not ruled out. On September 3, 2014, the series was revived as an app for iOS.https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ugly-americans-comedy- central/id898455673?mt=8 Critical reception Ugly Americans holds a Metascore of 60, gaining positive reviews from the likes of Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. Variety Brian Lowry called it \\"more a triumph of design and concept than execution\\" and added, \\"Not everything works, but with its bountiful supply of visual gags, Americans is just goofy enough to be good.\\" Alex Zalben of \\"UGO Networks\\", commending its mix of slapstick and intelligent humor, as well as actually building relatable characters, says the show \\"is easily the best animated show on Comedy Central since South Park.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News stated, \\"If Ugly Americans comes with a message, it is at least equally determined to just be funny, and at that task, it frequently succeeds. The variety of odd creatures keep the visual gags going, and the dialogue runs steadily toward droll.\\" Largely due to its visual gags and morbid, offbeat humor, the series has also gained negative reception from publications such as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Deseret News. Kris King of Slant Magazine gave Ugly Americans a 50/100 rating and claimed, \\"The show's dry humor, mixed with a rather troubling visual style where everything is stiff and vaguely deformed, mostly just makes you feel uneasy.\\" IGN's Ramsey Isler also gave the pilot episode a 5/10, stating, \\"The show struggles to find some kind of funny [...] The whole thing feels more like a film student project that just didn't quite work out.\\" See also * List of programs broadcast by Comedy Central References External links 2010s American adult animated television series 2010s American black comedy television series 2010s American horror comedy television series 2010s American sitcoms 2010s American workplace comedy television series 2010 American television series debuts 2012 American television series endings American adult animated comedy television series American adult animated horror television series American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters American flash adult animated television series English- language television shows Comedy Central animated television series Comedy Central original programming Hell in popular culture Television about magic Television shows set in New York City Television series about angels Television series about demons Television series about vampires Television series about werewolves Zombies in television Yeti in fiction Television series by Cuppa Coffee Studios ","title":"Ugly Americans (TV series)"},{"id":"25129328","text":"Matam is an urban sub-prefecture in the Conakry Region of Guinea and one of five in the capital Conakry.

The book In its introduction, the books says that new documents had been stored at the US National Archives and Holocaust Memorial Museum, including both diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications, new documents released by the Argentine government and the British Foreign Office, and the diary of Bishop Joseph Patrick Hurley, and that these documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the Usta≈°e regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the postwar \\"ratlines\\" for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.Phayer, 2008, pp. xi- xvi. In the book, Phayer writes, \\"the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions\\".Phayer, 2008, p. xi. Critical reception Charles Gallagher in his article for peer reviewed The Heythrop Journal described the work as \\"perhaps the single most comprehensively important book to appear on the topic of Pius XII's and church-state relations in recent years\\". He notes that Phayer takes up the question \\"of the Vatican attitude of anti-Judaism as distinct from racial anti-Semitism, but he calls the distinction 'paper thin.' And that Phayer's assertion that Catholic anti- Judaism 'led to the physical elimination of Jews,' rather than assisted in creating a climate for such activity is still open to question.\\" He describes Phayer's treatment of the Cold War pope as \\"critical and discerning. The thrust here is to show the pope as the 'First Cold Warrior.'\\" Gallagher regards Phayer's treatment of Ratline activity as \\"impressive and enlightening\\". He further notes the books \\"exceptional primary resourcing\\" and that Phayer is \\"one of the first historians of the Cold War papacy to use Record Group 84, the diplomatic post files of the President's Personal Envoy to the pope. These files, rather than the so-called 'country file' of the Vatican,contain choice memoranda, telegraphic traffic, and intelligence insights previously undiscovered. In the larger trajectory of Phayer's book, the ratline investigations show a pope struck to the core by the insidious nature of worldwide communism. For Phayer, Pacelli's fear of communism allowed him look askance at the funnelling of atrocity perpetrators to South America where they would be expected to fight the spread of communism\\" Gallagher groups Phayers book amongst \\"three excellent treatments\\" he reviewed in 2009, the other two being \\"The Papacy, The Jews, and the Holocaust\\" Frank J. Coppa and \\"The Holy See and Hitler's Germany\\" by Gerhard Besier. He further notes that \\"Phayer makes the apt distinction between professional 'historians [and] writers whose sole objective is to defend Pius XII' and that so often in recent years, camps of defenders and critics have dredged-up one or two documents at a time and blasted their contents, usually out of full context, across media screens. A real strength of Phayer's book is that he is able to briefly assess each of the most prominent one-off assertions and contextualize it within the historiography and in light of the copious new information he has found in the archives.\\" Writing for the Catholic journal New Oxford Review, Vincent A. Lapomarda criticised the book, saying that it was \\"more the product of one man's subjective views than of objective evidence. Using documents released during the Clinton Administration, the author stresses how much the decision-making of Pope Pius XII was devoid of moral considerations because he was preoccupied with saving Western civilization from communism. While Phayer frequently points to omissions in the eleven volumes of World War II documents released by the Holy See, he fills these alleged gaps with documents that have been discredited by such historians as Robert A. Graham and Matteo Sanfilippo. In fact, Phayer himself casts doubt on one of his crucial sources, Unholy Trinity (1991) by Mark Aarons and John Loftus, declaring that it was \\"not a reliable account in many instances,\\" while later asserting that \\"Loftus and Aaron told a tale that was mostly accurate.\\"Pius XII as 'Phayer's Pope'; Vincent A. Lapomarda; New Oxford Review; April 2009 David Kertzer wrote in The American Historical Review \\"The new material that Phayer has brought to light from the National Archives offers a useful contribution to our understanding of the controversial relationship between the Vatican and the perpetrators of the Holocaust, especially in the postwar period.\\"American Historical Review, N0 114 , April 2009 See also *The Catholic Church and the Holocaust References Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust 2008 non- fiction books Books about Pope Pius XII 2008 in Christianity ","title":"Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War"},{"id":"25129336","text":"Mario Szenessy (14 September 1930 in Veliki Beƒçkerek, Yugoslavia (today Zrenjanin, Serbia) ‚Äì 11 October 1976 in Pinneberg, Germany) was a Hungarian- German author, translator, and literary critic.  Biography  Mario Szenessy grew up in the Vojvodina in a multiethnic, multilingual environment. In 1942 his family moved to Szeged, Hungary where he studied German and Slavic languages and discovered the writings of Kafka and Thomas Mann. He became a school teacher and also taught Russian at the Medical Academy, (today Szeged University). Based on his writings about Thomas Mann he received a grant by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and thus came to the University of T√ºbingen in 1963, where he worked on Mann's novella Die Betrogene. Later, he moved to Berlin. Encouraged by Inge and Walter Jens, Szenessy started to write in German and published his first book in 1967, Verwandlungsk√ºnste. Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote: He who is not a German writes a much better German than almost all who publish books in Germany... bitter, sarcastic, and full of temperament, sharp, springy and lapidary.Marcel Reich‚àíRanicki: So phantasievoll wie sachlich. Mario Szenessys Roman Verwandlungsk√ºnste. In: Die Zeit from 24 November 1967 When Szenessy‚Äôs books failed to gain a wider audience, he began to write critiques and translations, and eventually decided to become qualified as a librarian. In 1971, Szenessy received the Hermann- Hesse-Preis for his novel Lauter falsche P√§sse oder Die Erinnerungen des Roman Skorzeny. Mario Szenessy died from a bronchial carcinoma in Pinneberg in 1976.  Work  Szenessy wrote in the epic tradition of Thomas Mann, his literary role model, and his first book received highly favorable critiques. Thus the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung called him a new, wonderful narrator.Barbara Bondy in the SZ, 14/15 October 1967 When, however, he made literary concessions to gain a greater audience, critics bemoaned this development. Yet, remarkable remains Szenessy‚Äôs art to so completely enter into the German language that it had become finally his home.Kritisches Lexikon zur deutschsprachigen Gegenwartsliteratur ‚Äì KLG He always tried to popularize East-European literature in Germany; especially the Hungarian authors Gy√∂rgy Konr√°d and Tibor D√©ry he made more familiar with translations as well as a monograph. In his novel Lauter falsche P√§sse (1971), Szenessy stylized the image of the typical entertainment novel by treating the genre in a sarcastic fashion, thus transferring it into a work of art. In the book the author receives a manuscript that represents an autobiography of Roman Skorzeny. Skorzeny recalls how after falsifying stamps, he proceeds to manufacture the accompanying letters, and then the related biographies. The text demonstrates the patterns of a fascinating narration whereby the first name of the fictitious author (- In German Roman also means novel -) indicates that in this book the subject is the novel per se. Presented are the political thriller, the espionage and criminal novel, the sailors‚Äô yarn and Anglo romantic accounts of mail coach robberies. The introduction is a parody of the classical Bildungsroman and cites existing travesty in literature. The genre of the trivial novel presents itself as a novel in all its forms as if to prove that the novel is just not a lower art form.Willi Winkler: Mario Szenessy.

History  Since it was settled, Canwood has gone through four name changes. Records kept by the post office show the original name of the settlement was Parksiding, but no evidence has shown it ever operated under that name. The post office opened September 1, 1911, operating under the name McQuan; this was a typographical error, and three months later the name was corrected to McOwan. This name honoured Alexander McOwan, a pioneer settler who was an immigration agent, estate manager, and author. On June 1, 1912, the community's name was changed again to Forgaard to honour Jens Forgaard, a Norwegian-born settler who had emigrated from Minnesota. Exactly one year later, on June 1, 1913, the name was changed for the last time to Canwood, which is a portmanteau of Canadian Woodlands. Canwood incorporated as a village on July 18, 1916.  Geography  Canwood is located along Highway 55, and neighbours the towns of Debden and Shellbrook. The Canwood Regional Park is located southeast from Canwood along Highway 55. It has 20 campsites, a nine-hole golf course, and three baseball diamonds, and is open May through September.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Canwood recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census of Population, the Village of Canwood recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. Education Canwood Community School is the only educational institution in Canwood. Part of the Saskatchewan Rivers School Division #119, it educates students from Kindergarten to Grade 12. Higher education can be pursued out of town at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology, University of Saskatchewan, or University of Regina. Urban legend An urban legend says Albert Einstein played goal for the Canwood Canucks one winter while traveling to find peace and silence for his work on the Theory of Relativity. This story has been found to be implausible by media observers; in addition to the unlikeliness of Einstein visiting the rural community of Canwood, the Canwood Canucks hockey team was formed in 1958, three years after his death.

It created a military alliance between the states, directly principally against Spain. It was signed by the Sardinian Chief Minister the Marquis D'Ormea and the Austrian envoy Count Schulenburg. Following the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession and the attack on Austria by a coalition of states including France, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony - their possessions in Italy began to look vulnerable. Spain had ambitions in the area, driven by Elisabeth Farnese who wished to secure Italian kingdoms for her sons. Austria tried to persuade Sardinia to join with them against Spain, although this was resisted by the Sardinian leadership. Sardinian attempts to remain neutral were undermined by apparent Spanish threat's to their independence. After a large Spanish force was shipped across the Mediterranean and was poised for offensive operations in Italy, Sardinia moved towards concluding agreements with both the British and Austrians. The Sardinians initially made specific territorial requests from Austria as a payment for their co-operation, but later abandoned this for vaguer promises for new territory in Lombardy. The agreement was concluded on 1 February 1742.Browning p.96-97Owen p.129 The agreement was later expanded on by the Treaty of Worms (1743). References Bibliography * Browning, Reed.

History  Ceylon incorporated as a village on September 26, 1911. Taken from Radville & Deep South StarRadville & Deep South Star Ceylon and Hardy really started when the railroad arrived. The Canadian National Railway line came through in 1910, opening for service in July, 1911. The section between Ceylon and Hardy was completed on November 21, 1911. Ceylon had actually started up in 1910 north of where the tracks were eventually laid. When the town site was surveyed in 1911, it had to be moved to the south side of the tracks. With a great effort of manpower and horsepower (of the animal variety), the fledgling town was moved to its present location. The origin of the name Ceylon is still a bit of a mystery. It was given its name by the first postmaster in the area, John Aldred, who did not want the new town to be named after him. He may have chosen the name Ceylon in recognition of a CPR station of the name in Ontario, or it may have been named for a yacht that was owned by Scottish merchant Sir Thomas Lipton (whose name still graces tea bags to this day). Hardy was named for the great 19th century English novelist and poet Thomas Hardy. Some decades were better than the others. After the first years of backbreaking work cultivating the land, the first crops were harvested and prosperity came to the region. The area suffered a setback from 1914 to 1918 when many young men left to fight in the Great War. A disproportionately high number of young men from the Ceylon area never returned home. Their names are remembered in perpetuity on the war memorial at the bottom of Main Street. The twenties were particularly prosperous, only to be followed by the Dirty Thirties and the dust, poverty and hunger that came with it. Many families left during that time, some sought work elsewhere and returned once things had improved, and others stuck it out. The 1940s were dominated by the war in Europe. Many young men left to fight overseas. When they returned, things had changed a great deal. Farm work had become mostly mechanized, rendering horses and oxen obsolete. The threshing machines and their work gangs became a memory as combines took over the harvesting. Since many trains were diverted to the war effort, civilians had to use alternative forms of transportation. They became used to travelling in their own private vehicles, and roads were eventually improved accordingly. The trains were used less and less until the Ceylon train station was torn down in 1976, and all five grain elevators are now a distant memory. The last elevator to go, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, was torn down in 2000, ending the need for rail service in Ceylon. Hardy also had a train station and elevators; it lost its train station in 1959, and the last elevator was torn down in 1989. Today, Ceylon is a peaceful village, but its history is full of exciting stories. One of the most famous is the still unsolved bank robbery of 1922. In the wee hours of September 27, 1922, the Bank of Montreal was robbed. That same night, a bank was robbed in Moosomin. The robbery attracted a great deal of attention, and was the front-page story of the Regina Leader for three days in a row. The story was even mentioned in two novels, though it was represented very inaccurately in both. A very good (and exciting) account of the bank robbery by A. O. Smith is included in Ceylon's first history book, Builders of a Great Land. During the Prohibition of the 1920s, there was also allegedly some rum running that went on in the area. A great many things have changed throughout the past century, but some things have come almost full circle. The earliest farmers in the R.M. of the Gap had to haul their grain to Weyburn. Eventually elevators were built in Ceylon and Hardy, but these did not last and now, a full century later, the closest grain gathering point is once again Weyburn. But while the earliest settlers faced a grueling two- or three-day journey with a horse-pulled wagon, farmers now haul their grain in semis. In those first few years, there were few families in the area, and farms were far away from each other. A steady stream of settlers meant that within a decade or so, there were farms everywhere, and the isolation of the earliest days ended. Over the years, as farming changed and cities became more attractive to young people, the countryside has thinned out again. Small clumps of trees, former access roads that are being reclaimed by the land, and tumbledown shacks are all that remain of these former farms and homes. Reliable roads, vehicles, telephones and the Internet mean that farm families are not exactly isolated, but they certainly have fewer neighbours than they would have in decades past. Hardy School, and the country schools of the R.M. of the Gap, were centers of social activity in the first decades of the R.M. of the Gap. Ceylon and Hardy were the centres of business in the municipality, but in the earliest decades of its history, most farm families' centre of identity would be their local school district. In the Gap, there were twenty school districts, ten of which encompassed area in other municipalities as well. These school districts were: Trail, Egypt Valley, Lyons, Gibson Creek, Buffalo Valley, East Ceylon, Troy, Lacadia, Freda, Round Up, Naomi, Green Lake, Meadow View, Carnbrogie, Big Four, Good Time, Gordon, Oakville, Hardy, and Ceylon. Schools were more than just educational institutions; they were also centres of social activity. Dances, meetings and church services were held in the local schools. It was much more convenient to travel the relatively short distance (though it was probably always several miles, uphill, in a blizzard) to the local schoolhouse rather than travel all the way to Ceylon or Hardy, especially in the winter. Most of the schools were closed down in the 1950s, and the children were bused to the nearest town. The schools may be long gone, but many farms still bear the name of these school districts. Religion was also very important to many early settlers. Before churches were built, traveling priests and ministers held services in people's homes. St. Joseph's was built between 1913 and 1917, being dedicated in that year by the Archbishop of Regina. It burned down in 1951 and a new church was built to replace it. The United Church was built in 1918. There was also a church established at the eastern edge of the Gap, called St. Collette's. A congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was established in the 1940s. There are five cemeteries located within the Gap: St. Collette (NE 12-5-19), Lacadia St. Collettee (NE 35-4-19), Trail (NW 33-6-20) and St. Paul's (NW 7-5-19), as well as Ceylon Cemetery just south of town. Water shortages were a problem early on for the village of Ceylon, and as early as 1919 plans were made to develop a dam. It was completed east of town in 1934 under supervision of the R.M. The work to build it provided employment for many men during the early years of the Depression. The dam ended up being picturesque as well as practical, and in the 1950s the Ceylon Beach was started by the Homemakers Club. In 1967, a Centennial Grant allowed the development of a regional park, complete with swimming pool, picnic area, campground, ball diamond and a small golf course. Throughout the years, there were a variety of clubs and sports teams in Ceylon. Women were very activity in the community, and they did many of their good works through organizations like the Catholic Women's League, the United Church Women, the Ceylon Ladies Aid, Easter Lily Rebekah Lodge, the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ceylon Legion Branch No. 46, and the Ceylon Women's Institute (also known as the Ceylon Homemakers), among several others. There were many clubs for men as well, including the Ceylon Lions Club, Connaught Odd Fellows Lodge, Ceylon Masonic Lodge, Royal Canadian Legion Branch No. 46 and the Knights of Columbus. The Gap Agricultural Society was very active in the earlier decades of the area, holding fairs each year. There were a variety of sports in the Ceylon area as well, including: football, baseball/softball, tennis, basketball, curling, figure skating, and of course, hockey. Hardy also had its share of community clubs and sports teams. Ceylon grew very quickly, and by 1926 had made a name for itself in southern Saskatchewan. The Regina Leader published an article on June 26, 1926, which put Ceylon \\"In the Front Rank of the 'Best' Saskatchewan Villages.\\" In the earliest decades there were many businesses, including: general stores, hardware stores, cafes, livery barns, a newspaper, several banks, blacksmiths, butchers, laundries, drug store, dress shops, boarding houses, and later, garages and implement dealers. The original hotel built in 1911 burnt down that same year, but the North West Hotel was soon erected on the same site, and it is still in use today. Today Ceylon has lost most of its business to larger centres, however, businesses like Ceylon Pulses Plus and Border Line Feeders have rejuvenated the local economy in recent years. The oil and gas industry has also had positive effects on the economy. And of course, there are still farmers and ranchers, making a living the same way the original homesteaders in this area did, albeit with much more advanced technology. Ceylon and Hardy may have shrunk to a fraction of their former populations, but many families remain. Some of them have been here for more than a century, out dating even the municipality itself. Others are newcomers. Though the population of Ceylon and Hardy is smaller than it used to be (it has grown in recent years), the fact remains that for those who do live here in the \\"Gap\\", it is unquestioningly home. More detailed history of Ceylon, Hardy and the R.M. of the Gap No. 39 can be found in the two excellent history books of the area, Builders of a Great Land and Builders of a Great Land Continues.

This is analogous to the arithmetical hierarchy which provides the classifications but for sentences of the language of arithmetic. Definitions In the language of set theory, atomic formulas are of the form x = y or x ‚àà y, standing for equality and respectively set membership predicates. The first level of the Levy hierarchy is defined as containing only formulas with no unbounded quantifiers, and is denoted by \\\\Delta _0=\\\\Sigma_0=\\\\Pi_0.Walicki, Michal (2012). Mathematical Logic, p. 225. World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. The next levels are given by finding an equivalent formula in Prenex normal form, and counting the number of changes of quantifiers: In the theory ZFC, a formula A is called: \\\\Sigma _{i+1} if A is equivalent to \\\\exists x _1 ... \\\\exists x _n B in ZFC, where B is \\\\Pi _i \\\\Pi _{i+1} if A is equivalent to \\\\forall x _1 ... \\\\forall x _n B in ZFC, where B is \\\\Sigma _i If a formula is both \\\\Sigma _i and \\\\Pi _i, it is called \\\\Delta _i. As a formula might have several different equivalent formulas in Prenex normal form, it might belong to several different levels of the hierarchy. In this case, the lowest possible level is the level of the formula. The L√©vy hierarchy is sometimes defined for other theories S. In this case \\\\Sigma _i and \\\\Pi _i by themselves refer only to formulas that start with a sequence of quantifiers with at most i‚àí1 alternations, and \\\\Sigma _i^S and \\\\Pi _i^S refer to formulas equivalent to \\\\Sigma _i and \\\\Pi _i formulas in the theory S. So strictly speaking the levels \\\\Sigma _i and \\\\Pi _i of the L√©vy hierarchy for ZFC defined above should be denoted by \\\\Sigma^{ZFC} _i and \\\\Pi^{ZFC} _i.

Owned and operated by the city's Department of Recreation and Parks, the par-71 course in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood was designed by William P. Bell & William H. Johnson in 1947. The fairways are Bermuda Grass and the greens are Bent Grass. It hosted the Los Angeles Open on the PGA Tour seventeen times, and also was the site of events on the Senior PGA Tour and LPGA Tour. History The site was originally a private club named Rancho Country Club. The club ran into some tax problems and the federal government took ownership to satisfy the tax debt and leased it back to the club. Several citizens spearheaded an effort to make the site into a city park. Their efforts were rewarded in 1945 with the creation of Cheviot Hills Park, a park that included the golf course, tennis courts, and baseball fields. Hillcrest Country Club is adjacent to the northeast, separated by Motor Avenue. The Los Angeles Open moved to Rancho Park in 1956 and stayed through 1972 (except for 1968) and hosted a final time in 1983. A bronze plaque is located on the 508-yard par-5 ninth hole (currently the 18th hole) along the course's western boundary. It commemorates an incident in the first round of the L.A. Open in 1961; reigning Masters and U.S. Open champion Arnold Palmer carded a twelve after a great tee shot was followed by four consecutive shots out of bounds. Picture of the on-site plaque and commentary confirm 2nd‚Äì5th shots were OB. Various published sources disagree on details. The hole narrows near the green, squeezing in between the driving range on the right and Patricia Avenue on the left; he hit the first two to the right, then two left. Five years later, Palmer tied the course record with 62 in the third round to take a seven-shot lead, then held on to win by a stroke, the second of his three victories here (1963, 1966, 1967). Charlie Sifford was the first African-American to earn a PGA card in 1961; he won the L.A. Open on the course in 1969 on the first playoff hole for his second tour win. It happened on January 12, during the New York Jets' historic upset win in Super Bowl III in Miami. Jack Nicklaus earned his first tour paycheck at Rancho Park as a 21-year-old rookie in early 1962; he was over twenty strokes back in the $45,000 event and earned less than thirty four dollars. He never won the L.A. Open; his best finish was a solo runner-up in 1978 at Riviera Country Club with an uncharacteristic stumble in the final holes. Also age 21, Nancy Lopez gained her second career win at Rancho Park in the Sunstar Classic, the second of nine victories for her in 1978. She successfully defended in 1979 with a birdie on the final hole to win by a stroke. The 1980 event was won by JoAnne Carner, shortened to 54 holes after the first round was cancelled by heavy rain.

NIIP developed the Irbis-E radar from the Bars radar system used on Sukoi SU-30MK aircraft. Design Irbis-E development started in 2004 and the first radar prototype entered flight tests on board an Su-30M2 aircraft acting as a test bed in early 2007. The resulting radar system provides air-to-air, air-to-sea and air-to-ground (ground mapping, Doppler beam sharpening and Synthetic Aperture Radar modes) modes with improved performance in intense clutter (radar) environments compared to its predecessor, the Bars system. In addition, Irbis has been designed to detect low and super-low observable/stealth airborne threats. This is an X band multi-role radar with a passive phased antenna array (PAA) mounted on a two-step hydraulic drive unit (in azimuth and roll). The antenna device scans by an electronically controlled beam in azimuth and angle of elevation in sectors not smaller than 60¬∞. The two-step electro-hydraulic drive unit additionally turns the antenna by mechanic means to 60¬∞ in azimuth and 120¬∞ in roll. Thus, in using the electronic control and mechanical additional turn of the antenna, the maximum deflection angle of the beam grows to 120¬∞. The Irbis-E is a direct evolution of the BARS design, but significantly more powerful. While the hybrid phased array antenna is retained, the noise figure is slightly worse at 3.5 dB, but the receiver has four rather than three discrete channels. The biggest change is in the EGSP-27 transmitter, where the single 7-kilowatt peak power rated Chelnok TWT is replaced with a pair of 10-kilowatt peak power rated Chelnok tubes, ganged to provide a total peak power rating of 20 kilowatts. The radar is cited at an average power rating of 5 kilowatts, with 2 kilowatts CW rating for illumination. NIIP claim twice the bandwidth and improved frequency agility over the BARS, and better ECCM capability. The Irbis-E has new Solo-35.01 digital signal processor hardware and Solo-35.02 data processor, but retains receiver hardware, the master oscillator and exciter of the BARS. A prototype has been in flight test since late 2005. Operational features Irbis-E can detect and track up to 30 airborne targets at one time at ranges near 350~400 kilometers, and attack up to 8. In air-to-surface mode the Irbis-E provides mapping allowing to attack four surface targets with precision-guided weapons while scanning the horizon searching for airborne threats that can be engaged using active radar homing missiles. It can detect a target with radar cross-section (RCS) 3m2 at up to 400 km, (towards each other, in an area of 100 square degrees) while a target with RCS 0.01m2 at up to 90 km.http://www.niip.ru/downloads/public_art/2006/2006_2.pdf(dead link) It is one of the most powerful PESA radar used in an operational aircraft.http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Flanker-Radars.html References Aircraft radars Russian and Soviet military radars Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design products ","title":"Irbis-E"},{"id":"25129797","text":"Navia duidae is a plant species in the genus Navia.

The band was based in Cleveland, Ohio and Portland, Oregon, United States. History Emeralds was noted for drawing from both ambient music and Kosmische, and minimal music. John Elliott, Steve Hauschildt and Mark McGuire began playing music together under the name Fancelions in 2005 in Cleveland's western suburbs of Bay Village and Westlake. Shortly thereafter, they re-formed as Emeralds, playing their first show under that name in June 2006. Since then the group has released over forty recordings on various independent labels. The album Does It Look Like I'm Here?, released on Editions Mego in 2010, is their most widely known release to date. It received the Best New Album designation from Pitchfork Media, the Album of the Year award from Drowned in Sound, and accolades from many other publications. Mark McGuire and Steve Hauschildt also perform and record under their own names, while John Elliott does so under a number of monikers including Outer Space and Imaginary Softwoods. The band also maintains multiple labels including McGuire & Elliott's Wagon, Hauschildt's Gneiss Things and Elliott's curated imprint Spectrum Spools. Emeralds were invited by Godspeed You! Black Emperor to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in December 2010 and again in 2012 by The Afghan Whigs. From 19 September through 31 October 2010, the band opened for Caribou on a North American tour. In April 2009, the band opened for Throbbing Gristle in Chicago and New York. In January 2013, Emeralds announced that Mark McGuire had left the band.

Baculoviruses are insect cell viruses that can be modified to express proteins in mammalian cells. The unmodified baculovirus is able to enter mammalian cells, however its genes are not expressed unless a mammalian recognizable promoter is incorporated upstream of a gene of interest. Both unmodified baculovirus and baculovirus modified with a mammalian promoter (BacMam) are unable to replicate in humans and are thus non infectious. Invented by Dr. Frederick M. Boyce,US patent #5,871,986 BacMam is a baculovirus-mediated gene transfer technique that has gained widespread use because of advantages when compared to other transfection methods, (for reviews see, Kost, T.A. et al,). In addition, BacMam has been found to have inherent flexibility over stable cell lines, which has contributed to its adoption as a standard gene transfer technique. General Properties The BacMam gene delivery technology is a transient expression system, which facilitates expression of toxic gene products. It has a broad range of transduction including many primary cell types and stem cells. The baculoviral genome has a large capacity for foreign gene insert with up to 38 kb have been tried successfully. Simultaneous delivery of multiple genes to the same cell is feasible. There is little to no microscopically observable cytopathic effects of BacMam particles on mammalian cells. The level of gene expression can be adjusted by viral dose or chemical additions using histone deacetylase inhibitors. Transduction of cells is performed by liquid only addition and therefore BacMam is amenable to automated methods. Finally viruses are stable when stored at 4 ¬∞C in the dark for long periods of time. Biosafety ConsiderationsKost, T. A., and Condreay, J. P. 2002a. Applied Biosafety 7:167‚Äì169.Kost, T. A., Condreay, J. P., and Mickelson, C. A. 2000. Bisafety and viral gene transfer vectors. In Biological safety, principles and practices, 3rd ed. D. O. Fleming and D. L. Hunt (eds.), American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D.C., pp. 579‚Äì597. Baculoviruses are Risk Group 1 agents that have been widely used for over 25 years for insect cell protein production applications. Baculoviruses are produced in insect cells and incapable of replicating in mammalian cells and are not known to cause disease in healthy human adults. Furthermore, BacMam viruses are inactivated by human complement, which reduces risk to researchers. Lastly, viruses used in the laboratory cannot replicate in insects so there is no environmental threat from these particles accidentally being released into the environment. Viral Entry Studies on baculovirus entry into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells suggest that BacMam enters mammalian cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and possibly via macropinocytosis. Further studies have suggested that caveolae are somehow involved in baculovirus entry in mammalian cells. Host Cell Response To be effective, a gene delivery technology must not interfere with normal cellular function. Cytotoxicity assays and transcriptome analyses on a human HEK cell line (HEK293) have revealed that baculovirus transduction is not cytotoxic and does not induce differential transcriptional responses. Similarly, infected Schwann cells retain their characteristic morphological and molecular phenotype and are capable of differentiating in vitro and express the P0 myelination marker. Using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray technology to examine in vitro and in vivo global cellular gene expression profiles in the rat brain, cultured human astrocytes and human neuronal cells after viral transduction, host antiviral responses were observed. The related genes were mainly those associated with innate immunity, including several of the genes involved in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. * Bioproduction : BacMam has been used to produce proteins in large quantities using HEK293 cells in a hollow fiber bioreactor system * High Throughput Screening : Pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptor is enabled with the use of BacMam technology in drug discovery applications * Fluorescence Microscopy : Organelle labeling reagents are commercially available BacMam particles for labeling organelles and other subcellular structures : Single mitochondrion labeled with a mitochondrial targeted green fluorescent protein * Receptor Activation/Pathway Analysis : Characterization of serotonin receptor activation via a BacMam delivered GFP fusion to a kinase substrate * Structural Biology : BacMam system has been used to produce soluble and membrane glycoproteins for structural studies See also * Baculovirus  References  External links * The BacMam System Applied genetics ","title":"BacMam"},{"id":"25129893","text":"Events from the year 1945 in Denmark.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 13, 2009\\\\. The episode centers on Peter as he assumes temporary control of his father-in-law Carter Pewterschmidt's billion- dollar empire after he suffers a heart attack and is incapacitated in a coma. Peter immediately becomes power hungry, however, and develops several ridiculous items, prompting Lois and Carter, after he recovers from his coma, to try to trick him into relinquishing control of the company. The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and Alex Carter, and directed by Pete Michels. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving criticism from and being reported to the FCC by the Parents Television Council. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.67 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Hugh Laurie, Bobby Lee, Nana Visitor, Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Business Guy\\" was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011. Plot The Griffins are invited onto the Pewterschmidts' yacht, where Lois becomes seasick and vomits. Peter is reminded of his bachelor party when this happens, and is shocked to find out that Carter has never had one and does not know what it is. Upon returning to Quahog, Peter takes him to a strip club to simulate a bachelor party. In his excitement, Carter has a heart attack and falls into a coma. Dr. House is hired to treat him, but he throws his rule book out the window and punches Carter in the face to ensure that he is comatose. Carter's video will is discovered, in which he gives Lois control of his billion-dollar manufacturing company, Pewterschmidt Industries, even though she does not know how to run a corporation. Peter, however, is inspired by House's \\"live-without-rules\\" regime and decides to control the company himself. On his first day on the job, Peter dismisses the entire board of directors for being unable to keep up with his ideas and hires his friends to manufacture ridiculous items. Soon after, Carter reawakens from his coma and finds what Peter has done with his company. Carter confronts Peter in his former office and demands for him to relinquish control of the company, but he refuses; he instead forces him to work as a janitor, have and invite people to his mansion for a Big Bang Theory viewing party, pay a compliment to a sharply-dressed Asian man, and clean out the fridge in the employee lounge. Carter is embarrassed, so he and Lois trick Peter into surrendering the company by scaring him into believing a swamp monster will eat him if he does not. A seemingly real swamp monster scares Peter out of the office, chases Lois and a disguised Carter, before being found out as House. In the end, Lois cheers Peter up by revealing that the contract he signed allows him to keep the corporate plane. Peter is delighted and jumps in a freeze frame shot, but he and his family grow alarmed when he actually remains in midair. Production and development Hugh Laurie parodied his character Gregory House. The episode was co-written by Andrew Goldberg and Alex Carter, both having written episodes for the show previously. The episode was directed by series regular Pete Michels, before the conclusion of the eighth production season, in his second episode of the season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Andrew Goldberg and Alex Carter working as staff writers for the episode. Karin Perrotta was the associate producer of this episode, in her ninth episode of the season. \\"Business Guy\\", along with the eleven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", a mini- feature entitled \\"The Comical Adventures of Family Guy ‚Äì Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call\\", and footage of the Family Guy panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. In addition to the regular cast, actor Hugh Laurie made his second appearance in the series, the first being \\"One If by Clam, Two If by Sea\\"; Laurie lampooned his role as House protagonist Gregory House. Actors Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Bobby Lee of MADtv and Nana Visitor also guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener also made minor appearances. Actor Patrick Warburton appears in the episode as well. Cultural references In the opening scene, Carter reveals that he has never had a bachelor party, leading Peter to profess that he will help solve Carter's dilemma, just as Hamburger Helper helped him. Peter is then introduced to the Hamburger Helper mascot Helping Hand, as well as his mentally challenged brother ‚Äî Cheeseburger Helper ‚Äî who insists on adding cheese to the meal. After taking Carter to the Quahog strip club, Peter decides to pay a mistress to give him a lapdance, causing Carter to suffer a heart attack from sexual arousal. This then prompts Quagmire to ask what is wrong with him, to which Carter replies that he is having \\"a heart attack-ack- ack-ack-ack-ack! You oughta know by now!,\\" which is taken from a line in the Billy Joel song \\"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\\". The bedtime story that Peter refers to when talking to Lois about how she makes him sad is the \\"Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb\\" from the German children's book Struwwelpeter. Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons guest starred. Returning home from firing the board of directors, Peter calls attention to Lacey Chabert, formerly the voice of Meg Griffin before being replaced by Mila Kunis, when he notes that he can also fire Lois for \\"misbehaving.\\" In introducing new products for Pewterschmidt Industries, Peter decides to create several unorthodox items, which include a cereal line for Jeremy Irons entitled \\"Jeremy Irons Cereal,\\" a \\"Scream in a Box,\\" as well as an African American heart rate monitor, which Carter later uses at the hospital, with the system's two settings, Barry White, and Bill Cosby's impersonated voices. Once Carter Pewterschmidt wakes up from his coma, Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons appear as Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper in the episode when Carter is forced by Peter to hold a viewing party for the CBS comedy sitcom The Big Bang Theory, which Carter is reluctant to do at first, but soon begins to enjoy the show. In an attempt to get the company back from Peter, Carter and Lois trick him into thinking a swamp monster is out to get important businessmen, and if he does not sign the company back over to Mr. Pewterschmidt, he will be eaten. Gregory House also dresses as a swamp monster, however, and causes Lois to become confused, until she unmasks the monster in the style of Scooby-Doo. House then interjects by speaking in Hugh Laurie's original English accent, as opposed to the American accent used on the television show in which he stars. Reception In a slight drop from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 7.67 million homes, in its original airing in the United States. The episode also received a 3.8 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, edging out The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show, and American Dad!. Receiving mixed reviews from critics, the episode was deemed \\"a throwback to the earlier more successful seasons.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the storyline as consistent \\"from start to finish.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the \\"inside jokes\\" in the episode, as well as the Scooby-Doo sequence as \\"a flash of satiric brilliance.\\" In contrast, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the storyline \\"an excuse jokes,\\" giving the episode a B- rating. Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV praised Laurie's performance in the episode, stating that \\"his scenes were among the funniest on the episode.\\" The TV Critic's Robin Pierson rated the episode 55, praising the storyline and Laurie's cameo while criticizing a non sequitur parody of Scooby-Doo. Controversy Although it did not name this episode its \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\", the Parents Television Council filed an indecency complaint about \\"Business Guy\\" two days after its airdate, citing the lapdance sequence as a possible violation of federal law regarding broadcast decency.

Center Central Site Services (ACCESS) Main campus is located in EJC Montilla, Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat, Philippines. Formerly called Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic State College, it was elevated to University status in 2010. There are eight campuses within the province of Sultan Kudarat and one in Glan, Sarangani The Sultan Kudarat State University (SKSU) provides instruction in science and technology, agriculture, fisheries, and education. It also undertakes research and extension services.Philippine Republic Act No. 6973 Section 3 History Sultan Kudarat State University was formerly known as Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic State College (SKPSC). It was established in 1990, by virtue of RA 6973, otherwise known as the SKPSC Charter. Unlike other state colleges, SKPSC was established out of five previously Department of Education Culture and Sport (DECS) ‚Äì supervised high schools in five municipalities of the province. The five high schools in Isulan, Kalamansig, Palimbang, Tacurong and Lutayan became the core for the creation of Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic College. As the only state college in the province, resolutions were made by the local government units. Expanding its campus throughout of Sen. Ninoy Aquino, Bagumbayan and even Glan, Sarangani. For the last three years during the term of the then President, Nelson T. Binag, preparations were made for the conversion of the state college to university but the bill was archived. With the installation of the new president, Dr. Teresita Llorente, on January 18, 2010, by virtue of republic Act No. 9966, SKPSC was converted into Sultan Kudarat State University. The history of SKPSC Isulan dates back to 1968 when an elementary school was established in Isulan. Considering that there was no public high school to accommodate the public elementary graduates, the school and barrio authorities planned to open a barrio high school patterned after the brainchild of Dr. Pedro Orata of Urdanate, Pangasinan who is better known as the Father of Barrio High School. 1968 was a landmark in the history of Isulan Barrio High School. Through the efforts of the Barrio officials, the school authorities and the populace, the establishment and opening of a barrio high school was made possible. In the same year, the high school was opened and operated at the same school site, and shared facilities with the Isulan Elementary School. Dr. Veronica Pastor then acted as principal of both the Isulan Elementary School and Isulan Barrio High School with Salvacion Sotelo as her assistant. Everything went smoothly through the encouragement of Lorenzo Labrador, the District Supervision of Isulan. In 1969, Dr. Pastor was promoted and at that time Bienvenida S. Terania who also has had a training and experience in the establishment and operation of a barrio high school took over the reins as principal, having been previously designated as Guidance Coordinator. This previous designation of hers served as her stepping stone to principalship. In 1974, Isulan Barrio High School was elevated to the status of a provincial high school but still sharing the same school site, school buildings and school facilities with the Isulan Elementary School. In 1975, Terani as application for study leave was approved and granted and so Donatila C. Romano was designated as officer on length of experience and capabilities. Isulan Provincial high School was elevated to the status of a national high school, thus, becoming Sultan Kudarat National High School. The school was given a permanent school site at the capital complex. R. A. 6973 took effect which was an act establishing the Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic State College. Hence, on Dec. 6, 1990 Polytechnic State College, merging itself with the other public high schools in the province namely: Tacurong Municipal High School, Kalamansig High School, Lutayan National Agricultural School, and Palimbang High School Normal. The high school curriculum in SKPSC Isulan is being phased out in conformity to the provisions of R. A. 6973 or the SKPSC Charter.

Tomas External Studies Program Center in Sto. Tomas, Davao del Norte. History December 15, 1978 marked the birth of the first ever state university in Region XI. On this date, Batas Pambansa Blg. 12 was passed, thereby creating the University of Southern Philippines, the givers of the university's initial name not knowing that there was already a university of the same name, the University of Southern Philippines in Cebu, to be later renamed as the University of Southeastern Philippines. The integration of the School of Arts and Trades (DSAT) and the Davao National Regional Agricultural School (DNRAS) paved the way for the birth of the five USeP campuses: the Davao City main campus in Obrero with an area of 6.5 hectares; the Mintal campus, Davao City that has an area of 2.8 hectares; the Tagum campus, Tagum City with a 77-hectare land area; the Mabini campus which lies in a 109-hectare land area in Mampising, Mabini, Compostela Valley Province; and the latest addition, Bislig campus in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur with an area of 9.7 hectares. The early years saw birth of the College of Engineering and Technology in Obrero campus, the College of Forestry and Agriculture at Tagum and Mabini campuses and College of Arts and Sciences in Mintal campus. The succeeding years witnessed developments in the academic and administrative realms of USeP. In 1993, through a Board of Regents (BOR) resolution, External Studies Programs were established. These were USeP-Hinatuan Ext.

Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990) is an appeal filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Initially, Lasercomb filed an action against Holiday Steel for breach of contract, copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud, unfair competition, and false designation of origin. The United States District Court ruled in favor of Lasercomb, awarding them punitive damages and actual damages for fraud, rejecting the defense of copyright misuse. On appeal, based on a recognition of the similarity to patent misuse, the holding was reversed, deeming the language contained in the license agreement unreasonable.Lasercomb Am., Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990).  Background Information  Larry Holliday and Job Reynolds worked together at Holiday Steel Rule Die Corporation. Larry Holliday was the sole shareholder and president of Holiday Steel and Job Reynolds was a computer programmer for that company. Steel rule die is used in a number of applications including the creation of creases, perforations, slits, and to cut and score paper and cardboard to be folded into cartons or boxes. Lasercomb America, Inc. was a competitor of Holiday Steel Rule Die Corporation and manufactured steel rule die for similar applications. The object of dispute was a software program developed solely by Lasercomb that eased the production of steel rule die. Lasercomb developed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software known as Interact. The software allowed the user to design a template of a cardboard cutout for visualization on a computer screen. Interact effectively allowed a designer to create and coordinate the production of steel rule die. Prior to the general release of Lasercomb's Interact program, Lasercomb licensed four pre-release copies to Holiday Steel. The contract stipulated the first licensed copy of Interact would cost $35,000, the second and third $17,500, and the fourth plus any subsequent copies $2,000. In addition, the terms of the license specified that for the ninety-nine year term of the agreement, and for one year thereafter, Holiday Steel \\"will not write, develop, produce or sell computer assisted die making software, directly or indirectly without Lasercomb's prior written consent.\\"Lemley, Menell, Merges and Samuelson, Software and Internet Law 3d ed. Aspen (2006). Holiday Steel, after receiving the pre-release copies, circumvented the protective measures implemented by Lasercomb and made three unauthorized copies of the Interact software. Holiday Steel then proceeded to develop their own software called \\"PDS-1000,\\" which was \\"almost entirely a direct copy of Interact, and marketed it as its own CAD/CAM die-making software.\\" With the direction of Holliday, the infringing activities were accomplished by Reynolds. Lasercomb, after consulting Holiday Steel, implemented \\"chronoguard\\" devices that prevented unauthorized access to Interact. Through manipulation and circumvention, Holiday Steel removed the chronoguards without authorization. In doing so, Holiday Steel misrepresented that the chronoguards were in use, even after removal. Once these actions were discovered by Lasercomb, it hastily copyrighted Interact and filed suit against Holiday Steel, Holliday, and Reynolds on March 7, 1986.  Opinion of the Court  While there was no contention that Holliday and Reynolds copied Interact, they claimed that Lasercomb misused its copyright. Holliday and Reynolds asserted that the language in Lasercomb's standard license agreement \\"restricts licensees from creating any of their own CAD/CAM die-making software‚Ä¶.\\" Specifically, section D of the license states \\"Licensee agrees during the term of this agreement that it will not permit or suffer its directors, officers and employees, directly or indirectly, to write, develop, produce or sell computer assisted die making software.\\" The \\"term of this Agreement,\\" as specified by Lasercomb in the clauses of its license agreement, was ninety-nine years. Holliday and Reynolds could only be bound by the terms of Lasercomb's license agreement if they had assented to it. Lasercomb sent the applicable agreement to Holiday Steel to be signed and returned; however, Larry Holliday did not sign the license agreement. Lasercomb overlooked this fact and still issued the prereleased software to Holiday Steel. The District Court rejected the claim of copyright misuse because the contract clauses had not been explicitly agreed to, \\"such a clause is reasonable in light of the delicate and sensitive area of computer software,\\" and questioned the existence of such a defense. The District Court granted a permanent injunction against Holiday and awarded collective damages of $120,000 for actual and punitive damages. The foundational patent misuse case Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppinger, 314 U.S. 488 (1942),Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488 (1942). involved an analogous situation involving the use of a patent in a manner that contradicted public policy. Such an exercise of contract constituted a misuse of one's patent by restraining an individual's constitutional privileges. At the time, the patent misuse analogy was not established and such a defense was limited to a single case; M. Witmark & Sons v. Jensen, 80 F. Supp. 843 (D.Minn. 1948). It was determined that \\"since copyright and patent law serve parallel public interests, a ‚Äòmisuse' defense should apply to infringement actions brought to vindicate either right.\\" The granted monopoly power of both patent and copyright law does not extend to umbrella property not included in a patent or copyright.Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1880). On appeal, the court found that Lasercomb's anticompetitive clauses within its license agreement were a misuse of copyright. Based on the patent misuse analogy, the copyright misuse defense was available to the appellants despite the fact that they had not agreed to the standard license agreement. Therefore, it was determined that Lasercomb should have been restricted from suing for copyright infringement by copyright misuse. The clauses contained in Lasercomb's standard license agreement were a misuse of copyright when suing for infringement of copyright of the Interact program. For these reasons, the appellate court reversed the injunction and reversed the award of copyright infringement damages.  Case significance  The Appellate Court found that the District Court had incorrectly inferred that a copyright misuse may not be a violation of antitrust law. Of more importance, the public policy of copyright laws were being violated by the exercise of Lasercomb's standard license agreement. This Appellate Court's reversal of this case recognizes copyright misuse as an equitable defense to an infringement claim. In doing so, the patent misuse defense in Morton Salt v. G.S. Suppiger was recognized as a legitimate analogy to a misuse of copyright.  References   Scholarship  Jason Mazzone, Copyfraud, Social Science Research Network (Jun. 29, 2006).

It is mandated to provide undergraduate and graduate courses in technology education, agriculture, fisheries, engineering, arts and sciences, forestry, business, health, computer, criminology, nautical and short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses. It is also mandated to promote research, advanced studies, extension work and progressive leadership in each area of specialization.Philippine Republic Act No. 11335 Its main campus is located in Buenavista, Guimaras.Philippine Republic Act No. 11335 Section 1 History The Buenavista Vocational School, around which the Guimaras State University eventually grew, was founded under the provision of Republic Act 3933 in 1964 with Representative Rodolfo Tiamson Ganzon of the Second District of Iloilo as the leading sponsor of the bill. The hard work of many local officials starting with Hon. Tomas Jonco, who backed a resolution to persuade the legislature to establish a vocational school in Buenavista, led up to the creation of BVS when RA 3933 was passed on June 18, 1964. Representative Fermin ‚ÄúNene‚Äù Zarandin Caram of the Lone District of Iloilo City made an effort for the implementation of the law. Four years later, through the efforts of lawyer Ernesto G. Gaduyon and Iloilo Governor Abelardo D. Javellana, the philanthropist-lawyer Juan Z. Salvador, Jr. bestowed a 12.36-acre lot taken away from his lands in Barangay McLain, Buenavista, Guimaras, to be the school site. This significant bequest led the school to honor him by taking his name to refer to the main University grounds. In 1980, the school was approved of offering post-secondary courses. The two-year trade technical and technology courses opened the door to the offering of higher education courses, which are either terminal or ladderized (a new system of education in the Philippines that allows learners to progress between Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and college, and vice versa). In 1992, the year Guimaras was proclaimed as a regular and full- fledged province, the Sangguniang Bayan (municipal council) of Buenavista passed a resolution requesting Representative Alberto ‚ÄúAlbertito‚Äù Javellana Lopez of the Second District of Iloilo to put his back for the conversion of BVS to Guimaras Polytechnic College. In July 1994, Representative Lopez filed House Bill 6252, in Congress, seeking the conversion of the BVS into a polytechnic college. On March 3, 1995, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act 7944 into law, showing out the conversion of Buenavista Vocational School into Guimaras Polytechnic College, which would offer general secondary curriculum, professional, technological courses. In June 2000, a consultation and public hearing on House Bills 7382 and 5807 sponsored by Representative Emily Relucio-Lopez of the Lone District of Guimaras was organized at the GPC Function Room. With 179 listed participants from public and private sectors in attendance, all sectoral representatives expressed full support for the conversion of GPC, Buenavista and Western Visayas College of Science and Technology (WVCST)‚ÄìGuimaras Extension in the Municipality of Jordan, into a state college. Then, in the first regular session of the Eleventh Congress, Representative Dante Ventura Liban and Representative Emily Relucio-Lopez filed House Bill 12358 (in substitution for House Bills 5807 & 7382). On June 8, 2001, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act 9138 into law. The law established the Guimaras State College, merging the Guimaras Polytechnic College in the Municipality of Buenavista and the Western Visayas College of Science and Technology‚ÄìGuimaras Extension in the Municipality of Jordan. The GSC in Buenavista was the main college grounds of the College and referred to as GSC Salvador while the one in Jordan was referred to as GSC Mosqueda Annex; [and the one in San Lorenzo was referred to as GSC Baterna Annex‚Äîan expansion during Dr. Rogelio T. Artajo's presidency]. GSU has had a mandate, from its very inception, to offer undergraduate and graduate courses in technology education, agriculture, fisheries, engineering, arts and sciences, forestry, business, health, computer, criminology, nautical and short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses that may be found to be needed and relevant. It has promoted research, advanced studies, extension work and progressive leadership in each area of specialization ever since its beginning. Too, it has provided primary consideration through the integration of research/studies for the development of the Province of Guimaras. For the next five decades, a principal, five administrators, an acting administrator, and an SUC president would take the helm and lead the school to its current level of excellence: Jose E. Esquera, Florencio D. Doromal, Cerilo P. Tamayo, Arthur Clemente, Mercedes R. Regalado, Teodoro B. Alenton, Hector G. Zamora, and Dr. Sofronio D. Dignomo. Over 50 years later after its founding, the Philippine Congress approved GSC's transition to University status by way of RA 11335, and President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed it into law on April 26, 2019. Today, having been the first state college in the whole Philippines to be Institutionally Accredited (IA) by Accrediting Agency for Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines, the Guimaras State University awards 58 bachelor's, 8 master's, and 4 doctorate degrees‚Äîand it is going on with more degree offerings. With promising future, having been the first state college in the whole Philippines to be included in the group of 11 state universities and college by Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) for its Internationalization Network Program, the University is positioned to become the most student-centered university in research, teaching, and public engagement on the island, in the West Visayas, and beyond. Annexes The Guimaras State University has two annexes: Mosqueda Annex (in Alaguisoc, Jordan, Guimaras; Jordan is the primary gateway of logistics, investments promotion and global transshipment center of the province) and the Baterna Annex (in Constancia, San Lorenzo, Guimaras; San Lorenzo is the renewable energy, agri-fishery processing and support services center of the province). Mosqueda Annex. By virtue of Republic Act 9138, the Western Visayas College of Science and Technology* (WVCST)-Guimaras Extension Campus in Alaguisoc, Jordan was officially turned over to the Guimaras State College during the celebration of the annual Manggahan Festival in May 2002. The University Mosqueda Annex has an enrollment of about 864 students. It offers Master of Public Administration and Master of Education, Bachelor of Industrial Technology, Bachelor of Elementary and Secondary Education, Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Bachelor of Science in Criminology, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor in Industrial Technology. Baterna Annex. The University Baterna Annex in Constancia, San Lorenzo is now the host of the College of Agriculture and Fisheries, pursuant to its mandate as provided in RA 9138. Location The Guimaras State University is based in Buenavista, a town in Guimaras whose functional role is as center for higher education and agropolitan development. It lies about 4 miles (about 16 km) north-east of Jordan, the provincial capital of Guimaras. Most of the University's teaching activities take place at the Salvador Campus, which occupy a 5-hectare site with billowing trees in a sprawling park-like setting. A number of jeepneys and tricycles provide a public transport link between the University's central area throughout the year, both during and outside term times. The province of Guimaras has a total land area of 60,457 hectares. The Province's specialization is on services sector (59%) particularly on other services which are both highest among the provinces in the region. Agriculture, fishery, and forestry sector ranks only second (8.76%). The industries that have the best potentials for contributing to the Province's economic growth are tourism, mango and cashew production, and food processing. Fishery including seaweed farming is considered as constrained performer which can best perform if supported. The province's annual per capita poverty threshold is pegged at Php 23,436 in 2017. There are 128 indigenous people's households, with a total population of 633 staying in the four identified areas in the four municipalities (excluding San Lorenzo), namely: Kati-Kati in San Miguel, Jordan; Serum in San Nicolas, Buenavista; Ubog in Lanipe Nueva Valencia; and Sitio Lininguan in Maabay, Sibunag. All the five municipalities and most barangays within the province are accessible by land transport. Nevertheless, three island barangays can only be reached by pump boats. The various modes of transportation available within the province are jeepneys, tricycles, vans, and single motorcycles. Motorboats and sailboats are the means of transport to the island barangays. Communication technology is never a problem in the province. Electricity in the province is almost everywhere with 99.0% of the province's barangays benefiting from rural electrification. It is provided by electric cooperatives and private electric company which is in each of the five municipalities. The province's peace and order is managed by 39 policemen with a police to population ratio of one policeman for every 944 persons. Crime rate in October 2019 is at 3.59%. The Province listed 571,699 tourist arrival in 2017. Logo The University's logo is an important part of the graphic identity of the Guimaras State University. It is reserved for uses which promote the heritage and history of the University, such as degree certificates, invitations to formal University events, and sports team apparel and merchandise. Inside the maroon gear is the name ‚ÄòGuimaras State University‚Äôin Akzidenz-Grotesk font in white text color; ‚ÄòBuenavista, Guimaras‚Äô states its main campus's address‚Äîand the tower in tan- brown and the computer symbolize technology. The fire-red atom stands for science, which is one of the main thrusts of the University.

The kite is flown out over the surface of a body of water, and the bait floats near the waterline until taken by a fish. The kite then drops immediately, signaling to the fisherman that the bait has been taken, and the fish is then hauled in. Kites can provide boatless fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only to boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate - such as shallows or coral reefs, where fish may be plentiful. Suitable kites can be simple to construct. Those of Tobi Island consist of a large leaf stiffened by the ribs of the fronds of the coconut palm. The fishing line can be made from coconut fibre and the lure from spider webs.bbc videoKiteLines Fall 1977 (Vol. 1 No. 3) Articles on Kite Fishing . Modern kite-fishing is popular in New Zealand, where large delta kites of synthetic materials are used to fish from beaches,Big Dropper Rigs taking a line and hooks far out past the breakers. Kite fishing is also emerging in Melbourne where sled kites are becoming popular, both off beaches and off boats and in freshwater areas. The disabled community increasingly use kites for fishing as they allow mobility-impaired people to cast the bait further than they could do otherwise. Kite fishing has become popular in South Florida for the recreational fishing of many pelagic species such as sailfish, wahoo, kingfish and tuna. This fishing technique allows anglers to create a very natural bait presentation, while simultaneously covering a large span of ocean which would otherwise be inaccessible using conventional fishing techniques. Kite fishing also affords fisherman the opportunity to fish with more than one line. Offshore kite fishing Offshore kite fishing is a sport fishing technique used to keep live bait on the surface of the water to attract and catch surface feeding predators. It is used in Florida along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean for sailfish. It is also used for blackfin and yellowfin tuna, dolphin or mahi-mahi, wahoo, black grouper, and yellowtail snapper. Kites  Most boats fly two kites at once: one off of each side of the boat. Which kite to use is up to the wind speed out on the water so many captains bring a wide variety of kites. The reason these captains carry a variety of different kites is because you can not use the same kite for a high wind speed that is made for a slow wind speed. Also, captains will fly different color kites so that they can tell their crew exactly which rod is going off without leaving the steering wheel. Kites will fall into the water and have to be retrieved, rinsed with freshwater, and dried before being sent back out. When a kite falls into the water they do sink and retrieving a kite that is 10 feet under water is much harder than retrieving one that is on the surface so a lot of captains will attach a helium balloon so they will not sink and help keep it in the air. To regulate the height of the kite weights will be attached to the line or line will be taken in or let out.  Launch  The hardest part of kite fishing is the launch of the kite. On large boats where almost all of the fishing is done in the stern of the boat it is hard to launch a kite because the cabin of the boat blocks the wind from helping the kite up into the air. This is because the down draft over the cabin and tuna towers pushes on the top of the kite and forces it towards the water. On boats like these the captain will turn the boat sideways so that the wind is coming across the back of the boat for an easier launch.http://www.floridasportsman.com  Rods, reels and bait  The kites are launched and retrieved on reels, occasionally electric. The rods that the kites are mounted on are super short rods with only one or two line guides on it. Line clips are then attached to the kite line and assigned a rod and reel. An experienced crew can get up to three lines on one kite. To the end of each leader is attached a neon Styrofoam marker to know which line is hooked up. These leaders are normally anywhere from 50 to 80 pound test and are about 15 feet long. Occasionally you may have to throw on a wire leader if the Wahoo or King Fish are biting. The reels used for the tackle are usually high-capacity, open-face bait casting reels. When kite fishing you want your bait still alive so it can move along the surface and make splashes. As bait, many kite fishermen use a fish called a goggle-eye as live bait. The problem with these fish is that they are nocturnal and are caught off of the reef at night so they are hard to catch yourself but can be bought. More commonly used are Spanish Sardines, Cigar Minnows, Pilchards, and Blue Runners. Circle hooks are becoming very popular because they do very little damage to large fish. To live bait a fish you must run a wire with a hook on one end and a loop on the other and run it up the bait's back until it sticks out right before the dorsal fin. Then take the leader with a hook attached to that and put it through the loop on the wire and attach it and hook it through the fishes nose. This way the fish can still swim freely. With four to six bait fish skimming along the surface your boat is almost guaranteed to get a hook up. When the fish does finally bite the hook and run with it the line it comes out of the clip on the main kite line and is only on the tackle rod. Once you have landed the fish you have shown that the kite fishing technique is one that works, and works well.

Commencing his service in the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a mechanic during World War I, he rose to become the RAAF's chief logistics officer for more than twenty years. Mackinolty was born in Victoria and joined the AFC in 1914. He first saw active duty the following year in the Middle East with No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (formerly the Mesopotamian Half Flight). In 1916 he was mentioned in despatches and posted to No. 2 Squadron AFC. By the end of the war he had been commissioned a second lieutenant. Joining the newly formed RAAF in August 1921, Mackinolty established himself as the service's senior logistician between the wars, first as Director of Transport and Equipment from 1929 to 1935, and thereafter as Director of Equipment. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. Soon after the outbreak of World War II, he became Director of Supply and was promoted to group captain. In June 1942 he was raised to acting air commodore and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE). Promoted to air vice marshal in 1948, Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until his sudden death from cancer in February 1951, aged fifty-five. Early life and World War I Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha, Victoria, Mackinolty was the son of labourer James Mickleburg Mackinolty and his wife Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne. Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17 August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War I.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 104‚Äì107 His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. xvi He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's woodworking team.

He departed Melbourne nine days later aboard RMS Persia, and arrived at Basra on 1 September.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, p. 25 Mackinolty's team immediately joined No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (originally the Mesopotamian Half Flight AFC), which moved into the city of Kut after its capture by British Empire troops in the Battle of Es Sinn. The unit took part in the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, and organised supply drops to the British and Indian garrison in Kut during the siege that lasted from December 1915 until the following April.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 6‚Äì8Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, pp. 6‚Äì9 Mackinolty was promoted in the field to flight sergeant in June 1916, and mentioned in despatches on 19 October. When the Australian members of No. 30 Squadron were dispersed, he was posted to Kantara, Egypt, where he joined the newly established No. 2 Squadron AFC (also numbered No. 68 Squadron RFC by the British). Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, the unit relocated to England in January 1917.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 6‚Äì8,16‚Äì17 Following his service with No. 2 Squadron, Mackinolty was assigned to No. 5 (Training) Squadron AFC, which formed at Shawbury, Shropshire, in June 1917. Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities, he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918, with the rank of second lieutenant. The following month he was given command of an aircraft repair unit in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, home of two squadrons of the AFC's 1st Training Wing.Sutherland, Command and Leadership in War and Peace, pp. 36‚Äì41 Between the wars Mackinolty remained in England following the end of hostilities, serving as \\"officer in charge of Australian packing\\" at RAF Hendon, near London, from December 1919 to September 1920. In this role he was responsible for crating and shipping to Point Cook the 128 aircraft and associated spares, weaponry, vehicles, hangars and other equipment that made up Britain's post-war Imperial Gift of Royal Air Force surplus to Australia, which eventually filled 19,000 cases.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 31 Mackinolty also completed formal training in aeronautical engineering before returning to Melbourne in October 1920. Discharged from the AIF in January 1921, he worked in the automotive industry and took a correspondence course on internal combustion engines. alt=Side view of single-engined biplane surrounded by five men On 8 August 1921, Mackinolty was commissioned as a flying officer in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A member of the Stores and Accounting Branch, he commenced service with No. 1 Aircraft Depot at Point Cook in December.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 42 He was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in 1924. On 20 November that year, he married Eileen Moore at Christ Church, South Yarra; the couple had a son and a daughter. In 1925, Mackinolty was posted as Equipment Officer to No. 3 Squadron at the recently established RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 21 Promoted flight lieutenant, he was appointed Director of Transport and Equipment at RAAF Headquarters in 1929, effectively making him the Air Force's senior supply officer, a role he would occupy for the next twenty-two years. His continuous tenure in essentially the one post was comparable to the RAAF's other chief logistician, Squadron Leader (later Air Vice Marshal) Ellis Wackett, who served as its senior engineer for twenty-four years, from 1935 to 1959.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 97‚Äì99 Mackinolty's position was redesignated Director of Equipment in April 1935.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 296 At around this time, he collaborated with Squadron Leader George Jones, then Director of Training, on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan. Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel, Wing Commander Bill Anderson, it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 445 Raised to squadron leader, Mackinolty was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honours on 11 May 1937, in recognition of his achievements in stores and accounting. In February the following year he was promoted to wing commander. The punctilious Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, sometimes complained that Mackinolty did not pay enough attention to his personal appearance, but never failed to acknowledge his \\"professional excellence\\".Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 179‚Äì180 World War II and after In April 1940 Mackinolty became Director of Supply, reporting to the Director-General of Supply and Production on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body. Responsible for all stores and equipment, Mackinolty also represented his service at the Federal Contract Board, Department of Supply, and Oil Board.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp. 3, 296Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 94 He was promoted to temporary group captain in June that year. With the formation in 1942 of Allied Air Forces Headquarters, which assumed the operational functions of the Chief of the Air Staff, the Air Board was reorganised. The offices of Air Member for Organisation and Equipment, once held by Air Marshal Richard Williams, and Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian position, were dissolved and replaced by those of the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) and Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AMEM) to focus on the two key logistical functions of supply and engineering, respectively.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p. 479Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, pp. 130‚Äì132 Promoted to acting air commodore, Mackinolty became the inaugural AMSE in June. Air Commodore Ellis Wackett became AMEM at the same time. Norman Ashworth, in How Not to Run an Air Force!, observed that splitting the logistical functions of the Air Board in this manner appeared to be a \\"uniquely Australian\\" experiment, and it was not inconceivable that the organisation had been \\"tailored\\" to suit these \\"two very capable officers\\".Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, pp. 132, 137 Serving as AMSE for the remainder of the war, Mackinolty was credited with successfully managing the supply requirements of personnel and aircraft for an organisation that by 1945 had grown by a factor of fifty from its pre-war size, to become the world's fourth largest air force.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 170‚Äì171 34th Infantry Brigade in Hiro, Japan, September 1946alt=Full- length outdoor portrait of four men in light-coloured military uniforms Following the end of hostilities, Mackinolty was personally responsible for disposing of surplus equipment up to an original value of ¬£500, and jointly responsible (with the Business and Finance Members of the Air Board) for disposing of equipment valued between ¬£500 and ¬£10,000.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 14 His duties as AMSE extended to setting the peacetime meal rations for RAAF personnel.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 113 In May 1946, he joined the Australian Battlefields Memorial Committee, convened to advise the Federal government regarding commemoration of the armed forces for their wartime achievements. Later that year, Mackinolty visited British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) headquarters in Japan, and subsequently arranged for the RAAF to assume responsibility for the supply of spare parts to its air component, British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR).Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 210, 216 He was raised to acting air vice-marshal in January 1947 (substantive in October 1948). By this time, Mackinolty and the Chief of the Air Staff, No. 4 Squadron AFC veteran Air Vice-Marshal George Jones, were the only remaining RAAF officers who had served in both world wars.Helson, 10 Years at the Top, p. 241 Other senior commanders and veterans of the Australian Flying Corps had been summarily retired in 1946, a \\"purge\\" that was ostensibly designed to make way for the advancement of younger and equally proficient officers.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 179‚Äì182 During 1947, the RAAF prepared for the introduction of an apprentice engineering scheme. Against a harsh post-war economic climate, Mackinolty personally intervened to improve the planned accommodation for trainees, arguing that the youths could not be expected to live in the austere conditions to which other members of the Air Force were used. He further noted in his submission to the Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, that \\"the parents of apprentices will, from time to time, be permitted to visit their sons and it would be in the interest of both the Apprentice Scheme and the Service generally if all reasonable efforts were made to create a favourable impression in the minds of the parents\\".Coulthard- Clark, From the Ground Up, pp. 29‚Äì32 Shortly after the first intake of engineer apprentices in January 1948, Mackinolty formally proposed that a similar scheme be set up for apprenticeships in the supply and clerical trades. Although initially rejected by the Minister, after some refinements the plan came to fruition three years later as the Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme.Coulthard-Clark, From the Ground Up, pp. 90‚Äì95 In January 1951, Mackinolty was struck down suddenly with cancer and admitted to hospital at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. He died there on 24 February, survived by his wife and children. At the time of his death, he had served for a decade as honorary treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmens' Imperial League of Australia, and was the last member of the original staff of the AFC in 1914 still serving. He was succeeded as AMSE by Air Vice- Marshal Joe Hewitt.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 500 Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as \\"the most significant logistics officer in the history of the RAAF\\",Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 7 Mackinolty was accorded an Air Force funeral with full honours at Bathurst Memorial Chapel, Elsternwick, and cremated at Springvale Crematorium.

It was directed by Damien Sage. The film was also written by Damien Sage under the pseudonym Sergio Mauroforte. The cast is composed of mostly unknown actors and actresses from the Raleigh, North Carolina area. The film also features Aeryn S√ºin of the industrial rock band RIP/TORN in a supporting role. Aeryn S√ºin and RIP/TORN also provided the score and original songs. The film is told in a fractured narrative that jumps through different time periods in the lead character's life. It is purposefully unclear as to whether some events shown are real, psychologically distorted or outright fantasy, as the entire movie was conceived to be like a series of hallucinations or interconnected dreams captured on film. Psychotropica was shot in and around Raleigh, Damien Sage's home town. Some scenes were also shot in the city of Graham, North Carolina. About 40% of the film was shot and produced in 2005; shooting stopped due to various reasons (mostly owing to Damien Sage funding the film out of pocket) then commenced again in 2009. The remaining 60% of the film was shot and produced from July 2008 to July 2009. Plot The film opens with an elderly man (Damien Sage as \\"The Patient\\") leaving a rushed and emotional, voice message to his partner of 30 years. The Patient implies that an insidious person from his distant past (a past he never spoke of to his lover) has shown up and this person is very dangerous. The Patient has decided to run out on the good life he has had for so long, to leave his lover and everything they have behind to keep his partner out of harms way. When The Patient finishes his message and prepares to leave he suffers from delirum, and he sees an orange fishtank with devil horns and eats it. In this moment The Patient drifts off into his subconscious mind, into his past. As this happens the \\"elderly\\" Patient's apartment fades away into a bright white light that reveals a large ominous building perched on a jagged cliff side, overlooking the sea... Two voices appear over the scene, one is of The Patient (age 25 at this point) and the other is a sadistic man known only as \\"The Doctor\\" (played by Maximillian Magick). The Doctor states that he has been administering an experimental drug called \\"Psychotropica\\" to The Patient and mercilessly interrogating him about a traumatic and off kilter \\"nightmare\\" for quite sometime now (in an effort to \\"study\\" his reactions.) The Patient is obviously in great emotional and psychological stress and does not wish to continue the \\"treatment\\" but The Doctor forces him to continue for \\"as long as it takes\\" under threat of severe \\"punishment.\\" Reluctantly The Patient agrees to continue relating his painful nightmare for The Doctor. The Patient takes a deep breath and begins his psychological \\"trip\\"... As The Patient begins, the scene fades into an odd neon landscape, that features a never ending \\"highway of the mind\\", glowing green plasma mountains and billowing technicolor clouds that flow relentlessly in the sky. The Patient can now be seen standing off in the distance of this dreamscape. We move slowly past him and into the sky. We travel through the vast reaches of space and time at great speed until we are thrust into the first major segment of The Patient's \\"nightmare\\"... From here on out the film plays like a dream would, jumping wildly in tone and style, from the past to the present, each segment related in some meaningful way to the ones before and after. The dream logic of the film is only interrupted by brief interludes of The Patient setting up and describing each part of his \\"nightmare.\\" Most of this nightmare revolves around The Patient's tumultuous relationship with his sadistic Stepbrother and Sister (played, as adults by Braden West and Tiffany Titmouse) and his efforts to break away from them and their violent life together. Along the way there are visually stylish dreams with dreams, a pulse-pounding psychedelic sex scene between the step brother and sister, an extended Evil Dead homage that segues into an epic animated sequence that pits The Patient's conflicting \\"light and dark\\" sides against one another. There are also moments of unmitigated violence, black comedy, brutal fights and visually stunning weirdness; all building up to an emotionally and psychologically explosive final act where all the secrets of the \\"nightmare\\", The Doctor and The Patient are revealed.

Sage and his small crew of local area actors and actresses shot the scenes (now referred to in the DVD Scene Selection) as \\"Death In The Park, Part 1\\", \\"Sister Takes His Car\\", \\"Yummy Steamy Incest\\" and \\"Death of the Boy\\" from January 2005 until June 2005. At that time the lead actress went to college and the co-lead actor went into the military. Sage held onto the footage already shot and moved on to other projects. After working on several short films (including the well received suspense short \\"D.O.D. (Dead on Delivery)\\") Due to the semi-success of \\"D.O.D.\\" Sage was in talks to do a feature-length version of that film. He and his company had negotiated a deal for a $300,000 USD budget and had arranged for several \\"name\\" actors to star in said production. When it came time for shooting to proceed however, the financial backers pulled out \\"due to a loss at Cannes\\" and left Sage and his cinematic team hanging. Sage scrapped the project they were working on and vowed to do the next film (and every other thereafter) totally independently. This film turned out to be \\"Psychotropica.\\" Using the basic structure of \\"The Eclipse's\\" original plot (a sordid love triangle between two brothers and their sister) Sage concocted the new more ambitious saga that would become Psychotropica. Psychotropica ended up being shot for far less than $1,000 USD. The cast and crew like to jokingly say that the movie was made with a budget so low \\"no money was harmed during the making of this film.\\" With a new cast in place Sage and company commenced shooting on the remainder of Psychotropica from July 2008 until July 2009. Post production work, including editing, scoring and visual effects were done simultaneously. The film was shot on Mini-DV Cassettes, using a Panasonic DVx 100-a Camera. As the film is an homage to the \\"classic\\" works of Dario Argento, Ken Russell, John Waters (and many others) Sage purposefully gave the film a retro look; using vivid \\"psychedelic\\" color schemes alternating with black and white, \\"kung-fu\\" snap zooms, star filters, soft focus and faux rear screen projection (among many other techniques.) Also, in order for Psychotropica to appear as if it were a \\"Eurotrash\\" film from the 1970s Sage added film grain and scratches in post production, to make it seem almost as if the film had been shot on Super-8 or VHS. After the final cut of the film was prepared, Sage desired to give the film an extra edge. So he went back and hand animated over the top of the footage, to enhance the surreality of the film even more and as a reference to \\"Childhood drawings by The Patient\\" mentioned in the plot of the film. (Critics have compared this style to the works of Ralph Bakshi and Richard Linklater.) Music Aeryn S√ºin and his band RIP/TORN composed original songs and score for Psychotropica (after having composed for Sage's short film \\"D.O.D.\\") To achieve the desired unique sound for the score and songs S√ºin used many odd and outlandish instruments and methods, including: Dulcimers, , household objects (buckets, cabinets, etc.), a de-constructed synthesizer and older, worn in guitars made in the 70s and 80s. Once all of the songs and score were completed and in place Sage was so pleased with the results that he gave \\"Music By RIP/TORN\\" pre-title, top billing in the film and S√ºin an Associate Producer's credit. Reception Judge Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict Said: \\"Psychotropica certainly looks and sounds like no other film I am familiar with... Damien Sage set out to create a unique assault on the eyes and ears with Psychotropica, and on that score he succeeds admirably.\\" Release Static Omega Films and AMP/Diamond Dust released the DVD in November 2009 independently through CreateSpace.

Travelling by road from Pinehouse, the Key Lake mine is 223 km (138 miles) north, Prince Albert is 346 km (215 miles) south, La Ronge is 214 km (133 miles) east and Beauval, the closest community, is 107 km (67 miles) west. Highway 914 passes through the community and Pinehouse is the only established community along this road, other than uranium mines. There were 1,074 residents in 2016. Cree was the mother tongue of 630 of the residents in 2011. The mayor of this predominantly M√©tis settlement is Mike Natomagan.  History  There was a North West Company post and a rival post near the mouth of the Tippo River called Lac des Serpents (Lake of Serpents or Snake Lake) in 1786. The Hudson's Bay Company had a post at the north end of Pinehouse Lake called the Souris River Post. It was located about 2 km west of the mouth of the Belanger River once known as the Souris River. Most of the residents of this settlement which numbered about 100 people in the 1920s and 1930s eventually moved to Pinehouse. The Souris River Post near Sandfly Lake operated from 1875 to 1939. The Census of 1906 called this settlement then numbering 73 people Souris River on the Churchill. Missionaries first visited the Dene population of Pinehouse Lake in 1899. A smallpox epidemic killed around half of the population of the area in 1900-1901. Some survivors moved up the Churchill River towards Patuanak and downriver to Stanley Mission further depleting the area population. The 1906 Canada Census uses the name Serpent Lake on the Churchill to describe the community that then had about 11 people which included the family of Samuel and Veronique Misponass. A townsite was established in the 1940s and a Roman Catholic church (St. Dominic) was built in 1944 followed by a store and in 1948 a school. In 1954 the community was renamed Pinehouse Lake. Pinehouse was originally named Snake Lake (kin√™piko- s√¢kahikam in Cree) and elders still use this name in reference to the community. Although officially named Pinehouse, numerous official sources including the official road map of Saskatchewan issued by the province, identifies the community by the name Pinehouse Lake. Eighty houses were built between 1967 and 1980 and Pinehouse was connected to the power grid in 1984 replacing a diesel generator set up around 1970. The first road to the community was built from Highway 2 in 1977.  Infrastructure  Pinehouse is home to a store, a gas station, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment, the northern village's office and a health clinic. The community is served by Pinehouse Lake Airport. The community is also home to the Pinehouse Photography Club, a non-profit organization that supports and encourages youth mental health prevention through therapeutic photography. The ice skating arena features an artificial ice plant.  Education  Pinehouse has two schools - Minahik Waskahigan Elementary School and Minahik Waskahigan High School. The schools are in the Northern Lights School Division #113 and have an enrolment of 400 students and a support staff of 40.

It is located 190 km northwest of Creighton via the Hanson Lake Road and Highway 135. The community is on the banks of the Churchill River. It is at the end of Highway 135, after passing through Pelican Narrows. Sandy Bay is 72 km north of Pelican Narrows. Pelican Narrows, the neighbouring community, is the administrative centre for the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation and the majority of the townsite is reserve land. Sandy Bay is split into two parts: the southern village part and the northern part, which is situated on the Wapaskokimaw reserve (Wapaskokimaw Reserve #202). Sandy Bay is situated at \\"road's end\\" in the northeast area Saskatchewan and occupies land that was home to Aboriginal peoples for hundreds of years before it became the site of power generation. It is close to the Manitoba border, and its economic and social ties to that province are extensive. Sandy Bay is administered by the Northern Village of Sandy Bay. The community has a health clinic, a rehabilitation centre, a recreation board and a K-12 school. SaskTel put a communications tower in Sandy Bay in 2008 and the community has cellular service including, as of 2011, a 3G network. Sandy Bay has a population of about 1,200, of whom about one quarter are members of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation.  History  Main Beach on the Churchill River Sandy Bay grew around the hydroelectric power station built in the late 1920s to supply power for the smelters and mines in Flin Flon, Manitoba. It was initially situated further downstream on the Churchill River, but the residents were encouraged to relocate near the proposed site of the Island Falls Generating Station to provide a source of labour for its construction. The community then grew as the Island Falls Generating Station altered traditional lifestyles. In 1965 Sandy Bay became a Local Community Authority. In 1966 the Island Falls Generating Station switched to an automatic system and the majority of jobs were lost. An all-weather road was built into the community in 1967 and other services followed. In the 1980s Sandy Bay was designated as a northern village. The dam is presently operated by SaskPower and is now totally automated. Tourism is now the major industry in the area. There is a local store in the community, but other supplies and groceries can be purchased in Flin Flon, Manitoba, two hours away on gravel and paved highways.  Demographics   Climate  Sandy Bay has warm summers and cold winters. The average daytime high does not exceed 25 ¬∞C, but it is common to have heat waves where the temperature will reach 30 ¬∞C to 35 ¬∞C. In the winter the average daytime low does not dip below - 25 ¬∞C, but is it common to get cold fronts that bring the air temperature to -40 ¬∞C. The majority of the precipitation occurs during the summer months, mainly June and July. The average annual precipitation is 460mm. During the summer months it is common for the rain to fall in large amounts during short periods of time. Lightning and Thunder Storms are almost a daily occurrence in the summer evenings. With heavy amounts of rain, the lakes, rivers and streams fill up fast and can cause problems. In the summer of 2011 the Sandy Bay and Pelican Narrows region received a large amount of rain over a three-day period. The rivers overflowed and the main road was washed out in several places. The roads were impassable. The communities were cut off from regular services and no one could leave. The Hansen Lake Road, Highway 106, was washed out and became impassable. The provincial Ministry of Transportation worked around the clock to fix the roads and had them open within a few days. The hottest day on record was on July 21, 1929 when the daytime high reached 40 ¬∞C. The coldest day on record was on January 15, 1930 when the daytime low reached -46.1 ¬∞C. The most rain, in a single day, was on August 22, 1936 when 77mm of rain fell. The day with the most snow was on November 28, 1973 when 28 cm of snow fell.  Hector Thiboutot School  The Hector Thiboutot Community School offers schooling for children from Kindergarten to Grade 12. The school has over 500 students. Like most schools in the division, it has a large gymnasium, science lab, home economics room, industrial arts shop, community library, computer room and many large classrooms. Furnished rental teacher housing is provided for the staff. The school offers exciting and challenging programs for the students.  Sandy Bay Memorial Beach  The Sandy Bay Memorial Beach is a community based project in memory of the children who have drowned in the Churchill River. In the summer of 2011 the community came together and decided to build a safe recreational area where the children can swim. The beach provides a controlled swimming environment and some of the safety features are floating docks, buoys, and an emergency access ramp which are not common in Aboriginal Northern communities. The community is planning on having lifeguards working in the summer months and it will be the perfect spot for the whole family to swim. This project has created new jobs for the community and gives youth work experience. The Hector Thiboutot School joined the project to teach the students about water safety and about playing near frozen rivers/lakes in the winter.

The newspaper was founded in Luray, Virginia in 1911, by a merger between The Page News (established in 1881) and The Page Valley Courier (established March 1867). The Page News and Courier is one of a number of newspapers owned by the Byrd Family. Other newspapers in the group include The Winchester Star (Winchester, Virginia and Frederick County, Virginia), The Daily News-Record (Harrisonburg, Virginia and Rockingham County, Virginia), The Warren Sentinel (Front Royal, Virginia and Warren County, Virginia), The Shenandoah Valley-Herald (Woodstock, Virginia and Shenandoah County, Virginia), The Valley Banner (Elkton, Virginia), The Clarke Times (Berryville, Virginia and Clarke County, Virginia), and the Rocktown Weekly (Harrisonburg, Virginia). An earlier newspaper, the Luray Review, may have been the predecessor of Page Valley Courier, having been established before the American Civil War. Due to financial woes experienced on account of the war, however, the Luray Review may have ceased production as early as 1862. On March 6, 2018, it was announced that The Page News and Courier, along with the other Byrd family newspapers, were to be sold to Ogden Newspapers.

The novel addresses India's changing social, political, and cultural climate following colonialism. Plot summary The novel is set around 1911 to 1919 in Delhi. Ahmed Ali has vividly drawn the picture of old Delhi and its Muslim inhabitants of that era. He depicts the themes of disintegration, degeneration, alienation, gender and social conflicts, nostalgia, the downfall of the Mughal emperors, and the effects of colonialism and imperialism on Indian Muslims in Delhi. The novel is shot through with rich symbolic imagery. The palm tree, the henna plant, dogs, cats and pigeons refer not only to the behaviors of characters but also the whole Muslim society. The novel starts at dawn, with \\"twilight\\" referring to the rise of the sun as well as the rise of the protagonist Mir Nihal's living standards. By contrast, descriptions of twilight at evening in the closing sentences portray the overall downfall and destruction of not only the family of Mir Nihal but also the Mughal Empire altogether.

He was the founder and editor-in-chief of the Washington Monthly magazine and the author of We Do Our Part: Toward A Fairer and More Equal America (Random House, 2017). Writing in The New York Times, Jonathan Martin called the book a ‚Äúwell timed ‚Ä¶ cri de coeur‚Äù and ‚Äúa desperate plea to his country and party to resist the temptations of greed, materialism and elitism.‚Äù  Early life and education  Charles Peters was born December 22, 1926, in Charleston, West Virginia. He attended public schools, graduating from Charleston High School in 1944. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1944, serving at Ohio University, Camp Atterbury in Indiana, and Fort McClellan, Alabama, where an injury in a training accident resulted in his being in Army hospitals for several months, and his discharge from the Army in 1946. In 1946, he went to New York City to enter Columbia College. After receiving his BA in 1949, he entered graduate school at Columbia and received his MA in 1951. In 1952-53, he worked for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York. During the summers from 1946 through 1954, he performed various backstage roles at summer theaters in Boylston, Massachusetts, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and Newport, Rhode Island, and had his own repertory company in Charleston, West Virginia. Peters entered the University of Virginia School of Law in 1954. He was named to the editorial board of the Virginia Law Review in 1955, serving until his graduation in 1957.  Early career  After receiving his law degree, he married Elizabeth Hubbell, a former ballet dancer who had attended Vassar College, and returned to Charleston to practice law with his father‚Äôs firm, Peters, Merricks, Leslie and Mohler. His practice included libel, criminal defense, corporate and labor law, as well as representing plaintiffs and defendants in civil trials. In 1959, he was named chief staff officer of the Judiciary Committee of the West Virginia House of Delegates, and in 1960, he was elected a member of the House. In 1960, he also managed the primary and general election campaigns in Kanawha County for presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. After serving in the 1961 session of the legislature, he went to Washington, D.C. to help start the Peace Corps. After returning to serve in the 1962 legislative session, he was named the Peace Corps‚Äô director of evaluation, a position that required him to report on the performance of the agency‚Äôs programs overseas and on how they could be improved.  Founding of the Washington Monthly  In 1968, Peters resigned from the Peace Corps to begin planning a new magazine to be called the Washington Monthly. The magazine‚Äôs prospectus said its purpose would be ‚Äúto look at Washington the way an anthropologist looks at a South Sea island,‚Äù helping the reader understand our system of politics and government, where it breaks down, why it breaks down, and what can be done to make it work.‚Äù The first issue was published in January 1969. Its articles included ‚ÄúThe White House Staff vs. the Cabinet,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat Happens to a Senator‚Äôs Day,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Data Game.‚Äù Among the authors were such journalists as David Broder, Murray Kempton, Russell Baker, and Calvin Trillin, as well as people who had worked in government, such as Peters, former White House aide Bill Moyers, and former U.S. Senate aide James Boyd. A similar mix of authors would continue to write for the magazine, but beginning in 1970, the magazine became largely the product of young unknowns, who would typically serve as writer-editors for two years. Among them were Taylor Branch, Suzannah Lessard, James Fallows, Walter Shapiro, Michael Kinsley, David Ignatius, Nicholas Lemann, Gregg Easterbrook, Mickey Kaus, Joe Nocera, Jonathan Alter, Timothy Noah, Steve Waldman, Matt Cooper, Jason DeParle, James Bennet, Katherine Boo, and Jon Meacham. One author characterizes Peters and the magazine as important influences on radical centrist political thought. Peters served as editor of the Washington Monthly until he retired in 2001, but continued to write a regular column Tilting at Windmills for the magazine until 2014. Russell Baker, in an interview in the alumni magazine Columbia College Today, called Peters ‚Äúa great editor in an age that‚Äôs not producing great editors.‚Äù  Founding of Understanding Government  In 1998, he founded a non-profit organization called Understanding Government with the purpose of improving press coverage of the executive branch of government. Understanding Government sponsored the first-ever Prize for Preventive Journalism, given in 2008 to journalist Michael Grunwald, and has published reports on federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Peters retired from the nonprofit in 2012, and it ceased operations in 2014.  Books  ;Author: *We Do Our Part: Toward a Fairer and More Equal America *Lyndon B.

Education Boyden received a BA (1932) and MA (1938) from Harvard University; he also studied at Columbia University and Hartt School of Music (the latter awarding him an honorary Ph.D. in 1957). Career After teaching for a year at Mills College, Boyden joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley in 1939; he taught at UC Berkeley until 1975 as assistant professor (1943-9), associate professor (1949‚Äì55), full professor (1955-75), and also served as chairman of the music department (1955‚Äì61). Boyden played an important role in the development of the UC Berkeley music department in his position as chair. He was instrumental not only in building up the musicology department, but also in promoting the ethnomusicology, composition, and performance sectors. Boyden was twice president of the American Musicological Society (1954‚Äì56, 1960‚Äì62), and a member of the executive board in 1958, 1966, and 1978-79. He was also involved with the International Musicological Society, the Royal Musical Association (England), the Galpin Society (London), and the Stradivari Society. After a long struggle with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Boyden died on September 18, 1986. Awards Boyden was awarded a Fulbright to teach at Oxford University (1963), and thrice received a Guggenheim fellowship (1954, 1967, 1970). The University of California, Berkeley honored him with the Berkeley Citation in 1980. Publications Boyden published in many journals, including The Musical Quarterly, The Journal of the American Musicological Society, and The Strad. Boyden published three textbooks, including the widely read An Introduction to Music. Boyden's focal scholarly research, however, was his innovative work on string instruments and performance practice; this culminated in the publication A History of Violin Playing from its Origins to 1761. This book, first published in 1965, and later translated into German and Polish, was a seminal work in both organology and performance studies. It has been influential not only for scholars, but also for generations of string players. A History of Violin Playing from its Origins to 1761 This work follows a chronology divided into four parts: ‚ÄúI. The Formative Period, 1520-1600‚Äù; ‚ÄúII. The Development of an Idiomatic Technique, 1600-1650‚Äù; ‚ÄúIII. National School of the Late Seventeenth Century. The Rise of Virtuosity‚Äù; and ‚ÄúIV. The Culmination of the Early History of Violin Playing, 1700-1761.‚Äù In each of these sections Boyden utilizes musical analyses of relevant works, organological studies, and iconographical studies, as well as critical examinations of treatises and contemporary accounts to elucidate the development of the violin, its performance and technique. Boyden also adeptly infuses personal insight from his broad experience and knowledge as a scholar of musical objects and performance. Boyden started a sequel to A History of Violin Playing from its Origins to 1761, but it was never completed.

It is particularly suited to short read sequencing data. All programs in the SOAP package may be used free of charge and are distributed under the GPL open source software license.  Functionality  The SOAP suite of tools can be used to perform the following genome assembly tasks:  Sequence Alignment  SOAPaligner (SOAP2) is specifically designed for fast alignment of short reads and performs favorably with respect to similar alignment tools such as Bowtie and MAQ.  Genome Assembly  SOAPdenovo is a short read de novo assembler utilizing De Bruijn graph construction. It is optimized for short reads such as that generated by Illumina and is capable of assembling large genomes such as the human genome. SOAPdenovo was used to assemble the genome of the giant panda. This was upgraded to SOAPdenovo2, which was optimized for large genomes and included the widely used GapCloser module.  Transcriptome Assembly  SOAPdenovo-Trans is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for RNA-Seq that was created for the 1000 Plant Genomes project.  Indel Discovery  SOAPindel is a tool to find insertions and deletions from next generation paired-end sequencing data, providing a list of candidate indels with quality scores.  SNP Discovery  SOAPsnp is a consensus sequence builder. This tool uses the output from SOAPaligner to generate a consensus sequence which enables SNPs to be called on a newly sequenced individual.  Structural Variation Discovery  SOAPsv is a tool to find structural variations using whole genome assembly.  Quality control and preprocessing  SOAPnuke is a tool for integrated quality control and preprocessing of datasets from genomic, small RNA, Digital Gene Expression, and metagenomic experiments.  History   SOAP v1  The first release of SOAP consisted only of the sequence alignment tool SOAPaligner.  SOAP v2  SOAP v2 extended and improved on SOAP v1 by significantly improving the performance of the SOAPaligner tool. Alignment time was reduced by a factor of 20-30, while memory usage was reduced by a factor of 3. Support was added for compressed file formats. The SOAP suite was expanded then to include the new tools: SOAPdenovo 1&2, SOAPindel, SOAPsnp, and SOAPsv.  SOAP v3  SOAP v3 extended the alignment tool by being the first short-read alignment tool to utilize GPU processors. As a result of these improvements, SOAPalign significantly outperformed competing aligners Bowtie and BWA in terms of speed.

Her work has appeared on stages in the San Francisco Bay Area, Washington, DC, and Seoul, South Korea. Among many awards, she received a 2014 Investing in Artists Award from the Center for Cultural Innovation, a 2008 Honorary Fellowship from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and a 2007 Dance USA Award from the Irvine Foundation She received the 2003 Goldie Award for artistic achievement in dance from the San Francisco Bay Guardian, which called her \\"among the leaders in the field\\", and her show \\"One Window\\" was cited by the SF Weekly as one of the Top Ten Theater Events of 2005. She has been nominated for three Isadora Duncan Awards, dedicated to outstanding achievement among Bay Area dance artists. Shuch has choreographed (and appeared in) plays staged by the California Shakespeare Theater regularly since 2009. Of the troupe's 2014 production of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" in which Shuch directed the movement and played the role of Titania, the San Jose Mercury News said, \\"Shuch's hypnotic movement is at the heart of this giddy and memorable 'Dream.'\\"  Style  Although Shuch's training is in dance, her work combines movement with theater, video, live and recorded music, and occasional puppetry. She tends to weave a non-narrative fabric of associations that conveys meaning implicitly rather than explicitly, often exploring the difficulties and ambiguities of human relationships. Even her most serious work frequently is suffused with sly humor. Shuch often uses striking visual tableaux and surreal situations. For instance, her 2006 production Orbit drew an analogy between the human need for interpersonal connection and heavenly bodies trapped in orbit. (The mnemonic that helps astronomers remember classes of stars, she points out, is: Oh be a fine girl, kiss me right now.) Shuch's shows are peppered with over-the-top dance routines archly set to pop-music bric-a-brac. The choreography is decidedly postmodern and often tortured, with frequent ironic references to social dance and variety-show revues. Her sets frequently take advantage of cinematic lighting and video effects. Reviewing Orbit, the San Francisco Chronicle noted: \\"What makes Erika Shuch's work so arresting isn't the way she intuitively melds movement and theater, or the knack she has for attracting brilliant collaborators, or the Gen Y appeal of her slouchy, all-too-human performers. What's made this still-young choreographer a standout since she emerged in San Francisco six years ago is her childlike audacity in the face of big questions. Shuch is a maker of metaphors, an existential explorer whose characters consider their place in the galaxy through poetic symbols.\\" Television station KQED documented Shuch's creative process in a May 2007, edition of its show SPARK.  Career  Shuch began performing as a theater student at UC Santa Cruz under dancer/choreographer Mel Wong. There, she attended a workshop by the politically-charged performance group Contraband, which suggested a broader framework for Wong's methods. She cites as influences Wong, Contraband, filmmaker and writer Miranda July, and the NPR radio show This American Life. Her first troupe was known as the Beauty School. She disbanded that group and formed the Erika Shuch Performance Project (ESP Project) in 2002. \\"Through metaphor and theatrical alchemy,\\" the company, according to its website, seeks to provide \\"a mirror, a lens, an opportunity for reflection, a brainstorm, a meetingplace, a prayer, a conversation, and a confession.\\" ESP Project has gone on to perform at many San Francisco Bay Area venues, including a long- running residency at Intersection For The Arts. As co-founder of the Experimental Performance Institute at San Francisco's New College of California, Shuch co-directed BA and MFA performance programs during the school's initial years. She joined the adjunct faculty at California College of the Arts in 2014 and lectured to UC Berkeley's Global Urban Humanities Initiative in 2015. In addition to her own productions, she has directed, choreographed, or appeared in works by Richard Montoya, Peter Brook, Eric Ehn, Sean San Jose, Octavio Solis, Philip Kan Gotanda, and Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket). Shuch has held residencies at the Berkeley Reportory Theater (2012), American Conservatory Theater (2012), San Diego State University (2012), Mullae Art Space, Seoul, Korea (2011), deYoung Museum (2010), Naropa University (2010), American Conservatory Theater (2009-2012), and UC Berkeley (2007-2010). Other residencies include the Headlands Center for the Arts (2006), Djerassi (2007), ODC Theatre (2003, 2004), and Intersection for the Arts (2003‚Äìpresent).

Background The Cummeragunja Mission was mostly home to Yorta Yorta people who had been relocated in the late 19th century from the Maloga Mission. In January 1935, according to W.B. Payne, a Church of Christ missionary, Christian churches were indifferent and neglecting Aboriginal people at the mission, \\"While thousands of pounds were being raised for missions in foreign countries the aborigines in Australia were regarded as outcasts\\". Over the years, the New South Wales government had tightened its control on the operation of the mission. By late 1938 people had become unhappy with the management of the mission, living conditions and restrictions on their movement. Protest On 4 February 1939, when Jack Patten was arrested and removed from the mission after trying to address the local people, as many as 200 residents of the Cummeragunja Mission walked out of the mission and crossed the Murray River, leaving the state of New South Wales. This was in contravention of rules set by the New South Wales Board for the Protection of Aborigines. The walk-off has been described as the first-ever mass strike of Aboriginal people in Australia. Legacy Many of the people who left the mission in February 1939 settled in northern Victoria in towns such as Barmah, Echuca and Shepparton. The third episode of the 1981 miniseries, Women of the Sun, is a fictional story based on the walk-off. In October 2010, the opera Pecan Summer, based on the walk-off, opened in Mooroopna, near Shepparton.

Pasko worked for many comics publishers, but is best known for his superhero stories for DC Comics over three decades. He wrote Superman in various media, including television animation, webisodes, and a syndicated newspaper strip for Tribune Media Services, as well as comic books. He also co-created the 1975 revamp of Doctor Fate.  Biography   Early life and career  Pasko claimed to have been born as Jean-Claude Rochefort in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As a teenager, he was a regular contributor to comic book letter columns and co-published a fanzine, Fantazine, with Alan Brennert, who is now a novelist. After attending Northwestern University and New York University, Pasko settled in New York.  Comics  =The 1970s= Pasko's first published comics writing credit was a short story titled \\"Package Deal \\" for Warren Publishing's Creepy #51 (March 1973). His first published work, however, was a story titled \\"Eye Opener,\\" in Vampirella #20 (October 1972), which was erroneously credited to his friend and professional benefactor, Doug Moench. Pasko started working for DC Comics and began his long association with Superman in 1973, as a result of his association with long-time editor Julius Schwartz. As a frequent contributor to Schwartz's letter columns, beginning in 1968, Pasko had been nicknamed \\"Pesky Pasko,\\" in acknowledgment of the fact that his comments were more often than not acutely critical. His campaign to become a \\"lettercol regular,\\" as a way of breaking into comics writing, was inspired and encouraged by his friend and benefactor, writer Mike Friedrich, who advised Pasko that a name that was recognizable from the letter columns would have an advantage in terms of over-the-transom, or \\"slush pile,\\" contributions, by being more likely to be read before the submissions of writers unknown to the editor. Pasko's first Superman-related story was a \\"Private Life of Clark Kent\\" backup feature in Superman #277 (July 1974). In addition to writing backup stories and occasional other features in Action Comics during this period, such as The Atom, Pasko was the featured Superman writer from 1977‚Äì1979. DC Comics Presents, a team-up title starring Superman, was launched in 1978 by Pasko and artist Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. Pasko and Curt Swan created the Atomic Skull in Superman #323 (May 1978) and the Master Jailer in Superman #331 (January 1979).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 180: \\"Writer Martin Pasko and artist Curt Swan introduced...the Master Jailer.\\" From 1979‚Äì1982, Pasko contributed stories to the Superman Family anthology title, including runs as the regular writer of the Jimmy Olsen and Supergirl features. In addition, during 1978 and 1979, Pasko scripted the syndicated newspaper comic strip The World's Greatest Superheroes which initially starred Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, and The Flash, but gradually changed its focus to primarily feature Superman. A solo Doctor Fate story in 1st Issue Special #9 (December 1975), written by Pasko and drawn by Walt Simonson, led to an important development in the life of the character. With this story, Pasko added the concept that the spirit of Nabu resided in Doctor Fate's helmet and took control of Fate's alter-ego Kent Nelson whenever the helmet was donned. In 1981 Roy Thomas incorporated this into his series All-Star Squadron, as an explanation of the changes in Fate's helmet and powers. In 1982, this led to DC featuring Kent and his wife Inza in a series of back-up stories, written by Pasko, in The Flash. DC later collected Pasko's stories into a three-issue limited series titled The Immortal Dr. Fate (Jan. 1985 - March 1985). Other titles Pasko wrote for DC included Wonder Woman from 1975‚Äì1977, featuring a major story arc documenting the heroine's attempt to gain readmission to the Justice League of America. Wonder Woman had quit the organization after renouncing her powers. Pasko wrote a number of issues of Justice League of America between 1974 and 1977; he was the regular writer of Metal Men in 1976‚Äì1977, and wrote all seven published issues of Kobra in 1976‚Äì1977, a feature he redeveloped and re-created, loosely based on a significantly-different concept originated by Jack Kirby. The story intended to be Kobra issue #8 appeared as the Batman story in DC Special Series #1. In addition, Pasko wrote a number of issues of Adventure Comics between 1976 and 1980. He wrote a Daredevil prose story for Marvel Novel Series #9 (The Marvel Superheroes) in 1979 under the pseudonym of \\"Kyle Christopher\\". =The 1980s= In his first comics-format work for Marvel Comics, Pasko was the regular scripter of that company's Star Trek comic book in 1980‚Äì1981. He helped Alan Brennert enter the comics industry by having Brennert co-write Star Trek #12 (March 1981) for Marvel. Pasko was also a writer of the Star Trek comic strip from late 1982 through early 1983. In 1988, Pasko wrote an issue of the DC Star Trek comic book. In 1982, Pasko and artist Thomas Yeates revived Swamp Thing, in a new series titled Saga of the Swamp Thing.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 197: \\"Swamp Thing returned to the pages of a new ongoing series, written by Martin Pasko and drawn by artist Tom Yeates.\\" Pasko left Swamp Thing with issue #19 (Dec. 1983) and was succeeded by Alan Moore, who took the title and the character in a different direction. Pasko wrote a number of issues of the First Comics version of Joe Staton's E-Man in 1983‚Äì1984. In 1988‚Äì1989 Pasko was a regular contributor to Action Comics during its stint as a weekly anthology, where he developed a new version of \\"The Secret Six\\". He also wrote the \\"Blackhawk\\" feature therein, based on the Howard Chaykin retcon, and the subsequent monthly title (1989‚Äì1990). = The 1990s and 2000s = In 1994, he wrote the Marvel Comics licensed series Gargoyles, based on a Disney Television Animation series. He then returned to New York to serve as DC's Group Editor-Mass Market. While that was his official title, within the company he was known as the head of the Special Projects Group. In this capacity, he oversaw the production of DC's custom comics; licensed titles such as the Star Trek line; and various special projects such as the writing of stage and stunt shows for the Six Flags amusement park chain, and the writing and production of various webisodes for Warner Bros. Online. In this capacity, he also co-created, with his staff, and edited the horror satire Gross Point, which ran in 1997-98. During his decade on staff at DC, Pasko wrote issues of Impulse, one of two stories in the Green Lantern issue of the 2004 Julius Schwartz tribute series DC Comics Presents, and the comics adaptation of the film Superman Returns. Until 2005, he was DC's liaison to Warner Bros. Studios, vetting scripts for WBA animated programming, all feature film, television, and animated development of DC brands, and the live-action series Smallville and Birds of Prey, as well as facilitating studio research by supplying comics and consulting on issues related to DC continuity.  Television  = Live action = In Los Angeles in the 1980s, Pasko wrote for or served as a writer/story editor on many live-action series, including Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Fantasy Island, The Twilight Zone (the 1985-1989 CBS revival), Max Headroom, Simon & Simon, and Roseanne. Between 1985 and 1989, Pasko's writing and story editing partner was Rebecca Parr. The partnership was dissolved in 1989, and Pasko's future TV writing credits were exclusively in animated programming. Parr continued working in sitcoms, notably becoming a writer and executive story consultant on Cheers. = Animation = Pasko began a long career in television animation in 1980, writing several episodes of Thundarr the Barbarian with Steve Gerber. Pasko's many other animated TV writing credits comprise series such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Exosquad, Teen Wolf, Berenstain Bears, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, and My Little Pony. Much, although not all, of this work was done in conjunction with Rebecca Parr. For Thundarr the Barbarian, Pasko came up with the name of Ookla the Mok. In 1980, Gerber and Pasko were having dinner in the Westwood area one night during the period Gerber was writing the \\"bible\\" for the series. Gerber commented to Pasko that he had not yet decided upon a name for the Wookiee-like character the network had insisted be added to the series. As the two walked past the gate to the UCLA campus, Pasko quipped, \\"Why not call him Oo-clah?\\". After writing several scripts, singly and in collaboration with Gerber, Pasko became a story editor on the second season. After leaving the sitcom world at the end of the 1980s, Pasko wrote for such series as Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars, The Tick, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (which he redeveloped in order to produce scripts acceptable to the network), and The Legend of Prince Valiant. As well, in the early 1990s, Pasko accepted a job at Disney Consumer Products' startup comic book division, Disney Comics, developing a line of superhero titles and writing the Roger Rabbit comics series. This activity lasted nine months until, in a corporate reorganization, Disney decided to stop publishing comics altogether. The day before he was let go by Disney, Pasko finalized a deal to join Warner Bros. Animation's Batman: The Animated Series as a writer/story editor. For his work on this series, Pasko won a 1993 Daytime Emmy Award. He is a co-writer of the animated feature Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.  2000s work  Pasko in the 2000s has worked on nonfiction about various aspects of pop culture history, as a writer-researcher and consultant, as well as writing children's fiction and videogame dramatics. These projects include writing The DC Vault, published in 2008; working on the dramatics for Freaky Creatures, Abandon Interactive Entertainment's massively multiplayer online game; co- writing The Essential Superman Encyclopedia with Robert Greenberger; writing the children's book Superman: Prankster of Prime Time; and acting as researcher, consultant, and supplemental copywriter on 75 Years of DC Comics: The Art of Modern Mythmaking. He was a consultant to numerous independent entertainment companies, including Cryptozoic Entertainment, a gaming company,and a freelance comics writer.  Death  Pasko died of natural causes on May 10, 2020, at age 65.

Voiculescu, K. Dykema, A. Nica, \\"Free Random Variables\\", CIRM Monograph Series, AMS, Providence, RI, 1992 The definition of free independence is parallel to the classical definition of independence, except that the role of Cartesian products of measure spaces (corresponding to tensor products of their function algebras) is played by the notion of a free product of (non-commutative) probability spaces. In the context of Voiculescu's free probability theory, many classical-probability theorems or phenomena have free probability analogs: the same theorem or phenomenon holds (perhaps with slight modifications) if the classical notion of independence is replaced by free independence. Examples of this include: the free central limit theorem; notions of free convolution; existence of free stochastic calculus and so on. Let (A,\\\\phi) be a non- commutative probability space, i.e. a unital algebra A over \\\\mathbb{C} equipped with a unital linear functional \\\\phi:A\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C}. As an example, one could take, for a probability measure \\\\mu, : A = L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R},\\\\mu),\\\\phi(f) = \\\\int f(t)\\\\,d\\\\mu(t). Another example may be A=M_N, the algebra of N\\\\times N matrices with the functional given by the normalized trace \\\\phi=\\\\frac{1}{N}Tr. Even more generally, A could be a von Neumann algebra and \\\\phi a state on A. A final example is the group algebra A=\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\Gamma of a (discrete) group \\\\Gamma with the functional \\\\phi given by the group trace \\\\phi (g) = \\\\delta_{g=e},g\\\\in \\\\Gamma. Let \\\\\\\\{A_i : i\\\\in I\\\\\\\\} be a family of unital subalgebras of A. Definition. The family \\\\\\\\{A_i : i\\\\in I\\\\\\\\} is called freely independent if \\\\phi(x_1 x_2 \\\\cdots x_n) =0 whenever \\\\phi(x_j)=0, x_j \\\\in A_{i(j)} and i(1) eq i(2), i(2) eq i(3),\\\\dots. If X_i\\\\in A, i\\\\in I is a family of elements of A (these can be thought of as random variables in A), they are called freely independent if the algebras A_i generated by 1 and X_i are freely independent.  Examples of free independence  * Let \\\\Gamma be the free product of groups \\\\Gamma_i,i\\\\in I, let A=\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\Gamma be the group algebra, \\\\phi(g)=\\\\delta_{g=e} be the group trace, and set A_i=\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\Gamma_i\\\\subset A. Then A_i:i\\\\in I are freely independent. * Let U_i(N),i=1,2 be N\\\\times N unitary random matrices, taken independently at random from the N\\\\times N unitary group (with respect to the Haar measure). Then U_1(N),U_2(N) become asymptotically freely independent as N\\\\to\\\\infty.

It is also one of the oldest surviving claimed reliquaries of the True Cross, if not the oldest.Vatican/Associated Press, November 2009 It is a crux gemmata or jewelled cross, silver-gilt and adorned with jewels in gold settings, given to the people of Rome by the Roman Emperor Justin II, who reigned from 565 to 578, and his co-ruler and wife, the Empress Sophia. The cross bears a Latin inscription reading: ligno quo Christus humanum subdidit hostem dat Romae Iustinus opem et socia decorem which is commonly mistranslated as \\"For the wood [of the cross] with which human Christ was overcome by the enemy, Justin [and his consort?] give Rome this wealth and decoration\\"McClanan, 166 A more accurate reading is: \\"With the wood with which Christ conquered man's enemy, Justin gives his help to Rome and his wife offers the ornamentation.\\" To mark the end of restoration and conservation work on the cross, it was placed on display in the main Basilica of Saint Peter's from November 2009 to April 12, 2010. Description A different, and far humbler, small cross of gold foil, with rubbings of coins of Justin II and holes for nails or thread, Italian, 6th century The original portion of the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75 inches high and 11.81 inches wide, excluding the spike at the bottom for fitting into its stand. The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size. The front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped. The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and the edges of the arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as pendilia. The reverse side is decorated in repouss√© silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross. At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of Christ on the cross, making a crucifix, which had previously not been usual. The central medallion shows the Lamb of God, a common older formula. Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be John the Baptist instead). The upper one shows Christ holding a book,Vatican Museums representing the Gospels, which was to become a standard feature of the image of Christ Pantocrator; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture. At the ends of the arms, where the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia.McClanan, 167-8 Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.Illustrated Cotsonis, 58 Date In 569, Justin and Sophia together reportedly sent a relic of the True Cross to the Frankish princess Radegund, who founded a monastery at Poitiers to house it. The event was commemorated in Vexilla Regis by Venantius Fortunatus. They are also recorded as sending relics to Pope John III (reigned 561-574) in an attempt to improve relations ‚Äì the Crux Vaticana very likely dates from John's reign, perhaps around 568 or 569.McClanan, 167 Older scholars thought, mainly on the basis of imperial head-dress, that Justin I (r. 518-27) and his empress Euphemia were the donors, but this view seems now rejected.See J.

Sherman Elijah Bernis Sherman (June 18, 1832, Fairfield, Vermont ‚Äì May 1, 1910, Chicago, Illinois) was a prominent Chicago lawyer and jurist. Biography Sherman was the son of Elias Huntington Sherman and Clarissa Wilmarth. He worked on the family farm until 1855, when he enrolled in pre- college studies at the Brandon Seminary, and then Burr Seminary in Manchester, Vermont. He entered Middlebury College in 1856, graduating in 1860. Upon graduating from college, he went on to teach at Brandon and South Woodstock Seminaries. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, in May 1862, Sherman enlisted in the 9th Vermont Infantry. This regiment was captured at the September 1862 Battle of Harpers Ferry, a part of the Maryland Campaign. Following the capture of his regiment, the Union Army sent Sherman to Camp Douglas. Annoyed by this forced idleness, Sherman resigned his commission in January 1863 (he had attained the rank of lieutenant). Sherman now enrolled at the University of Chicago to study law. He graduated in 1864 and set up a law practice. In 1876, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. The next year, Shelby Moore Cullom, Governor of Illinois, appointed Sherman as judge advocate of the first brigade of the Illinois National Guard, a position he held for many years. He won re-election to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1878. In 1879, he was appointed master in chancery of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1882, he was elected president of the Illinois State Bar Association. He was also active in the activities of the American Bar Association. External links * Jacob G.

It corresponds to the international ISO 3864 standard. Sub-Standards The ANSI Z535 standard comprises the following six individual standards: * ANSI Z535.1 American National Standard for Safety Colors * ANSI Z535.2 American National Standard for Environmental and Facility Safety Signs * ANSI Z535.3 American National Standard for Criteria for Safety Symbols * ANSI Z535.4 American National Standard for Product Safety Signs and Labels * ANSI Z535.5 American National Standard for Safety Tags and Barricade Tapes (for Temporary Hazards) * ANSI Z535.6 American National Standard for Product Safety Information in Product Manuals, Instructions, and Other Collateral Materials Development The ANSI Z535 standards are administered and published by NEMA the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, an association of member companies that manufacture a diverse set of products including power transmission and distribution equipment, lighting systems, factory automation and control systems, and medical diagnostic imaging systems. NEMA is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. These standards have been developed and formulated by the ANSI Z535 committee, originally formed in 1979 and accredited by the American National Standards Institute. This committee is a highly active United States standards-making body that writes these standards to govern the characteristics of visual safety markings that are used to warn about hazards and prevent accidents. Gary Bell led this committee for more than two decades and, as of January 2012, the chairmanship is now held by Geoffrey Peckham, CEO of Clarion Safety Systems. The ANSI Z535 standard series is continually improved and refined based on human factors research and court case precedents. Every five years these standards are formally revised with the most recent publication in October 2017. Usage ANSI Z535-style communications are becoming more prevalent in society. Identified by their use of the signal words \\"DANGER\\", \\"WARNING\\", \\"CAUTION\\", \\"NOTICE\\", or \\"SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\\", ANSI-style signs most often include specific details about the nature of the hazard, the consequence of interaction with the hazard, and avoidance procedures. Product manufacturers and facility owners in a wide array of industries use the ANSI Z535 standards in their efforts to assure a safer workplace and the safe use of their products so both accidents and lawsuits are minimized. Safety colors provided by ANSI Z535 are harmonized with U.S. Federal Regulations, and include tolerances ranges to make them compatible with ISO 3864. However, ANSI safety colors are not exactly the same colors as used in U.S. Traffic Signs (prescribed by the MUTCD.)

The regiment was formed from the remnants of the Prince of Cond√©'s Army after it was disbanded in 1800. The regiment entered British service in 1800 and continued to fight for the United Kingdom until 1814, when it was disbanded after Napoleon's first abdication and exile to Elba. Origin of the Chasseurs Britanniques With the start of the French Revolution, French Royalist forces were raised to fight the French Revolutionary Armies. Mostly, these were made up of emigres returning to fight for the deposed monarch. Three small armies were formed. One of these, raised by the Prince of Conde, operated on the Upper Rhine.John R. Elting, Swords Around a Throne: Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e, p. xiv. Initially operating with the Austrians, the Army of Conde served under Russia before entering British service. In British service Initially, the Chasseurs were composed of French √©migr√©s. As the Napoleonic wars continued, the ranks of the Chasseurs were replenished mainly from deserters from the French Army.Chartrand, p.3 In British service, the Chasseurs Britanniques earned a reputation for fighting well in battle. However, they had an equal reputation for desertion, so much so that they could not be trusted to act as picquets when in camp.Elting, p. 506. In 1813 alone, the Chasseurs had 224 deserters from a total strength of approximately 1,740 men.Chartrand, pp.14-15. Within three years of joining Wellington's army, nearly half of the Chasseurs had deserted.Steve Brown, \\"Heroes and Villains: Death and Desertion in the British Army 1811 to 1813\\" After being accepted into British service, the royalists' first chance in battle as the Chasseurs Britanniques came in 1801 during the Egyptian Campaign. Under the command of Colonel John Ramsey, they took part in the Siege of Alexandria.Raymond Henry Raymond Smythies, Historical records of the 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment, (Devonport, A.H. Swiss, 1894) p. 92 Following the Egyptian campaign, the Chasseurs were withdrawn, first to Malta and then to the Isle of Wight. In 1803, while on the Isle of Wight, the Chasseurs Britanniques were brought back up to war-strength with another influx of emigres.Chartrand, p.14 From there, the Chasseurs were sent to Naples, before being withdrawn to Sicily with the rest of the British forces in 1806. The Chasseurs were assigned to Major General John Stuart's expedition to Italy in 1806. Although they were not present at the Battle of Maida, the Chasseurs took part in the capture of Reggio Calabria on 9 July 1806, where they were able to entice 300 French prisoners to join their ranks. In 1810, the Chasseurs Britanniques received orders to join Wellington's army in the Peninsula. Arriving in Lisbon in January 1811, the Chasseurs joined Wellington's command in March. They served in the 2nd Brigade of the Seventh Division.\\"Memoirs of Generals and Flag Officers Recently Deceased: The Late Lieutenant-General Sir Wm. Igliss, K.C.B.\\", in United Service Magazine, vol. 20, p. 239 As part of Wellington's Army, they saw action in many of the major engagements of Peninsular campaign from 1811 to 1814, including the battles of Fuentes de Onoro, Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca and Vitoria, as well as the fighting in the Pyrenees. The Chasseurs' final major battle was Orthez. They were then assigned to escort the Duke of Angoul√™me to Bordeaux, where they discovered that the city had turned Royalist and welcomed the Duke and his escort.Chartrand, p.15 While most of the Chasseurs served as line infantry under Wellington, a detachment of the Chasseurs Britanniques received orders to report to the ship of the line HMS Ramillies. The detachment was present aboard ship for the Battle of Fort McHenry, but does not appear to have been part of the landing which culminated in the Burning of Washington. With the end of hostilities after Napoleon's first abdication and exile to Elba, the Chasseurs Britanniques were withdrawn from France and brought back to Great Britain. The corps was disbanded on 5 October 1814. Uniform and traditions The Chasseurs Britanniques were originally uniformed in green coats with yellow facings, with grey trousers. Their equipment was all Russian in pattern as, prior to entering British service, the battalion had been in Russian service. The Chasseurs continued to wear this uniform until they were stationed on the Isle of Wight. There, the uniform was brought in line with the rest of the British Army. The green and yellow coats were replaced by red coats with light blue facings, and white trousers. Officers' uniforms included silver lace, while the other ranks had blue and white piping. The uniform was topped off with a black shako with a plume. Grenadier companies wore white plumes, while the light companies had a green plume. The officers wore bicorne hats.Chasseurs Britanniques As with many light infantry battalions, the Chasseurs had no colours.

Aruz says to Bayandur khan, \\"Let me raise up this strange boy.\\" Bayandur takes him in. Later it turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life. When the one eyed boy grows up he bites off a neighborhood child‚Äôs nose and ear. His father scorns him, driving him away from the village. Tepegoz kills one more man, and the khans of the Oghuz people decide to banish him forever. Years later, Tepegoz grows stronger and destroys everything in his path. Nobody is able to kill him. The sword can not cut him. The arrow can not kill him. Tepegoz's skin is very hard. Half of all Oghuz heroes die trying to kill Tepegoz. Just one man is able to kill him, his half blood brother Basat. He uses his brain more than his power. He killed horrible Tepegoz by striking his eye. Then he cut off Tepegoz's head with a magical sword and thus he saved not only himself but also his nation from the terror of Tepegoz. Tepegoz's ultimatum Dede Korkut comes to the rescue of the Oghuz people who were not able to kill Tepegoz. Dede Korkut goes to Tepegoz's cave and says, \\"Please don't hurt my people.\\" Tepegoz answers, \\"I will let your people live on one condition ‚Äì give me 60 people every day.\\" Dede Korkut doesn't agree and offers another idea, \\"We can give you 2 men and 500 sheep.\\" Tepegoz agrees, but soon the Oghuz run out of sheep, so Tepegoz declares war again on the Oghuz people. Common themes The warriors of the Oghuz and battles described are likely grounded in the conflicts between the Pechenegs and Kipchaks. The story elements bear resemblance to the encounter with the Cyclops in Homer's Odyssey and is believed May 2020}} to have been influenced by the Greek epic or to have one common ancestral root. The book also describes in great detail the various sports activities of the ancient Turkic peoples: \\"Dede Korkut (AD 1000‚Äì1300) clearly referred to certain physical activities and games. In Dede Korkut's description, the athletic skills of Turks, men and women, were described to be 'first-rate', especially in horse-riding, archery, javelin throw, wrestling and polo which are considered Turkish national sports.\\"Dr. Ergun Yurdadon, Chair of Recreation Management, United State Sports Academy, \\"Sport In Turkey: The Pre- Islamic Period\\", Volume 6, Number 3, Summer 2003 See also *List of one- eyed creatures in mythology and fiction *Polyphemus *Cyclops Notes Sources *\\"Kitabi Dede Qorqud\\" epos. 8'th chapter \\" Basat kills Tepegoz\\".

P. Lang 2003, p. 528 Biography Hans Henning Baron von Voight was born of German nobility in Karlsruhe. In his youth he joined a circus and learned mime Shortly after leaving school he studied philosophy at Marburg University where he met the writer Boris Pasternak. He was self-taught as an artist, and he was also a proficient dancer and pianist. He died in Munich in 1969. Art He is best known as an illustrator, under the nom de plume \\"Alastair\\". His career as an artist was launched in 1914, when John Lane published Forty-Three Drawings by Alastair. His drawings, which are often decadent in spirit and have the look of Art Nouveau, are influenced somewhat by the drawings of the English artist Aubrey Beardsley, who illustrated works by Oscar Wilde, as Alastair would later do. His ‚Äòserpentine line‚Äô often depicts characters whose outlines are lightly drawn with the main areas filled in with ‚Äòbroken dotted lines‚Äô. His drawings were in black and white ink, sometimes with one colour added. Alastair's illustrations show a strong influence from the Decadent movement in art and poetry that had begun decades earlier, with the \\"perverse and sinister\\" a recurring theme. Intricate decorative elements and fine detail are apparent in his works. Alastair‚Äôs fame spread in 1920 with the publication of Wilde's The Sphinx, which contained ten full-page illustrations by him, ‚Äòprinted in black and turquoise‚Äô. Many of his drawings were inspired by the poems of Wilde, and in 1922 Alastair would illustrate a book of Wilde‚Äôs play Salome. Other books containing Alastair's illustrations include: * The Blind Bow-Boy (1923) by Carl Van Vechten, * Fifty Drawings by Alastair (1925) * Red Skeletons by Harry Crosby (1928) (published by the Black Sun Press) * \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" by Edgar Allan Poe (1928 edition, published by the Black Sun Press) * Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos (1929) * Manon Lescaut Translated From The French Of Abb√© Prevost By D.

The designation is made under authority of US Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended by Executive Order 13268 of July 2, 2002, and Executive Order 13284 of January 23, 2003, and Title 31, Parts 595, 596, and 597 of the US Code of Federal Regulations, among other US laws and regulations. The main regulatory framework underlying the SDGT designation was established two weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001 by US President George W. Bush. SDGTs are entities and individuals who the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) finds have committed or pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism, or who OFAC finds provide support, services, or assistance to, or otherwise associate with, terrorists and terrorist organizations designated under OFAC Counter Terrorism Sanctions programs, as well as such persons' subsidiaries, front organizations, agents, or associates. They are designated under OFAC's programs. The designation SDGT is one of several types of designations of persons to whom one or more OFAC- administered sanctions apply; these include country-specific and counter narcotics trafficking, non-proliferation, and transnational criminal organization-related sanctions, and potentially under sanctions related to illicit trading in rough diamonds, although this had not been applied of early November 2011. OFAC publishes an integrated list of persons designated under its various sanctions programs that is known as the Specially Designated Nationals List, under which SDGT listings are included. Individuals and companies designated as \\"Specially Designated Nationals\\" are known as \\"SDNs\\". Most SDGT SDNs are foreign persons, but in at least one case‚Äîthat of the late Anwar al-Awlaki (also known by various aliases)‚Äîan American citizen was designated as an SDGT.

On July 18, 1949, the school was renamed Marikina High School since the full four-year secondary general course was offered. Then, on July 18, 1952, the name of the school was again changed to Leodegario Victorino Memorial High School in honor of Leodegario Victorino, the first Marikenian to become Division Superintendent of Schools in the province of Rizal. The school retained its name until its conversion into a National School of Arts and Trades on July 1, 1957 by virtue of Republic Act No. 1586 authored by Rep. Serafin Salvador, Second District of Rizal. The school was then named as Marikina School of Arts and Trades (MSAT). During the school year 1957‚Äì1958, the first year of the Four-Year Secondary Trade Curriculum was started and the first batch of graduates finished in March 1961. Beginning the school year 1960‚Äì1961, the Two-Year Trade Technical Education Curriculum was offered with specializations in Applied Electronics, Industrial Electricity, and Woodworking. It was during the school year 1961-1962 when the Evening Opportunity Classes were organized to offer vocational courses which were highly in demand for the industries. The areas of specialization offered were: Electronics, Electricity, Machine Shop Practice, and Dressmaking. In 1962, the SEATO Textile Training Center was put up to provide a pool of textile technicians for the growing textile industry. It offered a One-Year Course in Mill Maintenance and One-Year Special Mechanical Technology. In 1965, the Philippines-France Pilot Training Center for Electrical Trades was established as an additional curricular offering by virtue of Republic Act No. 4815, sponsored by Congressman Frisco San Juan. It provided a pool of electrical technicians for the electrical industry. In school year 1967‚Äì1968, the Four-Year Teacher Education Program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE) was offered. This was organized to provide the various high schools in the service area with qualified vocational teachers. In the same school year, the Student Services Division and the Research, Evaluation and Development Division were created as supportive divisions to the school. New projects were similarly provided for the service area, namely: Manpower Training Program, Special Training Scheme, School Industry Tie-Up and Placement Program for the graduates of the school. In Summer 1969, the Graduate Education Program was organized by the Bureau of Vocational Education. The initial graduate education courses were the Master of Education for vocational school administrators and supervisors and the Master of Arts in Teaching for vocational teachers and instructors of technology, Science and Mathematics. Upon the reorganization of the Department of Education and Culture in 1975, the MSAT Graduate Education Program was included under the Ministry of Education (MEC) Integrated Scholarship Program. On May 8, 1978, the name of the school was again changed to Marikina Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) by virtue of a Malaca√±ang approval. In November 1982, some key officials of MIST headed by Supt. Avelino Asuncion were involved in the conceptualization and implementation of the Technical Vocational Education Project (TVEP) of the Philippines. The school was chosen as the National Center for Technical Education and Staff Development (NCTESD) which was one of the components of the project. Aware of the fact that the success in the development of vocational technical education institutes depends largely on an adequate supply of teachers, the school has to perform this role because of its commendable and demonstrated capability and experience in the area of teacher education. In June 1983, the implementation of the technical vocational education project formally started with the try-out class for the Diploma in Industrial Technician (DIT). In July 1983, the Master of Technician Education (MTE) curriculum was offered with 78 scholars from the 23 Technical Education Institutes (TEIs) of the Philippines. These programs ushered in the full implementation of the other technical vocational education projects. In 1986, through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan and as component of the TVEP, three buildings were constructed, namely: the NCTESD Building, the Ylagan Hall and the Dormitory. In 1991, the Philippine-Australia Technical and Vocational Education Project (PATVEP) was implemented. Through the project, construction of the shop buildings for electrical, automotive technology and of the electronics and mechanical workshops were undertaken. In 1993, the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSE) was offered by virtue of DECS Order No. 3, s. 1993 with fields of specialization in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, English and the different technology areas. In 1994, the school became a recipient of a donation of some technology equipment from the Australian government through the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports and the PATVEP. In the same year, the school experienced some changes and transitions in terms of governance and management as a result of the reorganization of the education department as recommended by Education Committee of the House of Senate (EDCOM). In 1996, DECS transferred the institute's supervision to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) hence, MIST became a CHED-Supervised Institute (CSI). However, in 2000, MIST's supervision was transferred to the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in accordance with Special Provision No. 8 of the General Appropriation Act (GAA), FY 2000. The special provision included the phasing out of the baccalaureate degree programs, namely: the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education and the Bachelor of Secondary Education as well as the Laboratory High School and the Graduate Education Programs. The abolition of the degree programs caused clamor from the people of Marikina City and its neighboring town and cities for the re-opening of the degree courses. Having realized the educational needs of his constituents, Hon. Congressman Del R. De Guzman of Marikina City sponsored a bill converting the Institute into a State College which was supported by a counterpart bill in the Senate sponsored by Hon. Senator Edgardo Angara. The bill was finally approved and became a law as Republic Act No. 9289 on April 14, 2004, thus the birth of Marikina Polytechnic College. In May 2004, Mrs. Yolanda E. Olano, being the Superintendent of the then MIST was designated by the Board of Trustees as the Officer in Charge of the college. On December 1, 2004, Dr. Manuel R. Pangilinan was appointed as the first President of the college. In January 2007, Dr. Henry L. La√±ada was appointed as OIC-President by virtue of BOT Resolution No. 4 s 2007. His appointment was changed to Acting President on June 18, 2007 through BOT Resolution No. 65, s 2007. Dr. La√±ada assumed office as President of the College in November 2008 by virtue of Board Resolution No. 25, s.2008 after a national search for President of MPC was conducted. In 2009, through the leadership of Dr. La√±ada, the Doctorate program major in Educational Management and Industrial Education Management was offered by virtue of Board Resolution No. 11, s 2009 with an initial enrolment of 25 students. From 2009 to 2012, the highest percentage of enrolment was achieved by the college with an increase of 20% per school year. Also, the highest percentage of faculty scholarship grants and employee trainings and seminars for professional development was given. Dr.La√±ada was re-appointed for his second term as President of the College on Dec. 1, 2012 . During Dr. La√±ada's term, massive development in instruction and infrastructure were done like the construction of the Graduate School Bldg., the IICT Extension Bldg., renovation of Drawing Building, construction of a 3-storey Automotive Extension Bldg., Students Nook 1 and 2 and other repairs and renovations of old buildings. Acquisition of library holdings, equipment and facilities for technology and science has taken place every year. In December 2012, the College became a recipient of the project proposal to DOST NCR Project for ‚ÄúUpgrading of the Mechanical and Welding Technology. To date, the college offers both graduate and undergraduate courses. The graduate programs include doctorate and master's degree major in Educational Management as well as Math, Science, Physics, English and Technology courses. The undergraduate programs include Bachelor of Technical Teacher Education (BTTE) Program and Bachelor of Industrial Technology (BIT). The BTTE is a four-year degree ladderized program for future teachers of Automotive Technology, Drafting Technology, Electrical Technology, Electronics Technology and Food Service Management. BTTE major in Chemistry, Physics, English and Mathematics are also offered. The BIT program is also a ladderized four year degree program with the same specialization in Technology courses as that of BTTE. Graduates of this program are qualified to work in industries both as skilled workers and as supervisors. Further, the college offers a three-year non- degree program which is designed to prepare individuals for employment in the middle level of the manpower structure. Also, special programs which consist of short-term non-credit courses are offered designed for training of semi- skilled workers. The shoe and leathercraftcenter has also been continuously enhanced as one of the College mandate. On November 17, 2015, Dr. Virginia D. Bacay was designated as the OIC-President through CHED Special Order.

Curramulka is within easy driving distance of the coastal resort towns of Port Victoria and Port Vincent and is north-east of Minlaton. At the , Curramulka had a population of 305. Nearby is an extensive chain of limestone caves. They were first explored in 1850, and major extensions discovered in 1984. They have 14 km of known passages in an area of approximately 400m x 300m and depth 46m. Corra-Lynn is the longest cave in the region. History Curramulka is one of the oldest townships on the Peninsula, the Hundred of Curramulka being proclaimed on 31 December 1874. The name is derived from 'curre' (emu) and 'mulka' (deep water hole). Emus used to drink here, and thus it was named by the indigenous inhabitants. Farming land was first opened up in the mid-1870s and Curramulka enjoyed its heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when most farming produce moved through nearby Port Julia. The town's commercial importance dwindled when Ardrossan to the north became the main regional port for wheat and wool, but recent signs indicate that Curramulka is back in a strong growth mode.Curramulka, South Australia Local School The primary school located in Curramulka is in need of a few more students as its numbers are plummeting below the population count of just 50. Though the staff at Curramulka are happy with not having to account for many students, they also like having more company as they attend their current duties.
