Built in Bungalow/Craftsman style in 1909, it was added to the register in 1989. The building is a nearly intact example of the wooden commercial-residential buildings that were common in central southeast Portland in the early 20th century. Features include a hip roof, hip dormers, red brick chimneys, exaggerated eaves, and narrow lapped siding. Along the first-floor front of the building are three storefront bays. Two polygonal bays project from opposite ends of the front of the second floor, while two similar bays project from the north face of the second floor. Originally, the ground floor was meant to accommodate three storefronts, each with its own entrance, but the building was altered to allow a single business to use the combined space. The second floor was designed for residential apartments, which were entered through a separate entrance opening on a stairway leading to an upstairs lobby, access halls, and stairs to the attic. History After the construction of bridges over the Willamette River in the late 19th century and subsequent extension of trolley lines over the river, southeast Portland expanded rapidly. By World War I, dense neighborhoods had replaced the scattered housing and open farmland that had characterized the area in the 1880s. Mixed commercial and residential properties came to dominate the first 12 blocks east of the river. During this period, Henry Kuehle invested money from his successful carriage and automobile business in other ventures. These included construction of the Henry Kuehle Investment Property, which stayed in the Kuehle family until 1972. In 1910, Edward J. and Anna Gottsacker, renting from Kuehle, opened Gottsacker Grocery and Meats on the first floor and lived in one of the second-floor apartments. Moving to Oregon from Wisconsin in the 1880s, they operated a bakery and candy store elsewhere in the city before starting the grocery. The Gottsacker family ran the store for more than 30 years.

The song was written by Lovato and former lead singer of The Academy Is..., William Beckett, while production was helmed by Toby Gad. The song was originally indended in Lovato's second studio album Here We Go Again (2009), but was deemed too intense for her young audience at the time. \\"For the Love of a Daughter\\" received extreme critical acclaim from music critics, praising heavily on its lyrical content and Lovato's sincerity and vulnerability in her vocals. The song addresses Lovato's strained relationship with her father. Background \\"For the Love of a Daughter\\" was composed by Demi Lovato and William Beckett, the lead singer for the American recording group, The Academy Is.... The song was recorded at Kite Studios in Los Angeles, California. It was produced, mixed and programmed by Toby Gad, who also provided the song's instrumentation. It was originally recorded as a pop rock song and intended to appear in Lovato's second album, Here We Go Again, released in 2009. Although not planning to write a personal song, a \\"really long talk\\" with Beckett resulted in the song being written. However, Lovato and her management felt that the song's subject would be too much for her young audience. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Lovato explained: \\"When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year- old and their mom.\\" Several other \\"emotional\\" songs were also put on hold. The song was later rewritten and appeared in Lovato's third studio album Unbroken, was released on September 20, 2011, just months after Lovato announced her departure from the Disney Channel series Sonny with a Chance. Composition The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who she rarely saw after her parents divorced when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to \\"put the bottle down\\" and questions him: \\"How could you push me out of your world, lie to your flesh and your blood, put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved?\\" Indicative in the lyrics \\"It's been five years since we've spoken last / And you can't take back what we never had\\" is distance that has added to the strained relationship with her father. An author from Sputnikmusic interpreted it as a song about her relationship with her alcoholic father who didn't seem to see her as a good enough reason to stop drinking and be there for her when she needed him. Critical reception Embrace You Magazine commented that song as \\"definitely pulsating; it holds me tighter than 'Skyscraper' and enlightens me further about the girl behind the music.\\" Chris Williams for Reuters praised the song as \\"a moving, vulnerable, angry screed taking aim at the dad from whom she's been long estranged.\\" Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk noted it as the best track on the album and commented on Lovato's vocals and the song's lyrics, noting that the two make \\"for the most enrapturing song of hers to date, and displays the true endeavors of what Unbroken is all about ‚Äî to overcome any obstacle and escape a better person.\\" An author from Sputnikmusic noted it as one of the album's highlights, commenting that Lovato ‚Äúsings with so much sincerity and passion that she really gives the song life and meaning.

The movie was directed by Tay Garnett and was the first film for which Power had top billing. The picture was remade in 1947 as That Wonderful Urge, with Power again and Gene Tierney. Plot Stephen \\"Steve\\" Leyton (Tyrone Power) is a prying newspaper reporter who works for Martin Canavan (Don Ameche), and he goes after the rich heiress, Tony Gateson (Loretta Young), to get an exclusive story with her. Annoyed with the articles he has published, and the way Steve has labelled her a \\"Tin Can Countess\\", Tony turns on him and announces to the press that they are engaged to each other. All this time, she has an actual fianc√©, Count Andre de Guyon (George Sanders). Steve, thinking that he has a scoop on his hands, calls up Canavan and dictates a story for him to write, but the news that Tony is engaged to Steve upsets the story, and Canavan is angry at Steve, and as a result, fires him. Now finding himself hounded by reporters and hustlers trying to sell their stuff, Steve is at first outraged at Tony and tries to refute the story, but the press does not believe him. Desperate, Steve begs Tony to call off the act, but she refuses, saying that he should experience how it is like to have his every move watched. Steve chases after her, and Tony's speeding car catches the attention of a police officer. She is arrested and taken to Judge Hart (Slim Summerville), and Steve purposely irritates the judge, convincing him to give Tony a 30-day sentence. Tony tricks Steve by telling him to get her vanity case from the car, and then accusing him of theft. As a result, Steve gets thrown in jail along with Tony. The story catches the attention of the press and Tony's uncle, and Judge Hart is forced to let her go. Before she leaves, Tony pays Steve's fine, and as a result, he is released as well, much against his will. On the way back, Tony teases Steve and offers him a lift, but he refuses, and Tony fakes a car crash and pretends to be unconscious. Steve picks her up, and throws her into a puddle of mud. By this time, Steve is trying to get his job back, and Tony persuades her uncle to do something about the mess between Steve and Count Andre, who has arrived in New York. Tony's uncle buys a share in the company, and Steve is made editor. Count Andre, having been jilted by Tony, offers to sell their love letters to Steve. Steve buys them, and Tony is upset when she finds out. Steve walks out from the office when he finds out that he was made editor because of Tony's uncle, and tells the group that has gathered in his office that he put the love letters in the safe. Tony finds a note written by Steve, saying that he destroyed the letters, and she runs after him, finally persuading him that she loves him, and the two kiss in a store, to a cheering crowd watching through the window.

It wasn't until it gained airplay as a radio news signature tune that it finally made its way to No.2 on the US Billboard charts. The LP was recorded at Joe Boles' home studio in Seattle, Washington, as was their second album, titled The Ventures. His was a local studio where other early Dolton artists also recorded. Released on Liberty's Dolton subsidiary in December 1960, Walk, Don't Run became a big seller, peaking at #11 on Billboard and earning a gold record for The Ventures (their first of three) for over 500,000 copies sold. Cover The Ventures were on one of their first tours as Liberty Records began compiling their first album and were still on the road by the time of the front cover photo shoot. As a result, four employees from Liberty's stockroom (with two wearing sunglasses) were posed as if they were falling or tripping over instruments with model Barbara Grimes walking in front of them. A photo of the actual Ventures was originally featured on the back cover, but to avoid possible confusion when compared to the \\"stand-ins\\" on the front cover, it was replaced with an outline-drawn version of the same photo.Walk Don't Run - The Story of The Ventures, 2nd ed. 2009, by Del Halterman (US), Lulu Press. In 1969, the album was reissued by Liberty (having discontinued the Dolton label two years earlier but keeping the original stereo catalog number), featuring an updated photo of the group. By that time, the lineup consisted of Don Wilson, Bob Bogle, Gerry McGee, Mel Taylor and John Durrill, though only the former two appear on the album.

On Robert's return from the Crusade he married Sibylla in ApuliaFran√ßois Neveux, The Normans, Trans. Howard Curtis (London: Constable & Robinson, Ltd., 2008), p. 174 in 1100. Shortly after returning to Normandy, Robert and Sibylla undertook a pilgrimage to Mont Saint-Michel to give thanks for his safe return from the Crusade.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Trans. Thomas Forester, Vol. III (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 272 It is clear that writers of the time were quite taken with Sibylla, praising both her beauty and intelligence.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale University Press, New Haven & London, 2003), p. 180 During Curthose's absence, Robert of Torigni noted that the new duchess administered Normandy better than the duke did. On 25 October 1102, their son was born.William M. Aird, Robert Curthose Duke of Normandy (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), p. 212 He was named William for William, Archbishop of Rouen who presided over his baptism, this according to Orderic. William of Malmesbury suggested he was named after his grandfather, William the Conqueror. On 18 March 1103,William M. Aird, Robert Curthose Duke of Normandy (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), p. 213 less than six months after the birth of her only child, she died at Rouen, Caux, and was buried, amid universal sorrow, in the cathedral church, Archbishop William Bonne-Ame performing the funeral rites. Sibylla was admired and often praised by chroniclers of the time; William of Malmesbury claims she died as a result of binding her breasts too tightly while both Robert of Torigny and Orderic Vitalis suggest she was murdered by a group of noblewomen led by her husband's mistress, Agnes de Ribemont.Agnes de Ribemont was the widow of Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham, and the sister of Anselm de Ribemont, who had died on crusade. It remains unclear if or when she and Robert even had an affair, but the story goes that she promised that if he would marry her he'd have the support of her powerful family. William of Malmsebury loved a good story, even if untrue; and in one version of his Gesta Regum, he credits Sibylla's death to Robert's \\"mistress\\", and in a later version he stated \\"mid-wife\\". However plausible it may have been that she was Robert's mistress, it remains less than plausible that Robert allowed his new wife, the mother of his infant son, to be poisoned while he sat idly by. Orderic may have seen such a story as further evidence Robert Curthose was unfit to rule Normandy. See: William M. Aird, Robert Curthose Duke of Normandy (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), pp. 213-14. The mysterious story also has a chronological problem in that Agnes de Ribemont may not even have been a widow at the time of Sibylla's death. See: Charles Wendell David, Robert Curthose (1920) pp. 146-7.

The basic premise is to lift concrete and to then fill the resultant void absolutely with compacted sand. Sandjacking includes the careful assessment of what is required to restore concrete to its original profile and the intelligent application of different materials to keep it that way. The filling provides the long term repair and protection of any flat concrete surface. Since the lifting and filling processes are distinctly separate events, each can be accomplished precisely. Overview The lifting process can utilize many different techniques, depending upon situational variables. The filling process uses compressed air to blow dry sand into any existing voids. The sand travels through hoses and nozzles to the void and deposits continuously. The sand travels wherever the air goes. It gradually loses momentum and deposits, nestling in with other grains of sand at 99-100% density (Midwest Testing). The filling can be performed from the surface of the slab or from the side of the slab if available. Separating the fill process from the lifting process is crucial in this system. After the void is filled with sand, the lift occurs. The concrete is lifted about ¬Ω - ¬æ inches and the filling process resumes. When the void is full the process starts again with the lift and repeating the iterations as many times as is necessary. The benefit of sandjacking is the control of moisture. There are more voids under concrete than the average person would presume. Any void will acquire moisture, subjecting the slab to endless wet-dry cycles (freeze-thaw in colder climates). If the voids are full of sand, water can't accumulate in sufficient quantity to be destructive. Moisture in the lifting process is also undesirable; the only way to reduce it is to reduce the quantity of lifting material. It's important to fill first, then lift creating a new void which is then filled with sand through the same hole. Since dry material will blow greater distances the holes required are few. Another benefit of the process is no point loading and the entire lift is gentle on the slab.

The tree has a height of about 19 metres and a crown diameter of about 17 metres. The girth of the trunk at a height of 1.30 metres is 10.80 metres. From 1782, following a senate resolution, priests were buried beneath the lime tree rather than being interred in front of the altar as had hitherto been the case.

Films from the wave won a plethora of international recognition, including a Golden Bear, Silver Bear for Best Director, Cannes Grand Prix, six nominations for Cannes Palme d'Or and four nominations for Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, with success continuing through directors emerging from the wave, including two Palme d'Or awards in 1980s and 1990s. Today, several of the films are considered classics of world cinema and were released as part of influential collections such as Criterion Collection in the United States. History In the early 1960s Yugoslavia produced more films than ever before. Exports soared during this period of intense creativity and experimentation. The film makers were linked by a common wish to increase the freedom of artistic expression, and to reform the cinematic language. The filmmakers wanted the right to show the darker side of the human psyche and to openly criticize the policy of the socialist state. This stream gained international attention as well as provoking strong controversies within Yugoslavia. The liberalization of the film form and expression reached its apex in 1967‚Äì 1968. In the following years, the counter-offence against the new movement intensified. Black films were attacked for their pessimistic view on the Yugoslav socialist development and liberalism in general, as well as their valorization of anarchistic and individualistic tendencies in the society. The attacks on the movement was can be seen as a natural result of the broader political developments at the time. Eventually it led to the banning of selected films and some directors were forced to leave the country. Notable individuals and movies Aleksandar \\"Sa≈°a\\" Petroviƒá was one of the major figures of the Yugoslav Black Wave. He made the movement well known in Yugoslavia and abroad. Two of his works were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: Three in 1966 and I Even Met Happy Gypsies (Feather Gatherers) in 1967. ≈Ωelimir ≈Ωilnik's Early Works (1969) showed the main tendencies of the Yugoslav Black Wave: nonordinary forms, polemical methods, socio-critical concerns, oppositional ideology and a fatalistic final.DeCuir, G (2008). Old School Capitalism: An Interview with Zelimir Zilnik. Cineaste Publishers At the same time, it prompted the writer and journalist Vladimir Joviƒçiƒá (who insisted on the position of the traditional communist party line) to write an article \\"The Black Wave in Our Cinema\\" (Crni talas u na≈°em filmu), published in Borba on August 3, 1969, which coined the very term ‚ÄúBlack Wave‚Äù. The official counterattack against the Yugoslav Black Wave began with this film and this article. Du≈°an Makavejev is considered the leader of the Black Wave filmmakers.Sterritt, D (2007). Sweet Movie: Wake Up!. The Criterion Collection His most successful film was the 1971 political satire WR: Mysteries of the Organism, which he directed and wrote. The film was banned, and Makavejev fled the country, not working there again until 1988. He made Sweet Movie in Canada, the Netherlands, and France. It is banned in various countries to this day. Although the best directors and movies of the black wave were Serbian, The Croatian Cinema was also a party to this process. The most important black wave classic from Croatia is Handcuffs (Lisice, 1969, by Krsto Papiƒá), first art product showing secrets of the breakup between Josip Broz Tito and Joseph Stalin in 1948.

It is the first novel in the \\"Sea Venture Trilogy\\", and was followed by The Observers (1988) and A Reasonable World (1991). The name of the novel derives from \\"The Sea Venture\\" (\\"CV\\" for short), an enormous, ocean-going habitat. During one of its first trips, the Sea Venture takes on a parasite, an alien symbiont that can pass from one person to another, leaving them changed in subtle but consequential ways. The symbiont enforces something like rational behavior upon its victims, causing them to question their earlier beliefs and practices. At the end of the novel, the parasite is brought to the mainland; the subsequent novels in the trilogy explore the consequences as it begins to affect a large part of the human population. Synopsis The Sea Venture (CV) is an enormous, largely self-contained floating vessel that serves as a prototype sea habitat. It was developed in part as an alternative to a more expensive orbital colony; one of the advocates of the space habitats, professor Paul Newland, is aboard to discover whether CV poses a threat to his dreams. Another passenger, an assassin who uses the name of John Stevens, has been tasked with killing Newland. The CV has no propulsion system; it navigates using ocean currents, and it is able to submerge in order to take advantage of the different currents at different levels below the surface. In addition to its crew, the CV carries about two thousand permanent residents as well as passengers. The novel opens as the Sea Venture is preparing to debark from San Francisco on its way to Guam. Soon after, a routine sample collection from the ocean floor pulls in a purplish, granular lump about the size of a fist; Newland, who is present in the collection room with a crew member named Randall Geller, suggests cracking it open. It contains what looks like a hollow sphere of glass. Just as it is opened, Geller feels faint, then recovers. Soon after, he collapses into a coma-like state. The same series of events occurs again and again; it soon becomes clear that the agent released from the nodule can travel from person to person, leaving them in an unconscious state after it departs. Soon there are dozens of afflicted patients. The sole doctor on board, Dr. Wallace McNulty, improvises an isolation ward, but cases keep occurring, several per day. On the tenth day, the first patient, Geller, recovers, and soon it becomes clear that the coma is temporary. There are no ill effects, but the recovered patients have been changed in subtle ways: they discard many of their past, irrational beliefs and fears, and in many cases change their way of life. For instance, crew members decide that their jobs are pointless and abandon them; married people leave their spouses. Knight reveals to us a little of the thought processes of the symbiont: it appears to have been in suspended animation for millennia, and it is now trying to learn about humans by temporarily gaining access to their thought processes and their impressions. Knight suggests that the changes made by the parasites in human brains are a benefit; hence the parasite is actually a symbiont. McNulty and the captain try a number of schemes for isolating the parasite, but without success. In the end, it escapes onto land after having infected the unborn child of one of the passengers. Significance This novel, and the others in the Sea Venture trilogy, have been described as \\"utopian literature\\".The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction The modifications wrought by the (apparently) moralistic symbionts echo the theme of Knight's earlier stories: \\"Rule Golden\\", \\"Natural State\\", and \\"The Dying Man\\", in which artificially increased empathy makes it impossible for people to be cruel without suffering the victim's pain. Publication history The novel was first published, in three parts, in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, in January, February and March 1985.

Detert (born October 22, 1944) is a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Florida who has served as a Sarasota County Commissioner since 2016. Previously, she represented parts of Sarasota and Charlotte Counties in the Florida Senate, from 2008 to 2016, and served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives, from 1998 to 2006. History Detert was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1944 and attended Siena Heights University, though she did not graduate, and moved to Florida in 1978. She is a descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1983, Detert founded the Osprey Mortgage Company, where she worked as the President until 2007. She was elected to the Sarasota County School Board, serving as a member until 1992, when she was defeated for re- election by Caroline Zucker. Florida House of Representatives In 1998, when incumbent State Representative Lisa Carlton retired from her seat to run for the Florida Senate, Detert ran to succeed her in the 70th District, which was based in Venice, where she lived. She was opposed in the Republican primary by Rick Louis, Brian O'Connell, and Donna Clarke, and though she placed first with a plurality of 33%, she was forced to face second-place finisher Rick Louis in a runoff election. Detert campaigned as a moderate and on her experience, noting, \\"Rick and I make a very nice primary. There are three major differences--I have experience, he doesn't; I'm pro-choice, he's pro-life; on vouchers, he supports them, I oppose them.\\" Detert ended up defeating Louis by a wide margin, winning the nomination of her party with 59% of the vote to Louis's 41%. Advancing to the general election, she faced Alan Miller Kunerth, the Democratic nominee, and was endorsed by the Sarasota Classified Teachers Association, the AFL-CIO, and Associated Industries of Florida, and she said that the fact that she received endorsements from groups that regularly opposed each other \\"[demonstrated] her willingness to work with anybody in an effort to serve her potential constituents.\\" Ultimately, Kunerth did not pose a significant challenge to Detert, and she defeated him in a landslide, winning 70% of the vote to his 30%. Running for re-election in 2000, Detert faced Tim Wizba, the Democratic nominee, who did not campaign during the election due to child-care problems. She noted, however, that despite Wizba's inactivity, his candidacy pushed her to get to know her constituents better, saying, \\"I would have rather played golf. But since I had an opponent, I was invited to all of the candidate forums, which gave me a chance to speak to people, hear their concerns and give them a legislative update.\\" Indeed, Wizba did not pose a significant challenge to her, and she defeated him in a landslide, winning re-election with 72% of the vote. In 2002, Detert did not face a major party opponent and was opposed only by Sandy Primack, the Libertarian nominee and a software developer who lived in Volusia County. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune strongly endorsed her for re-election, noting that she \\"seems molded for the times\\" and \\"has been both an initiator of ideas and a compromiser on a broad array of issues.\\" She ended up dispatching Primack with ease, scoring 82% of the vote to Primack's 18%. When she ran for re-election to her fourth and final term in 2004, she did not face major opposition once again, and defeated Libertarian nominee Don Wallace in a landslide, with 79% of the vote. 2006 congressional campaign In 2006, when Detert could not seek another term in the legislature due to term limits, she instead opted to run for Congress in the 13th District, which was being vacated by Katherine Harris, who was running for the United States Senate instead of seeking re-election. Detert faced businessman Vern Buchanan, businessman Tramm Hudson, former State Representative Mark G. Flanagan and fellow State Representative Donna Clarke in the Republican primary, and she initially took a back seat in the election while Buchanan and Hudson attacked each other. Buchanan's largesse enabled him to donate more than $2 million to his campaign, more than any other congressional candidate during the cycle, with Detert sarcastically asking, \\"Wouldn't it have been cheaper just to pay us all to drop out?\\" As the campaign heated up, Buchanan took aim at Detert and mailed out an attack advertisement criticizing her for being \\"soft\\" on illegal immigration, though she condemned the advertisement as a distortion of her views. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune endorsed Detert over her opponents, saying, that she has a \\"solid record of effective, principled legislative experience\\" and \\"a political philosophy unencumbered by dogma.\\" Ultimately, Detert fell to Buchanan, receiving 24% of the vote to his 32%. Following the contentious primary, Detert initially declined to publicly announce their support for Buchanan's campaign, but after some \\"soul searching\\" and pressure from then-Governor Jeb Bush, she decided to support his candidacy, although he was not her first choice, because she felt that Democrats regaining control of Congress would result in \\"total government gridlock.\\" Florida Senate When State Senator Lisa Carlton was unable to seek another term due to term limits, Detert ran to succeed her in the 23rd District, which included western Charlotte County, a small segment of Manatee County, and most of Sarasota County. She faced State Representative Michael J. Grant in the Republican primary, and received the endorsements of Carlton and State Senate President Ken Pruitt, while Grant was endorsed by then-Governor Charlie Crist and State Senator Michael S. Bennett. Detert campaigned on her experience and her knowledge of the district, observing, \\"I know Sarasota County, and I know state government. I know what Sarasota County residents care about, and I think I'm the best candidate to represent them.\\" She also received the endorsement of the Herald-Tribune once again, which declared, \\"Detert is pragmatic. In the complicated world of the Legislature, she didn't look for glory or ideological victories. She went for moderate strategies that got things done. With that approach, she won multiple legislator-of-the-year awards and chaired important committees.\\" Although she was outspent significantly by Grant, she was able to narrowly win the primary with 52% of the vote to Grant's 48%, remarking, \\"I get credit for time served and commitment to my community. That's the old-fashioned way.\\" Advancing to the general election, she was opposed by Morgan Bentley, the Democratic nominee and an attorney. The two embarked on a contentious and oftentimes vicious campaign, with the Republican Party of Florida running television advertisements attacking Bentley for representing insurance companies as an attorney, which Detert condemned, and the Florida Democratic Party and Bentley attacking Detert for voting for legislation that raised insurance rates by 70%. In the end, Detert ended up defeating Bentley by a wide margin, winning her first term in the Senate with 58% of the vote to Bentley's 42%. When Florida Senate districts were redrawn in 2012, Detert opted to run for a second term in the 28th District, which included most of her previous district's territory. She was re-elected unopposed, both in the primary and the general election. While serving in the Senate, Detert strongly opposed controversial legislation referred to as the \\"parent trigger\\" bill, whereby parents could \\"turn traditional public schools that are failing into charter schools,\\" noting that she had \\"not heard from one parent who supports this bill.\\" She sponsored legislation that would \\"allow children in foster care to remain in the system until they are 21,\\" as there were instances in which high school students who had turned eighteen were left on their own. Detert also sponsored legislation that would ban texting while driving, but allowed it when drivers were in stationary cars, and was further weakened by the House of Representatives to say that \\"law enforcement could not look at a driver's cellphone to seek evidence of texting unless there was an accident with injuries or death.\\"  Sarasota County Commission  In 2016, Detert was term- limited in the Senate and decided to run for an open Sarasota County Commission seat. She was elected without opposition.

From Marjorie H. Morgan, Caribbean Britain: The Cultural and Biographical Directory, 2013. He joined his mother in London in March 1955, shortly before his 15th birthday, living at a house on the Caledonian Road. Too young to work, he was assessed as educationally subnormal at his first school, and he was sent to Shelborne Road Secondary Modern. His cricketing skill gained him a place on the London Schools' cricket team, and a place at a Highbury Grammar School. After leaving school in 1958 with six O-levels and two A-levels, in botany and zoology, he found a job as a junior lab technician at Queen Elizabeth College, London University, working for Professor Garth Chapman. He gained further qualifications studying one day a week at a local polytechnic. In 1961 Palmer went to the University of Leicester earning a degree (2:2) in botany in 1964. He sought post-graduate work, and applied to study for an MSc at the University of Nottingham, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture. Academic work After an interview with Professor Anna Macleod, he secured a place to study for a PhD in grain science and technology jointly with Heriot-Watt College and the University of Edinburgh, beginning his doctorate in 1965. After completing his PhD thesis entitled Ultra-structure of cereal grains in relation to germination in 1967, he began his research work at the Brewing Research Foundation in Surrey in 1968, where he worked on the science and technology of barley.\\"Geoff PALMER, Grain Scientist\\" , Penicuik Greats.

He received a Doctorate of Science in 1985, and was offered a personal chair at Heriot-Watt in 1989 after Macleod had retired. Palmer specialises in grain science and has extensive expertise with barley, sorghum, other cereals and malt, having written a textbook on the subject entitled Cereal Science and Technology. He investigated the processes that turn barley into malt, and he invented the barley abrasion process while at the Brewing Research Foundation. At Heriot- Watt, he and his students worked on brewing using sorghum. He recently developed a new simple method to detect pre-germination in cereal grains showing difference in amylase actions of individual grains of a barley sample containing different degrees of pre-germination, with results that can be expressed in optical density (example image). In the journal International Brewer and Distiller, it was reported that Palmer had \\"requested samples of pre-germinated grain as he is developing a new amylase test which will look at the distribution of the enzyme across individual grains in a sample. A small number of grains, with high amylase/pre-germination activity, can cause unexpected storage or processing problems and visual or average analyses do not always identify uneven distribution.\\"International Brewer and Distiller, 8:8 (August 2012), 5.

Prior to this decision, there was no general principle of patent law, and no direct authority, for the proposition that a new use of an old compound can be claimed as a patentable invention. Furthermore, the decision is a leading case on the test for patentable \\"art\\". Background Shell Oil discovered that compounds having a specific chemical structure have useful properties in respect of the regulation of the growth of plants. Some of the chemical compositions it identified were new, while others were old. Shell Oil initially sought a patent on the chemical compositions themselves, but later it withdrew its claims for those. It instead sought to claim the chemical compositions in terms of their utility. In its submissions to the Supreme Court, Shell Oil took the position that the invention was not in the substances themselves, but in the discovery of a new use for these known chemical compositions, namely as plant growth regulators. The issue before the Court was whether such a discovery is a patentable invention. Reasons of the Court The definition of ‚Äúinvention‚Äù in section 2 of the Patent Act includes \\"any new and useful art\\". In determining whether Shell Oil's discovery is a patentable \\"art\\", Justice Wilson, for the Court, stated: > What then is the ‚Äúinvention‚Äù under s. 2? I believe it is the application of > this new knowledge to effect a desired result which has an undisputed > commercial value and that it falls within the words ‚Äúany new and useful > art‚Äù. I think the word ‚Äúart‚Äù in the context of the definition must be given > its general connotation of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù or ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù as commonly used in > expressions such as ‚Äúthe state of the art‚Äù or ‚Äúthe prior art‚Äù. [Shell Oil]‚Äôs > discovery in this case has added to the cumulative wisdom on the subject of > these compounds by a recognition of their hitherto unrecognized properties > and it has established the method whereby these properties may be realized > through practical application. In my view, this constitutes a ‚Äúnew and > useful art‚Äù and the compositions are the practical embodiment of the new > knowledge. After defining the term ‚Äúart‚Äù broadly as requiring the practical application of new knowledge to effect a desired result which has an undisputed commercial value, the Court concluded that the discovery of a new use of an old compound, in this case the newly discovered means of regulating the growth of plants, is accordingly a ‚Äúnew and useful art‚Äù. Consequently, the Court referred the matter back to the Commissioner of Patents for the issue of a patent. Definition of \\"art\\" In view of the above, the definition of the term \\"art\\" as articulated by Justice Wilson for the Supreme Court is generally cited as including a process that:Progressive Games, Inc. v.

He is in the $10 million reward category in the U.S. Rewards for Justice Program. Biography The U.S. State Department says that Khalil is a Syrian national, born in the city of Qamishli in 1982. He also has used other aliases such as Yaseen al-Suri, Izz al-Din Abd al-Farid Khalil and Zayn al-Abadin. Al-Qaeda activities The U.S. government first connected Khalil to al-Qaeda when it sanctioned him as the alleged leader of an al-Qaeda fundraising and logistics network in Iran on 28 July 2011. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, Khalil has lived and operated in Iran since 2005 under agreement between al-Qaeda and the Iranian government. In his role as al-Qaeda's representative in Iran, Khalil works with the organization's senior leaders to transfer money and recruits via Iranian territory to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Khalil reportedly tasks new operatives with delivering $10,000 to al-Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan. The al-Qaeda facilitator also allegedly works with the Iranian government to release al-Qaeda members from Iranian prisons and then facilitate their travel to Pakistan. The Wall Street Journal said that the U.S. government's announcement of the Iran-based al-Qaeda network was the first time the U.S. had \\"formally accused Iran of forging an alliance with al Qaeda.\\" On 22 December 2011, the U.S. State Department further announced that as part of its Rewards for Justice Program, it is offering up to a $10 million reward for information on the location of Khalil. Khalil is only one of three designated terrorists in the Rewards for Justice $10 million reward bracket along with Taliban head Mullah Omar and al-Qaeda in Iraq chief Abu Dua. Only al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri fetches a higher reward at a $25 million maximum. It also marked the first time that Rewards for Justice offered a reward for information leading to a terrorist financier. At the briefing announcing the reward for information leading to Khalil, Robert Hartung, Assistant Director for the Threat Investigations and Analysis of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, stated, \\"As a key fundraiser for the al- Qaida terrorist network, he is a continuing danger to the interest of the United States, to its facility, and its citizens. Locating al-Suri and shutting down his operations would eliminate a significant financial resource for al-Qaida.\\" The Iranian government has rejected as \\"completely baseless\\" the charges that Khalil is present in Iran and operating within the country.

The Mount Royal Funicular Railway, also known as the Mountain Park Funicular Railway and the Mount Royal Elevator, was a funicular railway serving Mount Royal Park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from 1884 to 1918. The railway consisted of a horizontal section that brought travellers from the ticket house, located near what is now the George-√âtienne Cartier Monument, to a transfer station at the base of the mountain, where riders boarded the funicular cars. Both sections were steam-driven, with cars pulled by cables. The funicular was inaugurated in 1884, a year before its official opening. Rides initially cost 5 cents for adults and 3 cents for children. It transported visitors to the summit of Mount Royal, facing east. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Mount Royal Park, was opposed to the funicular. His plan was for people to take a leisurely stroll up the mountain and to enjoy the views along the way instead of being whisked straight to the top by a machine. It was declared structurally unsafe and closed in 1918, and dismantled in 1920.

In mechanics, a variable-mass system is a collection of matter whose mass varies with time. It can be confusing to try to apply Newton's second law of motion directly to such a system. Instead, the time dependence of the mass m can be calculated by rearranging Newton's second law and adding a term to account for the momentum carried by mass entering or leaving the system. The general equation of variable-mass motion is written as :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m {\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf v \\\\over \\\\mathrm{d}t} where Fext is the net external force on the body, vrel is the relative velocity of the escaping or incoming mass with respect to the center of mass of the body, and v is the velocity of the body. In astrodynamics, which deals with the mechanics of rockets, the term vrel is often called the effective exhaust velocity and denoted ve.  Derivation  There are different derivations for the variable- mass system motion equation, depending on whether the mass is entering or leaving a body (in other words, whether the moving body's mass is increasing or decreasing, respectively). To simplify calculations, all bodies are considered as particles. It is also assumed that the mass is unable to apply external forces on the body outside of accretion/ablation events.  Mass accretion  At instant 1, a mass dm with relative velocity u is about to collide with the main body of mass m and velocity v. After a time dt, at instant 2, both particles move as one body with velocity v + dv. The following derivation is for a body that is gaining mass (accretion). A body of time- varying mass m moves at a velocity v at an initial time t. In the same instant, a particle of mass dm moves with velocity u. The initial momentum can be written as :\\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{1}} = m\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathrm{d}m Now at a time t + dt, let both the main body and the particle accrete into a body of velocity v + dv. Thus the new momentum of the system can be written as :\\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{2}} = (m + \\\\mathrm{d}m)(\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}) = m\\\\mathbf{v} + m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathrm{d}m + \\\\mathrm{d}m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} Since dmdv is the product of two small values, it can be ignored, meaning during dt the momentum of the system varies for :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{2}} - \\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{1}} = (m\\\\mathbf{v} + m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathrm{d}m) - (m\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathrm{d}m) = m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - (\\\\mathbf{u} - \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\mathrm{d}m Therefore, by Newton's second law :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac{m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - (\\\\mathbf{u} - \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - (\\\\mathbf{u} - \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} Noting that u - v is the velocity of dm relative to m, symbolized as vrel, this final equation can be arranged as :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m {\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf v \\\\over \\\\mathrm{d}t}  Mass ablation/ejection  In a system where mass is being ejected or ablated from a main body, the derivation is slightly different. At time t, let a mass m travel at a velocity v, meaning the initial momentum of the system is :\\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{1}} = m\\\\mathbf{v} Assuming u to be the velocity of the ablated mass dm with respect to the ground, at a time t + dt the momentum of the system becomes :\\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{2}} = (m - \\\\mathrm{d}m)(\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}) + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathrm{d}m = m\\\\mathbf{v} + m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathrm{d}m - \\\\mathrm{d}m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathrm{d}m where u is the velocity of the ejected mass with respect to ground. Thus during dt the momentum of the system varies for :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{2}} - \\\\mathbf{p}_{\\\\mathrm{1}} = (m\\\\mathbf{v} + m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} -\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathrm{d}m + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathrm{d}m) - (m\\\\mathbf{v}) = m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - (\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{u} )\\\\mathrm{d}m relative velocity vrel of the mass with respect to the ablated mass is written as :\\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}} = (\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}) - (\\\\mathbf{u}) = \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{u} Therefore change in momentum can be written as :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} = m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\mathrm{d}m Therefore, by Newton's second law :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac{m\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} - \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} Therefore the final equation can be arranged as :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m {\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf v \\\\over \\\\mathrm{d}t}  Forms  balloon ejects a significant amount of its mass as air, causing a large acceleration. By the definition of acceleration, a = dv/dt, so the variable-mass system motion equation can be written as :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m\\\\mathbf{a} In bodies that are not treated as particles a must be replaced by acm, the acceleration of the center of mass of the system, meaning :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m\\\\mathbf{a}_{\\\\mathrm{cm}} Often the force due to thrust is defined as \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{thrust}} = \\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} so that :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}} + \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{thrust}} = m\\\\mathbf{a}_{\\\\mathrm{cm}} This form shows that a body can have acceleration due to thrust even if no external forces act on it (Fext = 0). Note finally that if one lets Fnet be the sum of Fext and Fthrust then the equation regains the usual form of Newton's second law: :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{net}} = m\\\\mathbf{a}_{\\\\mathrm{cm}}  Ideal rocket equation  Rocket mass ratios versus final velocity calculated from the rocket equation The ideal rocket equation, or the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, can be used to study the motion of vehicles that behave like a rocket (where a body accelerates itself by ejecting part of its mass, a propellant, with high speed). It can be derived from the general equation of motion for variable-mass systems as follows: when no external forces act on a body (Fext = 0) the variable-mass system motion equation reduces to :\\\\mathbf{v}_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}= m \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} If the velocity of the ejected propellant, vrel, is assumed have the opposite direction as the rocket's acceleration, dv/dt, the scalar equivalent of this equation can be written as :-v_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = m{\\\\mathrm{d} v \\\\over \\\\mathrm{d}t} from which dt can be canceled out to give :-v_{\\\\mathrm{rel}}\\\\mathrm{d}m = m\\\\mathrm{d}v \\\\, Integration by separation of variables gives :-v_\\\\mathrm{rel}\\\\int_{m_0}^{m_1} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{m} = \\\\int_{v_0}^{v_1} \\\\mathrm{d}v :v_\\\\mathrm{rel}\\\\ln{\\\\frac{m_0}{m_1}} = v_1 - v_0 By rearranging and letting Œîv = v1  v0, one arrives at the standard form of the ideal rocket equation: :\\\\Delta v = v_\\\\mathrm{rel} \\\\ln \\\\frac {m_0} {m_1} where m0 is the initial total mass, including propellant, m1 is the final total mass, vrel is the effective exhaust velocity (often denoted as ve), and Œîv is the maximum change of speed of the vehicle (when no external forces are acting).

Staffspasttrack.org.uk. Cause The riots took place against the back drop of the 1842 general strike, started by colliers in and around the Potteries, and part of the popular working class Chartist movement. The spark that lit both the general strike and Pottery Riots was the decision, in early June 1842, by W. H. Sparrow, a Longton coal mine owner, to disregard the law and fail to give the statutory fortnight's notice before imposing a hefty pay reduction of almost a shilling a day on his workers.Pottery Riots 1842.

The strike cause was championed by Chartists, who called for a general strike across the Potteries.Workers‚Äô History . Workersliberty.org (15 December 2005). However, by the end of July strikes were endemic across north Staffordshire and were spreading, notably in south east Lancashire.General Strike 1842. Chartists.net.

Background Tennessee Eastman sought a patent for a surgical method for bonding a wound together by applying certain glues.Specifically, the patent application claimed, in part: \\"The method for surgical bonding of body tissues which comprises applying to at least one of the tissue surfaces to be bonded an adhesive composition comprising a monomeric ester of a-cyanoacrylic acid ... \\" The glues themselves were not new. The new discovery was that the glues could be used in place of stitches to close wounds. The Commissioner of Patents refused to grant the patent on the ground that the claimed method was not the kind of discovery which fell within the definition of ‚Äúinvention‚Äù in the Patent Act. In particular, it was not an ‚Äúart‚Äù because it was useful only in the process of surgical treatment and produced no result in relation to trade, commerce or industry. Tennessee Eastman appealed to the Exchequer Court. The issue there was whether this use of glue fell within the meaning of new and useful ‚Äúart‚Äù or ‚Äúprocess‚Äù within the meaning of the Patent Act. The Exchequer Court held that it did not for the reasons given by the Commissioner of Patents. Reasons of the Court The Supreme Court concluded that methods of medical treatment are not contemplated in the definition of invention as a kind of \\"process\\". Section 41 of the Patent Act restricted the scope of patents ‚Äúrelating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine.‚Äù This implied that, with respect to such substances, a medical or therapeutic use cannot be claimed by a process claim apart from the substance itself. Post Tennessee Eastman The decision was based on the former s. 41 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, now repealed. Even so, the overall conclusion made in Tennessee Eastman (that methods of medical treatment are not patentable) has been upheld by the Federal Court of AppealImperial Chemical Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1986] 3 F.C. 40 (F.C.A.) and cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada.Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 The current rationale for rejecting claims for methods of medical treatment is that enunciated by the Commission of Patents in this decision. A method that is essentially non-economic and unrelated to trade, industry, or commerce, and instead relates to an area of professional skills, is unpatentable.Shell Oil Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 536 and Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 Circumventing the prohibition Although Canadian jurisprudence has held that methods of medical treatment are unpatentable, many such claims can often be redrafted as ‚Äúuse‚Äù or ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù claims, which have been found acceptable. For example, in Canada, an inventor may get a patent on a product (i.e. a pharmaceutical), a patent on the method of use of the pharmaceutical (i.e. a patient taking the pill), and a patent on the diagnostic kit for use of the product. In particular, an invention directed towards the treatment of disease is patentable, since there is no removal of the need for professional skill and judgment, and the invention deals with an economic area related to trade, commerce or industry.Apotex Inc. v.

Main combatants comprised: * The Armed Forces of El Salvador ( ‚Äì FAES), which were backed by the United States, Taiwan and Israel, were the official armed defense forces of El Salvador. Subordinated to the Ministry of Defense and Security of the Salvadoran government at the capital San Salvador, the FAES branches were organized as follows: **Salvadoran Army (Spanish: Ej√©rcito Salvadore√±o) **Salvadoran Air Force (Spanish: Fuerza A√©rea Salvadore√±a) **Salvadoran Navy (Spanish: Fuerza Naval de El Salvador) *Paramilitary security forces: **National Guard of El Salvador (Spanish: Guardia Nacional de El Salvador) * The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (), more commonly known by its Spanish acronym FMLN, was an alliance or umbrella organization of five left- wing guerrilla groups created in 1980, which was backed by Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Eastern Bloc countries. An eclectic variety of weapons was used by both sides in the Salvadoran Civil War. The Salvadoran FAES were equipped with Western-made weapons, mainly American and Israeli in origin, but also included Argentine, Portuguese, French, West German, Yugoslavian and Taiwanese military hardware. During the early phase of the war, the FMLN likewise were largely equipped with Western arms and munitions, though as the war went on, Eastern Bloc weaponry began to play a major role.

The first large- scale delivery occurred in 1981 with 11,868 units delivered. A total of 32,374 M16A1/A2 rifles were delivered between 1980 and 1993. The U.S. began to replace the G3 rifles in the hands of the Salvadorian Army in 1981 with the delivery of 11,868 AR-15A1 R613 (M16A1); followed by another 20,743 M16s purchased with FMS funds for El Salvador in 1982. Many of these \\"new\\" rifles were actually leftovers from Vietnam. Eventually, another 45,160 AR-15A1 R613 followed, to include more than 500 CAR-15A1 R639 (XM177E2 Commando ‚Äì typified as M16A2 for El Salvador) to equip the Mechanized Infantry and officer Corps and hundreds of CAR-15A1 R653 (M16A1) Carbines starting in 1985, and even brand-new M16s supplied by Springfield Armory.http://blogs.miis.edu/sand/files/2011/02/elsbrief.pdf Source: Federation of American Scientists, Arms Sales Monitoring Project * CAR-15: Colt Automatic Rifle-15 Military Weapons System or CAR-15.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Floraconus Iredale, 1930 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turgid to conical in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral, and the spire whorl tops have cords. Nodules are either absent or die out in early whorls. The dentiform plait may be small or absent. The anal notch is shallow, and the anterior notch is slight or absent. The periostracum may be smooth or tufted, and the operculum is moderate to small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth may be equal to or slightly longer than the posterior section. The blade is short to moderate extending about one-third to one-half the length of the anterior section. The basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has a single row of serrations. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus are endemic to Australia. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous (meaning that the cones prey on marine worms) feeding upon polychaete worms.

History of Pine Creek Early in the 1860s, Kaszubian Polish and Bohemian immigrants living in Winona, Minnesota began buying land across the Mississippi River in Trempealeau County. The Pine Creek area was ideal because of its thick black soil and its advantageous proximity to Winona's markets and services.Polish Roots-Winona, Minnesota The precise date of Pine Creek's establishment remains problematic but most accounts give 1862, which is also the year that Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church was founded. Once the parish was formally established as part of the then-Roman Catholic Diocese of Milwaukee, a small community grew up around the church, including two or three taverns, a dance hall, and a general store. Although important in the history of the Kashubian diaspora, Pine Creek never became more than a small community due to the growth of the nearby town of Dodge, Wisconsin. Notable people *Martin D.

Recipients were single, no-dependents, standard- deduction, only-wage-income, one-employer, with a maximum adjusted gross income of $139,917. The purpose of ReadyReturn was to make it easier for taxpayers to file their returns, and to make the filing process more accurate and faster. More than 20 other countries implement pre-populated returns for some of their taxpayers. Denmark, began a pre-filled return program in 1988, and has a 80% participation rate. Chile, Finland, Malta, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden have similar programs available to most taxpayers. Singapore, South Africa, Spain and Turkey have similar programs available to at least 30% of taxpayers. Australia, Estonia, France, Hong Kong, Iceland, Italy, Lithuania and Poland have similar programs available and are used by some taxpayers. In the 1990s Michigan offered return-free filing, but dropped the program due to lack of participation, Louisiana planned but dropped implementation due to Y2K problems,John Rappa, Chief Analyst. States Allowing Income Tax ‚ÄúReturn-Free Filing‚Äù Office of Legislative Research, Connecticut General Assembly January 24, 2017 and Minnesota proposed but did not enact return-free filing.Analysis of SF 665 (Rest) and HF 843 (Benson), Minnesota Department of Revenue (March 2, 2007)  Origins  In 2004, California Franchise Tax Board staffers told Joseph Bankman,Joseph Bankman ‚ÄúMr. Smith Gets an Education: Why it is so Hard to get Easy Tax Filing.‚Äù a leading scholar in the field of tax law, a clinical psychologist,https://law.stanford.edu/2018/04/09/tax-time-really-need-painful- anxiety-ridden-process/ and Professor of Law and Business at Stanford Law School that they realized that they had all the data they needed to fill out Californians‚Äô tax returns for millions of Californians whose entire income came from one job. In 2005, Joseph Bankman worked with the State of California to create ReadyReturn, a pilot study with a completed tax return prepared by the state (not an individual or tax professional) that was available to single, no-dependant, standard-deduction, one-employer, wages-only taxpayers for the 2005 filing season. When the California Franchise Tax Board launched the ReadyReturn website, Intuit sued and lobbied California legislators to kill the program.https://icepp.gsu.edu/files/2015/03/ispwp0630.pdf  Methodology  In the pilot, taxpayers were allowed to file the return as given to them, to modify and then file it, or to ignore it and file however they normally would. Of the 50,000 participants in the pilot, 38,500 chose to ignore the return, and approximately 11,500 filed it. A survey of pilot participants found more than 90 per cent said they saved time using ReadyReturn, and that it was more convenient than the system they had used previously. 99% said they would use it again the next year. 0.3% of ReadyReturn filings contained errors, versus 3.1% of non-ReadyReturn filings.  Opposition  Between 2001 and 2010, Intuit Inc., maker of the tax- preparation software TurboTax, spent more than $1.7 million on lobbying in an attempt to kill ReadyReturn. A bill to provide explicit statutory authorization for ReadyReturn, and to make the program permanent died without a vote in the 2006 session of the California legislature.Jim Sanders, Tax- Return Bill Dies in Assembly, Sacramento Bee, June 2, 2006, p. A4LA Zelenak. Justice Holmes, Ralph Kramden, and the Civic Virtues of a Tax Return Filing Requirement 2007. California Controller, Steve Westly. said he was stunned by the response from taxpayers who used the program as part of the pilot project, about 96% of whom said it is a service government should provide, and one they would use again, > \\"I absolutely have come to believe that ReadyReturn is the right thing to > do\\". > ‚ÄîCalifornia Controller, Steve Westly No ReadyReturn forms were used for the 2006 tax year, but the California Franchise Tax Board revived it on their own for the 2007 tax year, expanding it to cover one million Californians.  Reception  In 2012, 88,652 California taxpayers used the system, and with paper returns costing more than seven times a ReadyReturn return to process, it saved the state an estimated $125,000.ReadyReturn: Your California tax return ready and waiting for you, California Franchise Tax Board (January 17, 2013) 99% stated they were satisfied with ReadyReturn, 97% stated this is the type of service government should provide, 96% stated it was more convenient than how they filed in the past, 95% stated it saved them time, and 98% stated they would use it again.

The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company Passenger Station. The station was built by the Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, in 1911. Amtrak's Pioneer also used the station and nearby area from 1977‚Äì1997. History The railroad first reached Hood River in 1882 with the arrival of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (OR&N;). The OR&N; built eastward from Portland, eventually reaching Huntington in 1884, near the border with Idaho. In 1882, a two-story wooden depot was built at Hood River. As the town grew, a new station was seen as necessary. The current building was completed in 1911, on the same site as the previous depot. In 1918, a runaway locomotive struck the west side of the station. After a series of corporate restructuring, the Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company was incorporated in 1910, still as a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. Over the next decades, the Union Pacific branding replaced the Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad. It its heyday, the station served inter-city trains such as the City of Portland, Pacific Limited, Portland Rose, and The Spokane. These provided connections with Chicago, Omaha, and Spokane, among others. The NRHP nomination for the building listed passenger and freight service as ending in 1958, but timetables for the Union Pacific show service to Hood River as far as 1969. The previously independent Mount Hood Railroad was purchased by Union Pacific in 1967. This line to Parkdale met the Union Pacific main line just east of the section. The original Mount Hood Railroad depot, east of this station site, was torn down by the Union Pacific in 1971. With the end of private inter-city rail in the United States and the formation of Amtrak on May 1, 1971, Hood River was initially not served. The station regained service with the formation of the Pioneer in 1977. Amtrak did not utilize the station building, and instead installed a metal waiting shelter to the east. Union Pacific continued to use the building until 1984. On November 2, 1987, a group of local investors purchased the building and line to Parksdale from Union Pacific and formed the Mount Hood Railroad Corporation. The station was repurposed to serve as the headquarters of the corporation, and it is the present use of the station. Amtrak also began to use the station building in the early 1990s, but the Pioneer was discontinued in 1997. The Mount Hood Railway again sold to Iowa Pacific Holdings in 2008, and in 2019, county officials have indicated they are prepared to seize the property due to back taxes. The station and surrounding area has been noted in a study by the Oregon Department of Transportation as being in good condition for possible reintroduction of Amtrak service. The station is noted as being ADA access to the building, but work would be required to upgrade the station's island platform that would be necessary for service. Greyhound Lines (and listed as Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach) provides service to Hood River between Portland‚ÄìBoise, at a stop adjacent to the station. Station Description The 1911 built station was designed in a Craftsman style, and is one and a half stories tall. It is noted have dimensions of in a rectangular shape. The interior of the station was initially built with two waiting rooms, one for women and one for men. These were later combined into one by the Union Pacific. The interior of the building also contains a ticket area, office space, and a baggage room.

The film stars Danny Trejo, Charles S. Dutton, and Ron Perlman. It is loosely based on the viral AC Transit Bus fight viral video. Plot Frank Vega (Danny Trejo) is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who had led a difficult life. His old girlfriend married someone else and had two kids while he was fighting for his country, he is unable to get a job anywhere, and ended up making a living selling hot dogs for most of his life until a hot dog van took away his customers. Frank spent much of the rest of his life as a drifter, until one day, he becomes famous on the Internet when he beats up two abusive skinheads on a bus, is given the nickname \\"Bad Ass,\\" and is celebrated by everybody around him; people make T-shirts and graffiti with his face on it, police give him ride-alongs and he ends up on talk shows. Three months later, Frank's mother, Juanita (Tonita Castro) passes away, leaving him her house and dog. Frank's best friend and fellow Vietnam vet, Klondike Washington (Harrison Page), moves in with Frank and entrusts him with a USB flash drive for his late mother's safe deposit box. Klondike goes out one night for cigarettes and is murdered in a dark alley by two thugs, leaving Frank heartbroken. Frank meets a boy named Martin (John Duffy), who lives next door to Frank with his mother, Amber Lamps (Joyful Drake), and abusive father, Martin Sr. (Chris Spencer). Officer Malark (Patrick Fabian) assures Frank that the police department are working on finding the men who killed Klondike, but after watching the news and learning that the police solved a different murder in a faster time span, Frank realizes that the police are doing little to nothing about Klondike's murder. Frank decides to solve the mystery himself, and investigates the alley where Klondike was shot. He finds a spent cartridge casing and a pendant with a woman's picture in it. Frank takes them both to a pawn shop where the shopkeeper (Duane Whitaker) tells him it belongs to a man named Terence (Erik Betts), whose wife's picture is in the pendant. After returning the pendant to Terence's wife, he asks where Terence is, and she tells him that he is playing basketball with some friends. After Frank beats up some of Terence's friends, they tell him that a man named Renaldo might know where Terence is. Frank goes to Renaldo's apartment and meets his roommate, who tells Frank that Renaldo is at a bar across town. After beating up some of the bar patrons who try to throw him out, Frank finds Renaldo and extracts the information that Terence is hanging out with his girlfriend. Frank finds her working at a massage parlor but she is uncooperative, so he follows her after her shift. After breaking into her house, he finds Terence and tortures him for information about his boss (who ordered Klondike's murder) by sticking Terence's hand in the kitchen's garbage disposal. Terence reveals that Klondike was killed by a drug lord named Panther (Charles S. Dutton) for the flash drive he had been given earlier, which contains details of a secret project to dig oil wells in the neighborhood on behalf of Mayor Williams (Ron Perlman). Before confronting Panther, Frank saves Amber and Martin from their abusive husband/father and ends up becoming their neighborhood friend. Amber invites Frank over for a home-cooked meal, and Frank gets all dressed up for it. At dinner, Frank asks Amber if he can have a matchbook of hers as a memento, and she gives it to him. They are about to kiss when Martin, Jr. walks in on them, so they do not. Frank insists that Amber and Martin stay at his place until he can repair her front door. The next day, Frank gives the flash drive to Officer Malark and tracks down Panther at his hideout. But he is knocked unconscious, captured, and then tortured for information about the location of the flash drive by being hooked up to an electrocution device. He is shocked multiple times, like he was in Vietnam, but Frank still refuses to surrender the flash drive. Panther takes Frank's wallet, learns Frank's address and believes Frank is hiding not only the flash drive but a loved one there as well, due to Frank's insistence that there is nothing to find. Panther leaves his men to continue torturing Frank, but Frank breaks free from his restraints and throws a lit matchbook (the one he got from Amber) at some oil drums stored in the room, setting the building on fire and causing explosions. Panther escapes but Frank gives chase. They both steal buses and duel, damaging many other vehicles during their chase, and ultimately demolish both buses. While chasing Panther again on foot, Frank comes across the two skinheads he beat up on the bus earlier. The skinheads try to undo their previous humiliation at Frank's hands by using their cell phone to record themselves beating up Frank, but Frank overpowers them again and resumes his chase. Panther arrives at Frank's house, finds Amber, and threatens to kill her for the flash drive, but Frank arrives in time to intervene. Their fight spills out into the front yard, and just as Panther is about to go after Frank again, Amber jumps on his back and slows him down enough for Frank to get up and beat Panther senseless. Panther is arrested, as is Mayor Williams when his connection to Panther's scandal is revealed on the news. Frank, Amber and Martin all live happily ever after. Cast Production Bad Ass was very loosely based on the AC Transit Bus fight, which was filmed by a bystander and became a viral video on YouTube. Immediately after the release of the film, the producers began active development on a story for a new installment of Bad Ass with a view toward shooting this installment in 2013.

The film has been sold to Wild Bunch for distribution in Germany and to Pinnacle Films for distribution in Australia. Subsequently, distribution arrangements were made with Samuel Goldwyn Films for USA theatrical release on April 13, 2012 as well as Twentieth Century Fox for ancillary rights and international all media distribution. Sequels Two sequels have been released. The first, Bad Ass 2: Bad Asses, was released in 2014, and co-starred Danny Glover. Trejo and Glover were paired again for the third film, Bad Asses on the Bayou, which was released on March 6, 2015. Reception Reviews of the film were mostly negative, with some news articles wondering if the film was actually real or a hoax. Vulture's Sarah Benned commented on the preview, saying \\"This trailer for Bad Ass (loosely based on this viral video) is either a parody, the trailer for a parody, or just an excuse to make Danny Trejo beat people up while wearing a fanny pack. It's your call.\\" Cinema Blend has compared the trailer to Trejo's initially mock-trailer for Machete, saying \\"This could be a spoof trailer sandwiched in the middle of a Grindhouse sequel. Then again, that worked for Machete, so why couldn't it kick-start Bad Ass, as well?\\" In his review of the film, Los Angeles Times critic Mark Olsen stated, \\"It's often difficult to tell what's bad on purpose or just badly handled. Perhaps it is just difficult to compete with the strange spontaneity of something like a viral video; the way it takes on its own momentum may be something that can't be replicated.\\" According to the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, which gave the film a 20% approval rating, the film received 4 negative reviews against 1 positive one.

Maryam was initially involved in the family's philanthropic organisations. However, in 2012, she entered politics and was put in charge of election campaign during the 2013 general election. In 2013, she was appointed as the Chairperson of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme. However, she resigned in 2014 after her appointment was challenged in the Lahore High Court. In July 2018, she was sentenced to seven years in prison with ¬£2 million fine on corruption charges in the Avenfield reference case. On 19 September, the Islamabad High Court suspended her sentence. Early life and education Maryam was born on 28 October 1973 in Lahore, Pakistan, to Nawaz Sharif and Kulsoom Butt. She received her early education from the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Lahore. She wanted to become a doctor, hence she enrolled in King Edward Medical College in the late 1980s; however, after a controversy over illegal admission arose, she had to leave the college without completing her degree. In 1992, she married Safdar Awan at the age of 19 and assumed her husband's surname as Mariam Safdar. Awan was serving as captain in Pakistan Army at that time and was the security officer of Nawaz Sharif during the latter's tenure as Prime Minister of Pakistan. As of October 2017, she has three children with Safdar Awan: One son Junaid and two daughters Mahnoor and Mehr-un-Nisa. She completed undergraduate studies from the University of Punjab, from where she received a master's degree in literature. In 2012, she was doing her Ph.D. degree on post-9/11 radicalization in Pakistan. In 2014, her degrees in M.A. (English Literature) and Ph.D. in Political Science were questioned by Lahore High Court. It was unclear whether her Ph.D. degree was earned or honorary. In 2018, she only declared her master's degree in English Literature while submitting records to the Election Commission of Pakistan. Following the 1999 Pakistani coup d'√©tat, she remained under house arrest for four months before being sent to exile in Saudi Arabia together with the members of the Sharif family.  Political career  Prior to entering in politics, she remained involved in the family's philanthropic organisation and served as the chairperson of Sharif Trust, Sharif Medical City and Sharif Education Institutes. In November 2011, Shehbaz Sharif granted her permission to join the politics after she expressed her intention to participate in politics. During her political debut, she began visiting educational institutes to give speeches on education and women's rights. In January 2012, she tweeted \\"I'm only assisting Nawaz Sharif at the moment. No intentions of getting into electoral or practical politics\\". She was made in-charge of Nawaz Sharif election campaign during 2013 Pakistani general election where she reportedly played a prominent role. She was regarded as \\"heir apparent\\" of Nawaz Sharif and the \\"presumed future leader\\" of the PML-N. In November 2013, she was appointed as the chairperson of Prime Minister's Youth Programme. However, her appointment was called into question by the Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) which termed the appointment a case of nepotism and moved the Lahore High Court in October 2014. PTI also accused her of misusing the government funds for her own image-building. On 12 November 2014, the Lahore High Court ordered the federal government to remove her. The next day, Maryam resigned from the post of the chairperson-ship. In March 2017, she was selected as one of the BBC's 100 Women. In December 2017, she was featured on The New York Times list of 11 Powerful Women Around the World for the year 2017. She became politically active in 2017 after her father Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in relation to the Panama Papers case. She campaigned for her mother, Kulsoom Nawaz, during the by-elections in Constituency NA-120. In June 2018, she was allocated PML-N ticket to contest the 2018 general election from Constituency NA-127 (Lahore-V) and PP-173. In July, she was sentenced to 7 years' jail on corruption charges in Avenfield reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau.

According to records uncovered by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Maryam was described as the owner of the British Virgin Islands-based firms Nielsen Enterprises Limited and Nescoll Limited, and allegedly the owner of the properties in the United Kingdom owned jointly by her brothers. In reaction, Maryam denied owning any company or property outside Pakistan and said \\"My brother has made me a trustee in one of his corporations which only entitles me to distribute assets to my brother Hussain's family/children if needed\\". In September 2016, the Pakistan Tehreek- e-Insaf (PTI) filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan asking for action against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family members for their alleged involvement in the Panama Papers scandal. In January 2017, Maryam submitted her statement to the Supreme Court saying she is not dependent on her father Nawaz Sharif since her marriage in 1992. On 16 February 2017, the lawyer of Maryam admitted before the Supreme Court that Maryam owned four flats in London for at least six months in 2006. On 20 April, the Supreme Court announced split verdict and ordered formation of the joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate Sharif family's assets for irregularities. On 10 July, the JIT submitted its report to the Supreme Court in which it maintained that Sharif family has assets beyond known sources of income. In its report, the JIT noted that Maryam misled the Supreme Court by presenting fake documents and stated that the Calibri font used on the declaration dated 2006 produced by Maryam was not commercially available before January 31, 2007. The scandal was widely referred to as Fontgate. The Supreme Court announced its decision on 28 July 2017 and disqualified Nawaz Sharif from holding public office as he had been dishonest in not disclosing his employment in the Dubai- based Capital FZE company in his nomination papers.

After conducting 107 hearings of the Avenfield case since September 2017, the accountability court reserved its verdict in the case on 3 July 2018. On 6 July 2018, she was sentenced to 7 years' jail and two million pounds by the NAB on corruption charges in Avenfield reference case. She was given 7 years for abetment and 1 year for non-cooperation with the NAB. Both sentences will run concurrently. As a result, she was disqualified from contesting election for 10 years. The court held that trust deeds presented by Maryam before the apex court were fake and had been tampered with. Her father, Nawaz Sharif, and husband were also sentenced ten years and one year in prison, respectively. The court also ordered the seizure of the Avenfield flats of the Sharif family. The next day, Maryam announced that she would return to Pakistan on 13 July to file an appeal against the decision. The same day, NAB announced to arrest her and Nawaz Sharif upon their arrival in Pakistan and obtained required arrest warrant. She along with Nawaz Sharif was taken into custody by NAB on 13 July upon their arrival at Lahore's Allama Iqbal International Airport and were airlifted to Rawalpindi's Adyala jail.

In 1995, Chai began her broadcast career as a radio host in Hunan Province. From 2001 to 2013, she worked for China Central Television (CCTV) as a well respected investigative reporter and host. In 2012 she published an autobiography, Insight (), which has sold more than 1 million copies. In 2014, Chai undertook an independent investigation into China's environmental problems, which culminated in a self- financed documentary called Under the Dome (). By March 3, 2015, the film had garnered over 150 million views in China, sparking widespread discussion about pollution and environmental policy in China. The film was blocked on Chinese websites by the authorities on March 7, 2015.News Deutsche Welle (German) In 2015 she was also named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people. Early life Chai was born in Linfen, Shanxi, China. In 1991, she enrolled in Changsha Railway Institute (now known as Central South University or \\"Zhongnan University\\" Railway Campus) in Changsha, Hunan Province, majoring in accounting. While still a student, she wrote a letter to a host at a Hunan Arts Radio, asking: \\"Could you help me fulfill my dream?\\" The host offered her an interview and she was later hired to work at the station. After graduation in 1995, she hosted the radio program, Gentle Moonlight (). Three years later, at age 22, she enrolled in Beijing Broadcasting Institute (now known as Communication University of China) to study television production, while hosting another Hunan radio program, New Youth, (). In 2001, she joined China Central Television (CCTV) as a reporter and presenter, at the same time working on a Master of Fine Arts at Peking University. Career at CCTV In 2001, Chai became a host and reporter for Horizon Connection () at CCTV. Two years later, as an investigative reporter, she covered the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, appearing on camera in white protective clothing and looking pale and thin herself. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in Wenchuan County, Chai went on scene to live with the refugees to experience their severe living conditions. She later compiled the experiences into a program called Seven Days at Yangping. The report raised her reputation as a television reporter. In 2009, Chai left investigative reporting to anchor 24 Hours () and host One on One () for CCTV News. In 2011, she became one of the hosts of the weekend edition of Insight (). Chai is known for her direct, get- to-the point interview technique. Some controversy arose surrounding Chai in 2013. After marrying famous photographer Zhao Jia she became pregnant, but she chose not to deliver her child in a hospital in China. Instead, she travelled to the United States before it was time for her to give birth. Some people pointed out that Chai had once declared that if she were to have a baby in the future that she would let her baby belong to China. Due to this issue, many people think that Chai directly contradicted herself. Fabricated corruption allegations On September 19, 2009, a blogger, Wujinger1 (), posted a false article, Famous CCTV hostess Chai Jing arrested today on suspicion of taking bribes. The next day, Chai herself blogged a denial of the rumor. Several months later, on July 13, 2010, Wujinger1 ran another false article, CCTV hostess Chai Jing was taken away by the procuratorate again today, alleging that she was again being investigated on corruption charges. It was later discovered that Wujinger1 was Wu Zhibo, who wanted to seek attention. He apologized to Chai, saying she was his idol, and he wanted the public to know more about Chai. Under the Dome environmental documentary While still pregnant, Chai was told her daughter had a benign tumor. Following her daughter's birth, Chai undertook her own year-long investigation into China's environmental problems, spending nearly 1 million yuan ($167,000) producing a documentary called Under the Dome (), which was released for free online viewing on March 1, 2015. The documentary, with Chai as a matter-of-fact on- stage presenter, was viewed more than 150 million times by March 3 and has since been censored in China.

He reasoned that if people could not agree on the reason of the war, they could at least unite behind the troops in a show of support for America's sons and daughters. \\"What better way for people to understand [the issue] than to put the face of the troops as the face of the war, rather than one or two spokesman up on a podium?\\" he said.

Previously, Dr. Smith was Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. In 1990, Smith published an article in the journal Science, which proposed that certain glial cells in the human brain known as astrocytes would be able to communicate through chemical signals, rather than electrical.Jon Hamilton, National Public Radio, June 2, 2010, \\"Einstein's Brain Unlocks Some Mysteries of the Mind\\", December 25, 2011 By utilizing the neurotransmitter glutamate, he was able to show that these cells, which had once been perceived as inert tissue between neurons, in fact were actively communicating with the rest of the brain. This discovery showed that astrocytes likely play an important role in learning and memory. Since Smith's discovery, astrocytes have become an increasingly important part of neural research. Smith has also been a primary leader in the development of array tomography (AT), a proteomic imaging method of volumetric microscopy, in which ultrathin sections of a plastic-embedded tissue are sliced using an ultramicrotome, bonded in an ordered array to a glass coverslip, stained, and imaged. The public methodology for this technique was introduced in a 2007 article in the scientific journal Neuron (journal) with Kristina Micheva, and was expanded upon in a 2010 article, also in Neuron (journal), with Micheva, Brad Busse, Nicolas Weiler, and Nancy O'Rourke. In utilizing array tomography, Smith and his colleagues created three-dimensional models of brains in mice, achieving a level of detail previously unattainable.Amy Standen, KQED-QUEST, November 18, 2010, \\"Touring Memory Lane Inside The Brain\\", December 25, 2011 Smith received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1977, after which he conducted postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley from 1977 to 1980.

It was part of the old Ducherow‚ÄìSwinem√ºnde railway. The lifting part of the bridge has stood since the end of the Second World War as a relic and technical monument in the middle of the Peenestrom. It was nominated for designation as a Historic Symbol of Engineering in Germany.  Construction and history  A predecessor of the lift bridge was built in 1875 initially as a manually operated swing bridge. It was normally kept open to enable shipping in the Peenestrom to pass and was only closed when a train needed to cross the bridge. In 1908 the line was upgraded to double track. The lift bridge was built in 1932 and 1933 as a result of the rise in railway operations and higher traffic loads. In the same period the Niederfinow Boat Lift was built to similar design principles and is still in operation today. The commonality of the two projects was so close that the cables of the Karnin Lift Bridge were pre-stressed on the construction site of the Niederfinow Boat Lift and then transported by special railway wagons to Karnin. The bridge had a total length of 360 metres; the length of the lifting frame is 51.7 metres and its height 35 metres. The centre pier of the old swing bridge was left in place as an additional abutment for the lifting section; that and a lightweight design of the actual lifting section resulted in considerable savings in the weight of the moving part of the bridge. Until its destruction on 28 April 1945, https://signalarchiv.de/Meldungen/10002742 the bridge was the most important transport link from Usedom to the mainland. The bridge crossed the Strom, as the southern part of the Peenestrom is called, from the mouth of the Peene to the Stettin Lagoon, between Kamp and Karnin. This link was of great importance for the touristic development of the island, as well as the military installations on Usedom (the ammunition dump near Usedom town and the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Centre from 1936). At the end of the Second World War the bridge was blown up by the Wehrmacht, in order to hinder the advance of the Red Army. They destroyed the flood bridges over the island and mainland, leaving the actual lift bridge undamaged. The centre section was saved because there were still units of the German navy operating in the Stettin Lagoon and they wanted to keep open an escape route to the Baltic Sea. After the Second World War the railway link and bridge were not rebuilt because a section of the line now ran over Polish territory on Usedom near Swinem√ºnde (Polish: ≈öwinouj≈õcie). The blown-up flood bridges that had collapsed into the Peenestrom were recovered after 1945 and partly used in the rebuilding of the destroyed Oder bridges on the Prussian Ostbahn in K√ºstrin. The route of the old railway line from Ducherow via Karnin, Usedom and Dargen to Swinem√ºnde can still be made out on satellite and aerial photographs. Work on plans drawn up in the 1960s to rebuild the railway line and bridge was repeatedly shelved. Meanwhile, its transportation function was taken over by the Peene Bridge at Wolgast, which was designed as a combined railway and road bridge. In 1990/91 bridge engineer Hans Nadler saved the lift bridge section from the serious threat of demolition. To carry out his aims of preserving and rebuilding the bridge as a monument, he and other like-minded people founded the Usedom Railway Society (Usedomer Eisenbahnfreunde e.V.) in 1992. Beginning in 1997, the society restored the station building at Karnin station and from 1999 to 2005 ran a small exhibition on the line's history.Pressemitteilung Usedomer Eisenbahnfreunde report dated 26 November 2007 on the death of Hans Nadler The good condition of the lift bridge today is due to the fact that a rust- resistant steel was used, which corrodes very little even when not regularly painted.  Current situation  In Germany's 2003 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, the rebuilding of the line from Seebad Heringsdorf via ≈öwinouj≈õcie to Ducherow was listed under the international projects section. Such a link would cut the travel time between Berlin and the island of Usedom from the present four hours to about two hours.Peter Neumann: Berliner Zeitung, 14 Mayi 2007 Bahn will in zwei Stunden nach Usedom , Berliner Zeitung dated 14 May 2007UBB soll ab Juni bis Swinem√ºnde fahren, inselbahn.de, 11 April 2008 Because the Karnin Lift Bridge is on the Ducherow‚ÄìSwinem√ºnde railway, current attempts to rebuild the bridge have been included as part of that.

It was a punishment killing, carried out by members of the Sandy Row women's Ulster Defence Association (UDA) unit. At the time the UDA was a legal Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation. The victim, Ann Ogilby, a Protestant single mother of four, was beaten to death by two teenaged girls after being sentenced to a \\"rompering\\" (UDA slang term for a torture session followed by a fatal beating) at a kangaroo court. Ogilby had been having an affair with a married UDA commander, William Young, who prior to his internment, had made her pregnant. His wife, Elizabeth Young, was a member of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit. Ogilby had made defamatory remarks against Elizabeth Young in public regarding food parcels. Eight weeks after Ogilby had given birth to Young's son, the women's unit decided that Ogilby would pay for both the affair and remarks with her life. The day following the kangaroo court \\"trial\\", they arranged for the kidnapping of Ogilby and her six-year-old daughter, Sharlene, outside a Social Services office by UDA man Albert \\"Bumper\\" Graham. A group of UDA women then followed the minibus which took Ogilby and Sharlene to a disused bakery in Hunter Street, Sandy Row; this empty building had been converted into a UDA club and \\"romper room\\". After Sharlene was sent by Graham to a shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was made to sit on a bench and a hood placed over her head. Two teenagers, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting on the orders previously given them by the unit's leader, Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Douglas, proceeded to savagely beat Ogilby to death with bricks and sticks. As Ogilby screamed and pleaded for her life, Sharlene, who had already returned from the shop, overheard her mother being beaten and killed. A later autopsy report revealed that Ogilby had sustained 24 blows to the head and body, 14 of which caused a \\"severe fracture to the bulk of the skull\\". Within weeks of the killing, ten women and one man were arrested in connection with the murder. They were convicted in February 1975. All but one, a minor whose sentence was suspended, went to prison. The murder caused widespread revulsion, shock and horror throughout Northern Ireland and remained long in the public psyche even at a time when bombings and killings were daily occurrences. The Ann Ogilby murder was investigated by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) which was established by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate the most controversial killings carried out during the Troubles. Events leading to the murder Ann Ogilby Ann Ogilby (born c.1942/1943 and sometimes referred to as Anne Ogilby),CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths ‚Äì 1974 CAIN gives her age as 31 at the time of her death. Her gravestone however gives her age as 32. a young Protestant woman, moved to Belfast from Sion Mills, County Tyrone on a date that has not been firmly established.Author David M. Kiely gives her age as 17 at the time of her move which would make the year approximately 1959/1960,[ref:\\"Elizabeth Douglas: the Sandy Row executioner\\". Belfast Telegraph. David Kiely. 1 June 2005] however RUC detective Alan Simpson contradicts this date in his book Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles\\" by stating that Ann Ogilby arrived in Belfast \\"some six years\\" before her murder, making the year of her arrival 1967 or 1968. [ref: Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles, p.34] She was one of 13 children from a poor family.\\"Elizabeth Douglas, the Sandy Row executioner\\". Belfast Telegraph. David Kiely. 1 June 2005 Retrieved 4 April 2015 Described as a \\"very attractive girl with dark-brown silky hair and blue eyes\\", and a slender figure, she embarked on a transient lifestyle, regularly changing her address and employment. The jobs she held were mostly low-paid positions in offices and shops, and she was often evicted for failing to pay the rent. Her striking good looks made her popular with men. In about 1968 she became a single mother, having been made pregnant by a married British soldier stationed in Northern Ireland who had abandoned her and their child after he was transferred to another duty station. \\"Women Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland: Duty, Agency and Empowerment ‚Äì A Report From the Field\\". All Academic Research. Sandra McEvoy. 2008. p. 16 She started socialising with a rough crowd, and in August 1972, she met William Young, a married high-ranking member of the then-legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA) with whom she fell deeply in love and began living with him in south Belfast.The UDA was formed in September 1971 as an umbrella organisation for the many loyalist vigilante groups known as \\"defence associations\\". It was structured along military lines with brigades, battalions, companies, platoons and sections. Although Andy Tyrie was the overall commander, the brigadiers enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and regarded their own territories as \\"their personal fiefdoms\\". [ref: Loyalists. Peter Taylor. p.199]. The UDA remained legal until 10 August 1992 when it was proscribed by the British Government. Young came from the loyalist Donegall Pass area and was a local UDA commander.\\"Ann Ogilby was beaten to death by a gang of UDA women - why would they come forward and tell all now?\\" Belfast Telegraph. Henry McDonald. 1 December 2013 Retrieved 2 May 2015 He told Ogilby his marriage had already broken up and that his divorce hadn't been finalised. Ogilby by that time had three children by two different men: Sharlene, and twins Stephen and Gary. The boys had been put up for adoption after their birth, leaving only the eldest child, her daughter Sharlene, in her care.\\"I heard mum beg for mercy\\". Sunday Life. Ciar√°n Barnes. 7 February 2010 Retrieved 25 December 2011 When Young was interned inside the Maze Prison in 1973, she often visited him. He complained that his estranged wife, Elizabeth never sent him food parcels, despite her having been provided with money by the Loyalist Prisoners' Association (LPA). The LPA was unaware of the Young couple's estrangement. The delivery of food parcels by women to imprisoned members was a long-established practice by the UDA and a \\"particular source of pride for the organisation\\".McEvoy, p.14 Ogilby was required to make up and send him the food parcels herself which she felt was an imposition as these had to come out of her own money, although she was almost destitute. When Ogilby mistakenly repeated Young's complaint in a Sandy Row pub, the local Sandy Row women's UDA unit (of which Elizabeth was a member) overheard her words and became violently angry, especially as Elizabeth was able to prove that she had been sending her husband food parcels. Ogilby's comments were regarded by the women's UDA as a grievous insult to its integrity, as the unit was responsible for the assembly and distribution of the parcels. The group was already antagonistic due to Ogilby's affair with Young, and her defamatory remarks only added fuel to their wrath. The women considered her behaviour in public immoral, ostentatious, and extremely unconventional because she frequented clubs and pubs on her own instead of with female friends which was the custom in Sandy Row. Furthermore, they believed her loud, outspoken and maverick personality, status as an unmarried mother, and habit of what was described by a local as \\"flaunting herself\\" was a cultural infraction that brought shame upon their community. Sandy Row, south Belfast, where loyalist paramilitaries have always had a strong presence since the early days of the Troubles Social milieu Sandy Row is an Ulster Protestant working class enclave just south of Belfast city centre closely affiliated with the Orange Order whose 12 July parades are gaudy, elaborate events made notable by the traditional Orange Arches erected for the occasion.Murphy, Dervla (1979). A Place Apart. Harmondsworth: Penguin. p.288 Prior to late 20th-century urban redevelopment beginning in the 1980s, rows of 19th-century terraced houses lined the streets and backstreets that branched off the main commercial thoroughfare. Loyalist paramilitaries have had an active presence there since the early days of the Troubles. By 1974, the violent ethno-political conflict waged between the Protestant unionists and Catholic Irish nationalists was six years old and showed no sign of abating; bombings, shootings, sectarian murders, intimidation, security alerts and military patrols were a daily feature of life in Belfast and the rest of Northern Ireland. There was no family in working-class areas of Belfast that remained unscathed by the Troubles or insusceptible to the effects of the disorder, tension and carnage.McEvoy, p.13 The Provisional Irish Republican Army's bombing campaign had escalated sharply in 1972 and began to increasingly target Belfast city centre, often with lethal consequences such as on Bloody Friday on 21 July 1972, when the Provisional IRA exploded 22 bombs across the city, killing nine people and injuring over 100. This led to the erection of steel gates, manned by the British Army, thus effectively putting a security cordon or \\"ring of steel\\" around the city centre,Clarke, R.V.G; Newman, Graham R. (2006). Outsmarting the Terrorists. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Publishing Group.171 which resulted in both Protestants and Catholics retreating further into segregated neighbourhoods, which rapidly fell under the sway of local paramilitary groups who exerted a strong influence in their respective districts.Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. p.126 These groups also assumed the role of policing their communities and rooting out what they described as anti-social elements. In the February 1974 edition of Ulster Loyalist, a UDA publication, the UDA warned that it intended to take firm action against teenaged criminals and vandals in the Sandy Row and Village areas. Robert Fisk, Belfast correspondent for The Times between the years 1972-75, regarded the Sandy Row UDA as having been one of the most truculent of all paramilitary outfits in Belfast. Their bellicose stance over the street barricades they erected during the Ulster Workers Council Strike in May 1974 almost led them into direct confrontation with the British Army and they had even made preparations to fight if the latter had smashed the UDA roadblocks. The Sandy Row UDA's commander during this volatile period was Sammy Murphy who used as his headquarters the local Orange Hall. In addition to Sandy Row, Murphy had overall command of the South Belfast UDA and was referred to as a community leader in the British Army's press releases although his name and paramilitary affiliation were not mentioned. To defuse the explosive situation, Murphy engaged in talks with the Army which proved successful.Fisk, Robert (1975). The Point of No Return: the strike which broke the British in Ulster. London: Times Books. pp.145-148 According to journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, the Sandy Row and Donegall Pass UDA were almost completely out of control by this time; both the male and female members were caught up in violence and drunkenness and already inured to beatings and killings. Drinking clubs or shebeens where alcohol was obtained cheaply were common features in the area. Author David M. Kiely suggested that by this stage the women's unit was more about gangsterism and mob rule than adhering to a political cause. The Sandy Row unit was not the only women's unit within the UDA. There was a particularly active women's group on the Shankill Road which had been established by Wendy \\"Bucket\\" Millar as the first UDA women's unit. A number of the members were highly visible due to the beehive hairstyles they typically wore.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, Plc. p.136 Although each unit was independent of the others, Jean Moore and later Hester Dunn served as the overall leaders of the UDA's women's department at the UDA headquarters in Gawn Street, east Belfast.Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973). Political murder in Northern Ireland. Penguin. p.232 Tanya Higgins and Nancy Brown Diggs observed in their book Women Living in Conflict that the loyalist paramilitary women were \\"angrier and more militant\\" than their male counterparts.Higgins, Tanya; Diggs, Nancy Brown (2000). Women Living in Conflict. Women's Studies28. pp-20-60 Another analysis was provided by Sandra McEvoy in her report Women Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland: Duty, Agency and Empowerment - a Report from the Field in which she suggested that by joining paramilitary groups like the UDA, loyalist women were provided with a sense of freedom and personal and political power that had previously been denied them in the domestic sphere; furthermore by taking up \\"the gun\\", the women proved they were willing to go to prison for their beliefs and the loyalist cause.McEvoy, p.10 The commander of the Sandy Row women's unit was Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Douglas, described by Kiely as having revered power above everything else in her life. As leader of that particular unit she exerted a great deal of control over the lives of other women within the area that included intimidation and moral policing. The middle of three daughters, Douglas was born and raised in an impoverished working-class family. She married at the age of 17 and had four children. By 1974, Douglas (aged 40) who lived in a terraced house in Sandy Row's City Street had a criminal record dating back over ten years for various offences which included smuggling, forgery, assault, inflicting bodily harm and running a brothel. When Ogilby had publicly denounced the women's UDA over the food parcels, she was not fully aware of Douglas' violent character and the considerable amount of authority she wielded in Sandy Row. Kangaroo court On 23 July 1974, eight weeks after Ogilby gave birth to a premature son, Derek, fathered by Young, five UDA women, including her lover's wife Elizabeth Young (32), Kathleen Whitla (49, the second-in-command), Josephine Brown (18), Elizabeth Douglas (19), led by the latter's mother, commander Lily Douglas, abducted Ogilby from a friend's house in the Suffolk housing estate. They took her back to Sandy Row and put her before a kangaroo court held inside the disused Warwick's Bakery in 114 Hunter Street between Felt Street and Oswald Street, which had been converted into a UDA club. Ogilby had often frequented the club with Young on previous occasions prior to his internment; according to Kiely she had enjoyed the company of the other patrons and being part of the camaraderie of loyalists \\"against the Fenians\\". A total of eight women and two men presided over this \\"trial\\"; Elizabeth Young, however, had by then absented herself as she was not part of Douglas' \\"Heavy Squad\\". The \\"Heavy Squad\\" were the members of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit who meted out punishment beatings by Douglas' orders. Ogilby was grilled for an hour over her affair with Young and regarding her calumnies over the food parcels. At some stage, Douglas told her, \\"We have rules here. We all stick to them and I expect anybody new to do the same\\". Ogilby, by now frightened at the predicament in which she found herself, was additionally informed that if found guilty, she would be subjected to a \\"rompering\\". The notorious UDA \\"romper rooms\\" had been invented in the early 1970s by UDA North Belfast Brigadier Davy Payne.\\"Death in Details\\". The Scotsman. Simon Pia. 10 July 2003 Retrieved 26 December 2011 Named after the children's television programme, these \\"romper rooms\\" were located inside vacant buildings, warehouses, lock-up garages, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be \\"rompered\\" (beaten and tortured) before being killed. Although most of the victims were Catholics, many Protestants were also consigned to the \\"romper rooms\\".Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. pp. 26, 146 Despite the UDA women having found Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men present at the \\"trial\\" couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where she got on a bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then \\"rearrested\\" her. It was alleged that this decision came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, \\"Who does she think she is? The Queen?\\" which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it pulled out of the station into the street, Douglas and her \\"Heavy Squad\\" then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed they were on their way to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that \\"It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around\\". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area.Lily Douglas came from City Street, Henrietta Piper Cowan came from Teutonic Street, Josephine Agnes Brown from Blythe Street; located in Sandy Row. The others had Sandy Row addresses as well with the exception of Christine Kathleen Smith who lived in Tates Avenue, which is in the neighbouring Village area and Kathleen Whitla of Howard Street South in Donegall Pass. [ref: Ciaran Barnes. Andersonstown News] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder. \\"Romper room\\" beating That same Wednesday 24 July 1974 at 3:30 pm, outside the Social Services office in Shaftesbury Square, Ogilby and her daughter were kidnapped by 25-year-old UDA man Albert \\"Bumper\\" Graham, while members of Lily Douglas' \\"Heavy Squad\\" waited at the nearby Regency Hotel lounge bar overlooking the office. They knew beforehand that Ogilby had an appointment that afternoon at the Shaftesbury Square office. Using the pretext that a UDA commander wished to speak with her, Graham was able to abduct Ogilby and her daughter Sharlene as they left the office; Ogilby, taken in by Graham's words, willingly got into his blue minibus. Having made a pre-arranged signal to the watching women, Graham drove the two females away to the UDA club in Hunter Street, Sandy Row, which had been turned into a \\"romper room\\". When the UDA women, led by Douglas, arrived on the scene, Ogilby tried to escape, but was grabbed and forcibly detained. After Graham sent Sharlene to a corner shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was ordered by Douglas to be dragged inside the former bakery and forced upstairs to the first floor where she was made to sit on a wooden bench, blindfolded and a hood placed over her head.McKittrick, David (1999).Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children Who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Mainstream. p.468 By this stage, Ogilby was so intimidated and terrorised by the \\"Heavy Squad\\", she no longer put up any resistance.Richards; A. P. (2003). Irish Murders. Geddes & Grosset. p.134 Sunday Life newspaper suggested that she was bound to a chair instead of a bench. Ciar√°n Barnes, a journalist writing for the paper, had conducted an interview with Sharlene Ogilby in 2010. Retired RUC detective, Alan Simpson, who devoted a chapter to the Ann Ogilby murder in his 1999 book Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles, instead affirmed that Ogilby was forced by her captors to sit on a wooden bench. Although hooded and blindfolded, her hands remained untied. Acting under earlier instructions by Douglas, who had remained downstairs, to give Ogilby a \\"good rompering\\", two members of the \\"Heavy Squad\\", teenagers Henrietta Piper Cowan (17) and Christine Smith (16), both of whom were wearing masks, proceeded to attack Ogilby. Cowan punched her forcefully in the face, knocking her to the floor. Ogilby was then kicked in the face, head, and stomach by both girls before blows from sticks were rained down upon her. When the two teenagers began battering Ogilby's face and head with bricks which had been lying about the dismantled bakery, Albert Graham and \\"Heavy Squad\\" member Josephine Brown (who was also masked), saw Ogilby's blood staining the hood and realising things had gone too far, started to panic and remonstrated with the girls to discontinue the beating. Cowan and Smith did stop, to smoke cigarettes and make plans to attend a disco that evening. Simpson suggested that during the attack, Ogilby had placed her hands inside the hood in a futile attempt to protect her face from the force of the bricks. Meanwhile, Ogilby's daughter, Sharlene, had returned from the shops; she entered the club, climbed the stairs to the first floor and began banging on the door and crying for her mother. Although by this stage Ogilby had sustained severe head injuries from the brutal assault, Sharlene heard her screaming and pleading with her assailants for mercy while they danced to blaring disco music. Ignoring the injured woman's pleas for her life and Sharlene's cries, Henrietta Cowan, once again wielding a brick, resumed beating Ogilby on the head with renewed vigour until she lay dead on the floor. The beating session had lasted for over an hour. Ogilby received (according to the later autopsy report) a total of 24 blows to the head and body with a blunt object, 14 of which had caused \\"a severe fracture to the bulk of the skull\\". Albert Graham took Sharlene out of the building and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Lily Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up and went out to the disco as planned. Immediate aftermath M1 motorway at Stockman's Lane close to where Ann Ogilby's body was found Douglas arranged for the body's disposal and unnamed UDA men later loaded it onto a van and dumped it in a ditch in Stockman's Lane near the M1 motorway.Although Lily Douglas admitted to the CID that she made the necessary arrangements for the disposal of Ann Ogilby's body, she refused to give the names of the men who carried out the removal. Ciaran Barnes alleged that Sandy Row UDA commander Sammy Murphy (now deceased) was involved. [ref=\\"Sunday Life. Ciaran Barnes] It was discovered five days later on 29 July by motorway maintenance men. The RUC were immediately called to the scene which was then photographed and mapped. Ogilby, clad in a red jumper, grey trousers and wearing just one shoe, was lying on her back partly submerged in 18 inches of stagnant water with her blackened and battered face visible and her arms outstretched. Her missing shoe and a large brown sack were discovered not far away from her body at the top of the ditch. There were no identifying documents found on her. The press, along with local television and radio news bulletins, released details regarding her physical appearance and the distinctive rings on her fingers. Hours later, a social worker from the Shaftesbury Square Social Services office, who had been scheduled to meet with Ann Ogilby on 24 July, contacted the RUC telling them that Ogilby and her daughter Sharlene had arrived at the office late for the appointment but left without explanation before the social worker could speak with Ann. She informed the RUC that Ogilby had not been seen since that afternoon. The social worker was then taken to the mortuary where she confirmed that the dead woman inside was Ann Ogilby. One of Ogilby's brothers later positively identified her. The police were told Sharlene was in the care of Social Services. Due to the location of the body, the murder investigation was allocated to the RUC B Division (West Belfast), based at the Springfield Road station where CID Detective Alan Simpson served. He formed part of the CID team set up to investigate the Ogilby killing. After Sharlene was located in a children's home, she was interviewed by a female detective; she clearly remembered the events of 24 July. It was arranged for Sharlene to accompany three CID detectives in a car to Sandy Row and she was able to direct them to the disused bakery in Hunter Street. A Scenes of Crime Officer was sent to the scene to examine the building's interior and collect the evidence. Forensics later showed that the bloodstains police detectives found on the floor and on the items retrieved from inside the UDA club matched Ogilby's blood group. Documents were also found on the premises bearing William Young's name. By that time the suspects had already been rounded up and taken in for interrogation. These were the eight women who had been inside the car with Ogilby on the evening of 23 July following the fracas outside the Glengall Street bus station. Ann Ogilby's grave at Umgall Cemetery Ogilby, aged 31 or 32 at the time of her death, was buried in Umgall Cemetery, Templepatrick, County Antrim. Her children Sharlene and Derek were put into care. The Ogilby family received only ¬£149 compensation from the State to cover her funeral expenses. It was later revealed that Ogilby had planned to relocate to Edinburgh, Scotland as soon as her infant son, Derek, was released from hospital (on account of his premature birth). Reactions Ogilby's murder caused widespread revulsion and shock throughout Northern Ireland, even though it had taken place during the most turbulent period of the Troubles when bombings and sectarian killings had become commonplace. Protestants were especially appalled that Ogilby, herself a Protestant, had become a victim of loyalist violence and angrily denounced the UDA. Journalist Ciar√°n Barnes described it as being one of the most brutal murders of the Troubles; adding that its sheer savagery and the fact that it was carried out by women against another woman within earshot of her child left a lasting impression upon the public psyche. The UDA leadership had not sanctioned the killing; and there was general condemnation from the UDA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. According to Ian S. Wood, the UDA's commander Andy Tyrie had not sufficient control over the many units that comprised the UDA to have been able to prevent the punishment beating from being carried out. A spokesman for the UDA released a statement condemning the killing and the women's unit that carried it out which was first published in the Irish Times on 8 February 1975: > We have completely disowned them [Sandy Row women's UDA]. We think the whole > affair was foul and sickening. Ogilby was cleared by the UDA of an > allegation about her private life long before she was killed. The killing > was an act of jealousy by a group of women. Following the Ogilby attack, the Sandy Row women's UDA unit was permanently disbanded by the UDA leadership. None of the other UDA women's units had consented to or been aware of the fatal punishment beating until it was reported in the news. Additionally, the Sandy Row women's unit notwithstanding, UDA \\"romper rooms\\" were more commonly used by male members of the organisation than by their female counterparts.McEvoy, p.12 Journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack described Ogilby's death as typical of the \\"brutish ... culture\\" that dominated the UDA and other paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. In reference to this attack and other cases of \\"rompering\\", the authors argue that \\"rape and the beating and humiliation of women in working-class Belfast was as routine as gunfire but was subsumed in the maelstrom of violence engulfing the North\\". Convictions Armagh Women's Prison. Ann Ogilby's killers were imprisoned here after being convicted of her murder. Albert Graham was sent to the Maze Prison. Within weeks of the killing, the RUC had arrested ten women and one man in connection with the murder; this group contained Douglas' entire \\"Heavy Squad\\". Most of the women were unemployed and at least three had male relatives imprisoned for paramilitary offences.McEvoy, p. 18 On 6 February 1975 at the Belfast City Commission, teenagers Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith pleaded guilty to murder. They were now aged 18 and 17 respectively. Characterised as having been \\"without feeling or remorse\\", they were convicted of carrying out the murder and sentenced to be detained at Armagh Women's Prison for life at the pleasure of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Smith was not the only member of her family to be involved in loyalist paramilitary activity. Her elder brother, prominent South Belfast UDA member Francis \\"Hatchet\\" Smith (28), was shot dead in Rodney Parade, off Donegall Road, by the IRA in January 1973 after he, as part of a UDA unit, gunned down Peter Watterson, a 15-year- old Catholic boy, in a drive-by sectarian shooting at the Falls Road/Donegall Road junction. A roofer by trade who was married with one childMcKittrick, David (1999). Lost Lives. UK: Mainstream. p. 320 he was (despite his wife having been Catholic),Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973). Political Murder in Northern Ireland. Penguin. p.179 the local UDA commander in the Village area where he lived. Described to the court as the leader of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit, Lily Douglas who had ordered the fatal punishment beating, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The charge of murder was withdrawn on the grounds that she had not actually intended for her \\"Heavy Squad\\" to kill Ogilby and she was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in Armagh Prison. She received two further sentences (which were to run concurrently with her 10 years) of three years each, for intimidation and detaining Ogilby against her will. The exact motive for the murder was not established in court. During police interrogation, Douglas maintained that Ogilby's killing was the result of a personal vendetta, stating \\"It was not a UDA operation, they had nothing to do with it. It was just a move between a lot of women, a personal thing\\". In his book The Protestants of Ulster which was published in 1976, Geoffrey Bell stated that the women murdered her as punishment for her affair with William Young.Bell, Geoffrey (1976). The Protestants of Ulster. Pluto Press. p.55 Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack suggested that jealousy and bloodlust were the motives for the murder. The others received lesser sentences: Albert Graham and Josephine Brown, after pleading guilty, were sentenced to three years imprisonment on charges of being accessories after the fact and causing grievous bodily harm to Ann Ogilby; the Crown withdrew the murder charge against the pair after recognising their attempt to prevent Cowan and Smith from continuing with the fatal beating. The unit's second-in- command, Kathleen Whitla was given two years for intimidation; Maud Tait (21), Anne Gracey (28), Elizabeth Douglas, Jr (19) and Marie Lendrum (23), were all sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for intimidation, and an unnamed 16-year- old was given an 18-months suspended sentence for intimidation. The convictions resulted in the largest single ingress of loyalist women into a Northern Ireland prison.Corcoran, Mary S. (2006). Out of Order: the political imprisonment of women in Northern Ireland, 1972-98. Willan. p. 136 Denouncing the UDA, the trial judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, \\"What appears before me today under the name of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising organisation of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation\\".\\"Battered and dumped in Stockman's Lane, murder still has power to shock\\". Andersonstown News. Ciar√°n Barnes. 24 July 2008 During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court \\"trial\\". Lily Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, \\"You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When you heard what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character.\\" The Northern Irish press dubbed Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Douglas \\"the Sandy Row executioner\\". Aftermath Sharlene Ogilby later married and has three children of her own. After her mother's murder, she was taken to live in Sion Mills by an uncle and aunt. For a while she kept in touch with her brother Gary but has since lost contact; she has no knowledge of what happened to her other brothers Stephen and Derek.\\"The appalling murder of Ann Ogilby in Belfast\\". The Carlow Nationalist. 11 February 2015 Retrieved 21 April 2015 Lily\\" Douglas died shortly after being released from Armagh Prison on compassionate grounds in 1979; Kathleen Whitla is also deceased. Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith were both released from Armagh in December 1983 after serving nine years. They returned to the Sandy Row area. Loyalist sources claimed Smith \\"deeply regretted\\" the part she played in Ogilby's murder. Graham, following his release from prison, also returned to south Belfast. To the present day he has steadfastly refused to discuss the murder. The rest of the women involved in Ogilby's murder are to date living in Sandy Row or the Village. William Young died in 2007. The disused bakery in Hunter Street has since been demolished. Belfast poet Linda Anderson wrote a poem, Gang-Bang Ulster Style, based on the Ogilby killing. It was published in the August 1989, no. 204 edition of Spare Rib.Deane, Seamus; Carpenter, Andrew; Williams, Jonathan (2002). The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing Vol. 5: Irish Women's Writing and Traditions. New York: New York University Press. p. The 'Romper Room'1507 Ann Ogilby's murder also featured in a Gavin Ewart poem entitled, The Gentle Sex (1974).Ewart, Gavin (2012). Selected Poems 1933-1993. Random House. The murder was investigated by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), which was established by the PSNI to inquire into the most controversial killings perpetrated during the Troubles.

It was established on 1 December 2011 and replaced the Russian Space Forces. The ASDFB was first commanded by former Space Forces commander Colonel General Oleg Ostapenko, who was promoted to Deputy Minister of Defence in November 2012. On 24 December 2012, Aleksandr Golovko was appointed the new commander. Although it is officially translated as aerospace in English, it covers both attacks from the air and from (outer) space, and some Russian writers translate it as \\"air and space\\" instead. On 1 August 2015, the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces were merged to form the Russian Aerospace Forces. The Russian Aerospace Defence Forces duties for space defense are now with the Russian Space Forces under the umbrella of the new Russian Aerospace Forces. The RADF today only provides air defense responsibilities. History The Aerospace Defence Forces trace their heritage to the Space Operations Section, Strategic Operations Branch of the Supreme High Command Reserve Artillery, formed in 1955, and transformed into the Space Services Central Administration of the Strategic Missile Forces in 1964 (and later the Chief Space Operations Directoriate in 1972). In 1967 the Anti-Missile and Space Defence Forces were formed () under Artillery Lieutenant General Yu. Votintsev. They were reorganised as the Ministry of Defence Space Service Units in 1982, and were expanded to include the Chief Space Operations Directorate in 1986. In 1991 the Soviet Union was broken up. The Russian Armed Forces were established on 7 May 1992, enabling the creation of Russian Space Forces later that year on 10 August. They were merged with the Strategic Missile Troops in 1996, but were reformed in 2001. In 2006 President Vladimir Putin agreed with the idea of a new \\"Air and Space Defence Concept\\" from 2016, but without the implication that it would be a separate service. In 2008 Aleksandr Zelin argued that the missile defence and space defence forces should be merged into the Air Force. On 30 November 2010 President Dmitry Medvedev said that air and space defence services would be under a single strategic command and the General Staff and Ministry of Defence had decided it would be on the basis of the Space Forces. In April 2011 the then Space Forces commander Oleg Ostapenko said that concept for the future system had been approved. The service was created by the presidential decree \\"On changes to the composition of the Russian Armed Forces until January 1, 2016\\" which has not been published. Thus, on 1 December 2011, the Space Forces became the Aerospace Defence Forces, fusing all space and some air defence components into one joint service. On 1 August 2015, the ADF was merged with the Russian Air Force to form the Russian Aerospace Forces, by orders of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, and upon the recommendation of the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu. It is today a service speciality corps within the Aerospace Forces with responsibility for the aerospace defense of Russian territory. Organisation Lekhtusi Radar Station Until 12 August 2015 the Aerospace Defence Forces was organized into 2 commands: the Air and Space Defence Command; and the Space Command. The structure was as follows: *Space Command (): **153rd Main Trial Centre for Testing and Control of Space Means named after G.S.

Deputy Defence Minister Yury Borisov said on that month that the military would invest 2 trillion rubles ($55.3 billion) in building up its aerospace defence weapons over the next six years to ensure they are capable of thwarting existing and future types of air and space attacks. The Aerospace Defence Forces had locations across Russia and bases in some Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as early warning radars in Azerbaijan (until December 2012), Kazakhstan and Belarus, and the Okno facility in Tajikistan. For a more detailed list of air bases now used by the Russian Aerospace Forces, see List of Soviet Air Force bases Facilities Until 2015 the VKO operated the following facilities for aerospace defence operations, with the merger of the Air Force it also now handles the operations of Russia's hundreds of air defense bases and air defense units as well.

Life  Frederick Charles of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was born in Rudolstadt, the son of Prince Louis G√ºnther II of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and his wife Sophie Henriette, born Countess Reuss of Untergreiz (1711‚Äì1771). As a child, he began his natural history collection, which later went to the Natural History Museum of Rudolstadt. In 1757, he created the Princely Natural History Collection at the Ludwigsburg Castle in Rudolstadt. The collection was later enlarged, and in the 19th century, it occupied seven rooms in the castle. One of the first supervisors of the collection was Christoph Ludwig K√§mmerer. In 1919, the collection was moved to Heidecksburg Castle. Frederick Charles of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt corresponded with Johann Heinrich Merck, among others, and let him have some rhinoceros bones and other pieces from his collection for research.Ulrike Leuschner (ed.), Johann Heinrich Merck.

Biography He was born in 1901 to a prominent Bosniak merchant family in Bijeljina, Bosnia. His parents were Sulejman and Munevera. He had two brothers, Osman and Mehmedalija and one sister, Safija. Military career Beginnings At the beginning of the First World War, during the mobilisation of the Austro- Hungarian Army, Adem Mesiƒá with his own funds, Mesiƒá mobilised 450 volunteer troops and stationed them on the Austria-Hungary border on the river Drina. Dervi≈°eviƒá's brother, Mehmed, joined the group and was later promoted to captain. At age eleven, Elez left school to defend Austria-Hungary with Mehmed.\\"Tomes, Jason. King Zog of Albania: Europe's Self-Made Muslim Monarch, 2003 (), page.33. Battles of the Isonzo When Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, the 91st Czech Infantry Battalion was ordered to Soƒça. The teenaged Dervi≈°eviƒá volunteered to help the Czech infantry at Soƒça supplying food for the battalion. The Czech officer stationed there, Alois Martinek, asked the local Protection Corps commander to help guide him via the river Sava and the region of Slavonia, to which he agreed. However, Dervi≈°eviƒá abandoned his task to jump on the train with the army to become a soldier. He was discovered only after he got to Soƒça. After hearing of this, Martinek ordered him off the front line. At first, Dervi≈°eviƒá was a courier. Then a commander brought him to see the Bosniak forces in action. From a safe distance he watched as the Third Regiment of the Bosniak attacked and overran the Italian positions. Dervi≈°eviƒá and an officer captured three Italian soldiers, and because of this the boy was promoted to corporal. At fourteen he was the youngest soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After nineteen months of service Dervi≈°eviƒá was hit by shrapnel in the lower jaw and Martinek sent him to a hospital in Vienna. When he recovered he was stationed in Wielburg castle. He took care of the Ernsthaler family, who enrolled him in cadet school in Bratislava.Neumayer p. 262. After the war At the end of the First World War, Dervi≈°eviƒá returned to Bijeljina. The new Kingdom of Yugoslavia wanted to promote peace and unity, thus any demoblised Bosniak soldier of the Austro-Hungarian army, which had attacked the Kingdom of Serbia without aprobable cause, was given clemency, meaning that they were allowed to return to their homes without any hindrance, and would be treated as Yugoslav subjects. Upon arriving he was greeted by the mother and the brother of Osman Munevera. In 1925 he visited the Ernsthaler family and the Archduchess Isabella who lived in Hungary. As a gift from her, he received 5,000 florins. He used the money to start an agricultural export company. He became a successful entrepreneur in Kingdom of Yugoslavia and his business flourished until the Second World War. After the end of war he went to Syria, where he took the rank of major in the reserves of the Syrian Army. He died in Syria in 1988. He is buried in Damascus. He was survived by two daughters and two sons. Military decoration For his service in the First World War, Elez Dervi≈°eviƒá received the Silver Medal for Bravery 2nd class, the Bronze Medal for Bravery and the Medal of Military Merit, all from countries that were defeated in the war.

Biography  Oleg Skrypka was born in Sovietobad (now Ghafurov, Tajikistan). His father Yuri Pavlovich (died 30 August 2015), a radiologist, came from , a village in the Poltava region of Ukraine. His mother Anna Alekseevna, a teacher, came from a small village in the Kursk region of Russia. In 1972, the Skrypka family moved to the Murmansk region of Russia, due to Anna not liking the Tajik climate. In 1987, he graduated from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, founding the rock group Vopli Vidopliassova (VV) that same year with Yuri Zdorenko and Alexander Pipa of the heavy metal band SOS and mutual friend Serhiy Sakhno. In 1987, VV became a member of the Kiev rock club, won the first prize at the Kiev rock festival \\"Rock-parade\\", released their hit \\"–¢–∞–Ω—Üi\\" (\\"dancing\\", or \\"dances\\"). In 1990, the group took a tour of France and Switzerland, during which time one of France's largest newspapers, Le Monde, published material about VV. From 1991 to 1996, Oleg Skrypka, together with his group, lived in France, and toured the country. In 1993, Zdorenko and Sakhno left and Skripka replaced them with French musicians. Sakhno would return in 1997. In 1996, he returned to Kiev and since then has been playing many concerts in Ukraine and abroad. Before 2014, he regularly visited Moscow. In 2000, VV performed in Riga, London, gave a concert in the Moscow Palace of Youth, after that - a tour around the cities of Siberia. In January 2002 the group toured Israel and Portugal, and in February of the same year gave several concerts in New York. In 2003, they performed in Toronto. In 2004, Skrypka was one of the organizers of the festival Krayina Mriy, the festival began its history 14 years after the song and ten years after the album \\"VV\\" with the same name. Under the auspices of \\"Krayina Mriy\\" Oleg Skrypka also involved in publishing and versatile educational activities. Skrypka is the founder of another festival of modern Ukrainian rock music - \\"Rock Sich\\". The main purpose of the festival - to support the national rock culture. This capital and the only festival where both the three stages heard Ukrainian rock music. (In 2010, \\"Rock Sich\\" has acquired the status of an environmental festival. And from 2013 the festival gained international status, becoming a Swedish-Ukrainian). In 2007, Skrypka won the second place in the project \\"Dances with the stars 2\\". In 2009, a group of activists attempted to nominate Skrypka as a candidate for President of Ukraine, but he refused the nomination. He speaks fluently Ukrainian, Russian, English and French. His first language was Russian - his first exposure to Ukrainian came in 1974, when he went on a family holiday to Giltsi. He did not become fluent in Ukrainian until 1994.  Controversy  In 2014, Skripka stated in an interview with Rossiiskaya gazeta that he and Vopli Vidopliassova would no longer perform in Russia. Later that year, he pulled out of a concert in London that also featured popular Russian singer Valeriya, stating that he would not perform in Russia or alongside Russians \\"as long as Russia and Ukraine are at war\\". In 2016, Skrypka and numerous other Ukrainian entertainers lobbied President Petro Poroshenko to ban broadcasting of Russian film and music in the country, as well as banning the import of Russian film and music. In April 2017, he was recorded stating that people who don't speak Ukrainian have \\"low IQs\\" and should be sent to \\"ghettoes\\". He denied making those remarks, but the recording surfaced.Russian-language news article about the ghetto scandal, including the recording On the 22nd of that month, Skripka was called by Russian prankster Vladimir Kuznetsov, of Vovan and Lexus fame, who introduced himself as Arsen Avakov, the Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs. During the conversation with \\"Avakov\\", Skripka was questioned about his comments, and also accused the newspaper Ukrainskaya Pravda of taking his words out of context. He did not issue a formal apology until later that night, when he realised he had been the victim of a prank. In his apology, he also stated that the prank call was not a \\"provocation\\" against him, but against all Ukraine.News article about Skripka's reaction to the prank callSkripka's apology, in Ukrainian  Discography  * 2001 ‚Äî Inkoly (–Ü–Ω–∫–æ–ª–∏) * 2004 ‚Äî Vidrada (–í—ñ–¥—Ä–∞–¥–∞) * 2009 ‚Äî Serce u mene vrazilve (–°–µ—Ä—Ü–µ —É –ú–µ–Ω–µ –í—Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏–≤–µ) * 2010 ‚Äî Shchedryk (–©–µ–¥—Ä–∏–∫) * 2011 ‚Äî Jorjina (–ñ–æ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω–∞) * 2011 ‚Äî Humanisty (feat.

It sank with considerable loss of life on the east coast of Australia in 1895. Early years Catterthun was built at the Doxford shipyard in Sunderland, England, and launched in April 1881 for the Eastern and Australian Steamship Company. With an iron hull, it displaced gross and was long. Propulsion was supplied by a 250 hp twin cylinder engine powered by two coal-fired boilers. The ship arrived in Australia in August 1881 having travelled via Suez, Singapore, China, and New Guinea under the command of Captain J. Miller. For several years, it plied between Australia and China, taking cargoes of gold to China and returning with tea. Approximately 40 passengers could be carried, and its crew were predominantly Chinese crew as well as some freed East African slaves. Final voyage Catterthun left Sydney on 7 August 1895, bound for Hong Kong with several European passengers and a few dozen Chinese. The ship ran into a gale just after midnight near Point Stephens Lighthouse. A few hours later, near Seal Rocks, it hit a reef and was badly damaged. Noting the amount of water in the hold, the captain ordered the preparation of the lifeboats but this information was not passed on to the passengers or most of the crew. The strong seas swept the captain and two crew off the deck as the lifeboats were being launched. The ship sank twenty minutes after hitting the reef. Fifty-five people lost their lives. One lifeboat with 26 survivors made it safely to shore with assistance from a local sailing boat. Rescue efforts were hampered by the bad weather, and two more crewmen were found two days later in a lifeboat. Salvage Plans for the salvage of the gold cargo began almost immediately. The number of gold sovereigns on board was variously stated as being 8,000, 9,000, or as many as 11,000. The operation started in mid August 1895. Of the approximately 8,000 gold coins, over 1,000 were not found. It has been suggested that they may have been kept by the dive operators and not turned over to the owners. In the 1960s and 70s, further attempts were made to find the missing gold, but these operations were (at least publicly) unsuccessful. The wreck now lies in 60 metres of water and is a popular dive site for recreational divers.

Sheshadri starring Suchendra Prasad, Rameshwari Varma and H. G. Dattatreya. The story is based on Jnanpith awardee K. Shivaram Karanth's novel. It depicts the tradition of people living in remote areas of Western Ghats during pre- Independence days in India. Story The story happens in around early forties. A young freedom fighter Shivaramu, lost in jungle while he travels to a place near Subramanya, meets two villagers called Deranna and Bhatya. They advice Shivaramu to stay in the house of Gopalayya, a Brahmin living with his wife Shankaramma in Kelabailu. The couple treats Shivaramu well and asks him to stay for couple of more days. They express that their son Shambhu had left them years back. They treat Shivaramu as their own son. During the stay, Gopalayya narrates the story of his past. Recalls his hardworking days of making a beautiful crop field beside mountain. Shivaramu slowly gets clear introduction to the legendary personality of Gopalayya. Shivaramu gets more curious at his attitude of fighting against nature to build his dreams in a place called Katumule. Meanwhile, Shivaramu meets Narayana, his wife Laxmi and their kids, living in Katumule. They feel that Shivaramu could be a person sent by Shambhu. Narayana also expresses that Shambhu's return may cause them to leave Katumule. So, Narayana plans to leave before that critical moment come and thinks of having his own land. Couple of days later Gopalayya says about his decision to transfer the property of Katumule to Narayana. Later while talking to Shivaramu, everyone gives their own explanation for Shambhu's disappearance. Laxmi talks about an incident which could be the reason for leaving. Narayana describes Shambhu as a crooked minded. Gopalayya describes that opposing Shambhu's decision to join freedom movement may be the reason for him to leave the place. At the same time Shankaramma also blames herself to be the reason for his riddance. Each character explores their hidden feelings in their own way with Shivaramu. Once Shivaramu finds Shambhu's photo and identifies him that he was also a comrade with him in freedom fighting, says he would try to find out Shambhu. When Shivaramu comes across an incident of villagers hunting a tiger, he requests and stops them from killing it. Finally he leaves the place Kelabailu, with a promise of finding Shambhu.

Vendrell's film is set in the colonial Mozambique of the 1950s and tells the story of teenage protagonist Rui Pedro's growing awareness of the injustices of colonial Mozambique. The story is set in the settlement of Bu√© Maria on the Pungwe River, in the central Mozambican province of Sofala. Distribution history The film premiered on 8 February in the X√©non cinema in Maputo and on 15 February in the S√£o Jorge and Quarteto cinemas of Lisbon. Vendrell's film is based on the short story ‚ÄúO Lento Gotejar da Luz‚Äù by Leite de Vasconcelos, a journalist and writer who grew up in Mozambique but left the country for political reasons Synopsis Rui Pedro is a fifty something man who returns to the ruins of the cotton plantation where he grew up in colonial Mozambique. In the almost silent opening to the film, Rui Pedro drives from one of the big cities of Mozambique, perhaps Beira, out to Bu√© Maria, where he spent his childhood and adolescence. There he finds the ruins of a house, which we later realize is the house in which he and his family once lived. Rui Pedro pitches camp by the river, where he encounters a young shepherd boy. Though the boy cannot speak Portuguese, Rui Pedro shares food and a cigarette with him. This meeting between the older white mana the young black boy foreshadows the relationship between Rui Pedro and Jacopo, the ferryman from his childhood. His visit recalls memories of his adolescence, and in particular a set of incidents that took place when he was fourteen and home from school for the summer break from school, dramatic incidence which would mark his life. The son of Portuguese colonists living amongst a small community of whites at a remote outpost in the bus, Rui Pedro has grown up shuttling between two ways of life, the European mores of his family and the African traditions of the workers his father manages. His life has wavered between the two banks of the nearby Pungue river, between the culture of the white settlers and that of the black natives, between the boss and the slaves, between violence and peace, between love and passion. After the Second World War, at a time when the other European powers were reluctantly making ready to decolonize, Portugal stepped up its involvement in its African territories. In Light Drops, as the colonial cotton company Rui Pedro's father works for forces through a bumper cotton harvest, much to the detriment of the local population. This exploitation at a general level is echoed in the relationship between Rui Pedro's cousin and his family's maid Ana, who is betrothed to Guinda, a local mechanic and froe. The violent end to their relationship foreshadows the violence to come in Mozambique. Main characters Rui Pedro Played by Lu√≠s Sarmento (Rui Pedro at 50) and Filipe Carvalho (Rui Pedro at 14), the protagonist finds his adolescent questions about identity, society, morality and sexuality played out against the ideology of a repressive colonial society. Jacopo Played by Amaral Matos, Jacopo is Rui Pedro's black 'father', who teaches him to respect nature and African culture but also gives the young boy his first experience of mercilessness. Jacopo is a ferryman, who mediates between the two banks of the river professionally and symbolically for Rui Pedro. Ana Played by Alexandra Antunes, Ana is Rui Pedro's family's maid, practically a sister to Rui Pedro and his mother's godchild. She is an assimilada, caught between European values she has been taught to adopt and African traditions which her community still expects her to obey. Her torn loyalties come to the fore in her relationship with Guinda and her attraction for Rui Pedro's cousin, X. Guinda Played by Alberto Magassela, Guinda is a local mechanic. He aspires to become an 'assimilado', yet is careful to follow traditional protocol in his engagement to Ana. Carlos Played by Marco d'Almeida, Carlos is Rui Pedro's older cousin. He is studying in South Africa, and has returned to Mozambique for his summer holidays with stiff racist attitudes which contrast with the relative racial tolerance of his family. On the cusp of adulthood, he is caught between the attitudes he has learnt in South Africa and his attraction for Ana. Dona Alice Played by Teresa Madruga, Dona Alice is Rui Pedro's mother. She fusses over her son, treats Ana almost like a surrogate daughter and expresses objections to colonialism (without, for all that, fundamentally challenging any of its suppositions. C√©sar Played by Ant√≥nio Fonseca, Rui Pedro's father is an ambiguous figure, caught between care and callousness, his awareness that colonialism is drawing to a close and his desire to make a success of his plantation, as per the orders of his colonial superiors.  Andrade e Castro Played by Carlos Gomes, Castro is a colonial administrator who visits the plantation. Isaura Played by Carla Bolito, another goddaughter of Rui Pedro's mother, Isaura is trapped in a loveless marriage with Barroso Barroso Played by Vitor Norte, Barroso is a trader from rural Portugal. Brutish towards his wife, he aims to make the most profit possible in his store, even if this means cheating his African customers.

The fifth Meridian spacecraft to be launched, Meridian 5 was to have been deployed into a Molniya orbit with an apogee of , a perigee of and 65 degrees of orbital inclination; from which it would have provided communications for the Russian military. It would have been operated by the newly formed Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. Meridian 5 was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with a Fregat upper stage, from Site 43/4 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch took place at 12:08 UTC on 23 December 2011, with the rocket performing nominally during first and second stage flight. At 288 seconds after launch, the Blok I third stage's RD-0124 engine ignited to begin its burn. During third stage flight, an anomaly occurred which prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. An official spokesman stated that the launch had been terminated 421 seconds into flight, by means of the rocket's thrust termination system. Telemetry recorded by NPO Lavochkin, however, indicated that the rocket had veered off course 425 seconds after launch, with data suggesting that there had been an explosion. Another report indicated that the engine had lost thrust 427 seconds after launch. It was the first orbital launch to be conducted by the Aerospace Defence Forces, which had been formed at the beginning of the month. Debris from the launch fell over the Novosibirsk Oblast in Siberia, near Ordynsk. One piece of debris fell through the roof of a house in Cosmonaut Street in the village of Vagaitsevo. Despite debris falling in residential areas, no injuries were reported.

In 1995, his habilitation on French post- modern theorist Roland Barthes was accepted at Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt. In 2001, Ette received the \\"Hugo Friedrich und Erich K√∂hler\\"-award for his work on Roland Barthes from Freiburg University. Twice, he has been granted fellowships in advanced-study institutions. He has lectured and taught in a number of Latin-American and European countries, as well as in the USA. He has been a full professor Romance literature and comparative literature in Potsdam since 1995. To Ottmar Ette, Romance philology is a wide-ranging and inclusive academic field of inquiry which connects a number of disciplines and languages as it tells us about literary knowledge of human life. Since 2013, Ottmar Ette is member of the Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 2014, he was elected as honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America. In 2014, Ottmar Ette received the Mexican Research Award \\"Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios\\" from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico.http://www.uni- potsdam.de/romanistik/ette/ette/aktuelles.html/ Ottmar Ette is Chevalier in the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques (France) since 2012. He has been a regular member of the Academia Europaea since 2010. Also in 2010, he was a fellow at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies. This was after having already received a fellowship at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin Institute for Advanced Study in 2004/2005. He has been involved in establishing a number of state-funded \\"Graduiertenkolleg\\"-graduate schools at German universities. He is a co-founder of a research-network on Latin-America in the wider Berlin area, ForLaBB (Forschungsverbund Lateinamerika Berlin- Brandenburg).http://www.lateinamerika-forschung-berlin-brandenburg.de/ He is founder and co-editor of the electronic journal HiN - Alexander von Humboldt im Netz () and an online platform dedicated to von Humboldt avhumboldt.de - Humboldt Informationen online. Ette is also co-editor of the journal Iberoamericana (Madrid - Frankfurt am Main). Since 2009, he has also been co- editor of the electronic journal Istmo (Revista virtual de estudios literarios y culturales centroamericanos, )ISSNISSN.  Research  The research and teaching of Ottmar Ette focus on: Alexander von Humboldt, literary studies as a science of life, living-together or \\"conviviality\\", and TransArea Studies: poetics of movement and Francophone and Hispanophone literatures inside and outside Europe.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/ette/profil.htm Ottmar Ette directs the Research Project on \\"Alexander von Humboldt's American Travel Diaries: Genealogy, Chronology, and Epistemology\\" (2014-2017) and, since 2015, an eighteen-year project on \\"Travelling Humboldt - Science on the Move\\" of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (http://www.bbaw.de/en/research/avh-r).  Interests and Influence  Ottmar Ette's programmatic essay \\"Literaturwissenschaft als Lebenswissenschaft - Eine Programmschrift im Jahr der Geisteswissenschaften\\"Lendemains. √âtudes compar√©es sur la France. Zeitschrift f√ºr vergleichende Frankreichforschung, 125. Gunter Narr, T√ºbingen 2007 p.7 - 32 sparked wide-ranging reactions and discussion in Germany. Among many other publications, the theme reappeared in the national weekly paper Die Zeit.Lendemains, op. cit., nos. 126/127, 128 and 129 and in Die Zeit The basic thrust of Ette's argument is to reconceptualize literary studies in terms of a science of life or \\"life science\\": \\"Lebenswissenschaft\\". Literature, Ette claims, is an essential repository of human knowledge on life, especially with respect to ethically relevant experiences such as living-together or \\"conviviality\\", migration and belonging, or survival in times of existential danger. The term \\"Lebenswissenschaft\\" is coined to oppose and call into question the increasing dominance of the biological or medical \\"life sciences\\", that have begun to monopolize and reduce concept and semantics of human life. Ette recently presented his argument in English in the Modern Language Association's PMLA.PMLA. Publications of the Modern Language Association of America (New York) CXXV, 4 (october 2010), pp. 977-993. Ottmar Ette has also received much attention for his work on and editions of the writings of Alexander von Humboldt. He is considered a leading specialist on Humboldt's original scientific approach and extremely prolific work. Whereas Alexander von Humboldt has always been a well-known figure in the Americas, German reception had been heavily focused on the philological work of his older brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt. Ette's new editions of Alexander's colourful reports from his voyages have led to a more evenly balanced reception of the work of the two polymaths Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. As early as 1987, Ette's work on Alexander von Humboldt earned him the \\"Heinz-Maier-Leibnitz\\" Award from the German Ministry of Culture and the German Research Association DFG. In the English-speaking world, Ottmar Ette and Vera M. Kutzinski (Vanderbildt University) recently published two critical editions of Humboldt's works: in 2011, the \\"Political Essay on the Island of Cuba; in 2012, the \\"Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas\\", both titles published with the University of Chicago Press.http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/HUMBENG.html  Publications   Monographs (selected titles)  * Jos√© Mart√≠.

While most shorts in the series are shot in black and white, this one is among the very few that are in color. Plot After a long winter in the countryside, the snow finally melted and the animals came out of hibernation. A squirrel merrily runs around and heads to the groundhog's house to tell the latter of the good news. Upon coming out and hearing what the squirrel told him, the groundhog turned around and was surprised to see his shadow on the wall of his house. He then warns the squirrel and the other animals nearby that if his shadow is visible, more days of snow await. The other animals, however, were doubtful of his advice and therefore took it as a joke. On another part of the countryside, Oswald and an unnamed sister of his are working on their inn after it had been closed for the winter. They dust the furniture and shake the dirt off the carpets. After completing their tasks, the inn was ready for service. Oswald and his sister went outside for a little stroll. As the two inn operators are at the open and spending time with some animals, the groundhog approached and warn them once more about more winter days coming. Again, they all thought it was just a bluff and began to laugh. But they would stop laughing when snowflakes fall to the ground. Finally realizing the truth of the groundhog's warning, everybody hurried back indoors.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971. History Gogebic County was split from Ontonagon County in 1887. The county immediately started work on a courthouse, jail, and sheriff's office. The buildings were designed by the firm of Charlton and Kuenzli, and constructed in 1888 for $50,000 by contractor Herman Gundlach. The courthouse was enlarged in 1915. In 1974, the original jail and sheriff's office were demolished and replaced, and an elevator tower and annex to the courthouse were constructed. Gogebic County Courthouse, c. 1920 Significance The Gogebic County Courthouse symbolizes the cooperative effort of individuals, industries, and skilled workers in the Bessemer area in constructing a finely crafted building. It is a regional landmark, built when Gogebic County was a booming mining area, and reflects the economic prosperity of the times and the enthusiasm of county residents at a time when Gogebic County was a newly created political entity. Description The Gogebic County Courthouse is a rectangular Romanesque red sandstone building, two stories tall with a full basement. It has a hipped roof and a four-story square tower on the front facade. The entrance is through a carved, round arched entryway in the base of the tower. Farther up the tower are rectangular windows with transoms, surrounded by carved stone, and a porthole window. A dentilated cornice runs around the roofline of the building.

Along with Ranjit Movietone and the Imperial Film Company it was the largest movie studio when Indian talkies began in the 1930s. Kohinoor didn't just produce some of the most successful films of its era. The studio also trained such people as Nandlal Jaswantlal and Mohan Bhavnani, and produced artists such as Goharbai, Zebunissa and Rampiyari. History In 1918, the film pioneer Dwarkadas Narendas Sampat (1884-1958) established the Kohinoor Film Company. Sampat introduced wooden sets, doing away with the painted sceneries of the past. In 1923 a fire at the studio destroyed negatives of the company's films. However, Eastman Kodak willingly granted further credit for raw film stock. Filmography Between 1919 and 1929, Sampat and Kohinoor made 98 films, including *Vikram Urvashi (1920) *Anusuya (1921) *Bhakta Vidur ::Kanjibhai Rathod directed this mythological allegory, which alluded directly to political issues of the day.

This film adapted a section from the Mahabharata that concerns the fall of an empire at the hands of two warring clans, the Pandavas and the Kauravas. More overtly, the film's main character, Vidur (Dwarkadas Sampat), is a dead ringer for Gandhi, complete with his trademark hat and khaddar shirt. This film became something of a cause c√©l√®bre in India, as it generated a huge censorship controversy and was ultimately banned in Karachi and Madras. The District Magistrate of Karachi ordered the ban, saying it is likely to excite disaffection against the government and incite people to non-cooperation. *Kala Nag (1924) *Handsome Blackguard (1925) *Telephone Girl (1926) References Sources *Crow, Jonathan; Allmovie *Garga, B.D.; So Many Cinemas, Eminence Designs Private Limited. *Rajadhyaksh, Ashish & Willeme, Paul; Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, Oxford University Press.

In modern cataract operations, the lens capsule is usually not removed. The most common forms of cataract surgery remove nearly all of the crystalline lens but do not remove the crystalline lens capsule (the outer ‚Äúbag‚Äù layer of the crystalline lens). The crystalline lens capsule is retained and used to contain and position the intraocular lens implant (IOL). Months or years after the cataract operation, the lens capsule can become opaque in about 30% of eyes. Before the advent of laser surgery, a tiny knife called a cystotome was used to cut a hole in the center of the lens capsule, thus providing a clear path for light to reach the retina. This procedure thus reduces the opacity of the lens of the eye. This method has been replaced by YAG laser capsulotomy.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975, and demolished in 1989. History The city of Ironwood was first settled in 1885 as the commercial center of the newly opening Gogebic iron range. The city was incorporated in 1889, and hired architect George Mennie to design a new city hall. This building was constructed the following year. It initially housed the city jail, police department, fire station, library, and city offices. The library was moved in 1901 and the city offices in 1923; since then the police and fire departments exclusively used the building. In 1918, a horse barn and a metal stairway were added to the side facade. The building was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, but was demolished in 1989. The site now houses the Gogebic County Transit. Description The Ironwood City Hall was a two-story, rectangular, vernacular Richardsonian structure with an exterior of tan brick with smooth brownstone belt cornices on a foundation of rough cut brown sandstone. The hip roof was covered in steel, and an eighty-foot-high tower, originally capped with a pagoda-roofed open turret, was located on one corner. There were several ground-floor entrances, including a tower entrance, a double door for fire equipment, and entrances to the police station and library. The windows were rectangular and symmetrically arranged, with decorative windows in wall dormers on the upper story. Decorative trim, including gable pilasters and finials, chimney caps and cornices, appeared bulbous and weighty.

He was one of the leaders of the Nepal Bhasa renaissance, Page 74. and also a pioneer of printing with moveable type in Nepal.M, Razen (November 2011). \\"Pioneer of Nepalbhasha printing\\", The Newarland. Page 8. He is honored as one of the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa. Early life Bajracharya was born in Om Bahal, Kathmandu to father Muktananda and mother Thakumati Bajracharya. He belonged to a family of hereditary Newar Buddhist priests, who engaged in performing sacred rituals. His first wife Ratna Prabha died in 1901, and he subsequently married Dyah Mayju. Career In 1901, after completing Buddhist studies, Bajracharya began giving religious discourses. His storytelling sessions were held in sacred courtyards and other open spaces and lasted four months. Bajracharya had a clear style of narrating stories which made him greatly popular. He adapted the ancient texts into easy-to-understand everyday language, as the old writing style had become complex to listeners. The written and spoken forms of Nepal Bhasa had begun to grow apart as its development came to an end around 1850 with the advent of the Rana dynasty. The Ranas did not like Nepal Bhasa and suppressed its use.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 1. By the time literary activities were revived during the Nepal Bhasa renaissance, Page 128. the old style of writing had become difficult to follow. Bajracharya modernized the language by discarding the traditional spelling rules and writing it as it was spoken. He also brought a new style into prose writing by simplifying sentence construction.Sudarshan, Bhikshu (1970). Lumanke Bahahpin (\\"Memorable Figures\\"). Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Pages 1-5. Publications In 1909, Bajracharya published Ek Bishanti Prajnaparamita, the first book in Nepal Bhasa to be printed with moveable type.

In a career that lasted from October 1862 to September 1863 he ran eight times and won seven races. In 1863 he won all seven of his races including the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, The Derby and the Doncaster Cup. Background Macaroni was bred by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster at his Eaton stud in Cheshire. In 1861 Macaroni was one of several yearlings at the stud to be affected by an outbreak of an equine respiratory disease known as Strangles, which adversely affected his physical development and persuaded the Marquis to sell him. Macaroni was part of a lot of six yearlings bought for ¬£700 by the Liverpool banker Richard Naylor, who had recently started his own stud at Hooton Park on the Wirral Peninsula. Naylor sent the young horses to be trained by James \\"Jem\\" Godding at his Palace House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. At the time, Newmarket was falling out of favour as a base for preparing horses for the Classics, and many leading owners and trainers had shifted their operations to centres in Berkshire and Sussex. Macaroni's sire, Sweetmeat, a descendant of the Byerley Turk, was a very good racehorse, being unbeaten in sixteen races in 1845. In addition to Macaroni, he sired The Oaks winners Mincemeat and Mincepie as well as Parmesan who sired the Derby winners Favonius and Cremorne. Racing career 1862: two-year-old season In 1862, the best of Naylor's two-year-olds was reckoned to be a colt named Carnival, while Macaroni was very backward and slow to mature. He ran only once, in autumn at Newmarket and gave little grounds for optimism as he was beaten three-quarters of a length by Automaton, his only opponent in a two horse race. Naylor however, had a great belief in the colt and backed him heavily at long odds for the following year's Derby. 1863: three-year-old season Macaroni began his season at Newmarket in April when he won a one- mile stakes race by three lengths. Although the event was not particularly important, it proved that the colt went well on the course and coped with the unusually hard ground. Two weeks later over the same course and distance he started at odds of 10/1 against eight opponents for the 2000 Guineas, for which the favourite was the French colt Hospodar. Ridden by Tom Chaloner, he won by half a length from Saccharometer. The defeat of the French horse, who finished unplaced, and the popularity of Macaroni's owner, led to his win being warmly received by the Newmarket crowd. On 20 May, Macaroni was a 10/1 chance for the Derby at Epsom, with Lord Clifden starting the 4/1 favourite in a field of thirty-one. The race was run in difficult conditions with heavy rain and soft ground. Among the spectators was the Prince of Wales, who became the first member of the British Royal Family to attend the race since Prince Albert in 1840. The start of the race was delayed for almost an hour, owing to a record thirty-two false starts caused by horses breaking away or failing to line up correctly. The huge field led to good deal of bumping and roughness, with three horses either falling or being brought down. Chaloner held up Macaroni in the early stages, before moving into fifth place entering the straight. A furlong from the finish, Lord Clifden went into a clear lead and looked the likely winner, but Macaroni produced a strong late run to catch the favourite in the last strides and win by a head. Rapid Rhone finished well to take third place. Macaroni's victory was warmly received in Newmarket, where the church bells were rung in celebration. Naylor marked his success by donating ¬£1,000 to charities in his native city of Liverpool. In July, Macaroni ran the Drawing Room Stakes at Goodwood. He was made odds-on favourite despite a ten pound weight penalty an won easily from two opponents. At York in August, he took on older horses in the two-mile York Cup and won by four lengths from Clarissimus. At Doncaster in September, Macaroni bypassed the St Leger and ran instead in the -mile Doncaster Cup. He took the lead entering the straight and held off the sustained challenge of The Oaks winner Queen Bertha to win by one and a half lengths. At Newmarket in October he walked over in the Select Stakes and was then retired to stud. Stud career Macaroni was retired to his owner's stud at Hooton until 1866 when was sold for 7,100 guineas to Baron Meyer de Rothschild who moved the stallion to his stud at Mentmore. Macaroni sired several successful racehorses, including the 2000 Guineas winner Macgregor but was more notable as a sire of broodmares. He was the damsire of the Triple Crown winner Ormonde and the important stallions Bona Vista, the male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds, and Kendal (sire of the Triple Crown winner Galtee More). Macaroni died on 12 December 1887 and was buried at Mentmore.

A school is also established on his name 'Shahid Dharma Bhakta School (SDB)' currently located in Nakkhu, Lalitpur, Nepal by her daughter Renu Devi which runs the classes from montessori to grade 10 (School Leaving Certificate). Bodybuilding Dharma Bhakta was thin and unhealthy during his childhood, which caused other children to tease and bully him. To put an end to all that, he joined a gym while in Calcutta. Constant physical exercise rapidly improved his health. He so excelled in bodybuilding that he was announced as \\"Shree Bengal\\" (which literally means \\"Mr. Bengal\\") in an all Bengal bodybuilding contest. After graduating with an I.A. degree from Scottish Church College, he married Uttaradevi from Biratnagar. He returned to Kathmandu and established a gym at his aunt Yamkumari Ray's house. Many youths of Kathmandu were attracted by the novelty of the gym. The gym attracted not only the commoners but also the Rana family and the police forces too. Once a troop of German soldiers had come to Nepal for a visit. He showed his body building tricks and exercises to them in the presence of Juddha Shumsher. His proficiency easily won their hearts. Once during the Ghode Jatra festival, he showed his bodybuilding prowess to the people in the presence of King Tribhuvan and the Rana family in Tundikhel. He made different bodybuilding poses and performed many test of strength. For instance, he put a long rod on his back and told three to four persons on each side of the rod to hang. He was then jumping and lifting with those people. In another instance he lied down on the ground and told a person to hammer his chest with a hammer. People were amazed that he was unharmed. People could not believe that a man could be so strong. King Tribhuvan was also greatly impressed by his feat, so much so such that he was appointed as a physical instructor to the king. Early life Dharma Bhakta Mathema was born of a Newar family in Kathmandu in 1908 (1965 BS). His father Adi Bhakta Mathema held a government office as a subba during the Rana rule. He often went to India to purchase things for the Ranas. He met learned men in India and understood the importance of education. He received his basic education in Sanatan Madhyamik Vidhyalaya in Darjeeling, after which he went to the Scottish Church College in Calcutta to get an Intermediate in Arts (I.A.) degree. Political activity Besides bodybuilding, he was actively interested in politics. At that time the struggle for the independence from the British Raj was gaining momentum in India. While in India Dharma Bhakta had met Chittaranjan Das and had joined in the struggle for Indian independence. He wanted to establish a political party and settle in India itself. But for some reason he dropped that plan and returned to Kathmandu with an ardent desire for freedom from the Rana regime. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule. In those days, Juddha Shamsher was the prime minister of Nepal, who ruled with an iron fist. All political parties were banned. Dharma Bhakta met Dashrath Chand in Kathmandu in 1990 BS and in 1936 AD, a political party Praja Parishad was founded in the house of Dharma Bhakta. The founders were Tanka Prasad Acharya, Jiwan Raj Sharma, Ramhari Sharma, Dharma Bhakta and Dashrath Chand. His connection with King Tribhuwan as a physical instructor allowed him to act as a go-between the king and the Praja Parishad. He conveyed every activity of the Praja parishad to the King. However discovery of his political activities prompted Juddha Shamsher to exile his father Adi Bhakta Mathema. Death One day, a secret meeting of Praja Parishad was held in Lainchaur which was also attended by King Tribhuwan. The information of this meeting reached Juddha Shamsher, which led to the arrest of many of the members of Praja Parishad including, Dharma Bhakta were arrested. Since three of the founding members of Praja Parishad were of Brahmin caste, and hence were exempt from death penalty, they were duly humiliated and exile. As for Dashrath Chand and Dharma Bhakta, their caste could not provide a shield against the ruthlessness of a tyrant. Both of them were given death penalty. On 24 January 1941 (Magh 12, 1997 BS), Dharma Bhakta was hanged till death at Shifal, Kathmandu, at midnight.

It is found in tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean. This species was first described in 1870 by the French naturalist √âdouard Placide Duchassaing de Fontbressin. Description Iciligorgia schrammi is the largest of the sea fans and large specimens are much bigger than gorgonians. It is dichotomously branched in a single plane with the branches much further apart than other sea fans, giving it a ragged appearance. However, small specimens do not give this impression. The main branches are somewhat flattened and are in width. The polyps protrude from the edges of the branches. Their calyces are dome-shaped and have eight separate lobes. The polyps are stiffened with sclerites, which are curved spindles and rods which are arranged as a collar with pointed projections. The colour of this sea fan is usually light brown to bright red. Several brittle stars were associated with it in this habitat. Distribution In the Atlantic Ocean, this species is found from south Florida southwards to Brazil, and in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. A single specimen was found in the South Atlantic Bight in Georgia in 2007 which is a northward extension to its range. Habitat Iciligorgia schrammi normally grows at depths from 3 to 368 metres. It lives on vertical walls, standing out perpendicularly, and can also grow in deep water where the water is clear and the current high on slope breaks.

The excavation of the site is of great importance in understanding the history of Shang dynasty.Sohu article Retrieved December 25, 2011.Mafengwo article Retrieved December 25, 2011. Excavations Archaeologist Han Weizhou discovered the site in 1950. In the spring of 1951, a group of archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Sciences came to research in Zhengzhou. They collected some specimens and confirmed that it was indeed of Shang dynasty, and older than the Shang city of Yinxu in Anyang. Erligang is the type site of Erligang culture. This is the area located outside the giant walls of the ancient city. Starting in 1952, the first formal archaeological excavations at Erligang began. Also the east area of Luoyang was explored. In 1954, the archaeologist An Jinhuai and staff conducted a large-scale excavation in this area. The site of the city walls was identified to be of Shang dynasty in 1955. The living area of the royal families was found in the northeast part of Shang City. The excavation was forced to stop because of the Cultural Revolution. In 1971, An Jinhuai reorganized the archaeological group to continue excavations when he had a chance to go back to Zhengzhou. In 1973, they found ruins of many buildings of differing sizes made of hangtu. This turned out to be the palace area. Archaeologists found numerous other sites in this area. The excavations are difficult because the modern city covers most of the ancient city area. Layout The city was in a rectangular form. And the perimeter of the city walls is 6960 meters with 11 gaps that might be city gates. The wall of the north city was about 1690 meters. The west one was about 1870 meters while the south one and east one were both 1700 meters. The base width of the wall was around 20 meters. The top width was more than 5 meters and it might be about 10 meters when it was built. The palaces were located in the northeast of the city, and inside there were facilities to store water made of stones. There were also some small buildings.

He was co-founder of the Physiological Society.J.G.McKendrick (editor) Textbook of Physiology. 1888‚Äì1889. Early life John Gray McKendrick was born in Old Machar, Aberdeen in 1841 the son of James McKendrick, an Aberdeen merchant. He was initially apprenticed as a lawyer (1855‚Äì1861) but left law to study medicine at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh before graduating in 1864 as an MB ChB. He worked in Chester General Infirmary, Eastern Dispensary at Whitechapel then the Belford Hospital in Fort William. In 1869, he became the assistant to the Professor of Physiology at the University of Edinburgh, John Hughes Bennett, pursuing his own research into the nervous system and special senses. McKendrick went on to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1873, having been proposed by Sir William Turner, serving as a councillor and eventually the Vice-President from 1894 until 1900. He won the Society's Makdougall-Brisbane Prize for the period 1894‚Äì96. Glasgow He took up a post at the University of Glasgow in 1873, first as an extramural lecturer (one of his students was the physician Sophia Jex-Blake) and then as Regius Professor of Physiology in 1876. John McKenrick was a popular lecturer, raising significant funds for modernising his department and leading it into concentrating on the study and teaching of physiology. McKendrik sought to reflect his modernising efforts in the renaming his position, from Chair of \\"Theory of Physic or Institutes of Medicine\\" to Chair of Physiology in 1893. McKendrick was a founder member of the Physiological Society and Fullerian Professor of Physiology and Comparative Anatomy at the Royal Institution from 1881 to 1884; he resigned the Fullerian Professor on 5 March 1884 due to ill health.

There were bomb blasts and shootings at churches in Madalla, Jos, Gadaka, and Damaturu. A total of 41 people were reported dead. Boko Haram, a Muslim sect in Nigeria, later claimed responsibility for the attacks. Bombings Madalla At least 37 people died and 57 others were injured in an attack at St. Theresa Catholic Church in Madalla, a satellite town of Abuja located from the city center. A local coordinator with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) confirmed the death toll. NEMA spokesperson Yushau Shuaibu said that the Madalla bombing occurred on the street outside the church. He added that the church, which can hold 1,000 people, was badly affected by the blast. Witnesses said that the windows of nearby houses were shattered by the explosion. Officials at the local hospital said that the condition of many injured people was serious. Slaku Luguard, a NEMA coordinator, said that rescue workers found at least 25 bodies and officials were tallying the wounded in various hospitals. NEMA acknowledged that it did not have enough ambulances to help the wounded. Luguard also said that an angry crowd, which gathered at the blast site, blocked emergency workers from getting inside: \\"We're trying to calm the situation. There are some angry people around trying to cause problems,\\" he said. Jos An explosion hit the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Church in Jos and gunmen later fired on police who were guarding the area resulting in the death of one police officer. Another two bombs were found in a nearby building and were disarmed. Gadaka and Damaturu Two explosions were reported in the city of Damaturu and another at a church in the northeastern town of Gadaka.

However, their relative isolation from the mainland United States has always posed problems for rail traffic. Numerous factors over the late 20th century have caused further declines in freight rail traffic. Efforts to reverse this trend are ongoing, but have met with limited success. The New York and Atlantic Railroad currently operates all rail freight on the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s rights-of-way in Long Island. CSX Transportation also operates within New York City, as do several shortline railroads including a car float across the harbor. History Early days 1912 Pennsylvania Railroad map showing the Greenville Terminal and its car float operations. Rail and barge routes shown on the map are largely the same as those in use today. In part because of its easily accessible harbor and its canal connections to the interior, New York City and its surrounding area early on became the largest regional economy in North America. As railroads developed in the 19th century, serving New York City market was vital, but problematic. The Hudson River, a mile-wide (1.6 km) estuary near the city, a section also called the North River, presents a formidable barrier to rail transportation. As a result, most railroads terminated their routes at docks on the New Jersey shore (see 1900 map). Ferries brought rail passengers to and from the city, while car float barges carried freight cars across the Hudson‚Äîon the order of one million carloads of freight per year. Train on the High Line viaduct passing underneath Manhattan's Bell Laboratories Building in 1936 One exception was a New York Central Railroad line on the east bank of the Hudson that extended into Manhattan for freight service. The West Side Line, as it was called, brought freight cars to docks, warehouses and industries along Manhattan's west shore. Its southern portion included the High Line, a grade-separated viaduct that replaced the street-level railroad tracks on what was then known as \\"Death Avenue\\". In the early 20th century, the Hudson barrier was surmounted by tunneling for passenger rail‚Äîand with the construction of the Holland Tunnel in 1927, the George Washington Bridge in 1931, and the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937‚Äîby creating fixed crossings for automobiles and trucks as well. Trucks could deliver freight anywhere in the city without requiring a railroad siding. The rail tunnels required electric propulsion, limiting their use for freight. A rail freight tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn was proposed, but never completed. Rail freight traffic east of the Hudson that did not cross by barge had to go north some distance to cross the river by bridge. The first rail crossing of the Hudson was the Poughkeepsie Bridge built in 1888. The New York Central crossed just south of Albany, New York, where it continued west paralleling the Erie Canal to create the Water Level Route which competed with the Pennsylvania Railroad's more direct route that had to cross the Allegany Mountains. Even though the Poughkeepsie Bridge was closer to the city, it was less used. Post-World War II High Line park at 20th street in Manhattan. The peak of rail freight came during World War II, when New York industries, including the Brooklyn Navy Yard, worked around the clock to support the war effort. After the war, the Interstate Highway System was built, along with many inland waterways, both competing with the railroads. The rail industry went through widespread consolidations and bankruptcies. Containerization revolutionized shipping. The Port Authority developed the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal on Newark Bay. Piers in Brooklyin and Manhattan declined in usage and were abandoned. The 1980 Staggers Rail Act largely deregulated the U.S. railroads. The railroads de-emphasized \\"retail\\" railroading‚Äîmovement of one or a few rail cars from a shipper's siding to a destination siding‚Äîin favor of long unit trains for bulk commodities, such as coal and ore. General cargo shifted to intermodal movement, first trailers on flat cars (TOFC), intermodal containers on flat cars (COFC), and then double- stacked containers, loaded on special well cars. Much manufacturing shifted to Asia, particularly Japan and China, leading to a sharp increase in international container movements. Industry developed highly efficient logistics based on strategically located distribution centers, often serving an entire metropolitan area with a single center. Goods in long distance containers, whether shipped by rail or sea, typically must be unpacked at a distribution center outside the city before being sent to an end destination, such as a retail store. Heavy industry migrated out of the city. The Navy Yard closed in 1966. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge across the mouth of the harbor opened in 1964, allowing truck traffic to bypass Manhattan on the way to Long Island. The New York Central Railroad merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form the Penn Central in 1968, which then went bankrupt in 1970.Pinkston, Elizabeth (2003). \\"A Brief History of Amtrak.\\" The Past and Future of U.S. Passenger Rail Service. (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Congressional Budget Office) The Poughkeepsie Bridge was closed after a fire in 1974 and has since been converted to a pedestrian and bicycle path. The 60th Street Yard in Manhattan was sold and redeveloped as the Riverside South apartment complex, while the 30th Street Yard was converted into the West Side Yard storage facility for Long Island Rail Road trains. The West Side Line was last used for freight in 1982 and then converted to passenger use as Amtrak's Empire Connection in 1991, with the portion south of Penn Station abandoned and later converted into the High Line, an elevated pedestrian park. The numerous car float operations across New York Harbor shrank to a single cross harbor barge line, the New York Cross Harbor Railroad. It merged with a trucking company, then ran into financial difficulties and sold its cross harbor operation to New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, which was subsequently purchased by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Attempts to revive rail freight in the City and Long Island Oak Point Link with the Harlem River Intermodal Railyard in background. Most of New York City's municipal solid waste is exported by rail in containers like these, with some first floated across the harbor by barge. NYC's two barge to rail transfer facilities, on opposite sides of Arthur Kill. On the closer, Staten Island side, blue trash containers from Manhattan and Queens are placed on rail cars at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal. On the New Jersey side, green containers from Brooklyn are trucked to a nearby rail yard. Starting in the late 20th century, government officials have sought to increase the amount of freight to New York City and Long island that arrives by rail. To this end, several private and public sector initiatives have been undertaken: * Construction of the Hunts Point Market in 1972, with extensive rail facilities connected to the Oak Point Yard * The State of New York's $375 million \\"Full Freight Access Program\\" to allow cars with higher, TOFC clearance (but not double-stack) to reach Queens and Long Island, including construction of the Oak Point Link and the Harlem River Intermodal Yard in the Bronx. The link opened in 1998. The Harlem River Intermodal Yard was intended to handle intermodal containers but none were ever lifted there. Instead, it is being used for loading containerized trash onto trains for remote disposal. * The restoration in 2006 of freight rail service to Staten Island via the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge at a cost of $72 million. * The ExpressRail System, a $600 million investment in improved intermodal rail facilities at the container terminals on the west side of the Upper New York Bay and Newark Bay in New Jersey, and on Staten Island. The last yard of the project, next to Greenville yard, opened on January 7, 2019.Panynj Achieves Major Milestone in Efforts to Enhance Movement of Cargo by Rail Outside NY-NJ Region, Louanne Wong, Global Container Terminals, January 7, 2019 * The grant of a concession in 1997 to a private short haul railroad, the New York and Atlantic Railroad, to handle all rail freight on the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s rights-of-way. * The rebuilding of the 65th Street Yard, a rail yard at the Brooklyn shore with two car float bridges that allow rail cars to be loaded and unloaded onto barges, by the City and State in 1999 at a cost of $20 million.Operator Sought for Rebuilt Brooklyn Rail Yard, New York Times, August 31, 2000, Joseph Freed The car float bridges remained unused until 2012 because of financial disputes between the city and NYCHRR, which used bridges at the former Bush Terminal at 50th Street, instead. The 65th Street Yard was restored by the Port Authority for use by New York and New Jersey Rail, which it acquired in 2008. * The use of $4.8 million of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to rehabilitate an NY&A; rail spur at Enterprise Park at Calverton (EPCAL), an industrial park located at Calverton, Long Island. * The acquisition of the New York and New Jersey Rail cross harbor car float operations by the Port Authority in 2008 for $16 million. The Port Authority then acquired the New Jersey Greenville Yard in 2010 and awarded a contract for its reconstruction as a rail to barge facility in 2011. The authority's board authorized $118.1 million for the overall project. The State of New Jersey has budgeted $89 million in its 2012 budget to bring the Greenville Yard and Lift Bridge to a State-of-Good- Repair.FY 2012 Transportation Capital Program, New Jersey Department of Transportation * The opening, in September 2011, of Brookhaven Rail Terminal (BRT), a privately financed $40 million, 28-acre transload facility. It is projected to take 40,000 trucks off Long Island roads and transfer 1 million tons of freight a year by 2016.Grand Opening of Brookhaven Freight Train Terminal , Carolyn Fortino, September 27, 2011 The terminal includes three tracks for construction material, such as lumber, asphalt and concrete, and six tracks for merchandise, such as flour and biodiesel. Plans to expand the yard have generated community opposition. * Rehabilitation and reactivation of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT) along the Bay Ridge Channel in Sunset Park in late 2012. The terminal includes a 77-acre roll on/roll off automobile import and processing facility at the 39th Street pier, and an 11-acre, recycling facility for the city's plastic, metal and glass waste stream at the 30th Street pier. Both facilities are served by newly built rail connections to the 65th Street yard. * Construction in 2014 of a transload facility for vegetable oil, food products and construction material at NYA's Wheel Spur Yard along Newtown Creek near Long Island City. NYA expects the facility to support replacement of the nearby Kosciuszko Bridge. The NYA also received permission from the LIRR, which owns most of the tracks on which NYA operates, to handle cars weighing up to , the top load limit for railroads in the eastern U.S. The previous LIRR limit was .http://www.anacostia.com/sites/www.anacostia.com/files/assets/Apex- Spr2014.pdf * New York City's 2006 municipal solid waste plan. Under the plan, most of the city's non-recyclable solid waste is placed in intermodal containers and transported by rail to disposal sites. Some of the containers are loaded onto rail cars in the city, while others are first moved across New York Harbor by barge to transfer stations in Staten Island and New Jersey. Status Routes As of late 2013, most rail freight to New York City moves over lines on the west side of the Hudson and is unloaded in New Jersey, where it is brought by truck to the city. Railroad freight cars that enter the City or Long Island do so via the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Staten Island. New York and Atlantic Railroad system map = The Bronx = The main mainland rail connection to New York City and Long Island from the national rail network is via tracks on the east bank of the Hudson. CSX Transportation freight trains from the west cross the Hudson on the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge, 140 miles (230 km) to the north at Selkirk. From there to Poughkeepsie the two- track line, known as the Hudson Subdivision, is owned by CSX but is leased to Amtrak. Amtrak runs 28 trains a day on this segment. South of Poughkeepsie, the Hudson Line widens, first to three and then four tracks, becomes electrified with third rail. This section is owned by Metro North Commuter Railroad. CSX runs four road freight trains a day on this line with an average of 75 cars per train, the equivalent of 900 trucks. Just north of the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge in the Bronx, the Hudson Line connects with the Oak Point Link, which acts as a replacement for the decommissioned Port Morris Freight Branch in addition to connecting the Harlem River Intermodal Yard and the Oak Point Yard. The Oak Point Yard, the largest rail yard in New York City, directly serves local industry and the Hunts Point Market and also connects to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line to Boston, which is used by the Providence and Worcester Railroad to haul crushed stone to Long Island. Freight trains to Long Island move from the yard over the Hell Gate Bridge to the New York and Atlantic yard at Fresh Pond Junction in Queens. As part of the deal to create the Oak Point Link, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted trackage rights over the Hudson Line and the link, but Canadian Pacific currently allows CSX to haul its traffic in exchange for hauling CSX traffic on another route. Since 1997, the New York and Atlantic, a short-line railroad, has had the concession to provide freight service over the tracks of the MTA's Long Island Rail Road, the largest commuter operation in North America. The NY&A; carries about 20,000 carloads a year, including lumber, paper, building materials, plastic, aggregates, food products, and recyclables, over 269 route miles. As of 2011, it has seven transload facilities, in Brooklyn, Queens, Farmingdale, Hicksville and Yaphank. Clearances along the LIRR prohibit double-stack operations. =Brooklyn= A railroad car float in the Upper New York Bay, 1919. The sole remaining car float operation in the area, New York New Jersey Rail, carries railroad cars from the Greenville Yard in Jersey City to Brooklyn, where cars either go to local customers or are picked up by the New York and Atlantic and moved over the Bay Ridge Branch to Fresh Pond Junction. In 2004, when it was still run by a public company, New York Regional Rail, it carried 3400 carloads (a carload being one loaded rail car), charging between $250 and $1,500 per carload, and estimated that it needed to handle in excess of 4200 carloads per year to be profitable. The operation, now run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, began using the 65th Street Yard in Brooklyn in July 2012 and hopes to increase annual traffic from 1600 carloads to 23,000 by 2017.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/nyregion/65th-street- rail-yard-reopens-in-brooklyn.htmlNJTPA Freight Committee, October 2012 On September 17, 2014, the Port Authority announced that it was funding a major redevelopment of the Greenville Yard, to include a new container terminal, two new rail to barge transfer bridges, two new car float barges, each with 18 rail car capacity, and three new KLW SE10B ultra low emission locomotives.Port Authority Board Approves Major Redevelopment Of Greenville Yard To Improve Cargo Movement In The Port, Port Authority Press Release Number 190-2014, September 17, 2014 In November 2017, the first of the new barges was delivered. The second was delivered in December 2018. =Staten Island= Staten Island has a short, direct connection to the national rail network. Trains enter from New Jersey by way of the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, which was reopened in 2006. They serve the Staten Island Transfer Station at Fresh Kills Landfill, which handles municipal solid waste for the borough, and the refurbished, Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The latter has a new intermodal rail yard and can handle 425,000 containers a year. It is part of the Port Authority's ExpressRail system and is served by the Staten Island Railroad with a connection via Conrail Shared Assets Operations Chemical Coast to both CSX and Norfolk Southern. Rail share of freight Measured by ton-miles, about 40% of freight in the United States is moved by rail. However thare are significant regional variations. In the west, 65% of freight moves by rail, while in the north-east only 19% moves by rail.p. 14 Much of U.S. railroad freight consists of heavy commodities that are not significant in the New York economy, for example coal is 44% of total national rail tonnage. Intermodal tonnage is only about 8.9%. In addition to highway and rail, cargo arrives in New York City by air, barge and, of course, ship, the port being the largest on the East Coast of North America. A major source of freight leaving the City is trash. The closing of the Fresh Kills Landfill in 2001 forced the city to transport its waste material to distant sites. New York City's Solid Waste Management PlanFinal Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan Executive Summary calls for each borough to ship its own trash, the Bronx and Staten Island using rail directly and the rest of the city using barge to rail. The Panama Canal expansion project, which opened in 2016, was expected to bring more container traffic from Asia directly to the Port of New York, instead of coming via the railroad \\"Land bridge\\" from U.S. West Coast ports. The Port Authority has spent over $1 billion to raise the deck of the Bayonne Bridge to allow the larger New Panamax ships that now use the expanded canal to reach its existing container terminals in New Jersey, and has spent $235 million to buy a portion of the former Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne, which is not obstructed by the Bayonne Bridge. Proposals to increase freight rail use Proposed route of Cross Harbor Rail Tunnels (between blue dots) and connecting facilities. A number of proposals have been put forward to increase the share of rail freight movement within the City and Long Island: * Construction of an intermodal rail-to-truck yard at a site in the West Maspeth section of Queens. The location is near the intersection of Interstate 278 and Interstate 495. The project has received intense opposition for neighbors concerned about increased truck traffic on local streets that lead to the highway interchange. A City University of New York (CUNY) study pointed out that \\"no current demand for a containerized truck-rail facility has yet been demonstrated\\" in part because intermodal containers generally must be unloaded at major distribution centers, few of which are located on Long Island. The study also noted that standard double stack rail equipment is too wide to run on tracks where third rail is used, as it is on much of the Long Island Rail Road's passenger routes. * Construction of a transload facility at the former Pilgrim State Hospital. This project has also been stymied by local opposition, though Governor Paterson vetoed a 2008 bill that would have killed the project by incorporating the site into a nearby state park. The same CUNY study, commissioned by the state after the veto, concluded that \\"there is an immediate demand for bulk service\\"‚Äîrail-shipped commodities such as building materials, plastics, paper, and food‚Äîthat was unmet due to a lack of transloading facilities on Long Island. It identified 12 additional candidate sites besides Pilgrim State, including the Brookhaven Rail Terminal that has since opened. * Rebuilding parts of the Hunts Point Cooperative Market in the Bronx, already a major rail freight destination, to facilitate greater rail use. The market received a $10 million grant in 2012 for this purpose. * Construction of a double-stack-ready Cross Harbor Rail Tunnel from Greenville, New Jersey to Brooklyn, at a cost estimated in 2004 at between $4.8 and $7.4 billion, depending on whether one or two tracks are provided. The Port Authority is preparing a new environmental impact statement for the project, which has come under criticism because of its high cost (all the US freight railroads combined spent $10.7 billion on capital expenditures in 2010), modest projected impact on overall truck traffic (around a 5% reduction) and potential impact on local communities, such as West Maspeth. * Building a new container port on Brooklyn's Sunset Park waterfront with a rail link to the proposed tunnel. Brooklyn currently has a container operation at Red Hook, but it has no rail connection. (Sea access to Brooklyn is not obstructed by the Bayonne Bridge.) A proposal would use right-of-way that now carries freight, including the Bay Ridge Branch, to build a new Triboro RX passenger service connecting the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, potentially limiting use for rail freight. =Freight NYC= In July 2018, the New York City Economic Development Corporation announced a $100 million plan called Freight NYC to improve the flow of freight into and out of New York City. The plan's rail component includes: * Constructing up to four new transload facilities in Brooklyn and Queens * Constructing more passing sidings * Supporting the Port Authority's Cross Harbor Freight Program (CHFP) * Supporting the Metropolitan Rail Freight Council (MRFC) Action Plan aimed at increasing rail freight service to locations east of the Hudson The Freight NYC plan also includes a marine component that would build more barge terminals and an effort to support greener trucking. Impact of electronic commerce The rise of electronic commerce, coupled with faster delivery services such as Amazon Prime, has increased truck traffic throughout the area and has led to demand for more warehouse space within the city. At least some of these warehouses are being located near rail terminals, including Amazon's Staten Island facility which is a short distance form the New York Container Terminal and Arlington Yard. Active freight rail yards in New York City and Long Island Active freight rail yards in New York City and Long Island include: * 65th Street Yard ‚Äì Brooklyn shore, reopened in 2012 after being refurbished for cross harbor car float barge, which connects to Greenville Yard in New Jersey. * Arlington Yard ‚Äì Staten Island, small yard servicing the island * Brookhaven Rail Terminal ‚Äì facility for bulk commodities, in eastern Long Island * Harlem River Intermodal Yard ‚Äì the Bronx, intended for intermodal container traffic, used for trash containers instead * Hunts Point Terminal Market ‚Äì the Bronx, largest food distribution center in New York * Industry City ‚Äì Brooklyn shore, used for car float operations * Fresh Pond Junction ‚Äì Queens, main freight yard on Long Island, hub of NY&A; * New York Container Terminal ‚Äì Staten Island, includes an intermodal rail yard * Oak Point Yard ‚Äì Bronx, largest freight yard in the City, owned by CSX * Pine Aire Yard ‚Äì Farmingdale, owned by NY&A; and used to serve industries along the LIRR Main Line * Wheel Spur Yard ‚Äì Queens, reopened NY&A; transload facility in Long Island City used for vegetable oil, food products and construction material.Wheelspur Rail Yard in LIC Back in Operation, Mitch Waxman, Brownstoner, April 16, 2015 The New York City Subway system has many other rail yards, but, with two exceptions, these are not connected with the national rail network.

Life  Verster came from an artistic family. His father, Abraham Florentius Verster van Wulverhorst, was an administrator of the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden and a renowned scholar and painter of birds. His younger brother Cees developed into an art critic and later a curator of the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden. Hendrik took drawing lessons from Gerardus Johannes Bos and, in the winter of 1878-79, from George Hendrik Breitner when he briefly worked as a lecturer in Leiden. Between 1880 and 1884 Verster continued his training at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague where he counted among his fellow-students George Hendrik Breitner, Isaac Isra√´ls and Willem de Zwart. After graduation, he briefly attended classes at Amedee Bourson in Brussels. From 1882-1892 he shared a studio in Leiden with his future brother-in-law, the still-life painter Menso Kamerlingh Onnes (he married Jenny Kamerlingh Onnes in 1892). Until about 1885 he worked in the style of the Hague School. The next seven years he experimented in still life painting under the influence of his brother-in-law and of French painters Antoine Vollon and Th√©odule Ribot. As a colorist he excelled, his passionate color vision differing from the current Hague School style. In Brussels he met Jan Toorop and other members of the avant-garde artists' group Les Vingt. Partly under their influence Verster began working with a rough brush strokes and intense colors. He gained success with his large and exuberant works of floral still lifes and landscapes. In 1891 he took part in the salon of Les XX in Brussels. Between 1892 and 1900 his work underwent a metamorphosis as it became almost entirely devoted to drawings in crayons with serene subjects. From 1900 onwards he began to paint and established himself as a celebrated artist in the Netherlands. Major collections of his works are in the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum and the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden. He died from an accident in 1927.

Education Sumanadasa was born on 3 December 1910 in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) at Ambalangoda. He was educated at Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda and Ananda College, Colombo at the time when Patrick de Silva Kularatne was its principal. He completed his BSc degree in Physics at Ceylon University College and was awarded the Ceylon Government Scholarship to study aeronautical engineering at Imperial College, London in 1932 Graduating BSc and DIC (postgraduate Diploma of Imperial College). Aviation He learnt to fly with the London Aeroplane Club at Hatfield with Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr. as his instructor and made his first solo in and passed his A licence in 1934 (flying a DH.60G Gipsy Moth with a Gipsy II 120 hp engine) obtaining a private pilot's licence. He was a student member and later a full member of the Royal Aeronautical Society. After graduating (the first person from Sri Lanka to qualify in aeronautical engineering) he was hired by Handley Page Ltd where he worked as a junior technical assistant and later as a senior technical assistant in the design office. When war broke out he volunteered his services to the Royal Air Force and was a member of the RAF Volunteer reserve. However his technical and knowledge of aeronautical design at Handley Page made it impossible for him to be deployed on active service although his Ceylonese compatriots in the RAFVR, Rohan Amerasekera (later to command Sri Lankas Airforce), Mickey Dias ( later First Law Fellow, Director of Studies and Professor of Jurisprudence at Magdalene College, Cambridge), Rex de Silva, Pilot Officer Ananda Kularatne (son of Sumanadasa's school principal) and Dougald Abayasekera (former cricket captain and head prefect of S.

His daughter later described the voyage through U Boat infested waters and storms during which all ships but theirs was lost. Government Service Despite his skills and experience in aeronautical engineering the government of Ceylon deployed him to work in a senior role for the Ceylon Plywood Corporation in Gintota and later as government engineer for the southern coastal city of Galle. Education and University Sumanadasa worked from 1958 with the Ministry of Education to establish the Institute of Practical Technology at Katubedde, Moratuwa, which opened in 1960.

Attributed to the Flemish architect Lucas Faydherbe, the building is a notable illustration of the Italian-influenced Flemish Baroque style of the 17th century. The church was part of the Notre-Dame de la Vigne beguinage of Brussels. History Great Beguinage of Brussels in 1720 by Jacobus Harrewijn The beguines were lay women who lived a communal life but were not bound by perpetual vows. Three court beguinages existed in Brussels but the first and largest court beguinage was the Beguinage de Notre-Dame de la Vigne which was founded before 1247 outside the city walls. Located near today's /, the community composed a miniature village of individual dwellings with a mill, laundry, and flower and vegetable garden enclosed within a wall. The beguines built an infirmary and a small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Vineyard served as a place of worship. Because their community had grown to 1200 beguines at the end of the 13th century, a larger Gothic church was built at the same location where the present-day building is located. The women engaged in weaving wool, and from the 16th century onward, in making lace. From the start, / (\\"Beguines Street\\") formed the main axis of this large triangular domain of which / (\\"Laeken Street\\") formed the base. The area between Rue de Laeken and the / was known as the Beguinage quarter during the Middle Ages. The Beguines were dispersed in 1797 during the French regime. The grounds were parceled out gradually and streets laid out. The infirmary was renovated and transformed into the Hospice Pacheco. In 1998, the tragic expulsion of the Nigerian asylum seeker Semira Adamu, who died after police violence, triggered the occupation of the church from October 1998 to January 1999 by political refugee candidates awaiting regularisation. Building The previous church was a Gothic building with 3 naves and a transept that was destroyed by calvinists in 1584 during the Calvinist Republic of Brussels which lasted from 1577 to 1585. The beguines decided to rebuild their church in Baroque style and its construction started in 1657. Attributed to the Flemish architect Lucas Faydherbe, this church is a notable illustration of the Italian-influenced Flemish Baroque style of the 17th century. Its facade is considered to be one of the most beautiful in Belgium. The church was restored after it was ravaged by a fire in November 2000.

Unsuccessful in his efforts as a prospector, he earned his nickname baking pies for settlers and soldiers in Arizona Territory. His business success made him a prominent territorial citizen and he served three terms in the Arizona Territorial Legislature, two terms as Mayor of Tucson, Arizona Territory, and was appointed Arizona Territorial Treasurer for six years. Biography Allen was born in Maine on October 22, 1818, and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. He moved to the American West as part of the California Gold Rush, arriving in Colorado City, Arizona Territory (now Yuma) in 1857. From there he moved to Gila City to work in the placer fields before arriving in Tucson in 1858. Upon his arrival in Tucson, Allen gave up his ambition of striking it rich by finding gold. Instead, he began baking pies with dried apples and selling them to the local townsfolk and soldiers for a dollar a pie. His pies proved to be quite popular and profits from the endeavor allowed him to open a general store. His skill as a baker also earned him the nickname \\"Pie\\". Following his initial success, Allen opened stores in Tubac and Maricopa Wells. Additionally, he branched out into farming and ranching activities. On July 27, 1864, he became the first person in Arizona Territory to file a homestead application and is credited with constructing the first buildings in Tucson's new \\"American\\" section. Later activities include operating one of Arizona's first dairy farms and he is thought to have been the first to introduce honey bees to the territory. During the reign of Maximilian I in Mexico, Allen supplied arms to the anti- royalist forces. In addition to his business interests, Allen also became involved in territorial politics. As a member of the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature, he led the effort to move the territorial capital from Prescott to Tucson. On November 18, 1867 Allen was appointed one of three superintendent's to Arizona's first school district. Governor Richard C. McCormick then appointed him Territorial Treasurer on December 31, 1867. Under his management the territorial deficit was quickly erased. In 1873, Allen resigned as Treasurer after being elected a member of the 7th Arizona Territorial Legislature. He was reappointed at the close of the session and continued to serve until 1875. Following his time as Treasurer he was appointed Adjunct General for the territory and became known as \\"General Pie\\". Allen ascended Tucson's mayoral office on April 15, 1876, serving a partial term. In January 1877 he won election to a full term as mayor. While in office, he used broom wielding prison inmates to implement the city's first street sweeping program. With the founding of Tombstone, Allen opened another store out of the town's first major building. During much of his life Allen was something of a wanderer, moving from place to place throughout southern Arizona. In addition to Tubac, Tucson, Tombstone, and Maricopa Wells he operated businesses in Casa Grande, Quijotoa, Mammoth, Gunsight, and Willcox. In 1891, when he was elected to represent Pinal County in the 16th Arizona Territorial Legislature, he was living in Florence.Wagoner, Arizona Territory 1863-1912: A Political history, p. 520 In 1881 the 63-year-old Allen proposed marriage to a teenaged girl named Lola Tapia. The girl's mother agreed to the union on the condition she stayed in a convent. The marriage took place and Lola remained at the convent till the next year when she gave birth to a daughter. The marriage lasted until 1891 when Allen was granted a divorce on grounds of his wife's infidelity. In April 1899, Allen was suffering through the final stages of terminal cancer when his friends in Tucson decided to hold a dinner in his honor. During the ceremony he was presented with a tombstone by Zeckendorf & Company. In addition to his name and dates of birth and death the tombstone bore the epitaph \\"Territorial Treasurer Six Years, 1865 to 1871. Mayor of Tucson two terms. A man without an enemy.\\" thumb Allen died in Tucson on June 13, 1899. He was buried in the paupers section of Tucson's Court Street cemetery. His tombstone was later moved to Pima County Cemetery without his remains to clear land for a building project. Records to determine the location and disposition of his remains have been subsequently lost. The Pie Allen Historic District in Tucson was named a National Register Historic District in 1996.

The low light was demolished over a century ago and what remained of the high light has been rebuilt in Hartlepool Marina. Under increasing commercial pressure from the docks at West Hartlepool the Tees Navigation Company decided to improve access to the River Tees by providing a pair of leading lighthouses (navigation light towers) on the coast at Seaton Carew. These were not the first lighthouses in Seaton Carew as there is evidence of an earlier lighthouse in the 15th century.  Seaton Carew Low Light  The Low Light was on what is now Coronation Drive on the sea front at the junction with Lawson Road. The Low Light was a tall hexagonal tower with the base at a height of above mean high tide and exhibited a fixed red light. The Hartlepool steel works of South Durham Steel and Iron Company was built to the north of Seaton Carew low light. In a Board of Trade report into the grounding of the Vine in January 1877 off the mouth of the Tees it was claimed that the glow from the furnaces of the nearby steel plant may have been mistaken for the red low light.  Seaton Carew High Light  The High Light and cottages were inland to the west at the end of Windermere Road in what is now the Longhill Industrial Estate in Hartlepool north of Tees Bay Retail Park. The High Light was a tall Tuscan column of ashlar sandstone built in 1838 with the base at a height of above mean high tide. The High Light contained a newel helical stair lit by slit windows between the masonry blocks. The High Light also known as the Longhill Lighthouse, exhibited a fixed white light.  Deactivation and relocation  Seaton Tower, Hartlepool Marina In 1884 a new lighthouse was built on the breakwater at the newly constructed South Gare on the south bank at the mouth of the River Tees. Both light systems were used until 1892 when use of the light towers at Seaton Carew and Hartlepool was discontinued by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners. The low light was probably demolished a decade later in 1902 to make way for a coastal tramway and road from Hartlepool. The prospect of this demolition may have prompted local artist Thomas Grainger to create a painting of the lighthouse before it disappeared.; By 1985 although the High Light tower was disused and dilapidated and had lost its gallery, it was given grade II listed building status. In 1995 the tower now known as Seaton Tower, was moved by the Teesside Development Corporation to the recently regenerated Hartlepool Marina at Jackson's Landing to become a focal point, and in 1997 it was dedicated as a memorial to those who have lost their lives at sea.

A flight commander is the leader of a constituent portion of an aerial squadron in aerial operations, often into combat. That constituent portion is known as a flight, and usually contains six or fewer aircraft, with three or four being a common number. The tactical need for commonality in performance characteristics of aircraft usually insures that all aircraft under a flight commander's command and control in air operations are the same or very similar types. Historically, the role of a flight commander in fighter aircraft has been that of principal attacker in air-to-air combat, with the other airplane or airplanes in a flight supporting and protecting him from counter-attack as a wingman or wingmen. This delineation of roles came into being very early in the history of aerial warfare, as Oswald Boelcke, Roderic Dallas, and Mick Mannock all derived the basic tactics of successful air-to-air combat from their flying experiences during World War I c. 1916. The flight commander position has traditionally been held by a captain, naval lieutenant, or Commonwealth air force flight lieutenant, with the wingmen being both junior and subordinate to him. However, rank inflation has taken place in many air forces, and that rating may no longer hold true. In the Royal Naval Air Service of World War I, flight commander was the appointment for a lieutenant commanding a flight with its own rank insignia. Flight commander is also the title of the officer commanding a ground-based flight, a platoon-sized unit in the United States Air Force, the Royal Air Force and other Commonwealth air forces.

It provides information related to the production and consumption of animal products through rescue, education, and advocacy. History Founders Jenny Brown and Doug Abel moved to Woodstock, New York in May 2004. Abel is a film editor while Brown has previously worked for ABC, PBS, and Discovery Channel. Brown and Abel used their wedding as a fundraiser to garner the means to build a barn on their pasture. Woodstock Farm Sanctuary now provides shelter to over 200 cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, sheep, rabbits and goats who have been rescued from cases of abuse, neglect and abandonment at a 23-acre animal sanctuary in Woodstock, two hours north of New York City. In 2015, Brown and Abel decided to move 30 miles south and purchased the 150-acre Epworth Camp and Retreat Center. Brown stated that \\"We just celebrated our 10-year anniversary in 2014, and we‚Äôve grown beyond this property. We had no idea we would grow to this size and be as popular. We draw thousands of visitors in the summer.\\" There had been complaints from neighbors in the past. In 2010 concerns from neighbors about loud fundraising concerts led to a discussion about modifying the sanctuary's special use permit. The new location will be more insulated from others. With the move comes a name change from Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary to the more simple Woodstock Farm Sanctuary. In October 2016, the co-founders resigned from the organization, citing irreconcilable differences with the board of directors.

It flew in mid-1930 but did not win the competition, so only two were completed. Design The French R.2 specification of 1928 called for an all-metal two seat reconnaissance aircraft, fast and with a rapid climb rate and large radius of action. It led to prototypes from eight manufacturers, the Amiot 130, Breguet 33, Lat√©co√®re 490, Les Mureaux 111, Nieuport-Delage Ni-D 580, Potez 37, Weymann WEL-80 and the Wibault 260. One of the terms of the specification required the manufacturers to use a single Hispano-Suiza 12Nb water-cooled V-12 engine. The Potez 37 was a parasol wing aircraft. Its wing was in three parts, with a small centre-section attached to the upper fuselage on two outward-leaning, N-form cabane struts and with two outer panels, each mounted at about half- span on a parallel pair of struts from the lower fuselage. Like all the struts, these were enclosed in airfoil section fairings. In plan the wings had straight, unswept leading edges but were mildly curved over the trailing edges and tips. There was a rounded cut-out in the centre-section's trailing edge to assist the pilot's upward view. Generous ailerons filled much of the trailing edges outboard. Structurally each outer panel was built around two steel spars with dural ribs and dural covered; the leading edges were readily removable. The fuselage was in three parts. The forward part mounted the Hispano-Suiza V-12 engine within a close-fitting, sheet metal cowling that followed the cylinder banks and with a curved, transverse Lamblin radiator under its rear. Behind the engine the fuselage structure was a conventional rectangular section girder frame bearing wing struts and undercarriage and containing two tandem open cockpits. The aircraft was normally flown from the forward one, placed under the wing cut-out, and the observer's position was close behind, equipped with flying controls including a demountable control column, a flexible machine gun mounting and small side-windows. Immediately aft the girder cross-section was reduced rapidly, then joined to the final part of the fuselage, an unusual truncated dural cone strengthened internally with longerons and frames. The tail unit was conventional, with a blunted triangular fin mounting a curved, deep rudder. A high aspect ratio tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage on the fin; supported on inverted V-struts from below, its angle of incidence could be adjusted in flight. The elevators were narrow in chord; in plan the horizontal tail was straight-tapered with blunted tips. The Potez 37 had fixed, conventional landing gear, with mainwheels, equipped with brakes, placed apart at the ends of half-axles and drag struts hinged to the fuselage. The wheels had near-vertical shock absorbers mounted on the forward wing struts at a point reinforced by extra struts to the upper fuselage and to the base of the rear wing strut. There was a small, sprung tailskid. Development The date of the first flight of the Potez 37 is not known but test flights, flown by Lemoine, were under way by June 1930. Lemoine and Duroyon continued development flying until at least the end of July. They reported agreeable and straightforward handing characteristics. The S.T.I.A√© Concours des avions de grande reconnaissance (Long range reconnaissance aircraft competition) began at Villacoublay in April 1931, with all prototypes bar the Breguet gathered together. The selection process was unusually long and, while it continued, a second Potez 37 was completed and began testing. It had been fitted with a new radiator and preliminary flights suggested it was faster. In April 1932, after a year of contest, the ANF-Mureax 111 was declared winner so no more Potez 37s were built. One at least was still flying about eighteen months later and took part in the 3rd Tour de France du Prototypes in September 1933. Starting on 9 September the eight prototypes, led by Jonchay in the Potez, flew from Orly on a nine-day circuit around northern France. From 1930 to 1938 French military prototypes appeared on the Civil Register in the F-AKxx group. The first Potez 37 was F-AKFS and the second F-AKFT. The register records a type change of the latter to Potez 371.

The synthesis of proteins requires efficient native peptide ligation methods, which enable the chemoselective formation of a native peptide bond in aqueous solution between unprotected peptide segments. The most frequently used technique for synthesizing proteins is Native chemical ligation (NCL). However, alternatives are emerging, one of which is SEA Native Peptide Ligation. Overview The SEA group belongs to the N,S-acyl shift systems because its reactivity is dictated by the intramolecular nucleophilic addition of one SEA thiol group on the C-terminal carbonyl group of the peptide segment. This results in the migration of the peptide chain from the nitrogen to the sulfur. The overall process of SEA native peptide ligation involves first an N,S-acyl shift for in in situ formation of a peptide thioester, and later on, after thiol-thioester exchange, an S,N-acyl shift for formation of the peptide bond. Description of the reaction Scheme 1. SEA ligation between a bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amino (SEA) peptide and a cysteinyl or homocysteinyl peptide leads to the chemoselective and regioselective formation of a native peptide bond. SEA is an abbreviation of bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amido (Scheme 1). SEA ligation involves the reaction of a peptide featuring a C-terminal bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amido group with a Cys peptide. This reaction proceeds probably through the formation of a transient thioester intermediate, obtained by intramolecular attack of one SEA thiol on the peptide C-terminal carbonyl group as shown in Scheme 1. Then, the thioester undergoes a series of thiol-thioester exchanges, including with exogeneous thiols present in the ligation mixture such as mercaptophenyl acetic acid (MPAA). Exchange with the cysteine thiol group of the second peptide segment results in a transient thioester intermediate, which as for Native Chemical Ligation, rearranges by intramolecular S,N-acyl shift migration into a native peptide bond. Publication The first peer reviewed publication describing SEA native peptide ligation was published in Organic Letters by Melnyk, O. et al. (Ollivier, N.; Dheur, J.; Mhidia, R.; Blanpain, A.; Melnyk, O., Bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amino native peptide ligation. Org. Lett. 2010, 12, (22), 5238-41; Publication Date (Web): October 21, 2010. A few weeks later, the same reaction was published in the same journal by Liu, C. F (Hou, W.; Zhang, X.; Li, F.; Liu, C. F., Peptidyl N,N-Bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-amides as Thioester Precursors for Native Chemical Ligation. Org. Lett. 2011, 13, 386-389; Publication Date (Web): December 22, 2010).  SEA on/off concept  SEA on/off concept exploits the redox properties of SEA group. Oxidation of SEA on results in a cyclic disulfide called SEA off, which is a self-protected form of SEA on. SEA off and SEA on can be easily interconverted by reduction/oxidation as shown in Scheme 2.

He was a key commander of Later Liang forces in its struggle with its archenemy Jin, but, after repeated defeats by the Jin prince Li Cunxu, Liu sought retirement, and was subsequently poisoned to death by the Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen, who doubted his loyalty.  During Tang Dynasty   Background  Liu Xun was born in 858, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang. His family was from Anqiu (ÂÆâ‰∏ò, in modern Weifang, Shandong). His grandfather Liu Shou () served as a census administrator for the prefectural government of Mi Prefecture, which Anqiu belonged to, and his father Liu Rong () served as the Anqiu County magistrate. It was said that Liu Xun was ambitious in his youth, favored the study of military strategies, and studied histories and biographies. Sometime during the Zhonghe era (881-885) era of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's grandson Emperor Xizong, Liu became a low-level officer under Wang Jingwu the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang).  Service under Wang Shifan  In 889, Wang Jianwu died. The Pinglu soldiers supported his 15-year-old son Wang Shifan to replace him. However, one of his subordinates, Zhang Chan () the prefect of Di Prefecture (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong), refused to accept Wang Shifan and requested that then-ruling Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) commission a replacement. Emperor Zhaozong thus commissioned the senior official Cui Anqian as the military governor of Pinglu, and Cui went to Di Prefecture to join Zhang in a campaign against Wang Shifan; the sides fought for more than a year. In spring 891, when Wang sent the officer Lu Hong () to attack Zhang, Lu instead turned against Wang and prepared to attack him. Wang pretended to be fearful of Lu and offered to surrender the governorship to Lu if Lu would spare him. Lu believed Wang and prepared to return to the Pinglu capital Qing Prefecture () to take over. Wang instead approached Liu Xun, promising to promote him if he could kill Lu; Liu agreed. At a subsequent feast Wang held for Lu upon Lu's arrival, Liu surprised and killed Lu and several of his key followers. Wang then attacked Di himself and killed Zhang; Cui fled back to the imperial capital Chang'an. Emperor Zhaozong then commissioned Wang as full military governor, and Wang made Liu the deputy commander of the Pinglu infantry and cavalry.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 901, the powerful eunuchs led by Han Quanhui, fearing that Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin were about to slaughter them, forcibly seized Emperor Zhaozong and took him to Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then ruled by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen. Cui summoned his ally, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) to attack Fengxiang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Zhu put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege, and by 903, the city was in desperate straits, with the people resorting to cannibalism. Han had Emperor Zhaozong issue an edict ordering all the regional governors throughout the empire to attack Zhu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. When Wang, who had been a long-time vassal of Zhu Quanzhong's,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. received the edict, he wept, and with the retired chancellor Zhang Jun also writing him to urge him to act, he decided to send his officers to various cities throughout Zhu's territory to try to simultaneously rise and try to take control of the cities. However, most of the officers he sent failed in their surprise risings and were captured, except Liu, who was able to first send his soldiers disguised as oil merchants into Yan Prefecture (ÂÖóÂ∑û, in modern Jining, Shandong), the capital of Taining Circuit (), to survey the situation, and then made a night time attack, seizing the city. At that time, Taining's military governor Ge Congzhou, a major general under Zhu, was stationed at Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Liu, after he took over the city, went to greet Ge's mother and treated her, as well as Ge's wife and other family members, with respect. Zhu reacted by sending Ge to rendezvous with his nephew Zhu Youning () to attack Wang. Soon thereafter, with aid forces that Wang was trying to send Liu being cut off by Zhu Youning and with Li Maozhen's having sued for peace by surrendering the emperor to Zhu, Ge put Yan Prefecture under siege. Liu had Ge's mother ascend the city walls to inform Ge that Liu had treated her well, and Ge, as a result, slowed down the siege. Liu also reduced the rate of supply attrition by sending the women and the old or weak men out of the city, defending it with the stronger men alone. It was said that during the siege, Liu shared his clothes and food with the men under him and adhered to strict discipline, such that the remaining people were able to continue their livelihoods, untroubled by the soldiers. However, with the outside aid cut off, his deputy Wang Yanwen () descended out of the city walls to surrender to Ge; many soldiers followed Wang out. Liu reacted by sending an emissary to Wang Yanwen to state, \\"Except for the soldiers you are taking under our plan, do not take any extra ones.\\" He also declared to his own army, \\"You soldiers who go on your own without having been ordered to follow the deputy military governor will have your families slaughtered!\\" The soldiers were confused and did not dare to follow Wang in deserting, and the Xuanwu army, believing Wang to be part of a trickery, executed him. The city's defenses held. However, with Wang Shifan's own strength waning, Ge tried to persuade Liu to surrender. Liu pointed out that he was sent by Wang and that he should not surrender unless Wang ordered him to do so. When Wang eventually surrendered to Zhu himself and wrote Liu to tell him to surrender, Liu did.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264.  Service under Zhu Quanzhong  Ge Congzhou held a feast for Liu Xun for him to be prepared to be sent to Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture (), and prepared good clothes for Liu. However, Liu, believing that he needed to show humility before Zhu Quanzhong, opted to wear clothes fit for those waiting for punishment and to ride a donkey. When he met Zhu, Zhu gave him good clothes (which he again declined) and invited him to drink. When Liu stated that he did not have the capacity (for alcohol), Zhu responded, \\"But when you captured Yan Prefecture, what great capacity you showed!\\" He made Liu the commander of the Yuancong Corps () of the Xuanwu army ‚Äî commanding some officers who had followed Zhu for a long time. Liu accepted this post without hesitation, and this impressed Zhu further. Soon thereafter, Zhu made him the acting military governor of Baoda Circuit (‰øùÂ§ß, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). Liu later became Baoda's military governor, but in 904, as part of Zhu's defensive realignment against a potential joint attack by Li Maozhen, Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), Zhu ordered him to abandon Baoda's capital Fu Prefecture () and withdraw with his army to Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. In 905, Liu was made a general of the imperial guards and the commander of the police of then- capital Luoyang (as Zhu had forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital from Chang'an there). In 906, when Zhu, who had assassinated Emperor Zhaozong, was made the generalissimo of all armed forces by Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai, Liu was given the additional post of the commander of the generalissimo's guards.  During Later Liang   During Emperor Taizu's reign  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu, but was not recognized by several warlords who continued to wage war with him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In 908, when the major general Liu Zhijun, then stationed at Tong Prefecture, rebelled against Emperor Taizu and aligned himself with Qi (i.e., Li Maozhen's state) and Jin (then ruled by Li Cunxu), Liu Zhijun induced Qi forces to seize Chang'an while he himself quickly seized Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan) and Tong Pass. Emperor Taizu commissioned the general Yang Shihou to attack Liu Zhijun, and Liu Xun served under Yang in this campaign. When Liu Xun reached the east side of Tong Pass, he captured Liu Zhijun's sentry soldiers but let them stay free to serve as his guides, and then had them approach Tong Pass. The soldiers Liu Zhijun sent to defend Tong Pass did not know that the sentry soldiers had turned against them, and opened the pass to welcome them. Liu Xun followed and entered, capturing the pass and taking Liu Zhijun's brother Liu Zhiwan () captive. With Later Liang forces converging on him, Liu Zhijun fled to Qi, and Yang subsequently recaptured Chang'an. Emperor Taizu made Liu Xun the acting military governor of Youguo Circuit (‰ΩëÂúã, headquartered at Chang'an).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Soon thereafter, Emperor Taizu renamed the circuit to Yong'an Circuit () and made Liu Xun its military governor, as well as the mayor of Da'an Municipality (Â§ßÂÆâ, i.e., Chang'an) and the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Jin Prefecture (ÈáëÂ∑û, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi); he also bestowed the title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies) on Liu Xun. In 910, Emperor Taizong bestowed the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () and the title of acting Taibao () on him.  During Zhu Yougui's reign  In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who, after blaming the assassination on his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Kang and executing Zhu Youwen, took the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Zhu Yougui bestowed the title of acting Taifu () on Liu Xun. When Liu's mother died in spring 913 and Liu left governmental service briefly to observe a mourning period for her, Zhu Yougui recalled him back to governmental service.  During Zhu Zhen's reign  = Rise to greater authority = Later in 913, Zhu Yougui's brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun killed him in a coup and became the new Later Liang emperor (changing his name to Zhu Zhen), and it was said that he trusted Liu Xun even more than Zhu Yougui did. In 914, he recalled Liu from Yongping and made him the mayor of Kaifeng (which Zhu Zhen made the capital), while still maintaining a military governorship ‚Äî albeit an honorary one, as the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) as Zhennan then was ruled by Later Liang's rival Wu. With Jin thereafter making an incursion into Later Liang territory, Zhu Zhen stationed Liu at the northern frontier to assist Yang Shihou in defending against Jin, which then withdrew its army. Late in 914, Zhu Zhen tried to recall Wang Yin () from the military governorship of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and replace Wang with his brother Zhu Youzhang () the Prince of Fu. Wang, who had been commissioned by Zhu Yougui, was fearful and therefore refused to accept the order, instead submitting to Wu. Zhu Zhen ordered Niu Cunjie () and Liu to attack Wuning. When the Wu general Zhu Jin, trying to save Wang, attacked them, they repelled him. They captured Wuning's capital Pengcheng in early 915, and Wang committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. = As commander of the Later Liang army against Jin = In 915, Yang Shihou died. At the time of Yang's death, he was the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), which had a powerful army and which had thus allowed it to be largely de facto independent of the Tang imperial government for about two centuries. Zhu Zhen's brother-in-law Zhao Yan and secretary Shao Zan () thus suggested to him that he divide Tianxiong's six prefectures into two circuits to weaken it, to prevent it slipping out of imperial control again in the future. Zhu Zhen agreed, and he transferred He Delun () the military governor of Pinglu to Tianxiong, but created a new Zhaode Circuit () to be headquartered at Tianxiong's Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Anyang, Henan), to include Xiang, Chan (Êæ∂Â∑û, in modern Anyang), and Wei (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Xinxiang, Henan) Prefectures, with the official Zhang Yun () as its military governor. He further ordered that Tianxiong's army be divided in half, with half of the army and half of the circuit treasury be transferred to Zhaode. In order to try to intimidate the Tianxiong army into complying, he also sent Liu Xun with 60,000 men north of the Yellow River, while claiming that Liu's mission was to attack Jin's allies Zhao and Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei). Despite Liu's army's presence, the Tianxiong army, angry and distressed over the order to divide itself, mutinied under the leadership of the officer Zhang Yan (). Zhang put He Delun under house arrest and, when his subsequent request to Zhu Zhen that the division be reversed went unheeded, forced He Delun to write to Li Cunxu to submit Tianxiong to Jin. Li Cunxu's army quickly advanced to Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, not the same prefecture as the prefecture to be under Zhaode's control), as did Liu's, and the two armies initially stalemated outside the city. (In an ambush, Liu nearly captured Li Cunxu when Li Cunxu was out to survey Liu's army, but Li Cunxu fought out of the ambush with the help from his officer Xia Luqi () Believing that he could not defeat Li Cunxu quickly and wanting to catch Jin by surprise, Liu decided to pretend that his army was still in its camp ‚Äî by putting flags on the backs of donkeys and having the donkeys walk around in the camp ‚Äî while he took his army and headed straight into the Taihang Mountains, intending to attack Jin's capital Taiyuan. Several days later, however, Li Cunxu discovered that Liu's camp had in fact been abandoned, and he sent his adoptive brother Li Si'en () to warn Taiyuan of the impending attack while sending his cavalry to pursue Liu's army. Meanwhile, Liu's army was impeded by rainstorms and illness, and nearly became stuck in the Taihang Mountains, only fighting its way out when Liu pointed out to the soldiers that there was no escape otherwise. Hearing of Liu's movements, Li Cunxu's general Zhou Dewei the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) also arrived quickly and cut off Liu's access to food supply. When Zhu Zhen sent messengers to rebuke Liu for not engaging the Jin army quickly and leading to the loss of the soldiers and supplies, Liu requested more food supplies from Zhu Zhen to allow him to slow down the Jin army, causing Zhu Zhen to send back a sarcastic rebuke, \\"You, General, want this much rice. Is it to defeat the enemy, or to fill your stomach?\\" With his own officers also clamoring for a confrontation with the Jin army, Liu attacked the camp of the soldiers sent by Zhao and Yiwu, believing that they were more easily defeated than the main Jin army, but the Jin generals Li Cunshen (also an adoptive brother of Li Cunxu's) and Li Jianji () defeated him. (During this, Liu also sent chefs to pretend to surrender to the Jin army, planning to have them poison Li Cunxu to death. This was discovered, however, and the Jin army put the chefs to death.) After his defeat by Li Cunshen and Li Jianji, Liu went back into his defensive posture, hoping to wear out the Jin army. Li Cunxu, in spring 916, pretended to return to Taiyuan to draw Liu's attention. Liu thereafter decided to attack Wei Prefecture to try to capture it. When he reached the city, however, Li Cunxu was there waiting for him, along with the armies under Li Cunshen and another adoptive brother, Li Siyuan. Liu was surprised, and the Jin army quickly surrounded his. He fought his way out of the trap, but his army, then numbering about 70,000, was nearly completely destroyed. He withdrew to Hua Prefecture (ÊªëÂ∑û, in modern Anyang, not the same Hua Prefecture Liu had been stationed at years earlier), leaving virtually the entire territory north of the Yellow River in Jin hands. = Removal = After Liu Xun's defeat by the Jin army, Zhu Zhen summoned him to Kaifeng, but Liu found excuses not to report, apparently fearful of the consequences and ashamed of his defeat. Zhu Zhen, fearing that he would defect to Jin,Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 66 [916]. made him the military governor of Xuanyi Circuit (ÂÆ£Áæ©, headquartered at Hua Prefecture), stationing him at Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ, in modern Anyang). When Li Cunxu attacked Liyang in spring 917, Liu resisted him, and after several days of attacks, Li Cunxu withdrew. In fall 917, Liu finally went to Kaifeng to pay homage to the emperor. The opinion of the imperial officials at that time was to hold him responsible for the losses to Jin. Zhu Zhen thus stripped him of the honorary Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title and demoted him to be the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. = Restoration, retirement, and death = In fall 918, Later Liang's military governor of Taining Circuit, Zhang Wanjin (), believing that Jin army was about to attack south of the Yellow River, defected from Later Liang and submitted to Jin. Zhu Zhen sent Liu Xun to attack Zhang. Liu put Taining's capital Yan Prefecture under siege for more than a year, and Jin was unable to send an army to save Zhang. In winter 919, the city fell. Liu slaughtered Zhang's family. Zhu Zhen made Liu the military governor of Taining and restored him to the honorary Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title. In 920, Later Liang's military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Zhu Youzhen, defected and submitted to Jin. Zhu Zhen commissioned Liu to command an army against Zhu Youqian, with the generals Yin Hao (), Wen Zhaotu, and Duan Ning serving under him. Liu initially sent Zhu Youqian, to whom he was connected by marriage (one of Liu's children married one of Zhu Youqian's children), a letter urging him to resubmit to Later Liang, but receiving no response, he put Tong Prefecture, which Zhu Youqian had recently seized, under siege. Soon, however, the Jin army under Li Cunshen and Li Sizhao arrived and defeated him, forcing him to withdraw with heavy losses. After the defeat, Yin and Duan sent accusations to Zhu Zhen, stating their belief that due to the marital connection to Zhu Youqian, Liu intentionally delayed his attack so that the Jin army could come to Zhu Youqian's aid. Meanwhile, Liu himself claimed to be ill and sought to retire. Zhu Zhen agreed and had him retire to Luoyang, but then secretly ordered the defender of Luoyang, Zhang Zongshi, to poison Liu to death.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 22. (A slightly different version of the account indicates that Zhang forced Liu to commit suicide.) Despite this, Zhu Zhen still gave Liu posthumous honors. Liu Xun's concubine Lady Wang later became a favorite consort of Li Siyuan's after Li Siyuan became emperor (as Emperor Mingzong) of Later Tang (which Li Cunxu would found in 923 as its Emperor Zhuangzong), and therefore, Liu Xun's sons Liu Suining () and Liu Suiyong () continued to gain the Later Tang emperor's favor.

Majority of them live in Medan in North Sumatra while there are small community in other parts of the country such as Jakarta, Aceh, Riau and Riau Islands.\\"\\"Tamils - a Trans State Nation, Indonesia\\", Tamilnation.org, 15 August 2011. It is estimated that there are around 25,000 PIOs/NRIs living in Indonesia of which the Indian expatriate community registered with the Embassy and Consulate in Medan numbers around 30,000. History Pre-colonial era A group of Tamil workers were brought from India by the Dutch for working on plantation sectors in Medan, 1920s. Tamils have a long history in Indonesia. After Rajendra Chola I's attack on Srivijaya Empire in 1024‚Äì1025, there was a noticeable increase in Tamil economic activity in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. One of direct consequence of Chola invasion was the emergence of Kota Cina, an ancient trading town currently located in northern Medan. Their presence has been recorded in Lobu Tua Inscription dating from 1088 about Five Hundred Lords of Ayyanuruwar, a Tamil merchant guild in Barus, an ancient port town currently located in Central Tapanuli Regency, North Sumatra. The inscription itself is written in Tamil, and Barus was called Varocu by them. The Tamils residing permanently or temporarily in Barus were mainly traders or craftsmen by profession. Some of them were migrated to Karoland and Kota Cina, and assimilated with local Karo people. The clan (merga) Sembiring is believed to have a connection with the Tamils. Many of its sub-mergas, like Colia, Berahmana, Pandia, Meliala, Depari, Muham, Pelawi and Tekan, are clearly of South Indian origin. Some scholars cited that some aspects of Karo tradition are believed to have been influenced from Tamil culture, such as disposing of the dead and urung (village federation, thought to be influenced from medieval Tamil society). Another evidence of Tamil presence is the Suruaso Inscription, dating from the 14th century. The inscription was found in Tanah Datar Regency (West Sumatra), and written in two languages, Old Malay and Tamil. The Tamils were also assimilated with Acehnese people, and many of them has physical resemblance to that of Tamils. However, they do not practice Tamil culture or speak Tamil language anymore. Dutch colonial period Tamils from India were brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the early build-up of the plantation industry in the 1830s. Agents visited villages in South India and tempted poor uneducated Tamils to come to \\"Tanah Deli\\" (Sumatra) and were promised easy work with good pay. After they arrived in Indonesia, they were used for hard labor and housed in simple huts. Most of them worked for the Dutch company, Deli Maatschappij under harsh conditions. A small number of Tamils returned to India after their contract expires. At the end of the 1940s, many Tamils got an opportunity to return and left, but about 5000 to 10,000 Tamils remained in North Sumatra, mainly in Medan, but also in Lubuk Pakam (Deli Serdang Regency), Tebing Tinggi, and Binjai. World War II and Independence After World War II and the country's independence from the Dutch, many Tamils left the plantations and they often used cow carts as transport. These vehicles became their tools for making a living. Some even bought abandoned Japanese military vehicles, which they used to transport sand and building material for building projects. Other Tamils have specialized in spice trading at the markets and a few become contractors and government officials. Many Tamil Indonesians have remained in North Sumatra except for a few hundred families in Jakarta and the Tamils who went to Sigli in Pidie Regency, Aceh in an early stage. Relations with other groups Tamil Indonesians always had a harmonious relationship with other ethnic groups in North Sumatra, as the cultural and economic background do not differ too much. As for interracial marriages, not until the last two generations did Tamil Indonesians began to intermarry with other ethnic groups. Organizations In August 2011, more than 400 Tamil Indonesians gathered in Jakarta to form a new association, the Indonesia Tamil Sangam (ITS).\\"Tamil community forms new cultural association\\", The Jakarta Post, 15 August 2011. The ITS is a nonprofit, social and cultural organization dedicated to the welfare of the Tamil-speaking community living in Indonesia and it will organize Tamil language classes and establish a Tamil library in Jakarta. Other than Indonesian Tamil Sangam, there are some religious-based Tamil organizations, such as: * Perhimpunan Kuil Shri Mariamman (Shri Mariamman Temple Association). * Adi-Dravida Sabah. * Muda-mudi Buddha Tamil (Tamil Buddhist Youths). * South Indian Moslem Foundation and Welfare Committee. * Atma Jyothi - Indonesia Hindu-Tamil Association. * Love Medan Indians, Social Concern, Medan Tamil Less-fortunate kids, teens and youths education and careers. * Holy Trinity Church, Medan Christian Ministry amongst and to the Tamils and Indians. * Annai Velangkanni Shrine, Tamil Catholic Spiritual Pilgrimage. Population It is not known for exactly how many Tamils in Indonesia are, as post-1930 censuses do not include ethnical category. According to A. Mani (1980), there were 18,000 Tamils in North Sumatra in 1930. It is estimated that there were 75.000 Tamils in 1996 with religion percentage are 78% Hindus, 11% Buddhists, 5.5% Muslims and 4.5% Christians. Notable Tamil Indonesians * D.

At an early age Brumfield learned to play sandlot ball with other neighborhood kids, trying out for the league in 1946 when she turned 13. After failing to make the grade, she joined a softball team made up of girls from the Brookley Field area military base in Mobile. She received an invitation the next year to attend the AAGPBL spring training in Havana, Cuba. Her parents did not like the idea, but they agreed after a league's player, Margaret Holgerson, offered to serve as a chaperone for their daughter during the trip.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League At 15, Brumfield entered the league in 1947 with the South Bend Blue Sox, a squad managed by Chet Grant, a former Notre Dame football player and the sports editor for the South Bend Tribune.

She was traded to the Fort Wayne Daisies in 1952, appearing mostly at second base, but struggled until the manager Jimmie Foxx put her at first base for a double header. She went six- for-eight, including a home run, which prompted Foxx to use her at first in a regular basis. Unfortunately, near the end of the season she broke her left ankle in a home-plate collision and lost the rest of the season and the playoffs.1952 Fort Wayne Daisies. Retrieved 2019-03-27.

Playing career Buso started his professional career with hometown club Padova, then moving to Bologna in 1972. During his three years at Bologna, Buso also played the UEFA Cup Winners Cup and the Mitropa Cup, and won a Coppa Italia in 1974. He successively played with several other teams such as Cagliari, Novara, Taranto and Pisa, before to retire in 1986 after a single season with Lucchese. Coaching career After his retirement, Buso decided to stay at Lucchese as assistant coach. In 1989, he joined Taranto as youth coach, and filled the same role at Modena between 1990 and 1993. In 1993‚Äì94 he then took his first role as head coach at Trento. After a short stint as Foggia assistant, Buso became assistant/youth team coach at his former club Bologna, a role he filled since 1995. In 1999, he was promoted as caretaker head coach of the then-Serie A club, replacing Carlo Mazzone until the appointment of new permanent boss Francesco Guidolin. During this period he was defined as \\"Treccani of football\\" by then-chairman Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara because of his extensive competence. He then left Bologna in 2000 to accept an offer from Serie C2 club Taranto, leading his side to direct promotion by the end of the season. In 2001, he left Taranto to become new goalkeeping coach at Venezia under Cesare Prandelli. He then became Franco Colomba's assistant at S.S.C. Napoli the following season, following him at Reggina one year later. In 2004, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of newly promoted Serie A club Fiorentina, a role he left after a few weeks to become new head coach after the resignation of Emiliano Mondonico. His stint as Fiorentina boss turned out to the worse after a string of four consecutive defeats left the Viola in deep relegation zone, leading the board of directors to replace him with Dino Zoff. He then tried his luck as head coach of Serie B club Catanzaro, being however dismissed after a few weeks due to poor results. In 2006, he accepted to serve as Roberto Donadoni's assistant in the Italian national team, a role he took until 2008. He then re-joined Donadoni during his short-lived period as head coach of Napoli. Death Buso died on 24 December 2011, succumbing to a serious form of leukemia from which he had suffered for years.

This term to describe the characteristics of the Viennese style of playing was first defined by Gregor Widholm in 2006 in the √ñsterreichisches Musiklexikon, vol. 5. Origins The first use of the expression \\"Wiener Klangstil\\" was in 1966 in a letter from Dr. Hans Sittner, the former president of the Vienna Akademie f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst (Academy of Music and Performing Arts) to the Federal ministry recommending the formation of six new scientific institutes for the academic year 1966/67. One of these was to be an institute of \\"Wiener Klangstil\\". Under the direction of Prof. Dr. Hans Hadamovsky the institute existed on paper until 1980, but was not especially active. A letter from the director to the academic board in 1971 defined for the first time the objectives of the institute, namely: to establish the fundamental principles of the Wiener Klangstil. In 1973 Dr. Hadamovsky issued privately a three-volume, handwritten work on \\"Der Wiener Bl√§serstil\\", which for the first time gave both description and definition of the contemporary Viennese playing tradition, though very subjective and based on contestable science. The allocation of an assistant professorship in 1980 gave the institute new impetus and led to sound scientifically-based investigations into the construction, acoustics and playing techniques of the Vienna oboe, the Vienna horn and the Vienna timpani. Its use in national and above all international publications firmly established \\"Wiener Klangstil\\" as a concept at home and abroad, though still without a clear definition. Characteristics: Wind instruments Vibrato is used sparingly and for specific expressive effect, not as a stylistic device. The preference is for instruments which can readily alter tone colour according to the played dynamic intensity. A generally brighter timbre (richer overtone spectrum) of the oboe, due to lighter reed, and of horn, trombone and tuba, due to narrower bore. The characteristic timbre of clarinet and trumpet, on the other hand, is considerably darker (fewer overtones) than for instruments in use in most other countries. Characteristics: Percussion Drums and timpani utilise exclusively (and only in Vienna) drumheads of goat skin. Because the radial modes of vibration are stronger with these skins Vienna timpani contain a much higher proportion of tonal components. The characteristics of the skins also determine the material used for the stick heads and grip. Characteristics: String instruments The instruments are no different from those in other international orchestras, the characteristics of the ‚ÄúViennese string style‚Äù being entirely dependent on the human component. For most of these instruments there is evidence of string schools from the Viennese classical period to our day being taught by the concertmasters of the great Viennese orchestras, who passed on the musical tradition from master to pupil. Playing in a chamber music style and drawing on the Bohemian, Czech and Russian schools are also key features of the Viennese string sound. General characteristics The Wiener Klangstil is rooted stylistically in the rules of interpretation of Viennese Classicism mixed with German Romanticism. There is a clear preference for instruments which allow the player to control tone colour within a particular musical context. Just as the individual is subject to a process of continual change, so, too, is the characteristic style and timbre of an orchestra. An example of this constant evolutionary process can be heard in the use of vibrato by the strings of the Vienna Philharmonic during the 20th century. Similarly, the ‚ÄúWiener Klangstil‚Äù is not fixed, though the adherence to the fundamental principles of timbre and style does not change, and this fundamental principle of timbre governs the range of wind instruments found only in Vienna. During the second half of the 19th century all orchestral instruments underwent modification in the interests of greater volume (sound energy). Increased technical demands also led to new designs of woodwind and brass instruments. In the end the valve trumpet and the double horn (invented by Ed. Kruspe in 1900) became the dominant forms. What is striking is that where new designs made instruments easier to play, but at the expense of the palette of tone colour, such instruments were ‚Äì and still are ‚Äì rejected by the Viennese orchestras. This is especially true of the woodwind instruments. Despite the fact that Theobald B√∂hm‚Äôs improvements to instruments in the second half of the 19th century are in use throughout the world, the modern ‚ÄúVienna oboe‚Äù is simply a modification of the instrument by the Dresden instrument maker Carl Golde (died 1873). The clarinet and bassoon are slight modifications to German designs, and only in the case of the flute did players, around 1930, gradually switch to the universally used B√∂hm model. One reason for this may be that, as with stringed instruments, the timbre of the flute largely depends on the player rather than the instrument. Because variety of tone colour was considered paramount, the double horn, though easier to play and more secure, was not adopted by the Viennese orchestras. The Vienna horn is, in essence, the natural horn of the Viennese classical era with double piston valves added by the instrument maker Leopold Uhlmann (1806‚Äì1878). The trumpet, instead of having the almost universal Perinet piston valves , is the old German model with rotary valves, while the F tuba is its own instrument type. The trombone in Viennese orchestras is the usual type, although here, too, the preference is for the tonal quality of a narrower bore. Unlike the wind instruments, 19th century modifications to the stringed instruments (stronger bass-bar, steeper angle to the fingerboard and higher bridge) had less effect on the sound produced, and was probably a reason why the new instruments were readily adopted in Vienna. Ultimately, the sound produced depends less on the instrument than on the playing technique, and therefore the player. In 2002 M. Bertsch, with the participation around the world of over a thousand test persons, published the first scientific and statistically robust evidence to support the claim for a ‚ÄúVienna sound style‚Äù. The task was a blind test to recognize the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra using commercial CDs of the Vienna, Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras with examples played to some 1,200 persons including non-playing listeners, amateur musicians, professional orchestral musicians and soloists, sound engineers, university music students and top international conductors, some of whom, like Zubin Mehta and Seiji Ozawa, were represented on the discs chosen.

She was motivated to write this as she became ill and thought will not survive. The book was controversial and outspoken and had her critics gunning her after it was published in 1973; often shocking her readers with her for conventions and expression of her opinions on subjects in society- more often on the hypocrisy of it. Though My Story was supposed to be an autobiography, Das later admitted that there was plenty of fiction in it. Surayya herself translated the book into English, titled My Story.  Plot summary  This book is about Aami (Kamala), starting from her childhood and her village. It also depicts her teenage love towards a neighbor of the same age. Her childhood in colonized Calcutta is also explained vividly. Her failed marriage, the birth of her children and her extramarital affairs are addressed in this work. She moved away from social conventions and portrayed homosexuality as well.  Publication  Ente Kadha was serialised in 1972 in the now defunct Malayalanadu weekly, a literary magazine published by S. K. Nair. The novel not only created a literary sensation but even invited the wrath of Das' close relatives who wanted to stop its publication. V. B. C.

Does it make a difference whether the surrogate mother is paid (commercial) or simply reimbursed for expenses (altruistic)? * What, if any, difference does it make whether the surrogacy is traditional or gestational surrogacy? * Is there an alternative to post-birth adoption for the recognition of the intended parents as the legal parents, either before or after the birth? Laws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another. Of the countries which allow surrogacy, many have residency or citizenship requirements for the intended parent(s) and/or the surrogate. Countries without such requirements often attract persons from abroad, being destinations for fertility tourism. In some countries, such as the United States, Canada or Australia, laws vary by state/territory. Prohibition of commercial surrogacy Commercial surrogacy, that is, surrogacy where the mother is paid to carry the baby or surrender it to other person(s) is illegal in the European Union, as Article 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that \\"In the fields of medicine and biology, the following must be respected in particular: [..] (c) the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain\\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:12012P/TXT The Oviedo Convention, ratified by 29 countries, also states at Aticle 21 \\"Prohibition of financial gain\\" that: \\"The human body and its parts shall not, as such, give rise to financial gain.\\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full- list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007cf98 Australia In Australia, all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory allow altruistic surrogacy; with commercial surrogacy being a criminal offense. The Northern Territory has no legislation governing surrogacy.dcm.nt.gov.au In New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory it is an offence to enter into international commercial surrogacy arrangements with potential penalties extending to imprisonment for up to one year in Australian Capital Territory, up to two years imprisonment in New South Wales and up to three years imprisonment in Queensland. In 2004, the Australian Capital Territory made only altruistic surrogacy legal.Parentage Act 2004 In 2006, Australian senator Stephen Conroy and his wife Paula Benson announced that they had arranged for a child to be born through egg donation and gestational surrogacy. Unusually, Conroy was put on the birth certificate as the father of the child. Previously, couples who used to make surrogacy arrangements in Australia had to adopt the child after it was registered as born to the natural mother; rather than being recognized as birth parents, however now that surrogacy is more regular practice for childless parents; most states have switched to such arrangements to give the intended parents proper rights. After the announcement, Victoria passed the Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 2008, effective since 1 January 2010 to make only altruistic surrogacy legal.Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 2008 No. 76 of 2008 In 2009, Western AustraliaSurrogacy Act 2008 passed a law to allow only altruistic surrogacy for couples of the opposite-sex only, and to prohibit it for single people and same-sex couples. In 2010, Queensland made only altruistic surrogacy legal, as did New South Wales,Surrogacy Act 2010 No 102 and Tasmania did the same in 2013 with the Surrogacy Act No 34 and the Surrogacy (Consequential Amendments) Act No 31 In 2017, South Australia passed a bill to allow gay couples equal access to both surrogacy and IVF. The bill received royal assent on 15 March 2017 and went into effect on 21 March 2017. A Medicare rebate is not available for IVF treatment for surrogacy.  Brazil  Commercial Surrogacy is banned by Brazilian law, but altruistic surrogacy is allowed. Nevertheless, the practice is performed illegally throughout the country.  Canada  The Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHRC) permits only altruistic surrogacy: surrogate mothers may be reimbursed for approved expenses but payment of any other consideration or fee is illegal.Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 6(1), 12(1)c, 12(2), 12(3) Quebec law, however, renders all surrogacy contracts, whether commercial or altruistic, unenforceable.Civil Code of Quebec, 1991, c.64, article 541: \\"any agreement whereby a woman undertakes to procreate or carry a child for another person is absolutely null\\" People's Republic of China Surrogacy is neither forbidden nor expressly permitted by law in the People's Republic of China. The Ministry of Health has established \\"departmental rules\\" which prohibit medical professionals from performing surrogacy procedures, with violations punished by fines (but not criminal liabilities). In practice, surrogacy arrangements are common in the Mainland China with an underground market for commercial surrogacy estimated to encompass between 400 and 500 agencies in 2012. Colombia There are no clear rules in Colombia as of today regarding surrogacy and a loophole persists. The current laws applied are those from a natural childbirth. This means the child must be registered with the surnames of the surrogate mother and her partner or spouse, if she has any. Only through a challenging paternity lawsuit before a judge may the commissioning parents be recognized as legal parents, and it may include genetic tests. In July 2016, a right wing political party, Democratic Center, has introduced for the second time a bill in order to determine the concept of surrogacy and to forbid any types of it.http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/senadores- noticias/item/23755-radicado-proyecto-de-ley-que-prohibe-alquiler-de-vientres- en-colombia  Czech Republic  Surrogacy is not legally regulated in the Czech Republic and so is generally considered legal.24903-surogatni-materstvi The only mention of the phrase \\"surrogate motherhood\\" can be found in ¬ß 804 of the law n. 89/2012, where the law designates an exception to the ban of adoption by siblings for siblings carried by a surrogate mother.zakony.kurzy.cz/89-2012-obcansky-zakonik/paragraf-804/  Finland  All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) have been illegal since 2007. Commercial surrogacy arrangements were illegal even before 2007.  France  In France, since 1994, any surrogacy arrangement that is commercial or altruistic, is illegal or unlawful and is not sanctioned by the law (art 16-7 of the Code Civil). The French Court of Cassation already took this point of view in 1991. It held that if any couple makes an agreement or arranges with another person that she is to bear the husband's child and surrender it on birth to the couple, and that she is choosing that she will not keep the child, the couple making such an agreement or arrangement is not allowed to adopt the child. In its judgement the court held that such an agreement is illegal on the basis of articles 6, 353 and 1128 of the Code Civil.Hugh Beale, Arthur Hartkamp, Hein Kotx, Dennis Tallon, Cases, materials and text on contract law, ius commune casebooks on the Common Law of Europe, Hart Publishing, 2002, pp. 302f. casebooks.eu  Germany  All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. The German Free Democratic Party wants to allow altruistic surrogacy. According to the German Civil Code, the legal mother is always the woman who gave birth to the child.German Civil Code Georgia Surrogacy, along with ovum and sperm donation, has been legal in the country of Georgia since 1992. A donor or surrogate mother has no parental rights over such a child.  Greece  Law 3305/2005 (\\"Enforcement of Medically Assisted Reproduction\\") Surrogacy in Greece is fully legal and is only one of a handful of countries in the world to give legal protection to intended parents. Intended parents must meet certain qualifications, and will go before a family judge before starting their journey. As long as they meet the qualifications, the court appearance is procedural and will be granted their application. At present, intended parents must be in a heterosexual partnership or be a single female. Females must be able to prove there is a medical indication they cannot carry and be no older than 50 at the time of the contract. As in all jurisdictions, surrogates must pass medical and psychological tests so they can prove to the court that they are medically and mentally fit. What is unique about Greece is that it is the only country in Europe, and one of only countries in the world where the surrogate then has no rights over the child. The intended parents become the legal parents from conception and there is no mention of the surrogate mother anywhere on hospital or birth documents. The intended parent(s) are listed as the parents. This even applies if an egg or sperm donor is used by one of the partners. An added advantage for Europeans is that, due to the Schengen Treaty, they can freely travel home as soon as the baby is born and deal with citizenship issues at that time, as opposed to applying at their own embassy in Greece. The old regime (pursuant to art. 8 of Law 3089/2002), one of the prerequisites for granting the judicial permission for surrogacy was also the fact that the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents should be Greek citizens or permanent residents. However, the law has recently (in July 2014) changed and the new provisions of L. 4272/2014 foresee now that the surrogacy is allowed to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent or temporary residence in Greece. With this new law Greece becomes the only EU country with a comprehensive framework to regulate, facilitate and enforce surrogacy, as according to the explanatory statement of the art. 17 of the L. 4272/2014: \\"The possibility is now extending also to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent residence outside Greece\\".  Hong Kong  Commercial surrogacy is criminal under the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance 2000. The law is phrased in a manner that no one can pay a surrogate, no surrogate can receive money, and no one can arrange a commercial surrogacy (the same applies to the supply of gametes), no matter within or outside Hong Kong. Normally only the gametes of the intended parents can be used. In October 2010, Peter Lee, the eldest son and one of the presumed heirs of billionnaire Lee Shau Kee obtained three sons through a surrogate mother, reportedly from California. Since the junior Lee is single, the news attracted criticism on both moral and legal grounds. A vicar general of the territory's Roman Catholic diocese was critical. In December the case was reportedly referred to police after questions were asked in Legco.Peter Lee surrogacy case referred to police, SCMP, 2 Dec 2010  Iceland  All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal.  India  Altruistic and commercial surrogacy is legal for Indian citizens.The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 As of 4 November 2015 commercial surrogacy for foreign intended parents is not legal in India. Those commissioned before 11/4/2015 are reviewed on case by case situation; however, no new surrogacies will be started. Before 2015, foreign commercial surrogacy was legal in India. India was a destination for surrogacy-related fertility tourism because of the relatively low cost. Including the costs of flight tickets, medical procedures, and hotels, it was roughly a third of the price compared with going through the procedure in the UK.Regulators eye India's surrogacy sector. By Shilpa Kannan. India Business Report, BBC World. Retrieved on 23 Mars, 2009 In the case of Balaz v. Union of India the Honorable Supreme Court of India has given the verdict that the citizenship of the child born through this process will have the citizenship of its surrogate mother. Surrogacy was regulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines, 2005. Ireland There is no law in Ireland governing surrogacy. In 2005 a Government-appointed Commission published a very comprehensive report on Assisted Human Reproduction, which made many recommendations on the broader area of assisted human reproduction. In relation to surrogacy, it recommended that the commissioning couple would under Irish law be regarded as the parents of the child. Despite the publication there has been no legislation published and the area essentially remains unregulated. Due to mounting pressure from Irish citizens going abroad to have children through surrogacy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published guidelines for them on 21 February 2012. Israel In March 1996, the Israeli government legalized gestational surrogacy under the \\"Embryo Carrying Agreements Law.\\" This law made Israel the first country in the world to implement a form of state-controlled surrogacy in which each and every contract must be approved directly by the state. A state-appointed committee permits surrogacy arrangements to be filed only by Israeli citizens who share the same religion.Weisberg, D. Kelly. 2005. The Birth of Surrogacy in Israel. Florida: University of Florida Press The numerous restrictions on surrogacy under Israeli law have prompted some intended parents to turn to surrogates outside of the country. In February 2020, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled the restriction on same-sex couples from entering surrogacy agreements as discriminatory, thus giving the state one year to change the law. Israel's New Family organization has since stated that gestational surrogacy is legal for \\"infertile heterosexual couples and homosexual men\\" in Israel.https://www.newfamily.org.il/en/surrogacy-in-israel/  Iran  All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are legal and popular. Many couples from the Middle East do surrogacy in Iran due to the legal easiness. Japan In March 2008, the Science Council of Japan proposed a ban on surrogacy and said that doctors, agents and their clients should be punished for commercial surrogacy arrangements.  Malaysia  Surrogacy is currently prohibited by fatwa issued by National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs in 2008.  The Netherlands  Altruistic surrogacy is legal in the Netherlands.Surrogate mothers Only commercial surrogacy is illegal in Belgium and the Netherlands. Although altruistic surrogacy is legal, there is only one hospital taking in couples and there are extremely strict rules to get in. This makes a lot of couples seek their treatment outside the Netherlands or Belgium. New Zealand Altruistic surrogacy is legal.  Nigeria  Surrogacy is legal in Nigeria, and surrogacy contracts are enforceable in Nigerian courts. Gestational surrogacy is currently practiced in Nigeria by a few IVF clinics. The guidelines are as approved by the practice guidelines of the Association of Fertility and Reproductive Health (AFRH) of Nigeria. The ART regulation that is currently being considered by the Senate permits surrogacy and allows some inducement to be paid for transport and other expenses.Abiola Adewusi, Chizara Okeke, Kemi Ailoje and Oladapo A. Ashiru, The 6th Conference of GIERAF Cote D√© Ivoire, 7‚Äì10 February 2017.  Poland  Surrogacy is mostly unregulated in Poland. A 2015 news report estimated there are likely dozens of surrogate mothers in Poland. According to Family Code legal mother of child is always the woman who gave birth to them.Kodeks Rodzinny i Opieku≈Ñczy, 1964  Portugal  Heterosexual and lesbian couples could become parents via surrogacy in Portugal since 2016, under certain conditions. Yet, some parts of this law were considered unconstitutional in 2018 and it has since been suspended. Traditional surrogacy is illegal in Portugal except for some specific situations that give the right for a surrogate mother to be genetic (for example, if the future adoptive mother is completely barren).  Before the first legal surrogacy law  In 2006, a law was approved that explicitly considered any surrogacy contract to be null and void (Law 32/2006, article 8). A limited gestational surrogacy law proposed by the Left Bloc was approved in Parliament on the 13 May 2016, which went through considerable modifications during the five months that it took to get it from project to law (it was discussed in a work group with representatives from all parliamentary groups). The law received the favorable votes of the Socialist Party (minus two), Left Bloc (BE), The Greens (PEV), People Animals Nature (PAN), and 24 out of 89 members of the Social Democratic Party (PSD, including the former party leader Pedro Passos Coelho). Both CDS - People's Party (CDS) and the Communist Party (PCP) voted against the proposal. The communists justified their vote as being in line with the recommendations of the National Ethics Council. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa vetoed the law as soon as he received it, giving the same justification as the Communist Party. The law was once again sent to the Parliament and passed a second time after some changes, on 20 July 2016, with the favorable votes of BE, PS, PEV, PAN and 20 members of PSD. Eight members of PSD abstained, including Pedro Passos Coelho. The remaining members of PSD voted against, as did all members of CDS and PCP.  Limited gestational surrogacy legalization  On 22 August 2016, gestational surrogacy was legalized in Portugal (Law 25/2016) for the cases in which there is an absence of the uterus or, due to lesions or disease, the uterus is unable to successfully carry a pregnancy to term. The article 8 of the 2006 law was revoked. In such cases, the surrogate mother must willingly enter the contract and accept to renounce any motherhood rights and duties. The gestational surrogacy requires a written contract that explicitly deals with the possibility of abortion in certain cases, the Ordem dos M√©dicos' opinion (which does not need to be positive) and the National Council of Medically Assisted Reproduction's (CNPMA) permission. The only payment/donation that the genetic parents can make in favor of the surrogate mother is her medical expenses and the surrogate mother cannot be economically dependent on the genetic parents. No behavioral restrictions can be imposed on the surrogate mother. Single men and homosexual male couples cannot have access to gestational surrogacy. The law does not explicitly exclude single women, but requires that only one of the members of the couple has to contribute with genetic material, which may be interpreted as restricting the procedure to couples. The law does not restrict gestational surrogacy to residents, meaning that Portugal may become a fertility tourism destination.  After the first legal surrogacy law  Adoption of the law caused some debate within several Portuguese Christian Churches, though not among the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church. Representatives of Brazilian and US-based evangelical and Pentecostal churches condemn surrogacy and suggest that infertile couples can/must (depending on the Church) pursue conventional adoption (national or transnational even though the later is banned by law). After the 2016 law was approved, a regulatory decree (6/2017) was created in 31 July 2017 to materialize the 2016 law that included, for example, the requirement that the surrogacy mother is accompanied by a psychologist during and after the birth. On February 2017, a petition with more than 4000 signatures (the legal requirement for the Parliament to be forced to discuss the matter of the petition), was submitted to Parliament, asking for a referendum on gestational surrogacy. At the same time, a group of members of CDS and PSD requested that the law was subject to a constitutional inspection. On April 2018, the Constitutional Court deliberated on the matter and declared that some of the law's articles were in fact unconstitutional. The effects of the decision did not apply to any processes that had initiated the therapeutic procedure. This meant that a single process was allowed, while a total of eight processes that were in different stages of progress were considered null and void. On July 2019, new changes were made to the 2016 law in Parliament in an attempt to revert the Constitutional Court's decisions, but one of the issues raised by the Court (regarding the right of the surrogate mother to choose to keep the baby) failed to make it to the final version of the law. The final version had the positive votes of PS, BE (the author of the proposal), PEV, PAN and 21 PSD members, as well as five abstentions from PSD members. PCP, CDS, and 63 PSD members voted against it. On August 2019, president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa sent the law to the Constitutional Court for review. On September 2019, the 2016 law, after the 2019 changes, was once again considered unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.  Russia  Gestational surrogacy, even commercial, is legal in Russia, being available to practically all adults willing to be parents. There must be one of several medical indications for surrogacy: absence of uterus, deformity of the uterine cavity or cervix, uterine cavity synechia, somatic diseases contraindicating child bearing, or repeated failure of IVF despite high-quality embryos. The first surrogacy program in Russia was successfully implemented in 1995 at the IVF centre of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Institute in St. Petersburg. Public opinion in general is surrogacy-friendly; recent cases of a famous singer and a well-known businesswoman who openly used services of gestational surrogates received positive news coverage. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox Church has officially condemned surrogacy. As regards the baptism of the children born through surrogacy, the Russian Orthodox Church holds that a \\"child born with the assistance of ‚Äúsurrogate motherhood‚Äù can be Baptized according to the wishes of the party that will be raising it, if such are either its ‚Äúbiological parents‚Äù or its ‚Äúsurrogate mother,‚Äù only after they have recognized that, from the Christian point of view, such reproductive technology is morally reprehensible and have borne ecclesial repentance ‚Äì regardless of whither they ignored the Church's position consciously or unconsciously\\". A few Russian women, such as Ekaterina Zakharova, Natalija Klimova,Paternity Beyond the Grave RT (Russia Today TV) and Lamara Kelesheva, became grandmothers through post-mortem gestational surrogacy programs, their surrogate grandsons being conceived posthumously after the deaths of their sons. Registration of children born through surrogacy is regulated by the Family Code of Russia (art. 51-52) and the Law on Acts on Civil Status (art. 16). A surrogate's consent is needed for that. Apart from that consent, no adoption nor court decision is required. The surrogate's name is never listed on the birth certificate. There is no requirement for the child to be genetically related to at least one of the commissioning parents. Children born to heterosexual couples who are not officially married or single intended parents through gestational surrogacy are registered in accordance to analogy of jus (art. 5 of the Family Code). A court decision may be needed in that case. On 5 August 2009 a St. Petersburg court definitely resolved a dispute as to whether single women could apply for surrogacy and obliged the State Registration Authority to register a 35-year=old single intended mother, Nataliya Gorskaya, as the mother of her surrogate son. On 4 August 2010 a Moscow court ruled that a single man who applied for gestational surrogacy (using donor eggs) could be registered as the only parent of his son, becoming the first man in Russia to defend his right to become a father through court proceedings. The surrogate mother's name was not listed on the birth certificate; the father was listed as the only parent. After that, a few more identical decisions concerning single men who became fathers through surrogacy were issued by different courts in Russia, listing men as the only parents of their surrogate children and confirming that prospective single parents, regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can exercise their right to parenthood through surrogacy in Russia. Liberal legislation makes Russia attractive for \\"reproductive tourists\\" looking for techniques not available in their countries. Intended parents go there for oocyte donation because of advanced age or marital status (single women and single men) and when surrogacy is considered. Foreigners have the same rights for assisted reproduction as Russian citizens. Within 3 days after the birth, the commissioning parents obtain a Russian birth certificate with both their names on it. Genetic relation to the child (in case of donation) does not matter. Saudi Arabia Religious authorities in Saudi Arabia do not allow the use of surrogate mothers, instead suggesting medical procedures to restore fertility and ability to deliver. Serbia All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. A draft of the new civil law is said to allow surrogacy mother, but Serbian Assembly still did not adopt this law yet. On 21 April 2017, the Serbian Assembly started a discussion a legislation on assisted reproductive technology that bans all forms of surrogacy. (The legislation is being discussed.) South Africa The South Africa Children's Act of 2005 (which came fully into force in 2010) enabled the \\"commissioning parents\\" and the surrogate to have their surrogacy agreement validated by the High Court even before fertilization. This allows the commissioning parents to be recognized as legal parents from the outset of the process and helps prevent uncertainty ‚Äì although if the surrogate mother is the genetic mother she has until 60 days after the birth of the child to change her mind. The law permits single people and gay couples to be commissioning parents.Christie, Annabel, \\"South Africa shows a way to ensure more predictability in surrogacy arrangements,\\" BioNews, 9 January 2012. Retrieved 1-11-2012 However, only those domiciled in South Africa benefit from the protection of the law, no non-validated agreements will be enforced, and agreements must be altruistic rather than commercial. If there is only one commissioning parent, s/he must be genetically related to the child. If there are two, they must both be genetically related to the child unless that is physically impossible due to infertility or sex (as in the case of a same-sex couple). The Commissioning parent or parents must be physically unable to birth a child independently. The surrogate mother must have had at least one pregnancy and viable delivery and have at least one living child. The surrogate mother has the right to unilaterally terminate the pregnancy, but she must consult with and inform the commissioning parents, and if she is terminating for a non-medical reason, may be obliged to refund any medical reimbursements she had received.South Africa Children's Act of 2005, Chapter 19 (ss292-303). Retrieved 1-11-2012 South Korea As of mid-2010s, surrogacy was available and mostly unregulated in South Korea. The practice is often morally stigmatized. Surrogacy has declined since mid-2000s, as some aspects of commercial surrogacy became illegal. Spain Whereas surrogacy is not legal in Spain (the biological mother's renouncement contract is not legally valid), it is legal to perform the surrogacy in a country where it is legal, having the mother the nationality from that same country.Asociaci√≥n por la gestaci√≥n subrogada en Espa√±a - ¬øCu√°l es la situaci√≥n?

Only opposite-sex married couples as Thailand residents are allowed to have a commercial surrogacy contract arrangement. In the past Thailand was a popular destination for couples seeking surrogate mothers. Ukraine Ukraine is a major international surrogacy destination, given its very liberal laws, as well as the fact that prices are more affordable than in the United States. Since 2002, surrogacy and surrogacy in combination with egg/sperm donation has been absolutely legal in Ukraine. According to the law a donor or a surrogate mother has no parental rights over the child born and the child born is legally the child of the prospective parents. In Ukraine the start of the introduction of methods of supporting reproductive medicine was given in the eighties of the preceding century. It was Kharkiv where the extracorporeal fertilization method was for the first time successfully applied in Ukraine, and in 1991 a girl named Katy was born. Kharkiv was also the first city in the former Soviet Union to realize surrogacy. Many clinics dealing with surrogacy have been opened in Kiev. and Lviv. Ukrainian surrogacy laws are very favorable and fully support the individual's reproductive rights. Surrogacy is officially regulated by Clause 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine and the order of the Ministry of health of Ukraine \\"On approval of the application of assisted reproductive technologies in Ukraine\\" from 09.09.2013 No. 787. You can choose between Gestational Surrogacy, Egg/sperm Donation, special Embryo adoption programs and their combinations. No specific permission from any regulatory body is required for that. A written informed consent of all parties (intended parents and surrogate) participating in the surrogacy program is mandatory. Ukrainian legislation allows intended parents to carry on a surrogacy program and their names will be on the birth certificate of the child born as a result of the surrogacy program from the very beginning. The child is considered to be legally \\"belonging\\" to the prospective parents from the very moment of conception. The surrogate's name is never listed on the birth certificate. The surrogate can't keep the child after the birth. Even if a donation program took place and there is no biological relation between the child and the intended mother, their names will be on the birth certificate (Clause 3 of article 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine). Embryo research is also allowed, gamete and embryo donation permitted on a commercial level. Single women can be treated by known or anonymous donor insemination. Gestational surrogacy is an option for officially married couples only (a man and a woman) if they are able to prove they cannot carry a baby themselves for medical reasons and at least one parent must have a genetic link to the newborn baby. Surrogacy in Ukraine is not regulated in law as commercial, it is more close to altruistic, as the so-called \\"payment\\" is not performed to the surrogate mother, it is called a compensation and is not under obligation to pay taxes.  United Kingdom  Commercial surrogacy arrangements are not legal in the United Kingdom. Such arrangements were prohibited by the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985. Whilst it is illegal in the UK to pay more than expenses for a surrogacy, the relationship is recognised under section 30 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Regardless of contractual or financial consideration for expenses, surrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable so a surrogate mother maintains the legal right of determination for the child, even if they are genetically unrelated. Unless a parental order or adoption order is made, the surrogate mother remains the legal mother of the child. United States Surrogacy and its attendant legal issues fall under state jurisdiction and the legal situation for surrogacy varies greatly from state to state. Some states have written legislation, while others have developed common law regimes for dealing with surrogacy issues. Some states facilitate surrogacy and surrogacy contracts, others simply refuse to enforce them, and some penalize commercial surrogacy. Surrogacy friendly states tend to enforce both commercial and altruistic surrogacy contracts and facilitate straightforward ways for the intended parents to be recognized as the child's legal parents. Some relatively surrogacy friendly states only offer support for married heterosexual couples. Generally, only gestational surrogacy is supported and traditional surrogacy finds little to no legal support. States generally considered to be surrogacy friendly include California,http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&context;=ggulrev Illinois,http://www.aaml.org/sites/default/files/Illinois%20Becomes%20Surrogacy%20Friendly.pdf Arkansas,Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Sunday, 5 August 2007, reproduced on Simple Surrogacy .

Both New Jersey and Washington state commercial surrogacy laws became effective from 1/1/2019. For legal purposes, key factors are where the contract is completed, where the surrogate mother resides, and where the birth takes place. Therefore, individuals living in a non-friendly state can still benefit from the policies of surrogacy friendly states by working with a surrogate who lives and will give birth in a friendly state. The variations in policy mean that employee surrogacy benefits, which an increasing number of employers offer, can only be enjoyed in certain jurisdictions. Arkansas Arkansas was one of the first states to enact surrogacy friendly laws. In 1989, under then-Governor Bill Clinton, it passed Act 647, which states that in a surrogacy arrangement, the biological father and his wife will be recognized as the child's legal parents from birth, even if his wife is not genetically related to the child (i.e., in a traditional surrogacy arrangement). If he is unmarried, he alone will be recognized as the legal parent. A woman may also be recognized as the legal mother of the surrogate's genetic child as long as that child was conceived with anonymous donor sperm.Arkansas Code, Title 9-10-201, retrieved 12-19-2011 On the other hand, it is unclear how or whether same-sex couples could benefit these laws, since the 2008 ballot measure that made it illegal for unmarried, cohabiting individuals to adopt or provide foster care to minors.Human Rights Campaign, Arkansas Surrogacy Law, retrieved 12-19-2011 On 26 June 2015, the 2008 ballot issue is moot because of Obergefell v. Hodges. California California is known to be a surrogacy-friendly state. It permits commercial surrogacy, regularly enforces gestational surrogacy contracts, and makes it possible for all intended parents, regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, to establish their legal parentage prior to the birth and without adoption proceedings (pre-birth orders).Lawrence, Dale Elizabeth, \\"Surrogacy in California: Genetic and Gestational Rights\\", Golden Gate University Law Review, Vol. 21, Iss. 3 [1991], Art. 3 Michigan Michigan forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements. It is a felony to enter into such an agreement, punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 and up to five years in prison. The law makes surrogacy agreements unenforceable.MICH. COMP.

New Hampshire Since 2014, New Hampshire is recognized as a surrogacy friendly state, with laws in place to protect all parties to a surrogacy arrangement. All intended parents, irrespective of marital status, sexual orientation, or a genetic connection to the child, are able to establish their legal parental rights through pre-birth orders placing their names directly on the child's initial birth certificate. Reasonable compensation to the surrogate is permitted by statute.Title XII: Chapter 168-B: Surrogacy NH RSA. New York New York law holds that commercial surrogacy contracts contravene public policy and provides for civil penalties for those who participate in or facilitate a commercial surrogacy contract in New York. Altruistic surrogacy contracts are not penalized, but neither are they enforced. New York does recognize pre-birth orders from other states, and has provided a post-birth adoption alternative for altruistic surrogate parents via orders of maternal and paternal filiation.Bognar, Tara, \\"Birth Orders in New York\\", 11/29/2011  Oklahoma  On 23 May 2019, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into law HB2468, which legalizes and recognizes the validity of both compensated and uncompensated gestational surrogacy agreements. Under the bill, a comprehensive court procedure is created to validate all gestational agreements. The bill also allows a court to enter pre-birth orders establishing parentage prior to the birth of the child. The bill applies to gestational agreements entered into by single individuals, as well as heterosexual and homosexual couples, who wish to become parents. Lawsuits Baby M: New Jersey 1988. The surrogate mother in a traditional surrogacy arrangement decided to keep the resulting child. The intended parents sued to have themselves recognized as the legal parents. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that the surrogacy contract was invalid as a matter of New Jersey public policy. However, the intended parents were given custody of the child because the courts thought they would provide a better home for the baby than the surrogate mother, who was instead given visitation rights. Vietnam Surrogacy for humanitarian purposes has been allowed in Vietnam from 2015 after The amended Family and Marriage Law passed with nearly 60 percent of votes from the National Assembly. Under the new law, surrogacy will only be allowed among married couples, who do not have any common child, after doctors confirm the wife can not give birth even with technical support. The surrogate must be a relative of either the husband or wife, and have already given birth successfully. A woman is only allowed to be a surrogate once in her life and must produce her husband's approval if she's married. The embryo must be created by the intended parents' sperm and ovum. The process must be voluntary and follow in-vitro fertilization regulations.

Background  Boxing exhibitions had previously been illegal under a provision of the New Jersey Crimes Act, which made it a misdemeanor for \\"any two or more persons to fight together or commit or attempt to commit assaults and batteries upon each other\\" or to aid and abet such an event in a public or private place.\\"Death Ends A Boys' Fight\\", The Trenton Evening Times, 11 April 1910, \\"\\", 25 December 2011. Boxing was a polarizing issue in New Jersey at the start of the 20th century, as some viewed the sport as an artistic form of competition and fitness, while others viewed it as spectacle solely displaying violence and brutality. Prizefighting bouts were often held in secret locations that were difficult to find or access, such as in underground halls, barns, meadows, and in many cases barges on rivers and bays to prevent police from breaking them up. The underlying bill was introduced by NJ Assemblyman Joseph Hurley in 1917, passed by the state Senate on February 27, 1918, and was signed into law on March 5, 1918 by Governor Walter Edge. Senators Pilgrim of Essex County and Glennon of Hudson County, who supported the bill declared that, \\"boxing could not be considered a brutal sport in these days of war, but that on the contrary it was useful for young men.\\"\\"Boxing Bill Up To Edge\\", The New York Times, 28 February 1918, \\"\\", 25 December 2011 Many attempts were made by anti- boxing and religious groups, to no avail, to halt the Jack Dempsey-Georges Carpentier world heavyweight championship fight at Boyle's Thirty Acres on July 2, 1921 and to arrest the participants, based on the fact that the New Jersey Crimes Act was technically still in effect.\\"Reformers Fail To Stop Big Fight\\", The New York Times, 28 June 1921, \\"\\", 25 December 2011.\\"Reformers Demand Arrest of Dempsey\\", The New York Times, 3 July 1921, \\"\\", 25 December 2011.

The main towns are Dudinka, Norilsk and Khatanga.Google Earth Geography The North Siberian Lowland lies between the lower reaches of the Yenisey and Olenyok rivers in Krasnoyarsk Krai and Yakutia. It is 1,400 km long and up to 600 km wide. This lowland plain features flat-topped ridges approximately 200-300 m high, which rise over broad and heavily swamped degradations with a large number of thermokarst lakes. Rivers Pyasina, Taymyra, Kheta and Kotuy flow over the North Siberian Lowland and give rise to the Khatanga, Popigay and Anabar. There are many lakes in the North Siberian Lowland, the biggest one is Lake Taymyr. The North Siberian Lowland has deposits of oil, natural gas and coal (Taymyr Basin). Geology The North Siberian Lowland is formed by marine and ice-laid deposits, underlaid with sandstones and argillites. Permafrost is a common phenomenon in this area. Climate and flora The climate is subarctic continental with long (7‚Äì8 months) cold winters and short cool summers. Average temperature in January is -30 degrees Celsius in the West and up to -35-37 degrees Celsius in the East. Temperature in July is around 6-10 degrees Celsius. Snow cover stays for approximately 265 days. Precipitation is 250-300 mm per year. Sparse forest in the west consists mainly of Siberian larch. Eastern parts of the lowland are covered with Dahurian larch. Lichen tundra dominates northern parts of the lowland, while southern parts are full of shrubbery vegetation.

Before joining FC Barcelona in the 2012‚Äì13 season, Sullastres played for UE L'Estartit. Currently, she has a contract with Barcelona until 2013. She has been on the Under-17 and Under-19 Spanish national youth teams.Profile in UEFA's website Early career with UE L'Estartit Sullastres was born in Torroella de Montgr√≠, Girona, Catalonia, and she started her career with UE L'Estartit's youth team in July 2001. She played on youth teams that won several tournaments, and a league championship in the 2007‚Äì08 season, with only 7 goals scored against. Sullastres joined the senior team at a young age, and with her good performances, became a first-string player.Esther Sullastres, a player of Estartit Futbol Girona 's website By the end of the Superliga that, Estartit had obtained great results (they ended up in first place in the \\"second\\" minileague) and qualified for the Copa de la Reina, though they were disqualified in the first leg, against UD Levante. L'Estartit wanted to stand out in a competitive league. However, under the economic stress of traveling expenses and facing veteran teams with greater financial resources, L'Estartit was relegated to the second division after five years in Primera Divisi√≥n. Barcelona Sullastres first joined FC Barcelona's women's team in July 2012. The team gave her an opportunity after the relegation with Estartit. She participated in half of the games Barcelona played. Her first appearance took place in Manresa against her former team Estartit. FC Barcelona beat Copa Catalunya in the semifinals, with a result of 8‚Äì0, and a few days later won the Queen's Cup after defeating RCD Espanyol in the finals. At the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 season, their start was poor, as they lost the first two games, then to Espanyol and, later, to Rayo Vallecano de Madrid, but went on to win every other game and to again win the championship, in the last game against Athletic Club. 2012 Women's Champions League FC Barcelona's league title in the 2011‚Äì12 season, permitted the girls to play in this championship league in the following months. After drawing lots they knew their rival was Arsenal Ladies FC. The first leg took place in Mini Estadi, in Barcelona. Sullastres was the first-string goalkeeper, but, unfortunately, the match was a 0‚Äì3 loss. In the second leg, in London, the Arsenal ladies won again, 4‚Äì0. Sullastres did not play this time. Here ended the Champions League dream of these girls, which they hope one day to have again. 2010 Women's Under-17 Championship and Under-19 play Sullastres participated in the second qualifying round of the Women's Under-17 European Championship, which took place in Las Rozas de Madrid, in 2010, where she first appeared as an international player, in the third match of the championship, playing eleven minutes against Switzerland, in a match whose result was a draw (0‚Äì0). With that result, the team scored seven points, out of nine possible, and ended up qualifying for the final round to be played in Nyon, Switzerland. Sullastres, though, did not play. The team won the European Cup. For the next two years Sullastres was a part of the Under-19 team, and, finally, in the 2011‚Äì2012 season, she was chosen to participate in the three phases of the European Championship. 2012 Women's European Championship Sullastres was chosen to play in the first phase. The first round was played in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in September, 2011. It consisted of three matches: The first one against the host team, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a positive result (9‚Äì0); the second one was against Moldova, with another victory (8‚Äì0); and the last one, against Switzerland (currently classified in the Women's Under-20 World's cup) also a victory of 3‚Äì0. Sullastres played the full game against Moldova, allowing zero goals. The games were played in Grbavica and SRC Slavija stadiums, and they were refereed by Florence Guillemin (FRA) and Giovanna Farinelli (ITA), respectively. With 9 points, 0 allowed goals and 20 scored goals, the Spanish girls were a part of the best team of the first qualifying round. Qualifying for the second round in Sochi, Russia, the team trained hard until then. The matches were, in order: Spain ‚Äì Italy, with a victory of 4‚Äì0, played in Sputnik-Sport stadium and refereed by Riem Hussein (GER); Spain ‚Äì Russia, another 4‚Äì0 victory for Spain, refereed by Betina Norman (DEN); and the last one, against Scotland with a result of 2‚Äì3 for Spain, this time played in Centralni Stadium. Russia's weather caused some problems in that month of April, 2012. Some matches were suspended because of the hard and cold rain. Sullastres played only 17 minutes of the Russian match. Although this time the Spanish team allowed two goals, they continued to be the best team of the championship. Knowing that powers like Germany, Italy, France, and Norway were not in the final round in Antalya, Turkey, Vilda's players held onto their hopes for defending the cup for one more year. The final round resulted in the girls getting the silver medal. A good 3‚Äì0 starting against Serbia in World of Wonders Football Centre stadium, and an amazing 4‚Äì0 against England in Titanic stadium, respectively refereed by Zuzana Kov√°ƒçov√° (SVK) and St√©phanie Frappart (FRA), let the team get into the semifinals. Sullastres played 4 minutes against England. They seemed to play their third match against Sweden as an obligatory draw (0‚Äì0). This game was played in Mardan Sport Complex stadium (Field 2). The referee was the Armenian Knarik Grigoryan. After much struggling in the semifinal against Portugal (Mardan Sport Complex stadium (Field 1), Referee: Riem Hussein (GER)), Spain won (1‚Äì0), which put the girls got into the final for the third consecutively time. Unfortunately, things did not go well the night of the final. Goals did not want to come, and the match ended up a 0‚Äì0 draw at the end of regular play. Spain lost in overtime (0‚Äì1) in the 108th minute. It is said that Spanish players protested to the French referee, St√©phanie Frappart, for not having validated a goal. However, with the silver medal, Sullastres was at a high-level in her sport, a good ending to the last year of her youth career.

The result was a Han victory, and a temporary expansion of its hegemony deep into central Asia. Reprinted as an advertisement feature: Emperor Wu of Han had received reports from diplomat Zhang Qian that Dayuan owned tall and powerful horses (\\"heavenly horses\\") that could help fight against the Xiongnu. He sent envoys to survey the region and purchase horses. Dayuan refused the deal, resulting in the death of one of the Han ambassadors, and confiscated the gold sent as payment. So the Han sent an army to subdue Dayuan. Their first incursion failed, but a second, larger force defeated Dayuan, installed a regime favorable to the Han, and won enough horses to later build a cavalry strong enough to defeat the Xiongnu in the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War. Background  The horses  Emperor Wudi decided to defeat the nomadic steppe Xiongnu, who had historically harassed the Han dynasty for decades before. So in 139 BC he sent an envoy by the name of Zhang Qian to survey the west and forge a military alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. On the way to Central Asia through the Gobi desert, Zhang was captured twice. On his return, he impressed the emperor with his description of the \\"heavenly horses\\" of Dayuan. According to the Book of the Later Han (penned by a Chinese historian during the fifth century and considered an authoritative record of the Han history between 25 and 220), at least five or six, and perhaps as many as ten diplomatic groups were dispatched annually by the Han court to Central Asia during this period to buy horses.\\" The horses have since captured the popular imagination of China, leading to horse carvings, breeding grounds in Gansu, and up to 430,000 such horses in the cavalry during even the Tang dynasty.  Xiongnu  For decades prior the Han followed a policy of heqin (Âíå‰∫≤) sending tribute and princesses to marry the Xiongnu shanyu to maintain peace. This changed when Emperor Wudi came into power, when the Han adopted and revived a policy to defeat the Xiongnu.  Dayuan  Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han describe the Dayuan as numbering several hundred thousand people living in 70 walled cities of varying size. They grew rice and wheat, and made wine from grapes. Dayuan was one of the furthest western states to send envoys to the Han court. However unlike the other envoys, the ones from Dayuan did not conform to the proper Han rituals and behaved with great arrogance and self-assurance, believing they were too far away to be in any danger of invasion. Dayuan was also situated near the Xiongnu at this point, who were held in great respect for they had caused the Yuezhi much suffering. An envoy from the Xiongnu bearing the credentials of the Chanyu was provided with food and escort. In comparison, a Han envoy received no mounts he did not buy himself and no food unless he handed out silks and other goods. Han envoys also had a reputation for wealth in the west, thus they were charged exorbitant fees wherever they went, causing the Han no small amount of grief. However the historian Sima Qian provides a different account: Among the goods western envoys brought with them were the \\"heavenly horses\\", which the emperor took a liking to. He sent a trade mission with 1,000 pieces of gold and a golden horse to purchase these horses from Dayuan. Dayuan had at this point already been trading with the Han for quite some time and benefited greatly from it. Not only were they overflowing with eastern goods, they also learned from Han soldiers how to cast metal into coins and weapons. Thus they had no great reason to accept the Han trade offer, reasoning: The Han envoys cursed the men of Dayuan and smashed the golden horse they had brought. Enraged by this act of contempt, the nobles of Dayuan ordered Yucheng (modern Uzgen), which lay on their eastern borders, to attack and kill the envoys and seize their goods. Upon receiving word of the trade mission's demise, Emperor Wu decided to dispatch a punitive expedition against Dayuan. Li Guangli, brother of Emperor Wu's favorite concubine, Lady Li, was appointed Ershi General and sent against Dayuan with 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 young men drawn from the undesirables among the border kingdoms. First expedition (104 BC) In the autumn of 104 BC, Li Guangli set out with an army of 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. While crossing the Tarim Basin and the Taklamakan Desert (of modern Xinjiang), Li's army was forced to attack the nearby oasis states because they refused to provide them with supplies. Sometimes they were unable to overcome the oasis states. If the siege lasted for more than a few days, the army moved on without any supplies. Due to these numerous petty conflicts, the army became exhausted and was reduced to starvation after their supplies ran out. By the time they neared Dayuan, Li had already lost too much manpower to continue the campaign. After suffering a defeat at Yucheng, Li concluded that their current strength would not be sufficient to take the Dayuan capital, Ershi (Khujand), and therefore returned to Dunhuang. Second expedition (102 BC) The court officials wanted to disband Li's expeditionary army and concentrate their resources toward fighting the Xiongnu. Emperor Wu refused out of fear that failure to subdue Dayuan would result in a loss of prestige with the western states. He responded by giving Li a much larger army as well as supply animals. In the autumn of 102 BC, Li set out with an army of 60,000 penal recruits and mercenaries (collectively called ÊÉ°Â∞ëÂπ¥, literally meaning \\"bad boys\\") and 30,000 horses along with a large number of supply animals including 100,000 oxen and 20,000 donkeys and camels. This time the expedition was well provisioned and had no problem dealing with the oasis states. Facing a determined Han expedition army, most of the Western Regions states along the Hexi Corridor simply surrendered without a fight upon seeing the overwhelming display of power. The only state that put up any resistance was Luntai, for which Li had its populace massacred. Despite meeting no major setbacks and bypassing Yucheng entirely, Li still lost half his army to the harsh terrain by the time they reached Dayuan. Upon arriving at Ershi, Li immediately laid siege to it. A force of Wusun cavalry 2,000 strong was also present at the request of Emperor Wu, but they refused to take part in the siege out of fear of offending either parties. Dayuan's forces sallied out for field battle in an attempt to break the siege, but they were easily defeated by Han crossbowmen. Han engineers set to work on the river passing through Ershi and diverted it, leaving the city with no source of water as they had no wells. After a 40-day siege, the Han broke through the outer wall and captured the enemy general, Jianmi. The nobles of Ershi withdrew to the inner walls and decided to offer terms of surrender. First they killed their king, Wugua, and sent his head to Li. Then they offered Li all the horses he wanted as well as supplies in return for the army's withdrawal, but they would kill all their horses if he did not accept. Li agreed to the terms, taking some 3,000 horses as well as provisions. Before departing, Li enthroned one of the nobles called Meicai (ÊòßËî°) as king, since he had previously shown kindness to the Han envoys. As Li set out for Dunhuang, he realized that the local areas along the way would not be able to adequately supply the army. The army separated into several groups, some taking the northern route while others the southern route. One of these groups, comprising only 1,000 or so men under the command of Wang Shensheng and Hu Chongguo, tried to take Yucheng. After several days under siege, the inhabitants of Yucheng sallied out with 3,000 men and defeated the besieging army. A few of the Han soldiers managed to escape and alert Li of the defeat. Thereupon, Li dispatched Shangguan Jie to attack Yucheng. Seeing the great host sent against him, the king of Yucheng decided to flee to Kangju, causing Yucheng to surrender shortly thereafter. When Kangju received news of Dayuan's defeat, they handed the king of Yucheng over to Shangguan, who had him executed. The army met no further opposition on the way back to Yumen Pass. Having heard of Dayuan's defeat, the rulers of the oasis states sent their kin along with the army back to the Han capital, where they presented tribute to Emperor Wu. They remained at the Han court as hostages. Despite the overall success of the second expedition, having adequate supplies and losing only a small portion of the army in battle, the entire campaign was marred by corruption and self interest. Li's soldiers, being taken from the prison population and undesirable class, were given very little care by their generals and officers, who instead abused them by withholding rations, causing desertion. As a result, Li returned with just 10,000 men and 1,000 horses fit for military service. Even so, Emperor Wu still considered these to be acceptable losses in the victory over Dayuan, and made no attempts to punish those who were responsible. Those who had survived were given handsome rewards. Li Guangli was enfeoffed as Marquis of Haixi. Zhao Di, who secured the capture of the king of Yucheng, became Marquis of Xinzhi. Shangguan Jie became privy treasurer. Aftermath More than a year later, the nobles of Dayuan banded together and killed King Meicai, who they considered responsible for the entire affair with the Han in the first place. Wugua's brother, Chanfeng, became the new king. Not wishing to upset the Han, Chanfeng sent his son as hostage to the Han court. In response, the Han dispatched envoys with gifts for the new ruler and made peace with Dayuan. Ten years later, Li Guangli was defeated by the Xiongnu and defected to their side. He married the Chanyu's daughter but was eventually executed over a conflict with another Han defector more favored by the Chanyu.

After her death, her extensive diaries were donated to the Greater Vernon Museum and Archives in Vernon, where they became the basis of an academic book and related publications.  Lineage and early life  Barrett Parke was descended from a long line of Irish warriors and aristocrats who settled in Ireland in 1170. Her branch of the Barrett family (motto: Omnia virtute no vi)\\"All by Virtue, not by Force\\" came originally from Normandy, and is believed to have been among Crusaders who accompanied Richard the Lionheart. Barrett Parke's father, Theobold (Toby) Butler Barrett, was born at Banagher, Ireland, in 1817 and was thirteen years old when the Barretts sailed to Canada and settled in Sorel, Quebec. Upon his marriage in 1850 to Emily Lands, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, he moved with his new wife to Port Dover, Ontario, where he found a position in Her Majesty's Customs service. Between 1851 and 1869 Toby and Emily Barrett had eight children, of whom Alice was the fourth and youngest daughter. Born in Port Dover on November 5, 1861, she received an education grounded in Latin and some French. In her diaries, she described her family as large, loving, devout, intellectually lively and close-knit.  Early settler development of the Okanagan Valley and City of Vernon  During the summer of 1811, the North West Company sent their employee, David Stuart, to the Okanagan Valley in search of an overland route for the fur trade. He made his way to the interior of British Columbia, and followed a trail north along the west side of Okanagan Lake, later known as the Brigade Trail. In the 1850s, miners arrived from the south seeking gold, and soon outnumbered the fur trappers. Other early settlers pre-empted acreages from Sicamous and Enderby in the north to Summerland and Penticton in the south. By 1892, the City of Vernon, with an area of 3.12 square miles, had been legally incorporated, and the men of the town elected their first council the following year. The population was approximately four hundred people, and included young men from England and other parts of Canada, retired civil servants, professional men, shopkeepers, loggers, builders, prostitutes, and farmers.  Arrival in the Okanagan Valley  In March 1891, at age 29, Alice Butler Barrett made the long journey by train and ship from Port Dover, Ontario to the interior of British Columbia. Her younger brother, Harry, had preceded her by five years to assist their Uncle Henry in running the Mountain Meadow Ranch at Otter Lake in the Spallumcheen Valley, a few miles north of Vernon. The two bachelors needed her to take care of domestic duties, which she agreed to do for a year. Henceforth, her home would be the primitive three-roomed cabin on the ranch.  Courtship, marriage, and domestic life  When Harold (Hal) Randolph Parke first met her, Alice Barrett considered herself a confirmed spinster. Within six months, she received the first of several proposals of marriage from Parke, and eventually they married in Port Dover. Her husband was also of Irish descent, born into a well-to-do London, Ontario family, and one of four lawyer sons of the Honorable Thomas Parke, an architect and builder who served as Surveyor-General in the Baldwin-LaFontaine administration. He attended Upper Canada College and ran away as a teenager to join Confederate forces during the US Civil War; he was wounded in action and eventually retrieved by an irate father who brought him home. After completing his Law studies, Parke worked for a time at his brother Ephraim's London law firm. But seeking adventure, he became the one-hundredth man to enlist in the North-West Mounted Police, remaining a member of the Force for two years and taking part in an encounter at Wood Mountain Fort with Sitting Bull. When Parke met Alice Barrett, he was a 45-year-old widower operating a business hauling freight between Vernon and Enderby. He was also part-owner of a Vernon sawmill and brick kiln. Subsequently he held positions as Assessment Officer for the City of Vernon, Assistant Post Master, Constable for the City, Jailer, manager of the B.X. Ranch, Superintendent of Roads, and finally Post Master again. Marriage to Parke meant a substantial step up the social ladder for Alice Barrett.  The diaries  Diaries written by pioneer women in British Columbia's southern interior are extremely rare, and Barrett Parke's writings are among the few that have survived.Pioneer Susan Allison did not keep a daily record of her early life from 1868 to 1900 in the Similkameen. However, many years after she left the area she wrote a series of articles for a memoir that was published in the Sunday Province newspaper in 1931. Julia Bullock- Webster, an Englishwoman, wrote a diary from 1894 to 1896 while she was on an extended visit to her sons' ranch in the Similkameen District. In all, Barrett Parke wrote nearly half a million words describing life in the interior of British Columbia during the final decade of the nineteenth century. At her brother Harry's urging, Barrett Parke began writing a daily diary entry so that family in Port Dover could gain insights into life in the pioneer West. She wrote in 31 notebooks of many kinds, in ink and in a sloping, confident hand. Several gaps in the text coincide with lengthy visits to Port Dover. The diaries are divided into five sections: *March 1891 to June 1892: Barrett Parke's arrival in the Spallumcheen Valley, a visit to Vancouver and Victoria, and her return to Port Dover at the end of her promised year. *January 27 to February 6, 1893: a brief account of a harrowing and blizzard-plagued trans- Canada journey that she and her husband undertook after their wedding in Port Dover, written on the blank pages of a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) timetable. Afterward, there is a pause of nine months. *November 1893 to October 1896: her life after she moved to Vernon. *October 1896 to May 1898: the sudden move to the B.X. Ranch, where her husband became manager. *June 1898 to May 1900: resettlement in Vernon, assisting Harold Parke in running the Vernon Post Office. Besides describing her own family life, the diaries contained detailed portraits of people whom Barrett Parke met and befriended. They included notables like Catherine Schubert (of Overlanders renown) and her family; Lord Aberdeen (Governor-General of Canada) and his wife, Ishbel); Francis Barnard, operator of the Barnard Express stagecoach line; Pauline Johnson, a Canadian poet; mayors, councilmen, provincial politicians, premiers, and parliamentarians. She also took time to know and describe shopkeepers, blacksmiths, builders, men looking for wives, women looking for husbands, gamblers, loggers, farmers, and children. Alice Barrett Parke detailed many significant events that occurred during the final decade of the nineteenth century in the Okanagan Valley. Soon after she arrived, the stagecoach service between centers at the northern end of the Valley came to an end. The Shuswap & Okanagan Railway Company had pushed through a spur line from Sicamous to Okanagan Landing, which meant that Okanagan residents could travel by train all the way to Vancouver, or alternatively to points east. Kelowna and Penticton to the south were serviced from the Landing by CPR sternwheelers. She also wrote about periods of severe drought, devastating floods, earthquakes, deadly winters and widespread epidemics of diseases such as typhoid, scarlet fever and diphtheria, which were often fatal, especially to young children. She provided explicit details of the spousal and child abuse that were rampant at the time. While displaying early racist attitudes toward local First Nations people and the Chinese who helped to build the railroad, she moderated these attitudes over time, and became a strong opponent of the Chinese Head Tax.  Closing entries and return to Ontario  Alice Barrett Parke's journals came to an abrupt end in May 1900. The final entry stopped suddenly in the middle of a sentence and the middle of a page, without explanation. Almost exactly forty weeks later, Barrett Parke gave birth to her only child ‚Äì Emily Louisa Parke, born in February 1901. Barrett Parke was 39 at the time of the delivery. The Parkes' infant daughter survived only nine months and died that November after an illness lasting several weeks. The Parkes remained in Vernon until Hal Parke's retirement in 1905 from his job as Post Master. He was suffering eye problems which required the attention of a specialist. After consulting with doctors in Ontario, they returned to Vernon for a short visit the following spring to sell their property. They then left for central Canada.  Final years  At some point the Parkes again moved west, this time to Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta, where they operated a small market garden for a few years. With the exception of a single journal covering their daily life in Alberta from 1912 to 1915, no diaries emerged from the household. The entries for the first two years of this final volume were written by Harold Parke and are in note form only, giving abbreviated information on events, weather conditions, and so on. Deteriorating health prevented him from writing after November 24, 1913, and Alice Barrett Parke took over. Harold Parke's condition was in its final decline during the subsequent months, and they returned to her family in Port Dover in October 1914. On November 30, 1914, she wrote the entry: \\"Hal is gone.\\" Harold Parke was 68 when he died from thrombosis and myocarditis. Alice Barrett Parke survived him by 38 years, and lived on in Port Dover. She died there in 1952 aged 91.  The diaries: Discovery and publication  In summer 1996, 31 notebooks were delivered to the Vernon Archives by an Ontario donor. All that was known at the time was that they had been written by \\"a Vernon postmaster's wife\\"; that they covered the years from 1891 to 1900; and that they had lain undisturbed for more than a hundred years in an old rawhide box in the attic of the family home in Port Dover. Transcription of the diaries began immediately. When the second volume had been transcribed, Museum volunteer and local historian Jo Fraser Jones was selected to complete transcription work and produce an edited version of the diaries for publication. Transcription took fourteen months, after which work on the book began. Hobnobbing with a Countess and Other Okanagan Adventures was published by the University of British Columbia Press in 2001, and has since been assigned as a textbook for several university-level courses on early British Columbia history and BC women.

The San Carlos Hotel was the project of local businessmen James Michael Muldon, Sr. (1867-1932) and Frasier Franklin Bingham (1872-1953) (lumber magnate and shipbuilder), who saw the need for the kind of upscale hotel being erected in larger cities, and issued stock in the project under the name Pensacola Hotel Company. Regarding the site, their original choice was the northeast corner of Palafox and Garden Streets, which had no significant structures at the time. However, they instead purchased the northwest corner (at the cost of $75,000) from the First Methodist Church, which was relocating to Wright Street. The Methodists had purchased the property from Colonel Chandler Cox Yonge (1818-1889) in 1882 for an old Tarragona Street church building valued at $1,500 plus $100 \\"to boot.\\"\\"Purchased For $1,600, Sold 26 Years Later For $75,000.\\" Pensacola Journal, January 29, 1909. The hotel was designed by New York architect William Lee Stoddart and erected by local firm C. H. Turner Construction Co. at the cost of $500,000. A sturdy beam-and-girder structural system, designed to withstand hurricane winds, was covered by ceramic tile and stucco. The name \\"San Carlos\\" was selected on January 15, 1909, and site clearing began thereafter. As the Pensacola Journal explained: Ground was broken in April 1909, and construction was completed in 1910. It opened its doors on the first day of Mardi Gras celebrations. The hotel had its own well, with a rooftop cistern and purification system, and the original 157 rooms each had an exterior window and modern furnishings. Muldon and Bingham leased operation of the hotel to brothers Charles Bedell HerveyTersely Told The Pensacola journal., December 22, 1909 (1874-1942) and George Hancock Hervey (1880-1949) of the Hervey Hotel Company (of Mobile, Alabama) until 1919, and then to the Newcomb Hotel Company until 1922, when it was sold to lumber magnate William Byrd Harbeson, Sr. (1861-1934)Stone & Webster Journal, Volume 31, July- December 1922 and managed for 20 years by Harbeson's son-in-law Lee Conner Hagler (1890-1943). The new owners soon announced a massive expansion on the north and west sides of the hotel that maintained a consistent facade and added 246 rooms, a ballroom, a new lobby, and space for offices and shops. New Orleans architect Emile Weil (1878-1945) and associate architect Walker Dorr Willis, Sr. (1882-1968) were responsible for these renovations, with kitchen and food services upgrades completed by the Albert Pick-Barth Companies.Hotel Planning and Outfitting.

The park stretches between School Street to the south to the Kennedy Expressway to the north and east, with the alley behind Drake Street to the West. The park has recreational facilities including a playground, a fieldhouse, as well as an outdoor pool. History Created by the Irving Park District, Avondale Park takes its name from the surrounding neighborhood of Avondale. In 1929, the Irving Park District board drew up plans for a 5 acre park. That year an attractive brick fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld was built, and lawn, shrubbery, trees, and flowers soon graced Avondale Park's landscape. By the early 1930s, the park included a playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box, and tennis courts. With the creation of the Chicago Park District in 1934, the Great Depression forced consolidation of the city's 22 independent park agencies, including the Irving Park District. In 1959 the park's size was greatly reduced to just over 1 acre, when its entire northeast portion was destroyed to build the Kennedy Expressway. The result was the loss of Avondale Park's playfield and tennis courts, with the site redesigned to incorporate new volleyball and basketball courts.

These car float bridges, built in 1999, had never been in service until 2012. Car float in operation in 2016 The 65th Street Yard, also Bay Ridge Rail Yard, is a rail yard on the Upper New York Bay in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Equipped with two transfer bridges which allow rail cars to be loaded and unloaded onto car floats, the last of once extensive car float operations in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Located adjacent to the Brooklyn Army Terminal, it provided a major link in the city's rail freight network in the first half of the twentieth century. It was later used as a conventional railroad yard at the end of the LIRR/NY&A; Bay Ridge Branch. The new transfer bridges were constructed in 1999, but remained unused until the transfer bridges were activated in July 2012. History The yard was originally operated by the New Haven Railroad. It originally had four electrically operated car float bridges of the Overhead Suspension Contained Apron type (French Patent) and were named in alphabetical order from south to north: \\"Abie\\", \\"Benny\\", \\"Charlie\\" and \\"Davy\\". These four transfer bridges handled more than 1000 cars per day from the 1920s to the 1950s. Traffic subsequently declined and the yard was abandoned in 1968, after the New Haven was absorbed in the creation of Penn Central (PC) and float operations were ended by PC. The four transfer bridges were removed in the 1970's. Around 1978, the New York Dock Railway installed a pontoon supported pony plate girder float bridge, moved from Erie Railroad's West 28th Street Yard in Manhattan. The bridge referred as Brooklyn Army Terminal float bridge, abbreviated BAT, was used until about 1990. Its main purpose was to keep the 65th Street Yard accessible while the First Avenue was reconstructed and the yard could therefore not be reached from the Bush Terminal. The wreck of the bridge is still in the water just off the northwest corner of the yard. In 1981 the 65th Street Yard was purchased by the City and State of New York, which paid $2.5 million for the site, and the transfer bridges were rebuilt in 1999 at a cost of $20 million. The new transfer bridges appear to be a simplified design: single two track span with no apron, overhead gantry, counterbalanced with electrically operated span hoist. The design appears to be a variant of the type seen on the West Coast and possibly an improvement on the design of the transfer bridge located at the 207th Street Yard in Manhattan. However these two new transfer bridges had remained unused for car float operations since the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, the successor of New York Dock Railway, abandoned plans to move its operation from Bush Terminal at 50th Street to the 65th Street Yard due to financial disputes between the city and the Railroad. The New York Cross Harbor Railroad moved rail cars by car float to and from Greenville Yard in Jersey City. It was purchased in 2006 by Mid Atlantic New England Rail, LLC, which renamed the railroad to New York New Jersey Rail, LLC (NYNJ). In 2008 the railroad was bought by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey The Port Authority also started the restoration of the 65th Street Yard for use by NYNJ in 2011 as part of a $118.1 million investment for the restoration of the existing rail car float system operating between Greenville and sites at 51st and 65th Streets in Brooklyn, N.Y., including the purchase of Greenville Yard. In July 2012 the 65th Street Yard was reopened, with one transfer bridge in use with the other kept in a stand by mode. Car float operation moved from Bush Terminal to the 65th Street Yard. The goal of NYNJ is to increase the traffic from the actual 1,600 cars to 23,000 cars by 2017. In the future commodities shall include fruit, home heating oil and new cars.

She was given an elaborate coronation and entry in to Venice as dogaressa in January 1458. As her predecessor before her, Giovanna Dandolo came to play a very public role as dogaressa, performing representational tasks and acting as the protector of trades and individual artists. She supported the newly introduced art of book printing in Venice, the lace industry of Burano, and acted as a financier for many writers, artists and scientists. She was referred to as the 'Empress of Printing' and the 'Queen of Lace' due to her role as the benefactor of these trades.Jennifer S.

Historical location of Slavic groups that inhabited Albania in the early 20th century. Gollobord√´ (, , ) refers to a geographical area of traditionally 24 villages of which 18 are situated primarily in eastern Albania, with a small portion consisting of six villages lying within North Macedonia. This region is located within the Dib√´r and Elbasan counties which contain both Macedonian and Albanian villages. The majority group in the region consists of Slavic Muslims with different identifications (mainly Albanian in Albania, Turkish in North Macedonia) while there are also Orthodox Macedonian (some in Albania identifying as Bulgarian) and Muslim Albanian minorities. The region was divided in 1925 between Albania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The region, like neighboring Albanian and Macedonian regions, has historically been economically linked to the city of Debar, which was traditionally referred to by inhabitants as simply \\"the City\\".  History  Ottoman period The Islamization process is held to have occurred in Golloborda relatively late in Ottoman times.Toncheva, Veselka (2013). \\"The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity\\". Our Europe. Ethnography ‚Äì Ethnology ‚Äì Anthropology of Culture. Volume 2. Pages 40‚Äì42 In 1519, the region was still entirely Christian.Limanoski Niyazi (1993), Islamizatsijata i etnichkite promeni vo Makedonija [Islamization and Ethnical Changes in Macedonia], Skopje: Makedonska kniga (in Macedonian). Page 258 Some authors have held that the Islamization process in Golloborda to have occurred in the late 18th century, whereas others asserted that the impetus to mass Islamization in the region was the bedel tax, imposed only on Christians because they were not drafted and initiated in the region in the year 1832. According to this second theory, this tax was particularly harsh and caused many families to turn to Islam as a means of avoiding it.Stamatov Stefan (1938), Grad Debar i negovoto osnovavane [City of Debar and its Founding], Parvo prilozhenie na periodichnoto spisanie \\"Debarski glas\\", Sofia: Debarsko blagotvoritelno bratstvo (in Bulgarian). Page 23 During the same period, a mass emigration process occurred, and many Muslim families settled elsewhere, including in Debar, in Struga's Drimkol region, and in Thessaloniki.Limanoski Niyazi (1993), Islamizatsijata i etnichkite promeni vo Makedonija [Islamization and Ethnical Changes in Macedonia], Skopje: Makedonska kniga (in Macedonian). Page 260 The families that settled in Debar became Albanized, but retain memory of their origins which are denoted by their last names, including Klenja, Trebishta, Ostreni, Torba√ßi, Serpetova, and others.  Early 20th century  In 1913, the majority of the region was awarded to Albania while six villages were assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.Toncheva, Veselka (2013). \\"The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity\\". Our Europe. Ethnography ‚Äì Ethnology ‚Äì Anthropology of Culture. Volume 2. Pages 39‚Äì40. However, despite the border that divided the region in pieces, the region remained culturally and economically unified at this time, and Debar served as the unifying point for the entire region. There were plenty of migratory movements across the border during this period, and during King Zogu's reign, people on both sides of the Albanian-Yugoslav border running through the region would cross it to cultivate farmland on the other side. During this period, the official border changed a number of times‚Äîat one point, it ran between Klenja and Steblevo, but now these two towns are both in Albania.Risteski Lyupcho S. (2006), Zhivot na granitsa [Life on the Border] in: A. Svetieva (ed.) Golo Brdo. Zhivot na granitsa, Skopje: Institut za etnologija i antropologija, pp. 26‚Äì34 (in Macedonian). Pages 28‚Äì30  Under Communism  The fates of the two sides of the region diverged much more sharply after the rise of communism in the aftermath of World War II. In 1948, the regime of Enver Hoxha in Albania closed down the border, and a barbed wire fence was erected on the border, accompanied by guard posts. The Albanian communist state was extremely suspicious of Gollobordian communities, a fact one Macedonian author attributed to their \\"weak Albanian patriotism\\". This new heavy enforcement of the border caused many people to lose contact with their relatives who lived on the other side.  Demographics  Both Muslims and Christians today live in harmony and celebrate the holidays of both faiths together.Toncheva, Veselka (2013). \\"The Slavonic Community from the Golo Bardo Region, Republic of Albania: Traditions, Music, Identity\\". Our Europe. Ethnography ‚Äì Ethnology ‚Äì Anthropology of Culture. Volume 2. Pages 44 Bulgarian ethnologist Veselka Toncheva believes that this phenomenon, seen elsewhere in post-communist Albania, cannot be attributed solely to the anti-religious policies of communist leader Enver Hoxha, but also due to the perception of local communities as whole units of which local Christians and local Muslims both are part.  Albania  In the region of Gollobord√´, villages located on the Albanian side of the border have the following population demographics: Trebisht administrative unit: Gjinovec and Klenj√´ are inhabited solely by a Slavic speaking population which contain Muslim Macedonians (Torbe≈°) or Bulgarian Pomaks.–ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ï–º–∏–ª. –†–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏ –∏ –µ—Ç–Ω–æ-–∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –æ–±—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∑–∞–¥ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, –í: –î–∞ –Ω–µ —É–≥–∞—Å–≤–∞—Ç –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –æ–≥–Ω–∏—â–∞ –∏–∑–≤—ä–Ω –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è, –ö–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ–≤, 2016, —Å. 120‚Äì123.

It has been accused by academics, media figures, political figures, and watchdog groups of having various biases in their news coverage as well as more general views of a liberal bias. Most of these controversies took place during the 2008‚Äì2015 era. Controversies  Assertions of left-wing bias  Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's prime-time lineup is tilting more to the left. Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz has stated that the channel's evening lineup \\"has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News\\". In 2011, Salon.com noted that \\"MSNBC's prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics.\\"Kornacki, Steve (2011-01-21). \\"Is Olbermann the victim of his own success?\\". Salon.com. That same year, Politico referred to MSNBC as \\"left- leaning\\".Barr, Andy (2011-04-05). \\"MSNBC host coaxes Ron Paul to run\\". Politico. In reference to changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin said that \\"It happened naturally. There isn't a dogma we're putting through. There is a 'Go for it. A study conducted on media bias during the 2008 presidential election found that \\"A positive tone pervaded (on MSNBC) coverage of candidates from both parties. Nearly half (47%) of the stories about Democratic candidates were positive, vs. 19% negative and 34% neutral. Coverage of Republican candidates was not quite as rosy but still more stories were positive (38%) than neutral (33%) or negative (30%).\\" In the February 2008 issue of Men's Journal magazine, an MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive who said that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann \\"runs MSNBC\\" and that \\"because of his success, he's in charge\\" of the channel. The New York Times has called Olbermann MSNBC's \\"most recognizable face\\". In September 2008, MSNBC stated that they were removing both Olbermann and Chris Matthews as live political event anchors, and replacing them with David Gregory, due to growing criticism that they were \\"too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign\\". Olbermann continued to broadcast Countdown both before and after the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel's election night coverage. In September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the channel favorably and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see MSNBC unfavorably. On November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice- presidential candidate Sarah Palin's book \\"Going Rogue\\", MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan used photoshopped pictures of Palin on the channel's Morning Meeting program. Ratigan apologized a few days later stating, \\"I want to apologize to Governor Palin and all of our viewers. On Friday, in a very misguided attempt to have some fun in advance of Sarah Palin's upcoming book Going Rogue, our staff mistakenly used some clearly photoshopped images of Ms. Palin without any acknowledgment.\\" In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline \\"lean forward\\", which was described by some media outlets, including msnbc.com, as the network embracing its politically progressive identity.  Assertions of pro-Obama bias  Some Democratic Party supporters, most notably Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and Bill Clinton advisor Lanny Davis, criticized MSNBC during and after the 2008 Democratic primaries, as covering Barack Obama more favorably than Hillary Clinton.\\"Rendell: Obama coverage was embarrassing\\". Politico. August 24, 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008.Dangerous Liaison. The New Republic. May 27, 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008. A study done by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14% of stories vs. 29% in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate John McCain (73% of its coverage vs. 57% in the press overall). MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, \\"The Power of Change\\", was criticized as being overtly similar to Obama's campaign slogan of \\"Change\\". Following the 2008 presidential election, conservative talk-show host, John Ziegler worked on a documentary called Media Malpractice. ... How Obama Got Elected, which was very critical of the media, especially MSNBC's role, in the election. While promoting the documentary, he engaged in an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor Contessa Brewer, on how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin. After Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann made controversial on- air comments during the 2008 Republican National Convention, NBC News correspondent David Gregory replaced them, but Matthews and Olbermann continued working as analysts. On November 4‚Äì5, Matthews teamed with Rachel Maddow, Eugene Robinson, Gregory, and Olbermann to cover the presidential election. During MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, Matthews said of presidential candidate Barack Obama, \\"I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often.\\" This led many on the right to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.  Phil Donahue cancellation  Phil Donahue's 2002 program Donahue was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the Iraq War. Despite earlier statements tying the cancellation to low ratings, Donahue was MSNBC's highest rated show that month. A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as \\"a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity\\".  Michael Savage dismissal  During the spring and early summer of 2003, MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host Michael Savage. In July of that year, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a \\"pig\\" and a \\"sodomite\\", and telling him he \\"should get AIDS and die\\". Savage's show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward (with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question went off air).  Don Imus dismissal  In early April 2007, Don Imus, whose radio show Imus in the Morning was simulcast on MSNBC, described members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team, as \\"some nappy- headed hoes\\". The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.\\"MSNBC drops simulcast of Don Imus show\\". msnbc.com. April 11, 2007.  Rise of the New Right documentary  In June 2010, a documentary airing on MSNBC and hosted by Chris Matthews titled Rise of the New Right drew significant criticism from conservatives and the Tea Party movement. The documentary features interviews with Dick Armey, the former House Majority Leader, Orly Taitz, a leading figure in the \\"birther\\" movement, and radio host Alex Jones. The documentary also showed the Michigan Militia's survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky Senatorial candidate Rand Paul. After the documentary aired, FreedomWorks, which is chaired by Dick Armey, issued a letter calling for a boycott of Dawn and Procter & Gamble, which advertises during Hardball with Chris Matthews.  Olbermann suspension  On November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Olbermann indefinitely without pay for contributing $2,400 (the maximum personal donation limit) to each of three Democratic candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle.Aujla, Simmi (November 5, 2010). \\"Keith Olbermann suspended after donating to Democrats\\". Politico. Contributions to political campaigns, under NBC News policy, are not allowed without prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter. The same day, MSNBC announced that he would return on the air starting November 9. Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for the same offense, as the Morning Joe host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's suspension was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24.\\"MSNBC Suspends 'Morning Joe' Host Scarborough for Political Donations\\" The Wall Street Journal November 19, 2010  Tucson shootings  During the news cycle following the 2011 Tucson shooting, conservative talk- radio host Mark Levin threatened to sue Chris Matthews and several other MSNBC commentators who suggested that he might have influenced the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner. Levin also defended Republican politician Sarah Palin from MSNBC punditry linking her political rhetoric to the heated political atmosphere surrounding the killings. Paul Bond of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"MSNBC was crucial in driving the narrative that the killer was egged on by violent political rhetoric, particularly from Palin\\". Bond also wrote \\"even after it was learned that the shooter was an atheist, flag-burning, Bush-hating, 9/11 Truther who enjoyed joking about abortion (not exactly the portrait of a Palin supporter), MSNBC still did not let up on that story line\\".  Mitt Romney video  Anchorwoman Andrea Mitchell was caught showing a doctored video clip of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a rally in Pennsylvania. The edited version features Romney saying how amazing it is to get a custom made sandwich, using a touch screen ordering device at a Wawa convenience store. What viewers didn't see or hear was nearly three minutes of Romney discussing the extensive amount of paperwork faced by an optometrist he'd talked to in trying to get the post office to change his address. He expressed mock amazement at Wawa's efficiency to underscore how the private sector is often more efficient than Government.  Romney-Ryan chant video  On Morning Joe, a discussion about Romney relying on his running mate Paul Ryan's popularity was begun with a clip from a Romney rally that showed the crowd chanting. In the clip Romney instructs them to chant \\"Romney-Ryan\\". According to the subtitle added by the show, they were chanting \\"Ryan\\", which along with the introduction to the clip, made it appear that Romney was injecting his own name into a \\"Ryan\\" chant. A caller to TheBlaze TV's Pat & Stu said she had been at the rally and they were chanting \\"Romney\\". Reporters who attended the event from the website BuzzFeed, and the New York Times both confirm that the crowd was chanting \\"Romney\\", and he added the name of his running mate. In response to criticisms, Joe Scarborough tweeted that they were chanting \\"Ryan\\", and that he would \\"take note of those who link to the lie\\". Lauren Skowronski, a spokeswoman for Morning Joe, sent out an email stating that, \\"the tape clip was untouched and was played as it was recorded\\", though the \\"Ryan\\" subscript was clearly added to the clip. Bias against Romney and for Obama week before 2012 presidential election A study by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC's coverage of Romney during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign (68% negative with no positive stories in the sample), was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5% was positive and 57% was negative. On the other hand, their coverage of Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33% of stories were positive and 13% negative. During the campaign's final week, 51% of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample. Host Martin Bashir resignation Host Martin Bashir resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin. On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Sarah Palin for comments that she made comparing the Federal debt to slavery.\\"MSNBC not commenting on whether further action contemplated against Bashir\\", Associated Press via Washington Post (November 19, 2013). Bashir attempted to counter Palin's comparison by referencing the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called \\"Derby's dose\\" which involved forcing slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave as punishment. Bashir then concluded by saying \\"When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.\\"Williams, Rob. \\"Martin Bashir says Sarah Palin is an 'idiot' and suggests someone should defecate in her mouth\\", The Independent (November 18, 2013). Host Melissa Harris-Perry and guest panel ridicule Mitt Romney's adopted black grandson Political commentator Melissa Harris-Perry and her guest panel, in a look back on 2013 segment on her show, showed a picture of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his extended family. Mr. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian Dean Obeidallah, joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, \\"One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.\\" Obeidallah said, \\"It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person.\\" Afterwards, Harris-Perry issued an apology in a series of Tweets. Biracial Super Bowl Cheerios Ad Tweet On January 29, 2014, a tweet was posted on MSNBC's official Twitter feed suggesting conservatives hate biracial families: \\"Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/ biracial family\\". Led by conservative blogger and news contributor Michelle Malkin, many conservatives tweeted pictures of their biracial families with the hashtag #myrightwingbiracialfamily. Many criticized the network for its constant race- baiting and desire to spread negative stereotypes, while others pointed back to many similar incidents by the network as part of a disturbing culture. MSNBC later deleted the tweet, posting a new one with an apology, stating the original tweet did not represent the network's position. MSNBC Executive Editor Richard Wolffe also tweeted that \\"The Cheerios tweet from @msnbc was dumb, offensive and we've taken it down. That's not who we are at MSNBC\\". Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus sent a letter to the network's president Phil Griffin stating he will encourage all conservatives not to participate on the network until there was a public apology. Griffin apologized a few hours later, stating the person who had posted the tweet had been fired. Priebus accepted the apology, saying they will continue to monitor the network's pattern of unacceptable behavior to see if it actually changes. Cinco de Mayo Celebration On May 5, 2014 during the show \\"Way Too Early\\", a segment was done about the historical background of Cinco De Mayo and featured Louis Burgdorf dancing around the set in a sombrero, shaking maracas and drinking tequila, which host Thomas Roberts referred to as \\"go-go juice\\". The segment came under quick criticism for its mocking of Mexican heritage and use of false stereotypes. MSNBC apologized the next day, saying there was no intention to be disrespectful and that while the props were planned, Roberts and Burgdorf acted the way they did on their own. The two hosts also apologized, although they partially deflected the blame back at their producers for allowing the segment to begin with. Assertions of bias in coverage of financial issues  In his book Medium Blue: The Politics of MSNBC, Michael Arria wrote that the issue is not so much left wing or right wing as MSNBC and other media serving their own financial interests. Arria said that an example of ignoring news that threatens its own financial interests was that MSNBC was silent about the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. Comment about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal In January 2015, Arsalan Iftikhar of TheMuslimGuy.com was on MSNBC to discuss Republican Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's denunciation of supposed Muslim \\"no-go zones\\" in London. Iftikhar commented that Jindal, who is Indian-American, \\"might be trying to scrub some of the brown off his skin\\" ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run. Host Alex Wagner did not challenge the comment. MSNBC later released a statement saying: \\"We found this guest's comments offensive and unacceptable and we don't plan on inviting him back.\\" Coverage of Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict A series of errors plagued MSNBC in October 2015 while covering the ongoing Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and added to recurring claims of anti-Israel bias from the network. Ayman Mohyeldin was reporting live from Gaza, where he claimed to have witnessed an unarmed Palestinian man being shot by Israeli police at the Damascus Gate. The anchor in the studio immediately corrected him on-air, as photos and live shots of the crime scene clearly showed that the man was wielding a large knife, and video confirmed police had told him multiple times to stop as he swung it at them. Mohyeldin, who has a history of negatively covering Israel, attempted to backtrack by claiming everything was moving too quickly for him to concentrate (despite having just been adamant that the man was unarmed). While he had initially claimed to have had a good vantage point of the incident as it unfolded, it was later reported that it did not take place in front of NBC News cameras. Coverage of the 2020 Democratic primary On February 2, 2019, NBC ran a story about Tulsi Gabbard, the third office holding Democrat to enter the presidential primaries, claiming that her campaign was benefiting from Russian state media. Specifically it stated that she had received twice as many mentions on RT, Sputnik News and Russia Insider compared to expected front-runners Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. The following day, Glenn Greenwald, known for his time with The Guardian and for founding The Intercept criticized the sourcing of the article whose claims were cited to a programmer who tracks troll accounts as a \\"hobby\\" and what Greenwald called the \\"disgraced firm\\" New Knowledge. The article in The Intercept discussed the fact that New Knowledge admitted to performing a \\"false flag\\" operation to discredit former Republican politician Roy Moore -- a move which led to the firm's suspension from Facebook and a request for an investigation by Moore's Democratic opponent Doug Jones. Greenwald also condemned one of the original authors Ben Popken for tweeting that \\"the Kremlin already has a crush on Tulsi Gabbard\\". Popken subsequently defended New Knowledge against accusations that he called \\"wild conflation and hyperbole\\" while Gabbard alleged that NBC was using guilt by association to target her foreign policy stances. The following March, Yashar Ali, a journalist for The Huffington Post accused Dafna Linzer, a managing editor at MSNBC, of ceding editorial control to the Democratic National Committee. Ali, who planned to announce the locations of the DNC debates in advance of MSNBC, received a call attempting to dissuade him with the phrase \\"let them make a few phone calls,\\" referring to party leaders. A source quoted by CNN stated that this approach was necessary for any network that has enough of a relationship with the DNC to host its debates. MSNBC has also received criticism for its treatment of Andrew Yang, who has been excluded from candidate graphics on multiple occasions. On June 9, 2019, MSNBC cited a poll from RealClearPolitics and did not display Yang ‚Äî who was polling at 8th ‚Äî yet included a total of 20 candidates. The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra called out MSNBC for the omission in a tweet, which was picked up by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). On November 18, 2019, MSNBC once again cited a poll (the November 17 DM Register/CNN poll) and again did not display Yang among the 11 top polling candidates even though Yang was tied at 6th place. MSNBC received further criticism when part of Yang's speech at the Poor People's Campaign Presidential Forum was cut from the broadcast for a live discussion with the correspondent; however, the footage has since been removed. In November 2019, Yang's campaign manager dismissed an apology by MSNBC for leaving Yang off of an infographic, which according to a compilation from Yang supporter and UBI writer Scott Santens, was the 15th time in the campaign cycle MSNBC or its related networks had excluded Yang. During the November debate hosted by MSNBC Yang received the least speaking time of any candidate, and was not given any time to speak for the first 32 minutes of the 2 hour debate. Yang's short total speaking time and the long period of time before he was brought in sparked accusations from critics of MSNBC suppressing the speaking time of Yang and other outsider candidates. The incident sparked protests outside of the debate studio from Yang's supporters, who chanted \\"M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!\\". On November 23, 2019, following the November debate, Yang publicly rejected a request to appear on MSNBC unless the network would \\"apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates‚Äô\\"  Criticism of individuals  * Chris Matthews: Matthews, host of the MSNBC TV show Hardball with Chris Matthews, aired an interview with former GOP Chairman Michael Steele on Sunday April 23, 2012. In the interview, Matthews incorrectly stated that Mitt Romney is a \\"flat-earther\\" and does not believe in evolution. He also called the GOP \\"the Grand Wizard Crowd\\", for which he later apologized. Matthews has also made many disparaging comments about women in politics over his career, including Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Melania Trump, often based on their appearance or private lives. * Alec Baldwin: On November 14, 2013, Baldwin, host of Up Late with Alec Baldwin, allegedly called a reporter who was following him a \\"cock- sucking fag\\". Baldwin would be suspended the next day and was eventually fired on November 23, 2013. * Martin Bashir: On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Sarah Palin for comments that she made comparing the Federal debt to slavery. Bashir attempted to counter Palin's comparison by referencing the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called \\"Derby's dose\\" which involved forcing slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave as punishment. Bashir then concluded by saying \\"When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.\\" Bashir was suspended on December 2, 2013, and resigned two days later.

Formation and Sections EP With the exception of Calvin Smith, The Safety Fire met at the London Oratory School in South West London. Lori Peri and Derya Nagle had both started playing their respective instruments at the age of 14, and started a band together. From there Derya recruited his class friend Joaquin Ardiles and Lori recruited Calvin Smith whom he had known since the age of 4 to play guitars and drums respectively. Eventually the band settled on Lori's friend Sean McWeeney as the vocalist, whom also attended their school. During this period they played the London music circuit extensively under multiple different names, eventually playing at the Mean Fiddler which was a career highlight for the young band, due to the historic nature of the venue. It was not until 2006 that the band decided to take a new musical direction and, with it, decided to go by the name, The Safety Fire. From 2006 - 2009 The Safety Fire attended different Universities, focusing on their own educational endeavors, but in this time wrote their debut release in the form of the Sections EP. Garnering critical acclaim across both the printed and online press, the band toured whenever they could. After finishing university The Safety Fire went into the studio once more, to focus on maturing their sound and to record their debut album. Signing to Inside Out Music and Grind the Ocean The Safety Fire announced signing to Inside Out Music on 23 August 2011, simultaneously releasing a lyric video for their debut single \\"Huge Hammers\\".

The Safety Fire announced their debut album Grind the Ocean would be released through Inside Out Music on 27 February 2012 in Europe and the following day in the US. On 14 December 2011, the band's debut single \\"Huge Hammers\\" was played by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on the feature \\"Next Hype\\". The band received further airplay by Radio 1 DJs Huw Stephens, Daniel P Carter, whilst also playing a live session for the XFM Rock show. During March and April 2012, The Safety Fire embarked on their first tour of North America, supporting Protest the Hero. The line up also included Periphery, Jeff Loomis band and Today I Caught the Plague. In the Spring of 2012, The Safety Fire did a short UK run with French progressive metal titans Gojira, before playing a number of festivals including Download Festival and Hevy Music Festival in the UK and Brutal Assault in the Czech Republic. In October 2012 The Safety Fire toured Europe and the UK with Between the Buried and Me and Periphery and were due head out with The Faceless across the UK in January/February 2013 (this tour was later cancelled because The Faceless were unable to obtain work visas). In March 2013, the band stated that they were entering the studio to record their second album, with a projected release date of mid-late 2013. They also traveled to BBC Scotland to take part on the British quiz show Eggheads.  Mouth of Swords  On 5 June 2013, The Safety Fire announced that their second album, Mouth of Swords, was to be released on 2 September 2013, once again through Inside Out Music worldwide. The album was recorded and produced by the band's guitarist Derya Nagle, who was the producer of the band's previous album and has worked with artists such as Frank Turner (Mongol Horde), Rise to Remain and The HAARP Machine. Furthermore, upon revealing their track listing they announced that Tommy Rogers of Between the Buried and Me was to be a guest on the track \\"Beware the Leopard (Jagwar)\\". The band headed out on their first headline tour from 4 to 9 September across the UK in support of Mouth of Swords before flying to North America to be a part of Between the Buried and Me's 'Future Sequence' tour across North America during September and October 2013, alongside The Faceless and The Contortionist. The band debuted their first single from the album, Glass Crush, on The Rock Show on BBC Radio 1 hosted by Daniel P. Carter on 7 August 2013. Throughout January 2014 the band toured with Protest the Hero, Tesseract and Intervals across Europe, before heading back to the US for the Progressive Nation at Sea Cruise 2014 and then on tour once again with Protest the Hero and Intervals, this time also with Battlecross and Night Verses joining the tour.

It was closed in 2003 The Central Uruguay Railway (CUR) was one of the five original rail systems in Uruguay. The other four were the Midland Uruguay Railway Co., the North Western of Uruguay, the Uruguay Northern, and the Uruguay East Coast Railway. CUR, including its leased and worked lines, was considered the most important system. It controlled about of track. The system operated four sections: the Central Uruguay Railway Original Line (including the Northeastern Line), ; the Northern Extension Railway, ; the Eastern Extension Railway, ; and the Western Extension Railway, . Overview The Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (CURCC) took the name of the company. Pictured, the 1900 football team, posing with the cup won Central Uruguay Railway Co. of Montevideo, Ltd. was registered In London in 1876. It was the largest railway company in Uruguay. It operated from 1 January 1878 to January 31, 1949, when railroads were nationalized. It worked, leased and absorbed some smaller rail systems. By the end of the era of British railways in Uruguay, CUR had a network of standard gauge, about half of the total within the country. It owned about 170 steam locomotives and several thousand cars. In 1891, CUR's British and Uruguayan employees founded the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club. Routes The Central Co. included the Central Uruguay and the Northeastern lines. It operated the lines of the Western Extension, the Northern Extension, and the Eastern Extension companies. The Central ran from Montevideo to Santa Isabel, across the Rio Negro, with a branch from Santa Lucia to San Jos√© de Mayo; the Northeastern connected Montevideo and Minas. The Western Extension ran from San Jose to Mercedes, with a branch to the port of Colonia. The Northern Extension continued the Central from Santa Izabel to Rivera on the Brazilian border. The Eastern Extension started from a point on the Northeastern from Montevideo and ran to Melo, with a branch to Treinta y Tres.

She is an authority on the Muricidae, a large and diverse family of predatory sea snails, or marine gastropod mollusks. Vokes worked both on her own and with her husband, geologist Harold Ernest Vokes. Education and personal life Emily Hoskins was born in Monroe, Louisiana, but the family moved to New Orleans when she was eight. Vokes attended Newcomb College, then the women's undergraduate college of Tulane University, but dropped out, uncertain of her future career. She went to work for the Biophysics Laboratory and found her way to the Geology Department, where she became interested in geomorphology and later paleontology. In 1955 she re-enrolled as an undergraduate, but because Newcomb College did not then offer geology degrees to its women students, Vokes switched to Tulane. She completed her B.S. degree in geology in 1960, while working part-time as a curator of fossils. Following this she obtained both her M.S. (1962) and Ph.D. (1967) degrees from Tulane. In 1959, Vokes married geologist Harold Ernest Vokes (1908‚Äì1998), whom she had met in 1956 when he came to Tulane to run the Geology Department. She often collaborated with him on scientific research. She published 147 articles and books alongside the 144 published under his name. Career Vokes began her academic career at Tulane University in 1969 as an instructor for University College, where she worked until 1973. That year, she became an associate professor at Newcomb College. She was promoted to full professor in 1981, and later served as chair of the Geology Department and as dean of Newcomb College. She retired in 1996 and became an emerita professor. She held the post of curator for the Geology Department's collections until 1974. Vokes and her husband helped to start a summer field-work camp in Mexico, and for over a decade they traveled annually to the Yucatan Peninsula to study molluscs, resulting in their book Distribution of Shallow-Water Marine Mollusca, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (1983). In 1968 Vokes collected fossils in Central America, especially Costa Rica and Panama. In 1971, she spent a sabbatical collecting fossils in South America (Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, Peru) and teaching at Brazil's University of Rio Grande do Sul. In 1971, Vokes published a large study of the genus Murex, entitled \\"Catalogue of the Genus Murex Linn√© (Mollusca:Gastropoda)\\". At the time of publication, some 2500 species had been named in the Linnaean genus Murex, and Vokes attempted to reassign each species to its correct genus. Between 1976 and 1986, Vokes spent a good deal of time surveying fossils in the Dominican Republic. Some of this work was part of a larger project coordinated with other researchers that aimed to identify the origins of various species found in the rock formations of the Dominican Republic. This research resulted in another of her major works, \\"Neogene paleontology in the Northern Dominican Republic 18: The superfamily Volutacea (in part) (Mollusca:Gastropoda)\\", a 1998 study of the superfamily Volutacea found in the Dominican Republic. It focused on a particular group of taxa that tend to be characterized by folding of the axial part of the shell. She was an editor of the Tulane Geology Department's journal, Tulane Studies in Geology and Paleontology. Vokes and her husband were the core of the paleontological research program at Tulane University, and their fossil collections were extensive. These collections included research findings from excursions to the southeastern United States, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, South America, and Europe. Vokes and her husband collected from 1546 localities, their specimens filling over 72 square yards of cabinet space. A large number of their specimens have been transferred to the Smithsonian, the University of Florida, and the Paleontological Research Institution. Later years In retirement, Vokes moved to Ponchatoula, Louisiana, where she opened an antique shop. In 2010, Vokes took part in a Tulane-sponsored trip to South Africa, where the group participated in a tree-planting program in Soweto.

Today he is known as the \\"Frisian painter\\" () in Germany. As a Naturalist painter he is notable for depicting the contemporary rural life of his native area. After a sponsored education in Copenhagen, Paris and Rome, Jessen returned to North Frisia where he lived off his paintings. Although one of the key figures in Northern German arts and notable for his accurate and detailed style, he has been blamed for idealising rural life. Life Jessen was born in Deezb√ºll, now a part of Nieb√ºll, in 1833. After an apprenticeship as a carpenter he used to work as a decorator on farmsteads in the marshlands of North Frisia. Between 1848 and 1854 he began as a self-educated portrait- painter. In 1853 he quit the carpenter's business and focused exclusively on painting. From 1856 to 1865 he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in Wilhelm Marstrand's class with a scholarship granted by a wealthy pastor, a landowner from Vester Gammelby (now a part of T√∏nder Municipality in Denmark) and by the Countess Schackenburg.Claassen (1996), \\"Carl Ludwig Jessen...\\", p. 52. Through Marstrand and fellow painters, Jessen was influenced by H√∏yen's idea of painting Danish national history and tradition. When Denmark lost the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia and Austria in 1865 after the Treaty of Vienna (1864) ended the Second Schleswig War, Jessen returned to North Frisia. A scholarship by the state of Prussia enabled him to travel to Paris and Rome in 1867 and 1868. During 1869/70 he lived in Klockries near Risum. According to his nephew Momme Nissen, he later lived in Hamburg from 1871 to 1875, but it has been suggested that Jessen only stayed there from 1875 to 1876.Claassen (1996), \\"Carl Ludwig Jessen...\\", pp. 53‚Äì54. Then he returned to Deezb√ºll where he lived from portraits and idealised homeland paintings in the style he learned in Copenhagen. In 1893 he married Martha Elisabeth Benecke from Hamburg. Contrary to Jessen's rural paintings, the couple built a modern house which was still atypical for the area. Claassen notes that Jessen's social career in North Frisia predated his reputation as a painter, since he held many honorary appointments. In 1910, aged 77, Jessen was granted an honorific professorial title from University of Kiel. He died in Deezb√ºll in 1917.Claassen (1996), \\"Carl Ludwig Jessen...\\", p. 54. Reception Carl Ludwig Jessen's work has been seen as central in the history of the arts of Northern Germany. His paintings have captured the traditions and daily life of the North Frisian community with the distinct accuracy of Naturalism. He has thus been called a chronicler of North Frisia. Jessen's reputation as a painter of idealised Frisian home country motives was promoted by his nephew Momme Nissen who was also a painter and a friend of conservative critic Julius Langbehn. In 1913 Nissen published a portfolio with 24 of his uncle's paintings which he called Nordfriesische Heimatkunst (North Frisian Homeland Art).Claassen (1996), \\"Carl Ludwig Jessen...\\", p. 56. Later critics were more differential in their approach, such as a 1918 review that notes the documentary part of Jessen works but mentions that the paintings lacked ever more in quality the harder Jessen tried to portray a specifically Frisian aspect. Schlee writes that Jessen due to his solid and crafty painting was particularly suited to accurately depict rural life but mentioned also that his works were always slightly idealised imaginations of the \\"good old days\\". This idea is supported by Clausen who writes that Jessen only painted the nice aspects of countryside life but almost completely ignored depictions of hard labour. Kaufmann observed that Jessen lost his originally na√Øve style of painting during his academic education.Claassen (1996), \\"Carl Ludwig Jessen...\\", pp. 56‚Äì57, citing the following:  * Selected works File:Carl Ludwig Jessen 001.jpgYoung Woman, F√∂hr, 1859 File:CLJessen Inneres einer roemischen Kirche.jpgItaly, interior of a Roman church, 1867 File:CLJessen Strickende Italienerin.jpgA Knitting Italian Woman, 1868 File:Thinggericht Gem√§lde Karl Ludwig Jessen.jpgFrisian Thing Assembly, 1875 File:1912 Jessen Die blaue Stube anagoria.JPGThe Blue Living Room, 1912 Further reading References ;Works cited * External links Works by C.

He received his basic training as a paratrooper and completed his service in the 10th maintenance battalion in Sigmaringen.  Education and professional career  Clemens Graf von Waldburg-Zeil is a graduate in business administration. He studied computer science and economics in Karlsruhe and T√ºbingen. From 1990 ‚Äì 1995 he worked as a consultant and auditor for Dr. Lipfert GmbH (later merged with PricewaterhouseCoopers) in Stuttgart. During his tenure at Dr. Lipfert GmbH he also worked as a tax advisor and consultant for the company based in Berlin. Thereafter between 1995 and 2002 he managed the finance department of the catholic Archdiocese of Berlin where he was also responsible for managing established subsidiaries including publishing and real estate companies. In 2003 Waldburg-Zeil accepted the position as Secretary General (CEO, member of the board) of the German Red Cross based in Berlin. He initiated a reorganization of the GRC to define a strategic framework for the governance of the German Red Cross, a federal system with 400.000 volunteers, 140.000 employees and a gross budget of 6 bn euros per year. The process culminated in the adoption of new regulatory statutes in 2009. That same year, Waldburg-Zeil was appointed Chairman of the Board (CEO) of the German Red Cross. Waldburg- Zeil is also very active in the international aid community through the GRCs work in providing foreign aid internationally (present in fifty countries for disaster management and development assistance) ) with a current budget of 50 Mio p.a. His responsibilities include amongst others:  Chairman (CEO) of the German Red Cross Foundations; Board member of BAGFW (Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der freien Wohlfahrtspflege) ‚Äì a political lobbying association of the six largest non-governmental providers of healthcare and social services);  Board member of DV (Deutscher Verein f√ºr √∂ffentliche und private F√ºrsorge) - the German Association for Public and Private Welfare;  Member of the supervisory board for ‚ÄûAktion Mensch‚Äù, the social lottery responsible for supporting disabled persons;  Member of the board of ‚ÄúStiftung Deutsche Behindertenhilfe‚Äù, one of Germans largest foundations (based on capitalisation).  German Red Cross  At the beginning of 2003, Clemens Graf von Waldburg-Zeil took over the post of Secretary-General of the German Red Cross (GRC). He assumed strategic responsibility over more than 5000 legally independent divisions of the GRC, which comprised over 400.000 volunteers, 150.000 employees and seven billion euros in annual turnover. Prior to his tenure, the GRC faced financial and organisational challenges, owed largely to its federalist structure. Waldburg-Zeil was able to implement a set of process improvements and innovations. As a result, the capital reserves of the GRC Federal Associan could built up to 53 million euros, following years of losses prior to Waldburg-Zeil's tenure. His overall legacy to the GRC was one of transformation - towards a more uniform and integrated association capable of initiating far-reaching improvement processes. Waldburg-Zeil's efforts culminated in a strategic initiative which he coined 2010plus. It was designed to solve further financial and operational challenges through newly created processes, while overcoming federal barriers. The 2010plus initiative was presented as a best practice template for large-scale change management projects in external non-profit organizations - such as the Protestant Church of Germany, and the Bertelmann foundation. Under the leadership of Waldburg- Zeil, the GRC achieved an agreement on structured funding with the Ministry of Development, which reduced the GRC's dependency on obtaining funds in large scale emergency cases and helped establish long-term relationships with regions at risk. After a reorganization of the GRC, Waldburg-Zeil was appointed Chairman of the board in 2009. In addition to achieving financial security, another major objective was to reestablish user rights to the names and symbols of the Red Cross. Under the initiative of the GRC, the Red Cross Act, which dates back to the Second World War, was completely modernized by the Ministry of Justice and approved by the Bundestag. All trademark rights to names and signs have been filed with the Trademark Court and all unlawful use of names and signs under trademark law have been prosecuted. On top of this, he was instrumental in integrating the ambulance and disaster relief services, providing them with easier access to funding. In the course of modernizing the German civil service and disaster protection act, Waldburg-Zeil became involved with the Bundestag's forum for future public safety, which eventually became a standalone association.

See Chiellini, 8 The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It is one of the first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography. The gilding and monumentality of the cross link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is reflective of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Vel√°zquez to Francis Bacon.Bacon said: \\"You know the great Cimabue Crucifixion? I always think of that as a worm crawling down the cross.\\" Sylvester, 14 The work has been in the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence since the late thirteenth century, and at the Museo dell'Opera Santa Croce since restoration following flooding of the Arno in 1966.Emmerson, 256It was in the Uffizi from 1948 to 1959 and is sometimes referred to as the Uffizi Crucifix. See Cecchi, 65 It remains in poor condition despite conservation efforts.  Commission  Both of Cimabue's surviving crucifixes were commissioned by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views had a profound effect on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid- twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.Kleinhenz, 224Paolettii, 49 The church at Santa Croce was the third that the Franciscans constructed at the site. The first was begun in 1295, and is where Cimabue's Crucifix probably hung, given its large size, above the rood screen. It was later positioned at the north transept, in the sacristy and by the entrance on the southern flank.Jacks, 492  Description  Cimabue achieves a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches tended to be extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings.Chiellini, 8 Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.Chiellini, 15  Crucifixion  Arezzo crucifix, c. 1268‚Äì1271. This is the earlier of the two extant crucifixes attributed to him. Compared to earlier works of this type, Christ's body is more physically corporeal, depicted as a real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above the level of the cross.Farthing, 43 His body arches, forcing his torso to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds in his hands as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the physical reality of approaching death.Larson, Kay. \\"Survival of the Greatest\\". New York, 27 September 1982 His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, may be influenced by earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano.Gibbs, Robert. \\"Cimabue\\". Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 30 October 2016 His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; \\"Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man\\". Giunta Pisano, Crucifix, tempera on wood, 1240s. Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi His eyes are open, and his skin is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or timeless sky.Isaac, 2‚Äì3 This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, was known as the Christus triumphans (\\"Triumphant Christ\\"), and for contemporary ‚Äì especially Franciscan ‚Äì taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ.Thompson, 61Paolettii, 50 From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens (\\"Suffering Christ\\") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.Osborne, 245 The work surpasses Cimabue's c. 1268 Arezzo crucifix in several ways. It is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types,Paolettii, 52 and the anatomy is more convincing. Christ's face is longer and narrower, and his nose less idealised. These features, according to art historian Robert Gibbs, give him \\"a coarser but more personal expression\\". A similar approach is taken with the cloth in the background of the cross itself, which although highly ornamented, lacks the lavish ornamentation of the equivalent cloth in the Arezzo cross. His head hangs in exhaustion, and his hands bleed from the puncture wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry the weight of his body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.Paolettii, 51 The painting contains elements typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions.Bologna, 333 But in other respects it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.Chiellini, 11  Saints  Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ in small rectangular panels at either end of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.Hourihane, 229 Their cloaks are simpler and lack the lavish gilding of the Arezzo crucifixion. The Virgin wears a red dress. Her robe was originally blue, but has darkened.Messina, 45  Carpentry  The crucifix measures 448 cm x 390 cm and consists of five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices.Brink, 646 The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork. Its dimensions are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably influenced by the geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles.Brink, 647 Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning of some of the boards on the lower half.Brink, 651  Attribution  Due to lack of surviving documentation, it is difficult to attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicol√≤ Albertini.Magill, 272 It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period.Hourihane, 154 According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation. Rejecting these views, Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle in 1903 concluded that the Santa Croce crucifix \\"in technical examination...makes some approach to the Florentine master, but it is rather of its time than by the master himself.\\"Crowe; Cavalcaselle, 207  1966 damage and restoration  State before restoration The crucifix was installed in the church of Santa Croce at the end of the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame,Brink, 645 which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.Messina, 6 Detail pre-restoration A team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the \\"Laboratario del Restauro\\" in FlorenceMessina, 3 spent ten years reapplying paint. They worked in an almost pointillist manner, with the aid of computer modelling. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976. The international press covered the restoration; since then the work has been lent to galleries outside Italy, the first time it had left Florence since its creation. According to the critic Waldemar Januszczak, it was brought \\"around the globe in a curious, post-restoration state‚Äîpart original artwork, part masterpiece of modern science ... a thirteenth century‚Äîtwentieth-century hybrid.\\"Januszczak, 175-76  References   Notes   Sources  * Bologna, Ferdinando. \\"The Crowning Disc of a Duecento 'Crucifixion' and Other Points Relevant to Duccio's Relationship to Cimabue\\".

History Shepherd's Bush Cinematograph circa 1910 The Palladium was completed on 3 March 1910 and was originally called the Shepherd's Bush Cinematograph Theatre. The original owner was Montagu Pyke; the building was designed by an unknown architect. The original seating capacity was 900. From the beginning there were problems. In January 1921 the manager of the Cinematograph complained to Hammersmith Council ‚Äì which owned the local electricity supply station ‚Äì that there was too little power available to screen films, and that therefore the theatre had to close at 6.15 pm. He claimed compensation of ¬£60 for loss of business.Barbara Denny, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush Past, London: Historical Publications, 1995, , p. 101. In November 1923 the building reopened with 763 seats as the New Palladium (later called the Palladium, the Essoldo, the Classic, and finally the Odeon 2), designed by architect John Stanley Coombe Beard. Beard designed many cinemas in and around London, judged by one architectural historian as \\"excellent, if stylistically slightly eccentric\\".Richard Gray, Cinemas in Britain: One Hundred Years of Cinema Architecture, The Cinema Theatre Association, London: Lund Humphries, 1996, , p. 27.

It is the central part of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects the giant Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe through the South Caucasus Pipeline and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline. The pipeline has a strategic importance for both Azerbaijan and Turkey. It allows the first Azerbaijani gas exports to Europe, beyond Turkey. It also strengthens the role of Turkey as a regional energy hub. The construction of the -long pipeline started in March 2015, and it was inaugurated in June 2018. History Trans- Anatolian gas pipeline inauguration at the Turkish city of Eski≈üehir, 12 June 2018 Ilham Aliyev with Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan The project was announced on 17 November 2011 at the Third Black Sea Energy and Economic Forum in Istanbul. On 26 December 2011, Turkey and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a consortium to build and operate the pipeline. At first, a film dedicated to TANAP project was demonstrated. In the film, it was emphasized that TANAP is the signature of friendship and brotherhood between Turkey and Azerbaijan to Anatolia. In spring 2012, the process of conducting the technical-economic feasibility study was launched. On 26 June 2012, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and then Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan signed a binding intergovernmental agreement on the pipeline. Also, the agreement was signed by Azerbaijani Industry and Energy Minister Natig Aliyev and Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yildiz. The initial agreement on organizational issues between BOTA≈û and SOCAR was signed by Natig Aliyev and Taner Yildiz, SOCAR President Rovnag Abdullayev and BOTA≈û Deputy Director General Mehmet Konuk. The host country agreement was signed by Yildiz and Abdullayev. On March 17, 2015, both Erdoƒüan and Aliyev met with Giorgi Margvelashvili, President of Georgia, in the city of Kars in Eastern Turkey to formally lay the foundations for the pipeline and marking the work as started. On 12 June 2018, the TANAP was inaugurated at the compressor- measuring station in Eskisehir. The ceremony was attended by the Turkish president Erdoƒüan, the Azerbaijani president Aliyev, the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, the Serbian president Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, and the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov, as also by the head of SOCAR Abdullayev, Turkish minister of energy and natural resources Berat Albayrak, and the chief executive officer of BP Bob Dudley. On November 21, 2018, Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) have been joined along the shores of the Maritsa River at the Turkish-Greek border. As a result of the joining of these two pipelines, Azerbaijani natural gas from the Shah Deniz-2 field can be transported to Italy via Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania, and the Adriatic Sea. Description The pipeline cost US$8.5 billion. $800 million of funding was approved by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas per year at initial stage and would be increased later up to by 2023, by 2026, and at the final stage to be able to transport additional gas supplies from Azerbaijan and, if the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, from Turkmenistan. Its capacity would be increased by adding parallel loops and compressor stations according to the increase of available supplies. The pipeline will consist of pipes until Eski≈üehir, and pipes thereafter and across Marmora sea. The maximum height of the pipeline is 2,700 metres above mean sea level. Route The TANAP pipeline passes through 20 provinces of Turkey - Ardahan, Kars, Erzurum, Erzincan, Bayburt, G√ºm√º≈ühane, Giresun , Sivas, Yozgat, Kƒ±r≈üehir , Kƒ±rƒ±kkale, Ankara, Eski≈üehir, Bilecik, K√ºtahya, Bursa, Balikesir, √áanakkale, Tekirdaƒü and Edirne. The pipeline will start from Sangachal terminal and in territory of Azerbaijan it will be the expansion of existing South Caucasus Pipeline (SCPx). From end point of SCPx which is in Erzurum it will be continued to Eskishehir where it will unload 6bcm of gas entitled to Turkish buyers. From Turkey-Greece border it will continue through Greece, Albania and will end in Italy. The exact route of the pipeline is not clear. However, it was announced that one branch from Turkey would go to Greece and the other to Bulgaria. It would be connected with Trans Adriatic Pipeline. The Turkish government said in March 2015 that a branch from Greece through Macedonia and Serbia to Hungary was also under consideration. Shareholders The TANAP is operated by SOCAR. SGC holds 58% stake in the project. Turkey's pipeline operator BOTA≈û own 30%, while BP acquired 12% in the project on March 13, 2015. The TANAP project company is headquartered in the Netherlands. Initially, Azerbaijan had held an 80% stake, with Turkey owning the remainder. The Turkish stake was divided between the Turkish upstream company TPAO (15%) and the Turkish pipeline operator BOTA≈û (5%). The international companies from the Shah Deniz consortium (BP, Statoil and Total) had an option to take up to 29% in TANAP. However, only BP exercised this option in December 2013.BOTAS, BP Pipelines intend to become TANAP shareholders, trend.az, 17 December 2014, retrieved on 19 January 2015 The Turkish government decided then that only BOTA≈û will hold a stake (20%) in TANAP. The Turkish pipeline operator acquired an additional 10% in May 2014. SOCAR's initial plan was to retain 51% and operatorship of the project.

His goal was the conquest of Sogdiana. Alexander first sent Craterus to Cyropolis, the largest of the Sogdianan towns holding out against Alexander's forces. Craterus' instructions were to \\"take up a position close to the town, surround it with a ditch and stockade, and then assemble such siege engines as might suit his purpose....\\". The idea was to keep the inhabitants focused on their own defences and to prevent them from sending assistance out to the other towns. Starting from Gazza, Alexander went on to conquer the other surrounding towns. Five of the seven towns were taken in two days. Many of the inhabitants were killed. Alexander then arrived at Cyropolis, which was the best fortified of the towns and had the largest population. It also had reputedly the best fighters of the region. Alexander battered Cyropolis' defences with the siege engines. While the bombardment went on, Alexander ordered certain of his troops to sneak through a dried-up water course that went under the town's wall. Alexander also joined this mission and once inside his troops opened the town's gate to admit his attacking force. Once the natives saw that the town was taken, they fell violently upon the attackers. Alexander received a violent blow from a stone that landed upon his head and neck. Craterus was wounded by an arrow, but the defenders were driven off. Arrian puts the defender's force at about 15,000 fighting men and claims that 8,000 of them were killed in the first phase of the operation. The rest apparently sought refuge inside the town's central fortress, but surrendered after one day for lack of water. Accounts of how the battle went differ among authors. Arrian cites Ptolemy as saying Cyropolis surrendered from the start, and Arrian also states that according to Aristobulus the place was stormed and the town's inhabitants were massacred.

History According to the wife of John E. Williams, a great-grandson of James B. Posey and a great-nephew of Walter S. Posey, the events that led to the naming of Posey are as follows: In 1904, James B. Posey and Lewis T. Lester purchased controlling interest in First National Bank of Lubbock. Later, in 1908, the James B. Posey family purchased a farm between Lubbock and Slaton and built a house on what later proved to be in the center of the survey of the proposed Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The family moved the house about a mile north and when the railroad was established, a switch was installed on the original site of the Posey house and subsequently named ‚ÄúPosey Switch‚Äù. Later, when a community grew up around Posey Switch, the name was abbreviated to ‚ÄúPosey‚Äù.Mrs. J.E. Williams, \\"Posey, Texas Forum,\\" Texas Escapes Online Magazine, http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasTowns/Posey-Texas.htm#name, accessed December 25, 2011. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community of Posey was officially founded in 1936 with a population of twenty-five and three businesses.Mark Odintz, \\"Posey, TX (Lubbock County),\\" Handbook of Texas Online, https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hlp42, accessed December 24, 2011, Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Posey grew to a population of seventy by 1941 and by then it had a church, a school, a grain elevator, and two businesses. The Posey school was consolidated with those of Slaton by the 1960s, and today the community has an active cotton gin, a Lutheran church, and a few scattered homes. With regard to transportation, Posey is well situated. U.S. Highway 84 runs along the east side of Posey and Farm to Market Road 1585 passes to the south. The BNSF Railway now owns and operates the tracks on the east side of town, but passenger service was discontinued long ago and the many freight trains that pass through the area rarely pause in the vicinity of Posey Switch.

He, along with Joseph Nevins, are at the center of a research fabrication scandal at Duke University.\\"Deception at Duke\\", 60 Minutes, CBS, 12 February 2012 On 9 November 2015, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) found that Potti had engaged in research misconduct.https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/11/09/2015-28437/findings- of-research-misconduct Findings of Research Misconduct According to Potti's voluntary settlement agreement with ORI, Potti can continue to perform research with the requirement of supervision until year 2020, while he \\"neither admits nor denies ORI's findings of research misconduct.\\" As of 2020 Potti, who is employed at the Cancer Center of North Dakota, has had 11 of his research publications retracted, one publication has received an expression of concern, and two others have been corrected.  Biography  Anil Potti graduated from Christian Medical College, Vellore, India in 1995. He finished an internship in Internal Medicine at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine in 1999. In 2006 Potti completed training in hematology and oncology at Duke University. Potti resigned from Duke in 2010, following the discovery of flaws in the genomics research conducted at Duke and allegations of embellishments in his resume, assuming responsibility for the anomalies in the scientific research. Following his resignation from Duke, Potti worked as an oncologist in South Carolina, but was let go in 2012. Scientific misconduct According to the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), Potti engaged in scientific misconduct while a cancer researcher at both Duke University's Medical Center and School of Medicine. He resigned in November 2010 after Duke put him on administrative leave, terminated the clinical trials based on his research and retracted his published data.\\"Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns\\", Duke Chronicle\\"Suspended cancer trials terminated\\", Duke Chronicle Potti and his team were accused of falsifying data regarding the use of microarray genetic analysis for personalised cancer treatment, which was published in various prestigious scientific journals. While there were questions concerning Potti's work beginning in 2007, notably from two bioinformatic statisticians, Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes at MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2010 brought further and more widespread scrutiny when it was discovered by Paul Goldberg and reported in The Cancer Letter that Potti had claimed on his curriculum vitae that he had been a \\"Rhodes Scholar (Australian Board)\\". He said he was referring to the Association of Rhodes Scholars in Australia Scholarships, an award granted by an organisation of former Rhodes Scholars to bring Commonwealth citizens who attend overseas institutions in to Australia. Potti's fraudulent research was funded by the US government through the National Institutes of Health; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and the National Cancer Institute, in the form of six multi-year grants, and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. 60 Minutes described the case as \\"one of the biggest medical research frauds ever\\".http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham- county/article20103387.html  University response  Duke University became aware of the suspicions of research misconduct by 2008, when a medical student working with Potti and Nevins withdrew his name from the research and submitted a memorandum entitled \\"Research Concerns\\" to the administration. The administration denied any misconduct and convinced the student not to report his experiences to the funding agency, Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Duke later claimed that there had not been a whistleblower involved in the issue.  Investigation  The Potti scandal prompted the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study of the proper use of genomics in clinical trials. The Institute of Medicine's report, entitled \\"Evolution of Translational Omics: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward\\", was published on 23 March 2012 and made detailed specific recommendations for clinical trials that incorporate \\"omics\\". In February 2012, Joseph Nevins stated that it was \\"abundantly clear\\" that there was \\"manipulated data\\" that could not have occurred by chance. This was confirmed by the 2015 ORI report.  Aftermath  Healthcare companies cut ties with Potti after evidence surfaced that Potti had fabricated awards on his resume. The American Cancer Society stopped payments of a five-year grant which totaled $729,000 as Potti had received the grant based on his credentials. Duke University later reimbursed the American Cancer Society for the full amount of the grant.\\"Health care companies cut ties with Potti\\", Duke Chronicle Three clinical trials at Duke University Medical Center based on Potti's research came under scrutiny in 2009 and were temporarily suspended, then were permanently stopped in 2010.\\"Cancer research questioned\\", Duke Chronicle The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) reviewed one of the studies in 2009, several years after its initiation, and concluded that the study would require an Investigational New Drug application, which had not been submitted. An FDA audit in 2011 further showed that an Investigational Device Exemption application had not been filed, but otherwise found \\"no significant deficiencies\\" in Duke's IRB conduct. Potti's medical license record with the North Carolina Medical Board shows eleven settlements, each of at least $75,000, for incidents that appear to be related to these trials. In late 2011, the North Carolina Medical Board reprimanded Potti but he retains his medical license. The board issued its disciplinary action against Potti but imposed no sanctions. In its consent order, the North Carolina Medical Board stated that the board has no evidence from which it could conclude that Potti received funding for medical research as a result of the inaccuracies that he would not have otherwise received, but concluded that \\"...Potti's conduct as described herein constitutes unprofessional conduct...\\" In separate action on Potti's medical license, the North Carolina Medical Board reviewed 11 payments made to settle malpractice claims and posted on its website that \\"no public action was warranted\\". Potti was issued a medical license in Missouri on 1 February 2011; on 6 March 2012, the Missouri medical board (known as the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts) issued a reprimand on the basis of actions taken by the North Carolina Medical Board. In January 2011 Potti applied for a medical license in South Carolina, which was approved in April 2011. Potti was employed as a practicing physician at the Coastal Cancer Center in Loris from March 2011 until 21 February 2012, when he was let go. In addition to the settlements, two lawsuits also have been filed against Potti, as well as against Duke and other medical personnel there, charging medical negligence among other claims. In his response to the lawsuits, Potti stated that he was \\"not aware that false or improper data was included in the research.\\" Robert Califf of Duke testified that they had looked at 40 of Potti's publications and that two-thirds of them would be retracted in whole or in part. Science reported this as \\"The fallout from the Duke case includes 27 papers that Duke expects to be partially or completely retracted\\". As of February 2012, ten scientific papers authored by Potti and others have been retracted. After leaving Duke, Potti hired Online Reputation Manager, a reputation management company, to improve search results for his name. In February 2013, WordPress received DMCA takedown notices for Retraction Watch blog posts critical of Potti and the posts were removed. Retraction Watch alleges that these DMCA take-down notices were based on false claims. In November, 2013, Automattic, provider of the WordPress webhost service that hosts Retraction Watch, filed suit against the filer of the takedown notice, saying that he had made those false claims in violation of the DMCA. Research questions and Institute of Medicine report on 'Omics' Following questions raised about genomics research that was led by Potti and Nevins at Duke between 2004 and 2010, the National Cancer Institute requested that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) establish a committee to recommend ways to strengthen omics-based test development and evaluation. The IOM's recommendations released in March 2012 spoke to the many parties responsible for discovery and development of omics-based tests, including investigators, their institutions, sponsors of research, the FDA, and journals. The report identified best practices to enhance development, evaluation, and translation of omics-based tests while simultaneously reinforcing steps to ensure that these tests are appropriately assessed for scientific validity before they are used to guide patient treatment in clinical trials. The IOM's recommendations aimed to ensure that progress in omics test development is grounded in sound scientific practice and is reproducible, resulting not only in improved health care but also in continued public trust. The IOM report further added that \\"failure by many parties [at Duke] to detect or act on problems with key data and computational methods ‚Ä¶ led to the inappropriate enrollment of patients in clinical trials, premature launch of companies and retraction of dozens of research papers.\\" The report specifically called for scientific investigators to make the data, computer codes and computational procedures used to develop their clinical tests \\"publicly accessible for independent review\\" and to ensure that their data and research steps are presented comprehensibly. The report also found that so-called \\"omics\\" tests ‚Äì such as genomics and proteomics, which are diagnostic tools based on molecular patterns ‚Äì are in general highly prone to errors. IOM committee chair Gilbert Omenn, a computational biologist at the University of Michigan, said the problems could have been avoided. But he noted, as well, that those kind of problems were not unique to Duke.\\"There are a lot of lessons here that surely apply to other places,\\" Omenn said. Continuing controversy One question that neither Duke nor people involved in the research have been able to explicitly answer thus far is how data corruption or manipulation that would require thorough knowledge of microarray data warehouse (large specialised databases) as well as bioinformatics occurred. Dr. Robert Califf's comments about TMQF only addresses data provenance, adequate quantitative collaboration, accountability and open dialogue about issues beyond the individual lab and systems to deal with conflict of interest. In a curt exchange with committee member Thomas Fleming, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington, Dr. Joseph Nevins refused to say how he believed the data problems occurred. When Fleming pointed out that because the problems in the data improved the experimental results, it seemed that they were introduced intentionally. \\"I can't address it,\\" Nevins responded. \\"I just can't get into a position of speculating on how it happened.\\" Retracted papers As of 2018, 11 papers co-authored by Potti have been retracted, and seven others have been corrected.http://retractionwatch.com/2012/08/20/anil-potti-resurfaces-with- job-at-north-dakota-cancer-center/#more-9294 Potti's retracted papers are: ;A Genomic Approach to Colon Cancer Risk Stratification Yields Biologic Insights into Therapeutic Opportunities This article was published by PNAS. Gene expressions could allow the researchers to see if tumors are uniform throughout. This could also be used with colon cancer. They also can help predict how a person will respond to treatment and improve prognosis. The authors said they wanted to retract this article because \\"‚Ä¶we have been unable to reproduce certain key experiments described in the paper regarding validation and use of the colon cancer prognostic signature. This includes the validation performed with dataset E-MEXP-1224, as reported in Fig. 2A, as well as the generation of prognostic scores for colon cancer cell lines, as reported in Fig. 4‚Ä¶\\" ;Validation of Gene Signatures that Predict the Response of Breast Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy This article was published in Lancet Oncology. This study involved patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer. The researchers wanted to confirm their previous studies of gene-expression signatures in predicting the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. The article was retracted because the validity of the results was beginning to be questioned and because predictions were made off of the Nature Medicine article that was retracted. ;Genomic Signatures to Guide the Use of Chemotherapeutics This article was published in Nature Medicine. Gene expression signatures were developed with in vitro drug sensitivity data and Affymetrix microarray data. These were used to help predict response and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs as well as corresponding drugs. This article was retracted after being corrected because many key experiments could not be reproduced. ;Gene Expression Signatures, Clinicopathological Features, and Individualized Therapy in Breast Cancer This article was published in JAMA (Journal of American Medicine Association). The patients had early-stage breast carcinoma. The study's main point was to find if gene expression signatures could refine breast cancer prognosis. This article talks about cancer, genomic technology, and chemotherapy and radiation. This article was retracted because a large part of the article was based on another article that Potti had written and had published in Nature Medicine. The article in Nature Medicine had been retracted because of failure to reproduce results. ;Pharmacogenomic Strategies Provide a Rational Approach to the Treatment of Cisplatin-Resistant Patients with Advanced Cancer This article was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Usually, platinum-based chemotherapy is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, but how patients respond is highly variable. This article also talks about predicting how individuals will respond to cisplatin and pemetrexed. This article was retracted because experiments could not be reproduced. ;Gene-expression Patterns Predict Phenotypes of Immune-mediated Thrombosis This article was published in the journal Blood. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects about 3 in 1000 Americans. Out of the three, 10% have aPLAs. This study consisted of 129 patients. Out of those 129, 57 had APS and VTE, 32 had VTE without aPLA, 32 had aPLA, and 8 were healthy. Gene-expression profiles identify and predict individuals with APS from patients with VTE without aPLA. It is important to be able to predict APS and venous thrombosis because it will help with the management of the disease. This article was retracted because the other authors were unable to reproduce the data Potti cited. ;A Genomic Strategy to Refine Prognosis in Early-Stage Non‚ÄìSmall-Cell Lung Cancer This article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patients of this study were in stage IB, II, or IIIA of non-small cell lung cancer. Many patients receive surgery, but the risk of relapse is high. Others receive toxic chemotherapy unnecessarily. This study used gene-expressions to evaluate what form of treatment would be best. This article was retracted by the authors because they could not reproduce the results from the article. ;An Integrated Approach to the Prediction of Chemotherapeutic Response in Patients with Breast Cancer This article was published in PLOS One. It is important for cancer patients to receive the most effective treatment while also hopefully having the best quality of life possible. The researchers developed mRNA and microRNA profiles. They tested the mRNA profiles on 133 breast cancer patients. These breast cancer patients had been treated with TFAC chemotherapy treatment. This article was retracted as some of the information used in it derived from the Nature Medicine article which had been retracted. As that article had been retracted, it was felt that this article should be, as well. ;An Integrated Genomic-Based Approach to Individualized Treatment of Patients With Advanced-Stage Ovarian Cancer This paper was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in February 2007. The research studied ovarian cancer patient responses to platinum-based therapy. This marks the latest in a series of about 13 expected Potti retractions, with another 13 expected partial retractions. ;Characterizing the Clinical Relevance of an Embryonic Stem Cell Phenotype in Lung Adenocarcinoma This paper was published in Clinical Cancer Research on 15 December 2009. The study purportedly found a common gene expression pattern between lung adenocarcinomas and normal human embryonic stem cells that was associated with a shorter survival of patients with the lung cancer. On 21 February 2012, the manuscript was retracted. The retraction statement was signed by all authors and indicated \\"that clinical information from a data set ... available at the time of the signature development, was incorrect\\". Further, that statement indicated that \\"Drs. Anil Potti and Marvaretta Stevenson take full responsibility for this error\\". ;Upregulated Oncogenic Pathways in Patients Exposed to Tobacco Smoke May Provide a Novel Approach to Lung Cancer Chemoprevention Published in the journal Chest, this paper was retracted in 2012 with the retraction notice stating \\"The authors relied on the results reported by Potti, and they were not aware of the errors subsequently reported.\\" Paper under suspicion * Age- and Sex-Specific Genomic Profiles in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer was published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association (JAMA). This study, conducted at Duke University from July 2008 until June 2009, investigated age and gender influence on response to cancer by studying the genes of 787 non-small cell lung cancer patients. The article is under review but has not been retracted as of February 2012.

ASHAR or AXAR is the third month in Assamese Calendar and KANDI (Assamese term) means 'shedding tears'. During ASHAR, heavy sub-tropical rainfall creates flood in this low-lying area, which causes the dwellers of this place to shed tears out of misery. Especially the potters suffer a lot. Because they cannot make, dry up, burn their products and even cannot store safely their earlier produced items during the rainy season. But they selected the place due to some economically viable factors like the availability of raw materials, cheaper transportation facility, important strategic location, etc. The soil HIRAMATI is the soul of this craft. There are huge reserves of HIRAMATI in surrounding areas and the potters use the cheapest means of transport like boat as the village is just on the bank of the river Gadadhar, a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra. For the purpose of selling the products, both the surface transport and water transport are availed. The closeness of the village to Brahmaputra has given a great an advantage for shipping network with the major cities. Geography The village is situated at . It has an average elevation of 26 meters (85 feet). The river Gadadhar is flowing next to the village.About Gauripur and Dhubri District, Assam Culture of the village Originally, in early 19th century, a cluster of families of pottery community migrated from East Bengal (now Bangladesh) to Asharikandi and maintained their profession with innovation. Thus the Assamese terracotta art and culture took its birth at Asharikandi through a few cluster of pottery families. Today more than 80% families of this village are engaged in this ethnic art (handicraft) and pass their life after selling the terracotta items in the national and international markets.Asharikandi: Famous for Terracotta Traditionally most of these families belong to 'Paul' community of Bengali ethnicity. In Assam 'Paul' means Kumar (that is, potter). These days Dhubri district has acquired a pivotal position in the terracotta and pottery markets in India and abroad. Prominent artisans in the village Among the numerous artisans of Asharikandi cluster, late Sarala Bala Devi, who bagged the national award on Terracotta craft in 1982 for her innovative masterpiece - HATIMA doll, a lovely female figure with a child on her lap - brought name and fame to the craft village. Dhirendra Nath Paul, a son of Sarala Bala Devi, is nationally and internationally acclaimed master craftsman on Terracotta. Mahadev Paul is one of the senior craftsmen of this cluster. He begged state award on Terracotta for his excellent masterpiece Ganesh. Gokul Paul and Ashwini Paul are some young upcoming talents of this cluster.Dhubri District Industrial Profile Present status and Government initiatives Considering the tourism potential of this craft village, the Government of Assam has declared the village as a model village and brought under its rural tourism projects. NECARDO (North East Craft And Rural Development Organisation), an NGO, has been working for the revival of the craft and socio-economic development of the craftpersons. NECARDO is also implementing a United Nations Development Project (UNDP) for the promotion of terracotta art and culture since 2006.

It has sold in small numbers and remains in production. Design and development Several companies and groups have developed a series of designs which began at an offshoot of the Trod Kuznetsov aircraft engine plant in Samara. Beginning with the L-3, they differ in size and engine type but all are twin engine amphibians with a characteristic V tail. The L-4 is a direct development of the L-6M, promoted by AeroVolga. Its design began in August 2004. All L-4 variants have the same layout and all are largely built of composite materials. They are high-wing monoplanes with twin engines mounted close to the fuselage, on top of the wing. The wings have straight taper on both edges and almost square tips. The L-4 has a pair of flaps on each wing. Its hull has two steps and there are small winglets at waterlevel just aft of the trailing edge. The cabin extends from below the leading edge rearwards to the winglets. Fixed floats under the wings stabilize the L-4 on water; it is operable with waves to 400 mm (15 in) high. The most unusual feature of the L-4 is the empennage arrangement: it has twin fins, mounted on the fuselage and extended forward with long, curved dorsal fillets, separated at the base by the full fuselage width and leaning slightly outwards. The fins carry conventional rudders and the single tailplane is mounted upon the fin tips, extending well beyond them. Tailplane and single piece elevator together are trapezoidal; there is a trim tab at the centre of the elevator. The reason for the design is that the spine serves as a walkway to access the plane from behind, when moored at shore. The L-4 has a conventional undercarriage for land use, all three wheels and the water rudder being retractable. The first flight of the L-4 was in June 2005. The most recent variant, the more powerful L-44 flew in 2009. Operational history By mid-2008 sales, probably including L-6s from AeroVolga, had reached 14. Variants ;L-4: Original design, no longer produced. ;L-42: Improved, with Rotax 912 ULS flat four 73.3 kW (98.6 hp) engines. ;L-42M: Further improvements: weight savings, winglets, crew ergonomics.

He operated a commercial rose nursery in Scappoose, Oregon and published articles and books on rose production and cultivation. Biography Hennessey operated a commercial rose nursery from the 1930s to the 1960s. He published a column on rose cultivation in the Oregon Journal, starting in July 28, 1940. He participated in the American Rose Society's Proof of the Pudding program, in which professional rosarians evaluated new rose cultivars, from 1934 to 1941. He self-published Hennessey on Roses in 1942. He presented himself as self- taught in rose cultivation through many years experience growing tens of thousands of roses, for sale, in display gardens, and in test gardens. His last nursery catalog appeared in 1963. One of the controversies surrounding Hennessey concerned his promotion of the dark red Australian rose 'Nigger Boy', hybridized by George Robert Knight of New South Wales. He planted this rose in his test gardens in 1941 and carried it in his catalog through 1962. In response to pressure to not sell this rose due to its offensive name, he took out a full-page ad in American Rose magazine in 1951, advertising his nursery as \\"The Home of Nigger Boy\\". Hennessey on Roses Hennessey's advice on the growing of roses was often contrary to prevailing practices, and he was regarded as dogmatic and opinionated. Two of his mantras which were contrary to conventional wisdom, are to not prune roots when planting roses, and that roses are so tough that you could do anything to a rose bush short of leaving it lying on the ground, and it will grow and bloom. He also advocated for the reliance on beneficial insects rather than insecticides for pest control; for allowing roses to grow unpruned for a few years before beginning annual pruning; for selecting rose cultivars that will prosper in the particular climate they will be planted in; for not adding uncomposted organic matter in planting holes; for the installation of underground irrigation in rose gardens; and for providing some shade for roses in warm climates. He also credited anonymous Chinese gardeners with the creation of the double-flowered reblooming China and Tea roses introduced into European gardens and hybridizing programs, in contrast to the prevailing belief that these roses were discovered growing wild in China by European explorers. He ridiculed the belief that the Chinese could not possibly have created something that Europe didn't have, therefore these roses must be wild species. His book Hennessey on Roses contains chapters on why rose colors and fragrances are so variable, the effects of climate and soil on rose behavior, training of pillar and climbing roses, rose pruning versus rose whacking, and treatment of cut flowers. Hennessey focused his product line on roses he considered to be proven performers, rather than the newest introductions. He could be harshly critical of new introductions he considered to not be improvements on roses already on the market. His catalogs contained specific cultivation advice for many of his offerings. Hybrid roses Hybrid roses by Roy Hennessey include: * 'Artiste', a single yellow hybrid tea no longer commercially available. * 'Flaming Ruby', a dark red floribunda which replaced the notorious 'Nigger Boy' in 1963; no longer commercially available. * 'Florida Red', a red hybrid tea no longer commercially available. * 'Heavenly Fragrance', a light pink hybrid tea no longer commercially available. * 'Orange Smoke', an orange blend floribunda no longer commercially available.

She was born Cynthia Jean Furber in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Lawrence University, which honored her with the 1997 Distinguished Career Achievement Award. She also studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School and the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. She is married to professor emeritus William W. Cooley. Cooley is best known for her vivid paintings of steel mill interiors and of Pittsburgh's hillside neighborhoods and industrial valleys. She says she was ‚Äúoriginally drawn to the powerful geometric forms of the working mills.‚ÄùRooney, p. 142 She also has captured another of western Pennsylvania's industries in her series of coal mine paintings. She works mostly in acrylic and watercolors to create memorable works from her own on-site sketches and photographs. As a lifelong traveler, Cooley's paintings also reflect the many places she has visited, ranging from her watercolors of Giverny to her acrylics of doorways in Tunisia. In 1989, she accompanied the American Wind Symphony Orchestra as the artist-in-residence as they sailed on the waterways of northern Europe. Cooley has had over 45 individual exhibitions in 8 states, including one at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., and has received over 25 awards in group exhibitions. In 1989, she won Artist of the Year at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. She was named a \\"Master Artist\\" in Pittsburgh in 1998.

Educated at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Art Students League of New York, she drew inspiration from the horses and farm life of New England. Biography Ruth Ray was born in 1919 into a sophisticated New York City household. Her mother was an early feminist, a managing editor of Vogue, and a prolific author of self-help books. Ray attended Swarthmore College, Barnard College, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Art Students League of New York. In 1948, she married and established a home in Darien, Connecticut. She had a successful career as a commercial artist and portraitist; among her most famous portraits was the golfer Sam Snead. However, her passion was an idiosyncratic form of Magic realism inspired by her love of horses, New England farm life, and the Maine seacoast. Works Inspired by the surrealists but demonstrating a cultivated sense of restraint in the depiction of her subject matter, Ray juxtaposed the ordinary with the fantastical. \\"Her art might be called a rational surrealism,\\" opined the critic Frederic Whitaker in 1957. \\"Some of her paintings suggest the skill of a Dal√≠ with his irritating shock elements omitted.\\" Ray's paintings are in the collections of several museums, including the National Art Museum of Sport, the National Academy of Design, and the Sheldon Museum of Art.

Life and career Very little is known about Pierre Tr√©maux's life. He was born in Charrecey, France into a family of modest means. He was the son of Jean-Marie Tr√©maux, a farmer and Claudine Renaudin and had at least two sisters. Details of his final years are very sketchy and details of death and final resting place are unknown. Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth- Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 477 Tr√©maux distinguished himself in many fields. He entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1840 and received the second Prix de Rome in Architecture in 1845. As a trained architect, he worked at the Schneider establishments in Le Creusot. He was interested in urbanism, the breakthrough of the Suez Canal. A naturalist, he traveled to Algeria, Tunisia, Upper Egypt, Eastern Sudan and Ethiopia in 1847-1848, where he made many drawings and became one of the first to produce photographic images of the region.Merli, A., \\"A New Art in an Ancient Land: Palestine through the Lens of Early European Photographers,\\" Jerusalem Quarterly, Vol. 50, Summer 2012 From Alexandria, he went up the Nile to Nubia. In 1853-1854, he undertook a second photographic trip to Libya, Egypt, Asia Minor, Tunisia, Syria and Greece. He returned from these trips with many illustrations and photographic images, some of the first photographs ever made of the region and its people. Work Young Nuba Woman, photograph by Tr√©maux, 1853-1854 Photography Relatively few of his photographs have survived, and of the few that exist, the condition is very poor yet these reveal that he was not particularly talented as a photographer. However, his published works, the Voyagesseries, were the first books on Egypt, Palestine and other Middle Eastern locations to use photographic illustrations. Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth- Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 477 Theory of Evolution Tr√©maux is the author of a work that caused a sensation at the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris: Origine et transformations de l'homme et des autres √™tres (translated as Origin and Transformations of Man and Other Beings), 1865. In this book he proposed, for the first time in history, the evolutionary theory that today is referred to as the theory of punctuated equilibria.Wilkins, John S. and Nelson, Gareth J., \\"Tr√©maux on Species: A theory of allopatric speciation (and punctuated equilibrium) before Wagner\\", Archives of Philosophy of the Science, University of Pittsburgh, 2008; texte repris dans la revue History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, 2008, 30, pp 179-206 Publications Between 1852 and 1868, Tr√©maux produced a number of distinct groups of photographic plates to accompany texts on the geography, architecture, and people of African and Anatolian regions.

Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: sasay to zorgot. Vol. 5. Sahitya Akademi, 1992. There is an abundance of Sufi literature produced in Sindh throughout history.  History  According to some scholars the original torch-bearer of Sufism in Sindh was the 13th century saint Usman Marwandi, also known as Lal Shahbaz. These scholars believe that Sufism arrived in Sindh via Herat, Qandhar and Multan. Sufism reached its zenith in Sindh in the 18th century through the poetry of saints such as Shah Abdul Latif of Bhit and Sachal Sarmast of Daraz. The mystic Husain ibn Mansur al Hallaj who is credited with the utterance \\"Anal Haqq\\" (I am The Creative Truth) reached Sindh in 905, proceeding from Gujarat. He travelled extensively throughout Sindh and discussed theological matters with local sages.Hanif, N. Biographical encyclopaedia of sufis: South Asia. Vol. 3. Sarup & Sons, 2000. He inspired many poets and musicians in the region. Sachal Sarmast was one of the greatest admirers of Mansur Hallaj and pays homage to him in his poetry frequently.Annemarie Schimmel, Pearls from Indus Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan: Sindhi Adabi Board (1986). See pp. 5. According to Michel Boivin, music is inseparable from Sufi poetry in Sindh.Boivin, Michel. \\"Devotional Literature and Sufism in Sindh in the Light of Dr. NB Baloch's contribution.\\" Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society 9.4 (2012): 13-23. Sufism's relationship with music is ancient in the Indus Valley and was due to Baha' al-Din Zakariyya, the Suhrawardi saint from Multan, and Muin al-Din Chishti, the founder of the Chishtiyyah order. Baha' al-D√Øn Zakariyya's son-in-law, Shaykh Hamid al-Din Hakim was a teacher of Sindhi dhakirs (specialists in poetry). By the close of the 15th century, Sindhi dhakirs had earned acclaim in Mughal courts. The author of the Akbarnamah wrote that the kafi music originated from Sindh. The art of 'musical narration' had received patronisation under the Surnrah dynasty of Sindh and was further developed and patronised under the Sammahs. The most renowned Sindhi genre of poetry is the kafi which, according to Annemarie Schimmel, is accompanied by instruments and is a vehicle of mystical songs. Shah 'Abd al-Latif is seen as the greatest renovator of Sufi music in Sindh. The most famous expression of Sufism in Sindh is found in the Risalo of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. The philosophy of Persian poets deeply influenced Sindhi Sufistic thought and poetry. During Muslim rule in Sindh, the works of Rumi, Attar, Jami, Nizami Hafiz, Khayyam, Saadi and other poetic Persian mystics were keenly studied by both HIndu and Muslim scholars. Sachal was deeply influenced by Attar. Shah Abdul Latif was influenced by Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi. Suffism became a primary marker of Sindhi identity for both Muslims and Hindus.

These fairly large salamanders grow to 8.7 in (220 mm) in length. It is found from southeastern Alaska on May Island, through Washington and Oregon south to the mouth of the Gulala River, Sonoma County, California. It occurs from sea level to timberline, but not east of the Cascade Divide. Long-toed salamander The long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum, Baird 1849)Originally described as Ambystoma macrodactyla. is a mole salamander in the family Ambystomatidae. This species, typically 4.1‚Äì8.9 cm (1 3/5‚Äì3¬Ω in) long when mature, is characterized by its mottled black, brown and yellow pigmentation, and its long outer fourth toe on the hind limbs. The distribution of the long-toed salamander is primarily in the Pacific Northwest, with an altitudinal range of up to . It lives in a variety of habitats including temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian zones, sagebrush plains, red fir forests, semi-arid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, and alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. It lives in slow-moving streams, ponds and lakes during its aquatic breeding phase. The long-toed salamander hibernates during the cold winter months, surviving on protein energy reserves stored in the skin and tail. Olympic torrent salamander The Olympic torrent salamander (Rhyacotriton olympicus) is a species of salamander in the family Rhyacotritonidae. It is a small salamander (up to 10 cm total length) that lives in clear, cold mountain streams. It is endemic to the United States.

It is predominantly located in hilly or mountainous regions such as the Olympic Hills, the Willapa Hills and the Cascade Mountains. Pacific tree frog The Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) is a very common species of chorus frog, with a range from the West Coast of the United States (from North California, Oregon, and Washington) to British Columbia in Canada. Living anywhere from sea level up to over 10,000 feet, they are found in shades of greens or browns and even have been known to change between them. They live in many types of habitats and reproduce in aquatic settings. This species is also known as the Pacific chorus frog. Coastal tailed frog The tailed frogs are two species of frogs. The species are part of the genus Ascaphus, the only taxon in the family Ascaphidae . The \\"tail\\" in the name is actually an extension of the male cloaca. The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. It is the only North American frog that reproduces by internal fertilization. Until 2001, the genus was believed to be monotypic, the single species being the tailed frog (Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899). However, in that year Nielson, Lohman, and Sullivan published evidence in Evolution that promoted the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) from a subspecies to its own species. Since then, the former species has been formally called coastal tailed frog. Western toad The western toad or boreal toad (Bufo boreas) is a large toad species, between 5.6 and 13 cm long, of western North America.

Joppa is located on the North Fork of the San Gabriel River seven miles northeast of the City of Bertram. First settlers of this farming and ranching community included the William Alexander Faires family who moved to the area in 1874 and the Martin Luther Ater family who moved from nearby Mahomet in 1875. History The community got its start when in 1881, J. S. and Jane Danford of Delaware County, Iowa, donated two acres of land on the north bank of the river for a school and church. Their only stipulation was that residents had to complete construction of the schoolhouse by March 1, 1882 and they met that the deadline. The original settlement name was Pool Branch for a nearby pool of water carved out by a waterfall on the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. By the 1880s, a water-powered cotton gin and mill were established on the pool and a store and blacksmith shop soon followed, the only other businesses in the settlement. When a post office was established in 1891, residents submitted the biblical name ‚ÄúJoppa‚Äù and the postal service approved it. The first postmaster was William F. Childers and the post office continued in existence until rural mail delivery was established in 1904 and it closed. On May 19, 1904, the first telephone was installed in Joppa and in 1911, the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company out of Leavenworth, Kansas built an iron bridge across the river. The bridge still stands today (2011) though a new concrete bridge has replaced it for automobile traffic. In 1939 under the Rural Electrification Act, the Pedernales Electric Cooperative strung the first transmission line to bring electricity to the area. As late as the 1930s, the community held annual picnics as well as Friday and Saturday night socials and Sunday night singings. Part of that tradition continues today when members of the community gather the second Sunday of each month for \\"dinner on the grounds.\\" The original school building was converted to a community center after the one- room school consolidated, in 1942, with the Bertram Independent School District. Until 1913, the schoolhouse hosted church services. That year the Joppa Baptist Church congregation erected a meetinghouse across the road from the school and has been holding weekly services continuously ever since. All that remains of the pioneer settlement is the church and community center.

Headed by Ayman Nour, it was a split of the El-Ghad Party. Nevertheless, the \\"Revolution's Tomorrow Party\\" still uses the name El-Ghad (The Tomorrow Party) on its website and communiques . The Ghad El-Thawra Party was contesting the 2011‚Äì12 Egyptian parliamentary election with fifteen candidates (thirteen for the lower house and two for the upper) as part of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party-led Democratic Alliance for Egypt. Background Ayman Nour left the New Wafd Party in 2001, and established El-Ghad Party. The party was legalized in 2004. After facing president Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 Egyptian presidential election, Nour was sentenced to five years in jail on forgery charges. In 2005, just before Nour being sentenced, the El-Ghad Party split in two factions. One was headed by Moussa Moustafa Moussa, the other by Nour's (now former) wife Gameela Ismail. Legal battle ensued between both factions, both claiming legitimacy and simultaneously using the party name and insignia. The final court ruling in May 2011 was in favor of Moussa.ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖŸàÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜÿå \\"ÿ¥ÿ¶ŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≠ÿ≤ÿßÿ®\\" ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅÿ∂ ŸÇÿ®ŸàŸÑ ÿ™ÿ£ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ ÿ≠ÿ≤ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ . ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿ®ÿπ 2011-9-5.

The Ghad El-Thawra party supported the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Nour was reportedly close to the Muslim Brotherhood; the headquarters of the party were burned down in March 2013.  Platform  The party platform called for: * Political and economic reform. * Paying a special care for the handicapped. * Combating drug addiction. * Solving the water crisis. Name Confusion Ayman Nour has been tightly associated with both the El-Ghad name and party, even being accused of internal monopoly by other party members. Since both Nour and Moussa fractions were using (and still are) the same name and insignia (e.g.: Ghad El-Thawra website), it was often difficult to tell them apart. For instance, Liberal International lists El-Ghad, specifying its leader as Ayman Nour, as an observer member.Datasheet on the Liberal International's website Many poll and media outlets used the term \\"El-Ghad\\" without specifying which party or faction they are referring to, although they often meant the Ayman Nour Ghad El-Thawra faction.

A World War II veteran from Oklahoma, Frank Van Zant had served with the 7th Armoured Division, fought in several campaigns in Europe, and been badly burned in a tank battle outside Leipzig. Born on an Indian Reservation in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, on November 11, 1921, he was the son of Sydney Grove Van Zant and grandson of Alexander Grove Van Zant and due to his upbringing he identified himself as Creek Indian, although his father became disenchanted with the sovereignty of the Creek Nation and became an individual he took the Native American name Rolling Mountain Thunder after experiencing an epiphany. He took on the twin but related tasks of both building shelters from the presumed coming apocalypse, and making a de facto spiritual haven for spiritual seekers of the hippie era. (There is no Thunder Mountain in the vicinity.) The site covers five acres on the south side of a 1,000-foot stretch of Interstate 80. There were originally seven buildings, including a three-story hostel where many hippies stayed in the 1970s. Three stone and concrete buildings remain, and more than 200 concrete sculptures depicting Native Americans and their protective spirits, massacres, and injustices against them. Thunder Mountain Monument (or Park) is replete with found objects, such as car hoods, dolls' heads, typewriters, and gas pumps, many of which are incorporated into the buildings themselves; the third floor has one wall made up of antique bottles which form a stained glass window of a different sort; other floors have windows from antique windshields and bottles incorporated therein to provide a lighting source; one framework forms a large handle so the Great Spirit could take the building away after Thunder's death. The site was partially destroyed by arson in 1983, the same year Van Zant was named Nevada's Artist of the Year; he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head in 1989. The monument was neglected and subject to vandalism until it was declared a Nevada State Historic Site in 1992; it is now under the care of his grown children under the aegis of a State of Nevada Historic Site Restoration Project, and is partially open to the public for self-guided tours. Van Zant has been the subject of two short documentaries.

It is run by Franciscan friars and provides primary and secondary education. History The school started as a small parochial school in 1917 called San Luis Gonzaga and located on a corner of the square at Mariano Nu√±ez Street. On March15, 1925, an agreement was made between the Bishop of Puno, Fidel M. Cossio, and the Franciscans of the Province of the XII Apostles of Peru, resulting in the founding of the school. On May13, 1925, the Reverend Father Miguel Hernandez, who was appointed director, requested of the National Council of Education authorization for the operation of the school. On November 4 of the same year, the National Education Council resolved by Resolution No. 305 to authorize the operation under the name of the San Rom√°n School. San Rom√°n School occupied the 2.385 m2 site of the parish house of the Parish of St. Catherine of Juliaca, which accommodated 92 students at the time. The first story was built by Father Daniel Hall in 1932, blessed and inaugurated on April 10 of that year. On April 18, 1942, the R.P. Inheritance Antonio acquired an adjacent site owned by Mrs. Francisca Carpio Vda increasing the campus to 4,000 m2. Secondary education In 1951 inclusion of secondary education was granted by Ministerial Resolution No. 1659 of March 29, 1951, changing the name to Franciscan College San Rom√°n Juliaca. That same year a two-story wing was added with eight classrooms. R.P. Manuel Salas led the school into two periods: 1944‚Äì1949 and 1951‚Äì1954. In 1965 director Father Hugo Becerra initiated work on a three-story pavilion, nine classrooms, and restrooms, with a plan developed by engineers and Iturre Rivarola and completed August 1967. Two friars, Eugenio Ramirez Qui√±onez and Theodore Sakata Andrade, arrived at the facility in 1976 and 1981, respectively. Their efforts resulted in the construction of a road and great increase in school attendance. Infrastructure Franciscan School Saint Roman in the Juliaca's carnival The school, located at the Square of Juliaca, includes two modern four-story dormitories and a seven-story addition. It accommodates more than 1700 students and provides classrooms and related rooms, including a computer room, museum, library, auditorium, administrative staff room, chemistry laboratory, and cafes. There is also a local radio station (Radio San Francisco) and a stadium (San Francisco Enclosed Colosseum) with capacity for 2000 spectators.

In 1949, as part of a peace deal that concluded the Indonesian National Revolution, it joined the United States of Indonesia, of which the Republic was also a component state. In August, 1950, it was absorbed into the Republic as part of the province of North Sumatra. The area covered by the former state include the regencies of Langkat, Deli Serdang, Serdang Bedagai, Karo, Simalungan, Batubara and Asahan, together with the cities geographically within those regencies. History The Dutch focused their campaign to re- establish colonial rule in Sumatra on Northeast Sumatra for economic and political reasons. Before the Japanese invasion of the Netherlands East Indies in 1942 the region had been home to highly productive plantations and oil fields. The prewar Dutch had worked closely with local Malay sultans to administer the region and make its natural resources available to Western capital. By the 1930s most of the plantation workforce and the urban middle class of Medan were immigrants from other parts of Sumatra and Java, while ethnic minorities like the autochthonous Malays and Simalunguns and immigrant Chinese enjoyed privileged positions within the colonial system. Tengku Mansur, President of East Sumatra delivering a speech during a military funeral. (23 November 1949) In the aftermath of the Japanese surrender and proclamation of Indonesian independence by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta in August, 1945, the newly established Republic of Indonesia began to set up offices in East Sumatra. However, Republican officials only had tenuous control over groups of radicalized, pro-independence youths (pemuda) who had received training and arms from the Japanese during the war. Frustrated with the moderation of Republican politicians, the pemuda initiated a \\"social revolution\\" in March, 1946, killing much of the Malay and Simalungun aristocracy, sweeping away the former sultanate governments, and raiding the shops and warehouses of wealthy (often Chinese) businessmen. A year later the invading Dutch felt that they could rely on the support of these groups in setting up a new government in East Sumatra that could compete for legitimacy with the Republic. Twelve of the original thirteen members of the committee that formed to demand autonomy for East Sumatra following the Dutch invasion were Malays or Simalunguns.Reid, 274. East Sumatra's first, and only, head of state was Dr. Tengku Mansur, uncle of the former Sultan of Asahan and leader of the prewar Malay organization Persatuan Sumatera Timur (East Sumatra Association). The new government did not attempt to reinstate the traditional sultanates of the region, but it also made no attempts to hold democratic elections or incorporate \\"moderates\\" of other ethnicities into its administration, in spite of constant Dutch pressure to do so. Following the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in late 1949, the Dutch withdrew military support from the State of East Sumatra and its local authority began to collapse. Dr. Mansur entered into negotiations with Mohammad Hatta to reunify East Sumatra with the Republic of Indonesia in May, 1950. East Sumatra merged with Tapanuli to become the province of North Sumatra on August 15, 1950.

Shofuso was built in 1953 as a gift from Japan to American citizens, to symbolize post-war peace and friendship between the two countries. The building was constructed using traditional Japanese techniques and materials imported from Japan, and was originally exhibited in the courtyard of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. After two years, it was relocated to Philadelphia and reconstructed in 1958.McCarty, Yukiko Yanagida, Shoin-zukuri in Philadelphia, The East, Vol 42 No.1 P15-21 In 1976, a major restoration was conducted by a cadre of Japanese artisans in preparation for the American Bicentennial celebration. In 2007, contemporary Nihonga artist Hiroshi Senju created and donated an interior installation of twenty waterfall murals. Shofuso is owned by the city of Philadelphia and is administered, maintained, preserved, and operated by the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia, a private nonprofit. Background MoMA initiated their series of \\"House in the Garden\\" exhibitions in the courtyard of the Museum in 1949. Architectural director Philip Johnson and curator Arthur Drexler recognized the correspondence between modernism in the Western house and traditional Japanese architecture and proposed to build a Japanese house as the third exhibit of the series.Arthur Drexler, Letter to Takashi Komatsu, president of the Japan-America Society, March 20, 1953 John D. Rockefeller III, then-president of the Japan Society (New York), and MoMA curator Arthur Drexler visited Japan in February 1953 to meet with the business leaders of Japan and to request their support for the project. The Japan-America Society (JAS) agreed to sponsor the project, and declared that the Japanese House should be donated by Japan as a gift to American people in order to promote the cultural exchange. Sponsored by both the private sector and the government, the JAS raised a total of ¬•18.5 million ($51,000 at the exchange rate of ¬•360/$ in 1953) from 270 corporations and individuals.Takashi Komatsu, Report of the Special Committee on Shofuso, 1954 The National Forestry Agency of Japan granted special permission to harvest the wood, particularly \\"hinoki\\" cypress wood which was in short supply. A special Rockefeller Architectural Committee was formed and recommended a 17th-century shoin-zukuri house for the exhibit since that style most typically represents Japanese traditional architecture. The Committee unanimously chose Junzo Yoshimura to design the house.Arthur Drexler, Memorandum to the Museum of Modern Art, April 9, 1953 Yoshimura had worked for Czech-born American modernist architect, Antonin Raymond for 9 years in Tokyo and spent in 1940 a year in Raymond's office in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Yoshimura was close friends with George Nakashima, a Japanese American furniture maker in Bucks County, PA. The 11th generation master carpenter, Heizaemon Ito was chosen to oversee the construction. Ito's family has been master carpenter of Lord Tokugawa, the shogunate family that ruled Japan throughout the Edo period (1600-1868), since the 17th century. Exhibit at MoMA Pre-assembly of the house began in January 1953 at Ito's workshop in Nagoya, and was completed a year later, using the traditional Japanese method of building, which minimizes the use of structural nails, employing various joineries through the use of hand tools. The house was then disassembled and shipped to New York. The reassembly team led by architect Yoshimura arrived at New York in March, 1954 and completed the construction mid-June with help of a cadre of Hawaiian Nisei carpenters.Junzo Yoshimura, ‚ÄúOverseeing Construction of Shofuso‚Äù, Japan-America Society Special Bulletin,1954 The inaugural ceremony was held on June 17, 1954 and Shofuso was opened to the public on June 19. Japanese prime minister Shigeru Yoshida visited Shofuso in November 1954, escorted by John D. and Blanchette Rockefeller. The American public was impressed with the beauty of natural wood, simple interior design, and the house's flexible plan. The exhibit was closed on October 16, 1955, after attracting almost a quarter of million visitors in two seasons, approximately three times as many visitors as the two previous MoMA House and Garden exhibits (a 1949 house by architect Marcel Breuer that exists today at Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills, NY, and a 1950 house by architect Gregory Ain), demolished after the exhibition. Nio-Mon Temple Gate Nio-Mon Temple Gate Nio-Mon Temple Gate was a c.1600 Japanese building from Hitachi Province first exhibited at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\\"Nio-Mon, or Temple Gate,\\" Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Museum, vol. 4, no. 13 (January 1906). Following the fair, it was purchased and relocated to Fairmount Park. Also known as the \\"Japanese Pagoda\\", the area surrounding it was landscaped with a Japanese garden and lotus pond in 1909, funded by John T. Morris. A fire completely destroyed the Temple Gate on the evening of May 6, 1955,Kenneth Finkel, \\"A Story of Stewardship,\\" The Philly History Blog, October 7, 2015. and thereby, as fate would have it, creating an ideal site for Shofuso.Charles A. Evers ‚ÄúNio-mon ‚Äì The Japanese Temple Gate in Fairmount Park‚Äù ‚Äì Historic Guide to Philadelphia & Japan, pp. 29-32. Relocation to Philadelphia MoMA received a number of inquiries on the possibility of permanent exhibition of Shofuso. The final decision was to offer Shofuso as a gift to the Fairmount Park Commission in Philadelphia,Letter from d‚ÄôHarnoncourt to David Marder, January 25, 1956 a decision likely inspired by the presence of the Japanese garden in the park. In 1958, the carpenter, Okumura, and the gardener, Sano, who had built Shofuso at MoMA, returned from Japan to reconstruct Shofuso on the new site. The present setting of Shofuso was opened to the public on October 19, 1958. Over the years, Shofuso fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance. In 1975, Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo contacted the Consulate General of Japan in New York to inquire about the possibility restoring Shofuso for the 1976 Bicentennial Celebration. The Japan-America Society raised ¬•55 million($180 thousand at the exchange rate of ¬•308/$) to fund a complete major restoration of the house and garden in June,1976.Letter from Ambassador Nobuyuki Nakajima to Mayor Frank Rizzo, February 5, 1976 In order to continue preservation and maintenance of Shofuso, a non-profit organization, the Friends of the Japanese House & Garden was incorporated in February, 1982. The nonprofit administered Shofuso from 1982 to 2016, when it merged with the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia, a private nonprofit which produces the Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia. Senju's Mural Donation Water Curtain by Hiroshi SenjuThe \\"tokonoma\\" alcove and \\"fusuma\\" sliding doors of Shofuso at MoMA were decorated with murals painted in black ink by Kaii Higashiyama. All were destroyed by vandalism. In 2003, the internationally acclaimed Japanese painter, Hiroshi Senju offered to donate twenty murals to Shofuso.Melissa Ozawa, ‚ÄúField Trip‚Äù House & Garden, October 2007, p119 Senju's murals depict waterfalls in a custom ‚ÄúShofuso color‚Äù created by blending colors extracted from the elements in the house and garden. The paintings were rendered on mulberry paper specially fabricated by a master paper maker. Shofuso is the first and only place in the United States to house a combination of Japanese contemporary art in the background of traditional Japanese architecture. The City of Philadelphia dedicated Senju's murals on April 27, 2007, and Mayor John F. Street issued a proclamation naming April 27 \\"Senju Day\\".Ozawa, Y. ‚ÄúStory of Shofuso‚Äù December, 2010 p45-51 Shofuso's Architecture Shofuso was modeled after the guest house of Kojo-in, a sub- temple of Mii-deraMasuda, Leo. Architecture in Shiga website in the city of ≈åtsu, built in 1601. The guest house at Kojo-in had all the four major components of ‚Äúshoin-zukuri‚Äù architecture ;(1) attached desk,(2) staggered shelf,(3) toko-no-ma alcove, and (4) chodai-gamae (built-in ornamental doorway). It was built following set of standards that determined the proportions of each element of the building. Following these guidelines, carpenters and builders could achieve an overall architectural harmony. Architect Yoshimura modified the design of Kojo-in to fit in the courtyard of MoMA and added a kitchen, bath and tea house to create a functional house.Fujioka Hiroyasu, ‚ÄúShofuso‚Äù Shinkentiku November,2004 p145-151 He created neither a replica of Kojo-in, nor an original building but a design that would help the American public understand Japanese traditional architecture. The tea house was modeled after the famous tea house.\\"Masu-doko- no-seki\\" in Juko-in, subtemple of Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto. Shofuso's Garden Shofuso's garden at MoMA was designed by Tansai Sano, a landscape architect in Kyoto whose family had been caretakers of the famous dry garden in Ryoan-ji temple for six generations.Ono, Yotaro, Life of Sano Tansai, 2007 Eighty main stones were shipped from the old temple, which was located in central Japan. The original garden at Fairmount Park was built by Y. Muto for the temple gate in 1909. Muto also built the Water and Hill Gardenhttp://www.business- services.upenn.edu/arboretum/gardens_features_japanesehill.shtml and Hill- Cloud Gardenhttp://www.business- services.upenn.edu/arboretum/gardens_features_japaneseoverlook.shtml at Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia and the Japanese garden at Maymont in Richmond, Virginia. During the 1957 installation of his new garden designed to accommodate Shofuso after its move from New York, Tansai Sano modified the design by installing a waterfall and adding new planting scheme. In 1976, at the time of major restoration, Ken Nakajima further modified it installing the berm. The Journal of Japanese Gardening (JOJG) named Shofuso the third-ranked Japanese garden in North America in 2004, 2008, and 2013 out of more than 300 Japanese gardens in North America' The Journal of Japanese garden, November/December 2008, p22 See also * List of houses in Fairmount Park * List of Japanese gardens in the United States * Philadelphia Register of Historic Places  References   External links  * Shofuso Website * Hiroshi Senju Website Japanese-American culture in Pennsylvania Museums in Philadelphia Historic house museums in Philadelphia Japanese gardens in the United States Botanical gardens in Pennsylvania Parks in Philadelphia Houses completed in 1954 Architecture of Japan Fairmount Park Ethnic museums in Pennsylvania West Philadelphia Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia Philadelphia Register of Historic Places Relocated buildings and structures in Pennsylvania Houses in Fairmount Park 1954 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Shofuso Japanese House and Garden"},{"id":"34186170","text":"Magasan-e Olya (, also Romanized as MagasƒÅn-e ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ; also known as MagasƒÅn and Mohammadabad (Persian: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ), also Romanized as Mo·∏©ammadƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Bardesareh Rural District, Oshtorinan District, Borujerd County, Lorestan Province, Iran.
