He was the second son of Cao Cao, a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty, but the eldest son among all the children born to Cao Cao by his concubine (later wife), Lady Bian. According to some historical records, he was often in the presence of court officials in order to gain their support. He was mostly in charge of defence at the start of his career. After the defeat of Cao Cao's rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he took Yuan Xi's widow, Lady Zhen, as a concubine, but in 221 Lady Zhen died and Guo N√ºwang became empress. On 25 November 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian, the last ruler of the Eastern Han dynasty, to abdicate in his favour, after which on 11 December 220 he proclaimed himself emperor and established the state of Cao Wei. Cao Pi continued the wars against the states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu, founded by his father's rivals Liu Bei and Sun Quan respectively, but did not make significant territorial gain in the battles. Unlike his father, Cao Pi concentrated most of his efforts on internal administration rather than on waging wars against his rivals. During his reign, he formally established Chen Qun's nine-rank system as the base for civil service nomination, which drew many talents into his government. On the other hand, he drastically reduced the power of princes, stripping off their power to oppose him, but at the same time, rendering them unable to assist the emperor if a crisis arose within the state. After Cao Pi's death, his successor Cao Rui granted him the posthumous name \\"Emperor Wen\\" and the temple name \\"Shizu\\". Cao Pi was also an accomplished poet and scholar, just like his father Cao Cao and his younger brother Cao Zhi. He wrote Yan Ge Xing (), the first Chinese poem in the style of seven syllables per line (). He also wrote over a hundred articles on various subjects. Early life and career Cao Pi was the eldest son of Cao Cao and his concubine Lady Bian, but he was the second among all of Cao Cao's sons. (The first was Cao Ang) At the time of Cao Pi's birth, Cao Cao was a mid-level officer in the imperial guards in the capital Luoyang, with no hint that he would go on to the great campaigns he eventually carried out after the collapse of the imperial government in 190. Cao Pi was recorded as excellent swordsman as he studied martial arts from Shi E, a gentleman of the household from the \\"Rapid as Tigers\\" () division of the imperial guards.Êõπ‰∏ï, ÂÖ∏Ë´ñ Cao Pi, Dianlun; the Gentlemen of the Household Rapid as Tigers [huben zhonglang were a corps of soldiers who served as the emperor‚Äôs bodyguards. It is theorised that they were candidates for military appointments, though the phrasing in the Dianlun gives one the impression that they were a permanent fixture.] In the period after 190 when Cao Cao was constantly waging war against other rival warlords, it is not known where Cao Pi and Lady Bian were, or what they did. The lone reference to Cao Pi during this period was in 204, when he took Yuan Xi's widow Lady Zhen as his wife. Succession struggle with Cao Zhi The next immediate reference to Cao Pi's activities was in 211, when he was appointed General of the Household for All Purposes () and Vice Imperial Chancellor (). This position placed him second to his father, who was then Imperial Chancellor () and the de facto head of government in China. The eldest of all of Cao Cao's sons, Cao Ang, had died early, so Cao Pi was regarded as the eldest among all his father's sons. Besides, Cao Pi's mother had also become Cao Cao's official spouse after Cao Cao's first wife Lady Ding was deposed. Cao Pi thus became the presumptive heir to his father. However, Cao Pi's status as heir was not immediately made legal, and for years there were lingering doubts on whom Cao Cao intended to make heir. Cao Cao greatly favoured Cao Zhi (his third son with Lady Bian), who was known for his literary talents. Both Cao Pi and Cao Zhi were talented poets, but Cao Zhi was more highly regarded as a poet and speaker. By 215, the brothers appeared to be in harmony with each other, but each had his own group of supporters and close associates engaging the other side in clandestine rivalry. Initially, Cao Zhi's party appeared to be prevailing, and in 216 they were successful in falsely accusing two officials supporting Cao Pi ‚Äì Cui Yan and Mao Jie. Cui Yan was executed, while Mao Jie was deposed. However, the situation shifted after Cao Cao received advice from his strategist Jia Xu, who concluded that changing the general rules of succession (primogeniture) would be disruptive ‚Äì using Yuan Shao and Liu Biao as negative examples. Cao Pi was also fostering his image among the people and created the sense that Cao Zhi was wasteful and lacking actual talent in governance. In 217, Cao Cao, who had received the title of a vassal king ‚Äì King of Wei () ‚Äì from Emperor Xian (whom he still paid nominal allegiance to), finally declared Cao Pi as his heir apparent (). Cao Pi would remain as such until his father's death in 220. As King of Wei Cao Cao died in the spring of 220 in Luoyang. Even though Cao Pi had been his father's heir apparent for several years, there was initially some confusion as to what would happen next. The apprehension was particularly heightened when, after Cao Cao's death, the Qingzhou Corps under the general Zang Ba suddenly deserted, leaving Luoyang and returning home. Besides, Cao Pi's younger brother Cao Zhang (also born to Lady Bian) had arrived in Luoyang in a hurry, resulting in rumours that he was intending to seize power from his elder brother. Upon hearing these news at Cao Cao's headquarters at Ye, Cao Pi hastily declared himself the new King of Wei and issued an edict in the name of his mother Queen Dowager Bian, before receiving an official confirmation from Emperor Xian, to whom he still nominally paid allegiance. After Cao Pi's self-declaration, neither Cao Zhang nor any other individual took action against him. Cao Pi then ordered his brothers, including Cao Zhang and Cao Zhi, to return to their respective fiefs. With the help of Jiang Ji, the political situation soon stabilised. As emperor of Cao Wei =Succeeding Emperor Xian= In the winter of 220, Cao Pi made his move for the imperial throne, strongly suggesting to Emperor Xian that he should yield the throne. Emperor Xian did so, and Cao Pi formally declined three times (a model that would be followed by future usurpers in Chinese history), and then finally accepted, establishing the state of Cao Wei. This event marked the official end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period. The dethroned Emperor Xian was granted the title \\"Duke of Shanyang\\" (). Cao Pi granted posthumous titles of emperors to his grandfather Cao Song and his father Cao Cao, while his mother Queen Dowager Bian became empress dowager. He also moved the imperial capital from Xuchang to Luoyang. =Military failures against Sun Quan= A block print of Cao Pi wearing anachronistic clothing. After news of Cao Pi's ascension (and an accompanying false rumour that Cao Pi had executed Emperor Xian) arrived in Liu Bei's domain of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), Liu Bei also declared himself emperor in 221, establishing the state of Shu Han. Sun Quan, who controlled the vast majority of southeastern and southern China, did not take any affirmative steps one way or another, leaving his options open. An armed conflict between Liu Bei and Sun Quan quickly materialised, because in late 219 Sun Quan had sent his general L√º Meng to invade Jing Province and seize the territories from Liu Bei, which resulted in the death of Liu's general Guan Yu. To avoid having to fight on two fronts, Sun Quan formally paid allegiance to Cao Pi, expressing his willingness to become a vassal under Wei. Cao Pi's strategist Liu Ye suggested to reject and instead attack Sun Quan on a second front. This would effectively partition Sun Quan's domain with Shu, and would eventually allow Cao Pi to destroy Shu as well. Cao Pi declined this suggestion, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China; such an opportunity would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye's advice, Cao Pi granted Sun Quan the title \\"King of Wu\\" () and the nine bestowments. Sun Quan's submission did not last long. After Sun Quan's forces, under the command of Lu Xun, defeated Shu forces at the Battle of Xiaoting in 222, Sun Quan began to distance himself from Wei. When Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send his heir apparent, Sun Deng, to Luoyang as a hostage, Sun Quan refused and formally broke ties with Wei. Cao Pi personally led an expedition against Sun Quan, and in response, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei, establishing the state of Eastern Wu (but he continued ruling as \\"King of Wu\\" and did not declare himself emperor until 229). By this time, having defeated Shu, the Wu forces enjoyed high morale and effective leadership from Sun Quan, Lu Xun and a number of other capable generals. Cao Pi's forces were not able to make significant advances against them despite several large-scale attacks in the next few years. The division of the former Han Empire into three states has become firmly established, particularly after Liu Bei's death in 223. The Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang, serving as regent for Liu Bei's son and successor Liu Shan, re-established the alliance with Wu, resulting in Wei having to defend itself on two fronts and unable to conquer either. Exasperated, Cao Pi made a famous comment in 225 that \\"Heaven created the Yangtze River to divide the north and the south.\\" =Domestic matters= Cao Pi was generally viewed as a competent, but unspectacular, administrator of his empire. He commissioned a number of capable officials to be in charge of various affairs of the empire, employing his father's general guidelines of valuing abilities over heritage. However, he was not open to criticism, and officials who dared to criticise him were often demoted and, on rare occasions, put to death. Treatment of princes Since Cao Pi was still fearful and resentful of Cao Zhi, he soon had the latter's fief reduced in size and had a number of his associates executed. Ding Yi, who was chief among Cao Zhi's strategists, had his whole clan exterminated as a result of assisting the latter in the past. Cao Pi's younger brother, Cao Xiong, was also said to have committed suicide out of fears for his brother. In summary, under regulations established by Cao Pi, not only were the Wei princes (unlike princes of the Han dynasty) distanced from central politics, they also had minimal authority even in their own principalities and were restricted in many ways, particularly in the use of military force. Treatment of officials Cao Pi was recorded to frequently ridicule his subordinates. For example, Yu Jin was captured by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu at the Battle of Fancheng in 219, and was later taken back to Wu and detained there after the Wu invasion of Jing Province. Yu Jin was allowed to return to Wei after Wu briefly became a vassal state under Wei in 221. Cao Pi reinstated Yu Jin as General Who Pacifies the Borders () and announced that he would send Yu Jin back to Eastern Wu ‚Äì where he had been imprisoned ‚Äì as an envoy. However, before Yu Jin's departure, he was instructed to travel to Ye to pay his respects at Cao Cao's tomb. When Yu Jin arrived, he found that the emperor had commissioned artists to paint, in his father's tomb, scenes of the Battle of Fancheng. These scenes showed Yu Jin begging for his life to be spared and succumbing to the victorious Guan Yu, while his subordinate Pang De was shown dying an honourable death by resisting the invading forces to his last breath. Upon seeing the vivid mural, Yu Jin was so filled with regret and shame that he fell ill and soon died. Cao Pi further gave the deceased Yu Jin a negative-sounding posthumous title, \\"Marquis Li\\" (), for people to remember the latter as the \\"stony marquis (or vicious marquis)\\".(Êö¥ÊÖ¢ÁÑ°Ë¶™Êõ∞Âé≤„ÄÇÊÆ∫ÊàÆÁÑ°ËæúÊõ∞Âé≤„ÄÇ) There are two possibilities for someone to be given a posthumous title as \\"Li\\": Being Cold-blooded and arrogant, or having innocent people slaughtered. See Lost book of Zhou. Rules on assigning a posthumous name. Wang Zhong, a general who followed Cao Cao for many years, was also a subject of ridicule by Cao Pi. =Succession issues and death= An immediate issue after Cao Pi became emperor in 220 was who the empress would be. Lady Zhen was his wife. Cao Pi summoned Lady Zhen to Luoyang, but Lady Zhen refused because of her poor health. In 221 Lady Zhen died and the position of empress went to Guo N√ºwang. Guo N√ºwang did not bear Cao Pi any children. Cao Rui was the eldest of Cao Pi's sons, but because of his mother's death, he was not instated as the crown prince. Instead, Cao Rui was appointed \\"Prince of Pingyuan\\" after his father's ascension to the throne. Cao Pi did not appear to have seriously considered any other son as heir. (It might have been because the other sons were all significantly younger, although their ages were not recorded in history.) In the summer of 226, when Cao Pi was seriously ill, he finally named Cao Rui as his crown prince. On his deathbed, he entrusted Cao Rui to the care of Cao Zhen, Chen Qun and Sima Yi. Following his father's death, Cao Rui ascended the throne at the age of 21.

Life Coat of arms of Beaufort, earls and dukes of Somerset Edmund Beaufort, born about 1438, was the second son of Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset by his wife Eleanor de Beauchamp, a daughter of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and widow of Thomas de Roos, 14th Baron Roos of Hamlake. His elder brother was Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset (26 January 1436-15 May 1464). After the defeat of the Lancastrians in 1461, Edmund was brought up in France with his younger brother John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset, and on the execution of his elder brother Henry Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, Edmund is said to have succeeded as 3rd Duke by Lancastrians in February 1471, but his brother's attainder was never reversed, and his titles remained forfeit. In a proclamation dated 27 April 1471 Edmund is spoken of as \\"Edmund Beaufort, calling himself duke of Somerset\\". In October 1470 Beaufort returned from France when King Edward IV was driven from the throne after the Earl of Warwick's defection and alliance with Queen Margaret and the restoration of King Henry VI, who was the first monarch ousted by the family feud, and whom due to occasional insanity she assisted in his duties, Somerset was unenthusiastic over the reconciliation and made little effort to co-operate. In fact his failure to hold London against Edward IV was a decisive moment, leading to the Battle of Barnet (14 April 1471) and the death of Warwick. Some sources say he was present at Barnet, but this is an error.Ross, Edward IV, p. 167 n. 2 Fleeing west towards Wales to seek help from Jasper Tudor, but halted by the Yorkist army at the Battle of Tewkesbury (4 May 1471),Ross, C.D., Edward IV, Trowbridge 1975, p. 171 he commanded the van of the Lancastrian army at the battle.

After the defeat, Somerset and other Lancastrian leaders took refuge in Tewkesbury Abbey, but they were forced from sanctuary two days later. They were tried and executed immediately, at the Cross in the centre of Tewkesbury,Ross, C.D., Edward IV, Trowbridge 1975, p. 172 on Monday 6 May 1471. He was buried on the south side of Tewkesbury Abbey, under an arch. cites Dyde, Hist. and Antiq, of Tewkesbury, pp. 21-2. His younger brother John had been killed during the battle, and as both died unmarried, \\"the house of Beaufort and all the honours to which they were entitled became extinct\\".

Around the 180s, when the warlord Sun Jian was raising a militia to help government forces suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion, Huang Gai responded to the call and became one of Sun Jian's subordinates. Huang Gai accompanied Sun Jian in attacking bandits in the region and also participated in the campaign against Dong Zhuo under Sun Jian's banner. Huang Gai was later appointed as a Major of Separate Command (). After Sun Jian's death in 191, Huang Gai continued to serve under Sun Jian's eldest son, Sun Ce, and later under Sun Quan, Sun Ce's younger brother.

Huang Gai was sent to pacify the Shanyue. Once, Huang Gai was assigned to oversee Shicheng County and he knew that the local officials did not follow the laws and were difficult to control. After entering the county office, he chose two officers to be his assistants and ordered them to manage the office. He also gave instructions for all the officers to abide by rules and regulations and perform their duties well. The two officers were afraid of Huang Gai so they put in full effort in their work. However, as time passed, they realised that Huang Gai did not inspect their work, so they became lax and reverted to their old ways. Huang Gai was actually aware of what was going on. He invited all the local officials to attend a banquet later and exposed the two officers' misdeeds in front of everyone. The officers were frightened and started begging for their lives, but Huang Gai still executed them. This incident shocked everyone in the county. Huang Gai was later reassigned to be the Chief of Chungu County (Êò•Á©ÄÁ∏£; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui) and the Prefect of Xunyang County (Â∞ãÈôΩÁ∏£; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei).

Huang Gai also prepared some zouges (Ëµ∞Ëà∏; a smaller type of boat), which would follow behind the mengchongs and doujians, and his small fleet sailed towards Cao Cao's base. The wind was blowing strongly from the southeast. When Huang Gai's fleet reached the middle of the river, the ships all raised their sails, and Huang Gai lifted a torch and instructed his men to shout \\"We surrender!\\" Cao Cao's troops came out of the camp to look and they said Huang Gai was coming to join them. When Huang Gai was about 20 li away from the enemy base, he ordered his men to set the ships on fire and they boarded the smaller boats behind. As the wind was very strong, the flaming ships sailed towards Cao Cao's warships at fast speed and caused them to catch fire as well. Cao Cao's ships were all burnt down and the flames also spread quickly to his camps on land. Zhou Yu then ordered an attack on Cao Cao's base and scored a major victory.

At that time, there were only 500 troops in the commandery and they were heavily outnumbered by the rebels. However, Huang Gai ordered the city gates to be opened, and when about half of the rebel army had entered, he launched an assault on them, killing hundreds of enemies while the surviving ones fled. Huang Gai later succeeded in pacifying the rebellion over the following three months by targeting the rebel chiefs and pardoning the rebels who surrendered.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Huang Gai is a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He appears mainly in the chapters covering the events leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. His most significant moment in the novel is a fictional episode in which he proposes a \\"self-torture ruse\\" () to win Cao Cao's trust so that Zhou Yu's fire attack plan can be carried out. Huang Gai has a secret conversation with Zhou Yu one night and suggests his plan. The following morning, when Zhou Yu calls for an assembly of the officers to discuss their battle plans, Huang Gai pretends to openly challenge and insult Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu pretends to be furious and he orders Huang Gai to be executed, but with some intervention from Gan Ning and others, he spares Huang Gai's life and has him severely flogged. Huang Gai then writes a letter to Cao Cao, expressing his willingness to defect over to Cao Cao's side because he is unhappy with Zhou Yu. Cai Zhong and Cai He, two spies planted by Cao Cao in Zhou Yu's camp, confirm Huang Gai's account that he was flogged on Zhou Yu's order because of an argument. Kan Ze later helps to convince Cao Cao that Huang Gai's defection is genuine, even though Cao initially saw through the ruse. Huang Gai then arranges with Cao Cao that on a certain night, he would sail across the river over to Cao's camp. That night, Huang Gai uses the opportunity to launch the fire attack, sparking off the Battle of Red Cliffs.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 43-50.

The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state. There is no good medical evidence that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits. It is not known if it is safe or cost-effective, but researchers do not believe it poses serious risks.  Description  The Feldenkrais Method is a type of alternative exercise therapy that proponents claim can repair impaired connections between the motor cortex and the body, so benefiting the quality of body movement and improving wellbeing. The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to \\"rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement\\" and that \\"These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life\\". Proponents claim that the Feldenkrais Method can benefit people with a number of medical conditions, including children with autism, and people with multiple sclerosis. Though no studies in which participants were clearly identified as having an autism spectrum disorder or developmental disabilites have been presented to back this claims. In a session, a Feldenkrais practitioner directs attention to habitual movement patterns that are thought to be inefficient or strained, and attempts to teach new patterns using gentle, slow, repeated movements. Slow repetition is believed to be necessary to impart a new habit and allow it to begin to feel normal. These movements may be passive (performed by the practitioner on the recipient's body) or active (performed by the recipient). The recipient is fully clothed. 261x261px Effectiveness and reception In 2015, the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly in 2017 the Australian government identified the Feldenkrais Method as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \\"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\\". There is limited evidence that workplace-based use of the Feldenkrais Method may help aid rehabilitation of people with upper limb complaints. David Gorski has written that the Method bears similarities to faith healing, is like \\"glorified yoga\\", and that it \\"borders on quackery\\".  History  Similar to some other somatic methods, such as those started by F. Matthias Alexander, Elsa Gindler, and Gerda Alexander, the Feldenkrais Method originated in the efforts of its founder to work with his own bodily problem. In the case of Mosh√© Feldenkrais, it was a chronically injured knee. Feldenkrais first injured his knee while playing soccer in British-controlled Palestine in the 1920s. He reinjured it while negotiating the slippery decks of submarines while working as a scientist at the British Naval station at Fairlie, North Ayrshire, Scotland during the Second World War. By that time Feldenkrais was a judo teacher and had mostly completed the work toward a D.Sc. under the guidance of Nobel laureate Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie. Facing the prospect of a surgery that could leave him with a life-long limp, Feldenkrais decided to apply the knowledge gained from his study of physics, engineering, and martial arts to an intensive self-study of his own movement habits. When his work provided him with relief, allowing him to avoid the knee surgery, he began exploring the methods he developed on himself with a small group of people at Fairlie, including scientific colleague John Desmond Bernal and John Boyd-Orr, Nobel laureate and first president of the World Academy of Art and Science. After serving as head of electronic engineering for the Israeli Army in newly formed Israel from 1951 to 1953, Feldenkrais devoted the rest of his life, from age 50 onward, to developing and teaching self-awareness through movement lessons. From the 1950s till his death in 1984, he taught continuously in his home city of Tel Aviv. Feldenkrais gained recognition in part through media accounts of his work with prominent individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Beginning in the late 1950s, Feldenkrais made trips to teach in Europe and America. Several hundred people became certified Feldenkrais practitioners through trainings he held in San Francisco from 1975 to 1978 and in Amherst, Massachusetts from 1980 to 1984. Anticipating the need for an institutional structure to carry on his teaching, he helped found the Feldenkrais Guild of North America in 1977. Feldenkrais developed the conceptual framework of his method in part through the publication of six books, beginning with Body and Mature Behavior (1949) and ending with the posthumously published The Potent Self (1985). Since Feldenkrais' death, the international Feldenkrais community has used a guild structure to regulate its activity, with training accreditation boards in the Americas, Europe, and Australasia overseeing guilds and associations in eighteen member countries. The Feldenkrais Journal, the annual publication of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America, serves as a forum for the Feldenkrais community to discuss the method and its applications.  Influences  The development of the Feldenkrais Method was influenced by Moshe Feldenkrais's involvement in the martial arts. After meeting Kano Jigoro, the founder of Judo, while living in Paris in the 1930s, Feldenkrais transitioned to that practice. One of the main influences of judo on the Feldenkrais Method is the differentiation between rote exercise and attentive movement: \\"the methods of physical exercise in vogue ... exert only the muscles without any other goal, and one needs much will to bind oneself unfailingly to one of these methods\\", wrote Feldenkrais in 1952. \\"Judo is very different, each movement has a specific goal which is reached after a precise and supple execution.\\" Before he focused on the creation of his own method, Feldenkrais influenced the teaching of martial arts in Western Europe through the publication of five books on jiujitsu and judo, as well as teaching at practice centers in France and Great Britain. Feldenkrais was born into an Hasidic family and community, and he acknowledged the influence of Hasidic Judaism on his method. In David Kaetz's biography, Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life of Moshe Feldenkrais (2007), he argues many lines of influence can be found between the Judaism of Feldenkrais's upbringing and the Feldenkrais Method ‚Äì for instance, the use of paradox as a pedagogical tool. Feldenkrais also acknowledged the influence of the Russian spiritualist George Gurdjieff on his work, in particular Gurdjieff's teachings on automatism and freedom in embodiment. Feldenkrais earned his doctorate in a program at the Sorbonne intended to bridge theoretical physics and industrial engineering. Mark Reese, another biographer of the teacher, says that Feldenkrais brought this emphasis on practical scientific inquiry to the understanding of embodiment expressed through his method: > \\"Feldenkrais was critical of the appropriation of the term 'energy' to > express immeasurable phenomena or to label experiences that people had > trouble describing,\\" notes Reese. \\"He was impatient when someone invoked > energy in pseudoscientific 'explanations' that masked a lack of > understanding. In such cases he urged skepticism and scientific discourse. > He encouraged empirical and phenomenological narratives that could lead to > insights.\\" Feldenkrais incorporated the views of other scientists into his teaching; for instance, he asked questions of both the neurosurgeon Karl H. Pribram and the cyberneticist Heinz von Foerster at trainings in San Francisco in the mid-1970s. Cybernetics, also known as dynamic systems theory, continued to influence the Feldenkrais Method in the 1990s through the work of human development researcher Esther Thelen.

The cereal pieces are ring-shaped (hence \\"loops\\") and come in a variety of bright colors and a blend of fruit flavors (hence \\"froot\\", a cacography of fruit). However, there is no actual fruit in Froot Loops and they are all the same flavor. Kellogg's introduced Froot Loops in 1963. Originally, there were only red, orange and yellow loops, but green, blue and purple were added during the 1990s. Different methods of production are used in the UK where, due to the lack of natural colourings for yellow, red and blue, Froot Loops are purple, green and orange, and the loops are also larger in size. Although the marketing side of Kellogg's misleadingly sold the idea that each individual loop color was a different flavor, Kellogg's has acknowledged that all share the same fruit-blend flavor.  Mascot  Toucan Sam has been the mascot of Froot Loops since its first appearance. Toucan Sam is a blue anthropomorphic toucan; the colors of his bill correspond to the three original Froot Loop colors. While toucans have a sense of smell, as most other birds, he is portrayed as having an uncanny ability to smell Froot Loops from great distances and locates a concealed bowl of the cereal while intoning \\"Follow my nose! It always knows!\\" or \\"Follow my nose! For the fruity taste that shows!\\" Toucan Sam was first voiced by Mel Blanc, originally beginning with an \\"American accent\\" and later changing to a \\"British accent\\". Varieties A bowl of Froot Loops with milk Kellogg's made several varieties of snack foods, including snack bags called Snack Ums. Snack Ums were similar to the cereal but larger. Their slogan was \\"Super-sized bites with deliciously intense natural fruit flavors\\"...\\"Flavor Bursting!\\" Froot Loops-branding by Kellogg's was also used with the Froot Loops cereal bar. In the middle of 2012, Kellogg's introduced Froot Loops to the UK market for a limited time with only the secondary colors (orange, green, and purple), as natural color substitutes for red, yellow, and blue could not be found. The recipe also differed from the US version. Kellogg's stated that \\"due to European legislation we have been unable to produce Froot Loops to the same specifications as the US product. The formulations are different, including sugar and salt levels and the UK version has been produced with natural food additives and flavourings which will account for the differences in appearance and taste between the two products.\\" The UK Froot Loops are also larger in size compared with their American counterparts, and due to the different method of formulation, are a much coarser cereal. In September 2015, Kellogg's removed Froot Loops from the UK market due to a lack of demand for the cereal, although in 2017, a special Unicorn Froot Loops limited edition was released in the UK. As of 2019, special limited edition Unicorn Froot Loops, Mermaid Froot Loops, and Baby Shark Froot Loops cereals have been made available.  Froot Loops Bloopers  In February 2015, a spinoff cereal called Froot Loops Bloopers was sold and was promoted by licensing a unique Angry Birds Space episode.

He is first mentioned for crushing the revolt of the town of Fregellae in 125 BC. He was elected consul in 121 BC with Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, and while Fabius was campaigning in Gaul, he took part in perhaps the most decisive event of Roman history to that point. When Gaius Gracchus and M. Fulvius Flaccus were defeated for re-election by Opimius and Fabius, Gracchus organized a mass protest on the Aventine Hill. Alarmed by this action, the Senate passed the motion senatus consultum ultimum, which Opimius understood as an order to suppress their activities by any means necessary‚Äîincluding force. He gathered an armed force of Senators and their supporters, and confronted Gracchus and his followers, an act which quickly became a pitched battle inside the city of Rome. Gracchus, Flaccus, and many of their followers were slain in this conflict, and after clearing the streets of his opponents, Opimius established a quaestio or tribunal that condemned to death 3,000 people accused of being supporters of Gracchus. Opimius was prosecuted for these violent actions in 120 BC, but Carbo won his acquittal. Opimius' victory established the senatus consultum ultimum in Roman constitutional practice, providing a limitless tool that the various Roman factions used against each other in the following years as the Republic slipped increasingly into violence and civil war. In 116 BC, Opimius headed a commission that divided Numidia between Jugurtha and his brother Adherbal. Suspecting that the commission had been influenced by bribes from Jugurtha, its members were later investigated by a tribunal that censured their conduct. Humiliated, Opimius went into exile in Dyrrhachium, where he later died.Plutarch. [Lives of] Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, c. 39. In: Waterfield, Robin.

A descendant of the general Ma Yuan, Ma Chao was the eldest son of Ma Teng, a prominent warlord in Liang Province (covering parts of northwestern China). In 211, he formed a coalition with Han Sui and other northwestern warlords and revolted against the Han central government, which was led by the warlord Cao Cao. The coalition broke up after losing the Battle of Tong Pass against Cao Cao's forces. Ma Chao initially retreated, but later returned to attack and seize control of Liang Province by killing the provincial inspector Wei Kang and forcing Wei Kang's subordinates to submit to him. About a year after Ma Chao started his uprising, Emperor Xian issued an imperial decree ordering the execution of Ma Chao's family members, who were in Ye city at the time. In the meantime, Wei Kang's subordinates, led by Zhao Ang, Yang Fu and others, rebelled against Ma Chao and forced him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu, and returned to attack Liang Province but was ultimately defeated and driven back. Ma Chao took shelter under Zhang Lu for a while until around 214, when he heard that the warlord Liu Bei was fighting for control over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) with Yi Province's governor, Liu Zhang. He defected to Liu Bei's side and assisted Liu Bei in capturing Yi Province from Liu Zhang. Ma Chao had served as a general under Liu Bei since then and participated in the Hanzhong Campaign in 219. He died in 222. Historians and Ma Chao's contemporaries have a generally negative view of him. Apart from committing treason against the Han government under Cao Cao's control, Ma Chao was also notorious for committing a number of acts of cruelty: he betrayed his father when he persuaded Han Sui to join him in his rebellion; he abandoned his wife and son when he defected from Zhang Lu to Liu Bei; he killed Jiang Xu's mother in cold blood after she scolded him; he murdered Zhao Ang and Wang Yi's son after they rebelled against him and forced him out of Liang Province. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Ma Chao is romanticised as a heroic warrior and one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. In the novel, the descriptions of his character and personality, as well as the order of some events involving him, have been significantly modified for dramatic effect. For example, in the novel he started the Battle of Tong Pass to take revenge against Cao Cao for murdering his family, but historically he waged war against Cao Cao first, and then his family members were implicated and executed about one year later. In the novel, he also engaged Xu Chu and Zhang Fei in one-on-one duels at the Battle of Tong Pass and Battle of Jiameng Pass respectively, but historically the duels never took place and the Battle of Jiameng Pass is actually a fictional battle.

Ma Teng, along with Han Sui and others, were warlords who held considerable influence in Liang Province (covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and were reluctant to submit to Han rule. In 192, Ma Teng accepted the appointment of General Who Attacks the West (ÂæÅË•øÂ∞áËªç) from the Han imperial court and garrisoned his army at Mei County (ÈÉøÁ∏£). However, he rebelled against the Han dynasty later and attacked the city of Chang'an but failed to conquer it so he retreated back to Liang Province.(È¶¨Ë∂ÖÂ≠óÂ≠üËµ∑ÔºåÂè≥Êâ∂È¢®ËåÇÈôµ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÁà∂È®∞ÔºåÈùàÂ∏ùÊú´ËàáÈÇäÁ´†„ÄÅÈüìÈÅÇÁ≠â‰ø±Ëµ∑‰∫ãÊñºË•øÂ∑û„ÄÇÂàùÂπ≥‰∏âÂπ¥ÔºåÈÅÇ„ÄÅÈ®∞ÁéáË°ÜË©£Èï∑ÂÆâ„ÄÇÊº¢Êúù‰ª•ÈÅÇÁÇ∫ÈéÆË•øÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈÅ£ÈÇÑÈáëÂüéÔºåÈ®∞ÁÇ∫ÂæÅË•øÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈÅ£Â±ØÈÉø„ÄÇÂæåÈ®∞Ë•≤Èï∑ÂÆâÔºåÊïóËµ∞ÔºåÈÄÄÈÇÑÊ∂ºÂ∑û„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 36.

However, he did not dare to make his move when Xu Chu, one of Cao Cao's close aides, glared at him. Cao Cao later followed Jia Xu's strategy to sow discord between Ma Chao and Han Sui and make them become suspicious of each other.

Yang Fu warned Cao Cao, \\"Ma Chao has the courage of Han Xin and Ying Bu, and he has the support of the Qiang and Rong peoples. If we retreat now and don't station defences here, we'll forfeit all the territories in this area.\\" After Cao Cao left, as Yang Fu predicted, Ma Chao led the various tribes in the region to attack the commanderies and counties in Guanzhong, while the people responded to his call and joined him in the revolt. Ma Chao killed Wei Kang, the Inspector (Âà∫Âè≤) of Liang Province, and seized control of Liang Province's capital Jicheng (ÂÖæÂüé; in present-day Gangu County, Gansu) and forced Wei Kang's subordinates to submit to him.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Ma Chao is featured as a prominent character in some chapters in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. However, in the novel, the descriptions of his character and personality, as well as the order of some events involving him, had been modified to very large extents for dramatic effect. In the novel, he was nicknamed \\"Ma Chao the Splendid\\" for his elaborate armour and grand skill as a warrior, and was one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. Ma Chao is introduced in Chapter 10, where he participates in a campaign led by his father and Han Sui against Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang'an in 192, during which he slays the enemy officers Wang Fang (ÁéãÊñπ) and Li Meng (ÊùéËíô).Sanguo Yanyi ch. 10. He does not reappear until Chapter 57, in which he suggests to his father that he could lead the army against Cao Cao at Xuchang in 211 to follow Emperor Xian's orders to slay Cao Cao, but his father tells him to remain in Liang Province and command the Qiang troops there.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 57. After his father is killed by Cao Cao, Ma Chao, Han Sui and another eight officers fight against Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass, during which Ma Chao fights with Cao Cao's generals Xu Chu, Yu Jin, Cao Hong and Zhang He, and slays Li Tong. Later, Cao Cao's strategist, Jia Xu, suggests to Cao Cao to send a letter containing errors and markings (making it seem as though the recipient has something to hide) to Han Sui to make Ma Chao falsely believe that Han Sui is maintaining secret contact with Cao Cao. Ma Chao gradually becomes more suspicious of Han Sui, who also has the intention of defecting to Cao Cao's side after learning that Ma Chao no longer trusts him. Han Sui manages to escape when Ma Chao tries to kill him, but his left hand is cut off by Ma during the fight. Ma Chao is eventually defeated by Cao Cao's forces, but manages to escape and find shelter among the Qiang tribes. Ma Chao later joins forces with Zhang Lu to attack Cao Cao, but fails to make any significant gains. Zhang Lu, who distrusts Ma Chao, sends Yang Bo to spy on Ma, but Yang Bo is later killed. Ma Chao then helps Liu Zhang, the governor of Yi Province, deal with an invasion on Yi Province by Liu Bei. He duels with Liu Bei's sworn brother, Zhang Fei, at the Battle of Jiameng Pass. Later, he is convinced by Li Hui to defect to Liu Bei, who accepts him and makes him a general. He fights for Liu Bei in the Hanzhong Campaign and is later posted to Xiping, where he defends Liu Bei's strongholds from the Xianbei chieftain Kebineng. Although Ma Chao historically died in 222, in the novel, he is mentioned to be still alive during Zhuge Liang's southern campaign against the Nanman and is in charge of guarding Hanzhong from possible attacks by the state of Cao Wei. He died of illness after Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign. Zhuge Liang tells Zhao Yun that Ma Chao's death felt like the loss of an arm to him.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 91. In popular culture Ma is sometimes venerated as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in Hebei and Henan, usually in partnership with Ma Dai or Zhao Yun. Ma Chao appears as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series. Ma Chao is featured in the Taiwanese television drama K.O.3an Guo, a parody of Romance of the Three Kingdoms in a present-day high school setting. In the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, there is a card named \\"Ma Chao, Western Warrior\\" in the Portal Three Kingdoms set.

Gaius Sempronius Gracchus (154‚Äì121 BC) was a Roman Popularis politician in the 2nd century BC and brother of the reformer Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. His election to the office of tribune in the years 123 BC and 122 BC and reformative policies while in office prompted a constitutional crisis and his death at the hands of the Roman Senate in 121 BC.  Background  Gaius Gracchus was born into a family who had a strong tradition in the politics of ancient Rome. His father, Tiberius Gracchus the Elder, was a powerful man in Roman politics throughout the 2nd century BC and had built up a large and powerful clientele largely based in Spain. His mother was Cornelia Africana, daughter of Scipio Africanus, a noble woman who was a major influence on the Gracchi; as a widow, she refused the marriage proposal of Ptolemy VIII, the king of Egypt, preferring to devote her life to the upbringing of her sons.Bradley P., Ancient Rome: Using Evidence, Cambridge University Press, 2007 The family was attached to the Claudii faction in Roman politics despite his mother's background. It can be supposed, however, that both the Gracchi brothers would have come into contact with powerful members of both the Claudii and Cornelii Scipiones factions. Gaius Gracchus was the younger brother of Tiberius Gracchus by about nine years. He was heavily influenced both by the reformative policy of his older brother, and by his death at the hands of a senatorial mob. Plutarch suggests that it was \\"the grief he had suffered [that] encouraged him to speak out fearlessly, whenever he lamented the fate of his brother.\\"Plutarch, Makers of Rome, Penguin Books, 1965 Certain aspects of his reforms, and especially his judicial reforms, seem to have been directed at the people responsible for his brother's death.  Early political career  The pursuit of Gaius Gracchus Gaius's political career began in 133 BC when he served with Tiberius's land-commission. In 126 BC, he became a quaestor in the Roman province of Sardinia, where his merits advanced his good reputation. During his quaestorship, he honed his skills in oratory.Plutarch, Gaius Gracchi. 2 In one particularly harsh Sardinian winter, the Legate of the local garrison requisitioned supplies from the nearby towns, despite their objections. When they appealed and won the Senate's approval to keep their supplies, Gaius made them a personal appeal for aid. Fearing this as a ploy for popular approval, the Senate rebuffed envoys sent by Micipsa, king of Numidia, who had sent grain to Gaius based on their mutual regard. The Senate ordered the garrison's replacement, but also ordered that Gaius remain in his post, in Sardinia. Gaius returned to Rome, to appeal the decision. He was accused of unlawfully abandoning his post but won popular support when he pointed out that he had served twelve years - two more than the basic requirement - and had been quaestor for two years though legally only required to serve one. Furthermore, he had used the Roman money that he had brought with him to this quaestorship to aid Sardinia, and had never used his position to line his own pockets. He was then accused of aiding in an Italian revolt at Fregellae, but little evidence supported this. His support for the reforms of Gaius Papirius Carbo and Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, his evident skills at oratory and his association with the reforms of his brother led the senatorial nobles to try him on charges plainly false or heavily exaggerated. He cleared himself with ease and in 122 was elected to serve as a tribune for the following year.Cary M. and Scullard H., A History of Rome, PALGRAVE, 1989 Gaius used his celebrated oratory, considered to be the best in Rome, to attack his opponents at every chance and frequently lamented the fate of his brother Tiberius. He criticized the Senate's failure to emulate their ancestors' respect for the tribune, citing its decision to wage war on the Falerii for insulting the tribune Genucius, or how Gaius Veturius had been condemned to death for failing to make way for the tribune. He chastised the people for standing by while Tiberius and his supporters were beaten and cited the unlawful sentences of exile that followed because the accused were not permitted to stand trial., Plutarch, Gaius Gracchi. 3 Tribuneship of 123‚Äì122 BC =Reforms in 123/2 BC= Gaius' social reforms were far wider reaching than the reforms of his brother Tiberius. Perhaps motivated by the fate of his brother, some of his earliest reforms dealt with the judiciary system. He set up two initial measures, the first of which prohibited a magistrate who had been deposed by the people from holding office a second time. Gaius's second bill established the right of the people to prosecute any magistrate who had exiled citizens without a trial.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 4 These decisions were a direct response to the Senate's actions in the aftermath of his brother Tiberius's murder. Courts with capital punishment, not set up by the people, were now declared illegal by a retrospective measure which saw the former consul Popilius Laenas driven into exile. Further reforms to the judicial system were passed to check the acquittals by senatorial juries of senators charged with extortion; the Lex Acilia repetundarum placed extortion trials under the control of the equites class, and trial procedures were redesigned in favour of the prosecution. Aside from benefiting the provincials by dispensing of the conflict of interests involved in Senators trying their fellow-Senators on crimes of which they were often guilty themselves, it was also a significant step in wrenching apart the long standing alliance of the rich, Senators and Equites, in oppressing the poor proletariat, and bringing the Equites to his own side against the Senate.T. Mommsen, The History of Rome, (Meridian Books, 1958), ch. II., pp. 68, 69A. H. Beesely, The Gracchi, Marius and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History, (Kindle edition), ch. II., p. 34 A second measure which Gracchus passed to please the Equites was in changing the arrangements of the Senate for collecting the taxes from the recently acquired (133) province of Asia. Whereas the Senate had arranged for a fixed sum to be paid directly to the state, excluding the Equites, Gracchus passed a measure changing the tax to a 10% tax on the lands of the province, the right of collecting which was auctioned off at Rome, thus naturally placing it in the hands of the Equites, since the Senators were banned from commerce, and the provincials were too distant.Mommsen, pp. 67, 68 Although it has been stated that Gracchus' rearrangement was mere base pandering to the avarice of the Equites, who used the opportunity to extort fearful sums from the Asian provincials, it is also true that, on the other hand in a year of drought for instance, the 10% tax of Gracchus would be actually far more favourable to the province than a fixed amount.Beesely, Ibid. Though Tiberius' land measures had already accomplished their object by 129, when the Senate effectively froze it (by transferring jurisdiction regarding the right to proclaim land ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù from the land commission to the consuls), Gracchus symbolically returned jurisdiction over the land to the commission, gratifying popular sentiment.Mommsen, p. 62 As a substitute to the allotments, large overseas colonies were planned to provide for thousands of settlers which may have included some Italians as well as Roman citizens.Mommsen, p. 62 The Lex Frumentaria required that the state buy bulk grain from North Africa and Sicily and distribute it to citizens at a low price, as a monthly ration. Secondary roads were extended throughout Italy, to facilitate trade and communication. Rome's censors auctioned off contracts for tax collection in Asia. Gaius's Lex Militaris provided for the free issue of clothes and equipment to soldiers, shortened the term of military service and forbade the draft of boys under the age of seventeen. These reforms were intended to raise army morale and to win the political support of soldiers, allies, and voters with small incomes.Ward Allen, Heichelheim Fritz, and Yeo Cedric, A History of the Roman People, Prentice Hall, 1999 Gaius submitted a franchise bill that sought the extension of Roman citizenship to all Latin citizens, and of Latin citizenship to all Italian allies. The bill was rejected because the Roman elite had no wish to share the benefits of citizenship, including subsidised grain and public works. The rejection of this measure led, in part, to the disastrous Social War of 91-88 BC. In a further slight to the power of the Senate, Gaius changed physically how speeches were delivered from the Rostra. Formerly, when a speaker delivered a speech in the Forum, he turned his face to the right in the direction of the curia, the Senate house, and the Comitium. Instead, Gaius would turn his face to the left, toward the direction of the Forum proper, effectively turning his back on the Senate.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 5 Gaius showed great efficiency in his administration. He oversaw the implementation of each new institution, and personally selected 300 equestrian jurists.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 6 He helped Gaius Fannius win the consulship for 122, and was elected as tribune the same year by popular vote.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8 =Senatorial Response= The senate interpreted Gaius' popularity and legislation as threats to its privilege and position. It backed another tribune, Livius Drusus. He was placed under strict orders not to incite violence; instead, he should propose legislation that would please the common people, and make it known that he had the Senate's backing. In the event, his proposed legislation was neither credible nor beneficial to the commons, and was intended merely to undermine Gaius.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8-9 When Gaius proposed that two colonies be founded with reliable citizens, the Senate accused him of trying to win favor with the people before Drusus proposed twelve with three thousand citizens. When Gaius granted the most needy small plots of redistributed land on the condition they pay a small rent to the public coffers, the Senate accused him of trying to win favor with the people before Drusus proposed to do the same rent-free. When Gaius proposed that all Latins should have equal voting rights, the Senate protested, but approved of Drusus' measure that no Latin would ever be beaten with rods. Drusus went to great pains to ensure he was never seen as the beneficiary, politically or economically, of his legislation but rather that he proposed his measures, backed by the Senate, to further benefit the people. Drusus' constant referencing of the Senate worked and at least some of the people began to feel less hostility toward the Senate, marking the Senatorial plan a resounding success. When a measure was passed to found a colony at Carthage, which had been destroyed in 146 BC by Scipio Aemilianus, Gaius was appointed to oversee the construction and left for Africa. Drusus immediately took advantage of Gaius' absence by attacking Gaius' ally, Fulvius Flaccus, who was known by the Senate to be an agitator and was suspected by some of stirring up the Italian allies to revolt. A new candidate emerged for the consulship, one Lucius Opimius, who had opposed Fannius for the consulship in 122 BC and been stymied by Gaius' machinations. Opimius, a staunch conservative and oligarchical man who wanted to restore power to the Senate, had garnered a significant following and stood poised to challenge Gaius directly. Opimius had made it his sole mission to unseat Gaius. = Death of Scipio Aemilianus = When Scipio the Younger agreed to represent the Italian allies, who were protesting the injustices done to them which Tiberius Gracchus' land reform was supposed to remedy, he won the hostility of the people, who accused him of standing against Tiberius Gracchus and wishing to abolish the law and incite bloodshed.Appian, Civil Wars 1.19 When Scipio died suddenly and mysteriously one day, Gaius was one of many political enemies implicated in his death. Carbo had just that day delivered a fiery speech against Scipio and he‚Äîlike other Gracchan political allies such as Fulvius Flaccus‚Äîwas widely known to be an outspoken enemy of Scipio's during this time as his Gracchan-backed proposal to formally allow tribunes multiple terms in office was ultimately defeated in large part due to Scipio's influence.Stockton 91-2 In fact, between the years of his return from Spain in 132 and his death in 129, Scipio \\"inexorably began to unite the ruling oligarchy against\\" Gaius.Stockton 85-6 Other members of the Gracchi family were also accused; Scipio had been in a loveless marriage to Sempronia, sister of the Gracchi brothers and daughter of their mother Cornelia - Scipio referred to his wife as 'deformed' and 'barren'.Appian, Civil Wars 1.20 Both women were suspected of murdering Scipio because of his perceived attempt to undo the reforms of Tiberius. Return to Rome and outbreak of violence The combined political positions of his fellow tribunes Lucius Opimius, Livius Drusus and Marcus Minucius Rufus, another political enemy of Gaius, meant the repeal of as many of Gaius' measures as possible. Gaius now stood on increasingly shaky ground with the Senate, though his popularity with the people remained undeniable. Gaius' return to Rome from Carthage set in motion a series of events that would eventually cause him to suffer the same fate as his brother. Gaius' first action was to move from his home on the Palatine, where the wealthiest of Romans and the political elite lived, to a neighbourhood near the Forum, believing that in so doing he was keeping to his democratic principles and reaffirming his loyalty to the people rather than to the senatorial elite.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 12 Gaius then called together all of his supporters from Italy to put into motion his legislation. The Senate convinced Fannius, whose friendship with Gaius had run its course, to expel all those who were not Roman citizens by birth from the city. Gaius condemned the proposal, promising support for the Italians, but his image took a hit when he failed to uphold his promises and did not stop Fannius' lictors from dragging away a friend. Whether he did this because he was afraid to test his power or because he refused to do anything which would have given the Senate pretext to initiate violence remains unknown. Gaius further distanced himself from his fellow tribunes when he insisted that the seats for a gladiatorial show be removed to allow the poor to watch. When they refused, he removed them secretly at night. Plutarch claims this cost him a third term as tribune, because, although he won the popular vote, the tribunes were so upset that they falsified the ballots. Opimius and his supporters began to overturn Gaius' legislation with the hope of provoking him into violence, but Gaius remained resolute. Rumours suggested that his mother Cornelia hired foreign men disguised as harvesters to protect him.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 13 =Death of Quintus Antyllius= On the day that Opimius planned to repeal Gaius' laws, an attendant of Opimius, Quintus Antyllius, carrying the entrails of a sacrifice, forced his way through a crowd. A resulting scuffle between the supporters of the two opposing groups on the Capitoline Hill led to his death. Plutarch maintains that Antyllius had rudely pushed his way through the crowd and gave an indecent gesture and was immediately beset upon by Gracchan supporters much to the disapproval of Gaius. Appian states that Gaius had arrived with an escort of body guards in a distressed state. When Antyllius saw Gaius, he laid a hand on him, begging him not to destroy the state. When Gaius cast his scorn on Antyllius, his supporters took it as a sign to act on his behalf and struck Antyllius down. Gaius and Fulvius failed to exonerate themselves of the deed and returned home under the protection of their supporters to await the day's outcomes.Appian, Civil Wars 1.25 The death of Antyllius allowed a triumphant Opimius a pretext for action. On the following morning, with much showboating, the body of Antyllius was presented to the Senate as indicative of the measures Gaius would take. The senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, granting Opimius the right to defend the state and rid it of tyrants. The Senate armed itself and commanded all the equestrians to arm themselves and two of their servants and assemble the next morning.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 14 Fulvius gathered his supporters and they passed the evening in a drunken and raucous manner. Gaius, much more sombre, paused in front of the statue of his father on his way out of the Forum, and, weeping, went homeward. His plight and obvious distress caused such sympathy among the people, who blamed themselves for betraying their champion, that a large party gathered outside his home to ensure his protection. Unlike Fulvius, Gaius' men were quiet and reflective of future events. Death of Gaius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus The following morning, Fulvius' men armed themselves with spoils from Fulvius' Gallic campaign and marched loudly to the Aventine. Gaius refused to guard himself with anything save a small dagger and his toga. As he left his home, his wife Licinia, daughter of Crassus, begged him not to go meet the same men who had murdered and dishonoured Tiberius Gracchus, knowing well enough that Gaius was to die that day. Gaius, without saying a word, gently pried himself from her arms and left her there, weeping, until her servants eventually came to pick her up and carried her to her brother Crassus.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 15 At Gaius' suggestion, Fulvius sent his youngest son Quintus to the Forum to speak to the Senate as a herald carrying a staff, which was only used when heralds approached enemies in times of war. Tearful, he pleaded for terms which many there were willing to hear, but Opimius insisted on speaking directly to Fulvius and Gaius, demanding they surrender themselves for trial. These terms were not negotiable. When Quintus returned to Gaius and Fulvius, Gaius was willing to acquiesce but Fulvius was not and sent the boy back.Appian, Civil Wars 1.26 When the boy came back to the Senate and relayed what his father Fulvius stated, Opimius placed him under arrest and under guard and advanced on Fulvius' position with a contingent of archers from Crete. When they fired on Fulvius' men, wounding many, the crowd was thrown into chaos and fled. Fulvius hid in an abandoned bath or workshop with his eldest son and when discovered both were executed. Appian adds that when they initially hid, citizens were hesitant to give them away, but when the whole row was threatened to be burned down they were handed over to the mob.Appian, Civil Wars 1.26 Gaius, taking no part in the fighting and despairing at the bloodshed, fled to the Temple of Diana on the Aventine where he intended to commit suicide but was stopped by his friends Pomponius and Licinius. Gaius knelt and prayed to the goddess, asking that the people of Rome be forever enslaved by their masters since many had openly and quickly switched sides when an amnesty was declared by the Senate.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 16 Gaius fled the temple and tried to cross the Tiber on a wooden bridge while Pomponius and Licinius stayed back to cover his retreat, killing as many as they could until they were themselves felled. Accompanied by only his slave Philocrates, Gaius fled, urged by onlookers though no man offered assistance despite Gaius' repeated requests for aid. Arriving at a grove sacred to Furrina, Philocrates first assisted Gaius in his suicide before taking his own life, though some rumours held that Philocrates was only killed after he refused to let go of his master's body. =Aftermath= The Death of Gaius Gracchus, by Fran√ßois Topino-Lebrun, 1792. Gaius' head was cut off, as Opimius had announced that whoever brought back the head would be paid its weight in gold. When the head measured an astonishing seventeen and two-thirds pounds, it was discovered that Septimuleius, who brought the head, committed fraud by removing the brain and pouring in molten lead and therefore received no reward at all. The bodies of Gaius, Fulvius and the three thousand supporters who also died were thrown into the Tiber, their property confiscated and sold to the public treasury. Appian adds that their homes were looted by their opponents. Their widows were forbidden to mourn their deaths. Licinia, widow of Gaius, was stripped of her dower. Fulvius' youngest son, who took no part in the fighting and merely acted as herald, was executed, though Appian holds that Opimius allowed him to choose his own manner of death. Most outrageous to the people was when Opimius celebrated his victory by building a temple to Concord in the Forum with the Senate's approval. The people felt that a victory bought with the massacre of so many citizens was exceptionally distasteful. According to Plutarch, one night an inscription was carved that read \\"This temple of Concord is the work of mad Discord.\\"Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 17 Plutarch maintains that Opimius was the first Roman to appoint himself dictator, kill 3,000 Roman citizens without trial, including the proconsul Fulvius Flaccus and the tribune Gaius Gracchus, a man renowned for his reputation and virtue. Ironically, this same Opimius then later committed fraud and accepted bribes from the Numidian king Jugurtha and, after being convicted, spent his days in disgrace. The people, realizing that their democratic cause was now dead, understood how deeply they missed the Gracchus brothers.Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 18 Statues were erected in Rome, the locations where they fell were consecrated as holy ground and the season's first fruits were offered as sacrifice. Many worshipped them daily as if the Gracchi had been elevated to divine status. Cornelia honoured the memory of her sons' murders by constructing elaborate tombs at the spot of their deaths. Appian adds that within 15 years, all of the progress done under the Gracchi had been overturned and the poor were in a much worse position than ever before, many reduced to unemployment.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.27 While many of Gaius' laws were repealed by his political opponents, the Lex Frumentaria remained. It set a precedent for the \\"Roman Bread Dole\\" which existed in one form or another until the fall of the Western Empire.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Frumentariae_Leges.html Gracchus Babeuf The French revolutionary Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf took up the name \\"Gracchus Babeuf\\" in conscious emulation of the Roman brothers, and published a newspaper Le tribun du peuple (\\"the tribune of the people\\"). Ultimately he, like them, met a violent end.

It is the flagship paper of the Sun-Times Media Group, and has the second largest circulation among Chicago newspapers, after the Chicago Tribune. The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the Chicago Sun and the Chicago Daily Times. Journalists at the paper have received eight Pulitzer prizes, mostly in the 1970s; one recipient was film critic Roger Ebert (1975), who worked at the paper from 1967 until his death in 2013. Ownership of the paper has changed hands numerous times, including twice in the late 2010s. History The Chicago Sun-Times claims to be the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the city. That claim is based on the 1844 founding of the Chicago Daily Journal, which was also the first newspaper to publish the rumor, now believed false, that a cow owned by Catherine O'Leary was responsible for the Chicago fire. The Evening Journal, whose West Side building at 17‚Äì19 S. Canal was undamaged, gave the Chicago Tribune a temporary home until it could rebuild. Though the assets of the Journal were sold to the Chicago Daily News in 1929, its last owner Samuel Emory Thomason also immediately launched the tabloid Chicago Daily Illustrated Times. The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the Chicago Sun, founded by Marshall Field III on December 4, 1941, and the Chicago Daily Times (which had dropped the \\"Illustrated\\" from its title). The newspaper was owned by Field Enterprises, controlled by the Marshall Field family, which acquired the afternoon Chicago Daily News in 1959 and launched WFLD television in 1966. When the Daily News ended its run in 1978, much of its staff, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, were moved to the Sun-Times. During the Field period, the newspaper had a populist, progressive character that leaned Democratic but was independent of the city's Democratic establishment. Although the graphic style was urban tabloid, the paper was well regarded for journalistic quality and did not rely on sensational front- page stories. It typically ran articles from The Washington Post/Los Angeles Times wire service. = The 1940s, 1950s and 1960s = Among the most prominent members of the newspaper's staff was cartoonist Jacob Burck, who was hired by the Chicago Times in 1938, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and continued with the paper after it became the Sun-Times, drawing nearly 10,000 cartoons over a 44-year career. The advice column \\"Ask Ann Landers\\" debuted in 1943. Ann Landers was the pseudonym of staff writer Ruth Crowley, who answered readers' letters until 1955. Eppie Lederer, sister of \\"Dear Abby\\" columnist Abigail van Buren, assumed the role thereafter as Ann Landers. \\"Kup's Column\\", written by Irv Kupcinet, also made its first appearance in 1943. Jack Olsen joined the Sun-Times as editor-in-chief in 1954, before moving on to Time and Sports Illustrated magazines and authoring true-crime books. Hired as literary editor in 1955 was Hoke Norris, who also covered the civil-rights movement for the Sun-Times. Jerome Holtzman became a member of the Chicago Sun sports department after first being a copy boy for the Daily News in the 1940s. He and Edgar Munzel, another longtime sportswriter for the paper, both would end up honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame. Famed for his World War II exploits, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill Mauldin made the Sun-Times his home base in 1962. The following year, Mauldin drew one of his most renowned illustrations, depicting a mourning statue of Abraham Lincoln after the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Two years out of college, Roger Ebert became a staff writer in 1966, and a year later was named Sun- Timess film critic. He continued in this role for the remainder of his life. = The 1970s = In 1975, a new sports editor at the Sun-Times, Lewis Grizzard, spiked some columns written by sportswriter Lacy J. Banks and took away a column Banks had been writing, prompting Banks to tell a friend at the Chicago Defender that Grizzard was a racist. After the friend wrote a story about it, Grizzard fired Banks. With that, the editorial employees union intervened, a federal arbitrator ruled for Banks, and 13 months later he got his job back. A 25-part series on the Mirage Tavern, a saloon on Wells Street bought and operated by the Sun-Times in 1977, exposed a pattern of civic corruption and bribery, as city officials were investigated and photographed without their knowledge. The articles received considerable publicity and acclaim, but a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize met resistance from some who believed the Mirage series represented a form of entrapment. In March 1978, the venerable afternoon publication the Chicago Daily News, sister paper of the Sun-Times, went out of business. The two newspapers shared the same ownership and office building. James F. Hoge, Jr., editor and publisher of the Daily News, assumed the same positions at the Sun-Times, which also retained a number of the Daily Newss editorial personnel. = The 1980s = In 1980, the Sun-Times hired syndicated TV columnist Gary Deeb away from the rival Chicago Tribune. Deeb then left the Sun-Times in the spring of 1983 to try his hand at TV. He joined Chicago's WLS-TV in September 1983. In July 1981, prominent Sun- Times investigative reporter Pam Zekman, who had been part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team with the Chicago Tribune in 1976, announced she was leaving the Sun-Times to join WBBM-TV in Chicago in August 1981 as chief of its new investigative unit. \\"Salary wasn't a factor,\\" she told the Tribune. \\"The station showed a commitment to investigative journalism. It was something I wanted to try.\\" Pete Souza left the Sun-Times in 1983 to become official White House photographer for President Ronald Reagan until his second term's end in 1989. Souza returned to that position to be the official photographer for President Barack Obama. Baseball writer Jerome Holtzman defected from the Sun- Times to the Tribune in late 1981, while Mike Downey also left Sun-Times sports in September 1981 to be a columnist at the Detroit Free Press. In January 1984, noted Sun-Times business reporter James Warren quit to join the rival Chicago Tribune. He became the Tribunes Washington bureau chief and later its managing editor for features. In 1984, Field Enterprises co-owners, half-brothers Marshall Field V and Ted Field, sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and the paper's style changed abruptly to mirror that of its suitemate, the New York Post. Its front pages tended more to the sensational, while its political stance shifted markedly to the right. This was in the era that the Chicago Tribune had begun softening its traditionally staunchly Republican editorial line, blurring the city's clear division between the two newspapers' politics. This shift was made all but official when Mike Royko defected to the Tribune. Roger Ebert later reflected on the incident with disdain, stating in his blog, Murdoch sold the paper in 1986 (to buy its former sister television station WFLD to launch the Fox network) for $145 million in cash in a leveraged buyout to an investor group led by the paper's publisher, Robert E. Page, and the New York investment firm Adler & Shaykin. In 1984, Roger Simon, who had been a Sun-Times columnist for a decade, quit to join The Baltimore Sun, where he worked until 1995. Simon quit the paper because of Murdoch's purchase of it. Beginning in October 1984, Simon's columns from Baltimore began appearing in the rival Chicago Tribune. In December 1986, the Sun-Times hired high-profile gossip columnist Michael Sneed away from the rival Chicago Tribune, where she had been co-authoring the Tribunes own \\"Inc.\\" gossip column with Kathy O'Malley. On December 3, 1986, O'Malley led off the Tribunes \\"Inc.\\" column with the heading \\"The Last to Know Dept.\\" and writing, \\"Dontcha just hate it when you write a gossip column and people think you know all the news about what's going on and your partner gets a new job and your column still has her name on it on the very same day that her new employer announces that she's going to work for him? Yeah, INC. just hates it when that happens.\\" In February 1987, the popular syndicated advice column \\"Ask Ann Landers\\" (commonly known as the \\"Ann Landers\\" column and written at that point by Eppie Lederer) left the Sun-Times after 31 years to jump to the rival Chicago Tribune, effective March 15, 1987. The move sparked a nationwide hunt for a new advice columnist for the Sun-Times. After more than 12,000 responses from people aged 4 to 85, the paper ultimately hired two: Jeffrey Zaslow, then a 28-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter, and Diane Crowley, a 47-year-old lawyer, teacher and daughter of Ruth Crowley, who had been the original Ann Landers columnist from 1943 until 1955. Crowley left to return to the practice of law in 1993 and the paper decided not to renew Zaslow's contract in 2001. By the summer of 1988, Page and Adler & Shaykin managing partner Leonard P. Shaykin had developed a conflict, and in August 1988, Page resigned as publisher and president and sold his interest in the paper to his fellow investors. = The 1990s = In mid-1991, veteran crime reporter Art Petacque, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1974, left the paper. Almost ten years later, Dennis Britton, who had been the paper's editor at the time of Petacque's retirement, told the Chicago Reader that Petacque's departure, which was described at the time as a retirement, was involuntary. \\"I had problems with some of the ways Art pursued his job,\\" Britton told the Reader. In September 1992, Bill Zwecker joined the Sun-Times as a gossip columnist from the troubled Lerner Newspapers suburban weekly newspaper chain, where he had written the \\"VIPeople\\" column. In September 1992, Sun-Times sports clerk Peter Anding was arrested in the Sun-Times' newsroom and held without bond after confessing to using his position to set up sexual encounters for male high school athletes. Anding was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and possession of child pornography. In September 1993, Anding pleaded guilty to arranging and videotaping sexual encounters with several teenage boys and fondling others. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. In 1993, the Sun-Times fired photographer Bob Black without severance for dozens of unauthorized uses of the company's Federal Express account and outside photo lab, going back more than three years and costing the company more than $1,400. In February 1994, however, Black rejoined the paper's payroll after an arbitrator agreed with the paper's union that dismissal was too severe a penalty. At the same time, the arbitrator declined to award Black back pay. In 1993, longtime Sun-Times reporter Larry Weintraub retired after 35 years at the paper. Weintraub had been best known for his \\"Weintraub's World\\" column, in which he worked a job and wrote about the experience. Weintraub died in 2001 at age 69. In February 1994, the Adler & Shaykin investor group sold the Sun-Times to Hollinger Inc. for about $180 million. Hollinger was controlled, indirectly, by Canadian-born businessman Conrad Black. After Black and his associate David Radler were indicted for skimming money from Hollinger International, through retaining noncompete payments from the sale of Hollinger newspapers, they were removed from the board, and Hollinger International was renamed the Sun-Times Media Group. In 1994, noted reporter M.W. Newman retired from the Sun-Times around the age of 77. Newman, who died of lung cancer in 2001, had been with the Sun-Times since the Chicago Daily News closed in 1978 and had focused his efforts on urban reporting. Among other things, Newman had been known for coining the term \\"Big John\\" to describe the John Hancock Center and the expression \\"Fortress Illini\\" for the concrete structures and plazas at the University of Illinois at Chicago. On March 23, 1995, the Sun-Times announced that beginning April 2, 1995, veteran Sports Illustrated writer Rick Telander would join the paper and write four columns a week. On March 24, 1995, the Sun-Times published an editorial by Mark Hornung, then the Sun-Times' editorial page editor, that plagiarized a Washington Post editorial that had appeared in that paper the day before. Hornung attributed the plagiarism to writer's block, deadline pressures and the demands of other duties. He resigned as editorial page editor, but remained with the paper, shifting to its business side and working first as director of distribution and then as vice president of circulation. In 2002, Hornung became president and publisher of Midwest Suburban Publishing, which was a company owned by then-Sun Times parent company Hollinger International. In June 2004, Hollinger International placed Hornung on administrative leave just two weeks after Hollinger revealed that the paper's sales figures had been inflated for several years. Hornung resigned from the company four days later. On May 17, 1995, the Sun-Times' food section published a bogus letter from a reader named \\"Olga Fokyercelf\\" that Chicago Tribune columnist (and former Sun-Times columnist) Mike Royko called \\"an imaginative prank\\" in a column. In that same column, Royko criticized the paper's food writer, who edited the readers' column at the time, Olivia Wu, for not following better quality control. The Wall Street Journal then criticized Royko with an article of its own, titled, \\"Has a Curmudgeon Turned Into a Bully? Some Now Think So...Picking on a Food Writer.\\" Although the Sun-Times began hiring a freelancer to edit the space and look for double entendres, another one made it into the same column on July 26, 1995, when the section published a letter from a \\"Phil McCraken.\\" \\"This one was a little more subtle,\\" a reporter outside the food department told the Chicago Reader. Chuck Neubauer in the former Chicago Sun-Times newsroom, 1998 In 1998, the Sun-Times demoted longtime TV critic Lon Grahnke, shifting him to covering education. Grahnke, who died in 2006 at age 56 of Alzheimer's disease, remained with the paper until 2001, when he retired following an extended medical leave. = The 2000s = In 2000, the Sun-Times new editors, Michael Cooke and John Cruickshank, tapped longtime staff reporter Mark Brown, who had considered himself an investigative reporter, to write a column that would anchor page two of the paper.

Her second marriage to King Edward IV made her Queen of England, thus elevating Grey's status at court and in the realm as the stepson of the King. Through his mother's assiduous endeavours, he made two materially advantageous marriages to wealthy heiresses, the King's niece Anne Holland and Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington. By the latter he had 14 children. Family Thomas Grey was born in 1455 close to the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. He was the elder son of Sir John Grey (c.1432-1461) of Groby in Leicestershire, by his wife Elizabeth Woodville, who later became queen consort to King Edward IV. Career His mother endeavoured to improve his estates by the conventional methods of their class and time, through his marriages and purchase of wardships. He also found favour with Edward, fighting in the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Grey became Lord Harington and Bonville by right of his second wife Cecily Bonville. In 1475 he was created marquess of Dorset, and he was also a knight of the Garter and a privy councillor. On the death of his stepfather, Edward IV, and his 12-year-old half-brother, Edward V's, accession to the throne on 9 April 1483, Grey proved unable to maintain his family's position. It was not possible to arrange a Woodville regency. Internal fighting, particularly the long- established battle for ascendancy in Leicestershire between the Grey and Hastings families, now on the national stage, allowed Richard III to seize power and usurp the throne; the Grey family was aligned with Edward. On 25 June 1483, an assembly of Parliament declared Richard III to be the legitimate king, and Thomas's uncle and brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, and Richard Grey, respectively, were executed. Later in the summer, learning of the apparent murder of both his young half-brothers, Grey joined the Duke of Buckingham's rebellion against Richard III. When the rebellion failed he fled to Brittany to join Henry Tudor, who pledged to marry Grey's half-sister Elizabeth of York and heal the division between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians. However, just before Henry and the Lancastrian army left to launch their ultimately successful invasion of England in August 1485, Grey heard rumours from England that his mother had come to terms with Richard III, and he was persuaded to desert Henry Tudor. He was intercepted at Compi√®gne on his way to England, and played no part in the invasion or subsequent overthrow of Richard III. Grey was instead confined to Paris, as security for the repayment of a loan made to Henry Tudor by the French government, unable to return home until Henry VII was safely installed as king of England. Thereafter Henry VII took good care to keep his half-brother-in-law under control and Grey was not permitted to recover his former influence, although his attainder was reversed. Thomas Grey was confined in the Tower in 1487 during Lambert Simnel's rising and not released until after the House of Tudor victory in the Battle of Stoke Field. Though he accompanied the King on his expedition to France in 1492, he was obliged to commit himself in writing to ensure he did not commit treason. He was permitted to assist in suppression of the Cornish rising in 1497. Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, died in London on 20 September 1501, aged about 46, and was buried in the collegiate church of Astley, Warwickshire. His widow married Grey's cousin, Henry Stafford, later Earl of Wiltshire. Marriages and issue His mother sought to make provision for him by marriage to wealthy heiresses. He married firstly, at Greenwich in October 1466, Lady Anne Holland (1461Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 57, fol. 2*rc. 1474), the only daughter of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, and Anne of York. His mother-in-law was the second child and eldest surviving daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, thus sister to his mother's second husband King Edward IV. After Anne Holland died young without issue, Thomas married secondly, by papal dispensation 5 September 1474, Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington of Aldingham and 2nd Baroness Bonville, the wealthiest heiress in England.Lympstone: From Roman Rimes to the 17th Century.

He was largely self- taught as a player, and he performed as an amateur before being invited by Sir Thomas Beecham to join the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 1947. He remained with the orchestra until 1963, two years after Beecham's death. Brymer later played in the BBC Symphony and London Symphony Orchestras. He was also associated with several chamber music ensembles, and maintained a lifelong pleasure in playing jazz. He held professorships during most of the period from 1950 to 1993, first at the Royal Academy of Music, then at the Royal Military School of Music, and finally at the Guildhall School of Music. He was a frequent broadcaster, both as a player and a presenter, and made recordings of solo works and with orchestras and smaller ensembles. He published two volumes of memoirs and a book about the clarinet.

The Guardian wrote of him, \\"Struggling with an inadequate instrument (a sharp- pitch A clarinet with a bit sawn off in the school woodwork room) and playing in local bands and amateur orchestras with people much older than himself, he learned his craft in the most practical way.\\"Emerson, June. \\"Jack Brymer\\", The Guardian, 18 September 2003 While still a boy he encountered, and appreciated, a wide range of musical styles from jazz and light music to brass-bands and circuses. He later insisted that all these genres had been of great value to him professionally. Brymer was educated at Westoe Secondary School, South Shields, excelling at rugby football.\\"Jack Brymer ‚Äì Obituary\\", The Times, 17 September 2003 He hankered after a musical career, but as a profile in The Gramophone put it, \\"The virtual collapse of the orchestral profession when sound entered the cinema, and musicians were thrown out of work by the hundred turned his thoughts elsewhere.\\"Wimbush, Roger. \\"Here and There\\", The Gramophone, May 1968, p. 33 From 1933 Brymer trained at Goldsmiths College, London University as a generalist teacher. He joined the teaching staff of Heath Clark School, Croydon, and in his spare time played in amateur musical ensembles. Among his fellow students at the college, and later his colleague in the amateur groups, was a string player, Joan Richardson. They married in 1939 when they were both 24. There was one son of the marriage. Although he had no formal tuition as a clarinettist, Brymer maintained that nobody was entirely self-taught: \\"I learnt from everyone I heard play. Frederick Thurston and Reginald Kell unwittingly betrayed their methods to me, but I also decided that I wanted to play in certain ways that they had never done. The ability to play the clarinet is the ability to overcome the imperfections of the instrument. There's no such thing as a perfect clarinet, never was and never will be.\\" Other clarinettists whose technique Brymer observed and learned from were Charles Draper and Haydn Draper. Brymer wrote of his predecessors, \\"They would have been astounded at the things they taught me, without a penny piece changing hands.\\" During the Second World War Brymer served in the Royal Air Force. After his basic training he was promoted to corporal and posted to Morecambe on the north west coast of England as a physical training instructor.Bullamore, Tim. \\"Jack Brymer ‚Äì Principal clarinettist in Sir Thomas Beecham's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\\", The Independent, 20 September 2003 When not on RAF duty he frequently played in the Morecambe Central Pier dance band dressed in his corporal's uniform. Among those he met in the Air Force was the horn player, Dennis Brain, who admired Brymer's playing, and who later had a decisive influence on his career. =Royal Philharmonic= In 1946, Sir Thomas Beecham founded the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Among his principal players were Kell and Brain. The following year Kell announced his forthcoming resignation, and Brain suggested to Beecham that Brymer would be a suitable replacement. Brymer had returned to his teaching post after being demobilised from the RAF, and was incredulous at receiving a telephone call from Beecham inviting him to audition. Brymer's first reaction was to think it was a practical joke, with one of his musical friends impersonating Beecham's familiar lordly drawl. Having realised that it was indeed Beecham calling, Brymer accepted the invitation to audition. Having heard him play, Beecham appointed him to succeed Kell. His first appearance with the orchestra was in EMI's Abbey Road Studios, recording Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben. Brymer recalled \\"an old man in a raincoat leaning over my shoulder to mark the part of his Heldenleben ‚Äì Richard Strauss in the last year of his life\\". Many years later Brymer crossed swords with the conductor, Norman Del Mar over interpreting Strauss. A historian of the London Symphony Orchestra wrote, \\"Rehearsing Don Quixote, Del Mar had the temerity to admonish Brymer for playing a phrase too loudly: 'Just a memory, Jack, just a memory,' Del Mar called out. 'Why are you playing it mezzo-forte?' 'Because Strauss told me to,' Brymer retorted. 'And I'm surprised that you don't remember, Norman, because you were playing second horn at the time.'\\"Morrison, p. 117 The Times said of Brymer in this period, \\"After his appointment to the RPO in 1947, the balding, affable Brymer was certainly Great Britain's pre-eminent clarinettist, ‚Ä¶ whose mellifluous playing style and unruffled platform manner charmed even those usually impervious to classical music.\\" In the RPO, Brymer joined Beecham's starry line-up of wind players, Terence MacDonagh (oboe), Gerald Jackson (flute) and Gwydion Brooke (bassoon); collectively they became known to colleagues and audiences as \\"the Royal Family\\". A clarinettist of a later generation, Alan Hacker, wrote that the sound produced by Brymer and his colleagues was \\"expressive and instantly recognisable, even in just one solo note.\\" With Beecham and the RPO, Brymer made the first of his three recordings of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in 1958. When the recording was reissued on compact disc in 2001, The American Record Guide said, =BBC, LSO, chamber music and jazz= After Beecham's death in 1961 Brymer and other members of the RPO including MacDonagh became unhappy about the management of the RPO.\\"Lives Remembered\\", The Times, 2 October 2003, p. 41 The BBC's controller of music, William Glock, invited Brymer and MacDonagh to move to the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Brymer was the orchestra's co-principal clarinettist from 1963 to 1971. He also began to play more often in chamber music. When Pierre Boulez became chief conductor of the BBC SO in 1971, the sound he sought from his players, \\"avant garde, harsher, more cutting in its edge\\", did not appeal to Brymer. He accepted an invitation to join the London Symphony Orchestra as co-principal with Gervase de Peyer. An example of Brymer's sound in his LSO years can be heard in a 1972 recording of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No 2, conducted by Andr√© Previn. In The Gramophone, Edward Greenfield wrote of Brymer's \\"distinctively refined tone-colour ‚Ä¶ breathtakingly expressive\\" in the slow movement.Greenfield, Edward. \\"Rachmaninov. Symphony No 2 in E minor\\", The Gramophone, April 1973, p. 121 In the classical chamber repertory, Brymer was associated with several groups. At various times in his career he was a founder-member of the Wigmore Ensemble, the Prometheus Ensemble and the London Baroque Ensemble. He was director of the London Wind Soloists, and a member of the Tuckwell Wind Quartet and the Robles Ensemble. Throughout his career Brymer enjoyed an interest in mainstream jazz.\\"Brymer, Jack\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007,accessed 12 February 2012] He performed as a soloist with many of the leading British and American jazz players of the post-war decades. When the RPO was in New Orleans on an American tour, Brymer improvised with local jazz stars, including Alphonse Picou. =Teaching, recording, broadcasting and later years= As a teacher, Brymer was professor at the Royal Academy of Music (1950‚Äì58), the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall (1969‚Äì73), and the Guildhall School of Music (1981‚Äì93). Among his pupils at the Royal Academy was Alan Hacker, who like many players of the generation after Brymer was less attracted by the rich sound developed by Brymer, favouring instead more radical techniques propounded by Bruno Bartolozzi, and playing styles harking back to an earlier, less mellifluous, style of playing. Jack Brymer's grave at St Peter's Church in Limpsfield, Surrey. During his career Brymer made gramophone recordings of all Mozart's works for wind solo and ensemble. Several works were written for him, including Three Pieces and a Clarinet Quintet by Cecil Armstrong Gibbs; Roundelay by Alan Richardson; and a Clarinet Concerto by Guy Woolfenden. Brymer was also a well-known broadcaster. His biographer, Raymond Holden, writes, \\"his easy manner before the microphone meant that the radio programmes that he presented for the BBC, such as 'At Home', were popular favourites\\". The LSO paid Brymer the unusual tribute of mounting a special concert to mark his 70th birthday, and another to mark his 75th. By the time of the latter he had retired from full-time orchestral playing, but he continued to perform, and played at a concert given by the English Chamber Orchestra to mark his 80th birthday, at which he played Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet, and Weber's Clarinet Concerto No 1. Brymer's last public concert was on 18 July 1997 at the Wigmore Hall in London where he performed Mozart's Clarinet Quintet with the Gabrieli Quartet. Before the performance, Brymer told the audience that the Quintet held a special importance for him and he thought it appropriate that this music should mark his farewell to the concert platform. Brymer died in Redhill, Surrey at the age of 88. His ashes were interred a short distance away in the churchyard of St Peter's, Limpsfield, close to the grave of Beecham.St Peter‚Äôs Churchyard, The Limpsfield Net, 4 March 2006 Publications =Books= * (also published in French and German editions) =Video= * Notes References * External links *An interview with Jack Brymer recorded in 1992 - a British Library sound recording 1915 births 2003 deaths Academics of the Royal Academy of Music BBC Symphony Orchestra British clarinetists British classical clarinetists London Symphony Orchestra players Officers of the Order of the British Empire People from South Shields ","title":"Jack Brymer"},{"id":"245137","text":"From the Earth to the Moon: A Direct Route in 97 Hours, 20 Minutes () is an 1865 novel by Jules Verne. It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three people‚Äîthe Gun Club's president, his Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poet‚Äîin a projectile with the goal of a Moon landing. Five years later, Verne wrote a sequel called Around the Moon. The story is also notable in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in that, considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time, some of his figures are remarkably accurate. However, his scenario turned out to be impractical for safe manned space travel since a much longer barrel would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers. The character of Michel Ardan, the French member of the party in the novel, was inspired by the real-life photographer F√©lix Nadar. Plot The projectile, as pictured in an engraving from the 1872 Illustrated Edition. The firing of the Columbiad. The story opens some time after the end of the American Civil War. The Baltimore Gun Club, a society dedicated to the design of weapons of all kinds (especially cannons), comes together when Impey Barbicane, its president, calls them to support his latest idea. He's done some calculations, and believes that they could construct a cannon capable of shooting a projectile to the Moon. After receiving the support of his companions, another meeting is held to decide the place from which the projectile will be fired, the dimensions and materials of both the cannon and the projectile, and which kind of powder they are to use. An old enemy of Barbicane, a Captain Nicholl of Philadelphia, designer of plate armor, declares that the entire enterprise is absurd and makes a series of bets with Barbicane, each of them of increasing amount, over the impossibility of such feat. The first obstacle, the money to construct the giant cannon (and against which Nicholl has bet 1,000 dollars), is raised from a number of countries in America and Europe. Notably, the U.S. gives four million dollars, while England does not give a farthing, but in the end, nearly five and a half million dollars are raised, which ensures the financial feasibility of the project. Stone's Hill in \\"Tampa Town\\", Florida is chosen as the site for the cannon's construction. The Gun Club travels there and starts the construction of the Columbiad cannon, which requires the excavation of a and circular hole, which is made in the nick of time, but a surprise awaits Barbicane: Michel Ardan, a French adventurer, plans to travel aboard the projectile. During a meeting between Ardan, the Gun Club, and the inhabitants of Florida, Nicholl appears and challenges Barbicane to a duel. The duel is stopped when Ardan‚Äîhaving been warned by J. T. Maston, secretary of the Gun Club‚Äîmeets the rivals in the forest where they have agreed to duel. Meanwhile, Barbicane finds the solution to the problem of surviving the incredible acceleration that the explosion would cause. Ardan suggests that Barbicane and Nicholl travel with him in the projectile, and the proposition is accepted. In the end, the projectile is successfully launched, but the destinies of the three astronauts are left inconclusive. The sequel, Around the Moon, deals with what happens to the three men in their travel from the Earth to the Moon. Influence on popular culture The novel was adapted as the opera Le voyage dans la lune in 1875, with music by Jacques Offenbach. In 1880 The Pall Mall Gazette described Verne‚Äôs Columbiad as a ‚Äòspace-ship‚Äô - the first recorded use of this term in history.https://howthingsfly.si.edu/ask-an-explainer/what-year-was-word- spaceship-first-used In H. G. Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon (also relating to the first voyagers to the Moon) the protagonist, Mr. Bedford, mentions Verne's novel to his companion, Professor Cavor, who replies (in a possible dig at Verne) that he does not know what Bedford is referring to. Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \\"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\\", he asked archly. The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges M√©li√®s. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac. In 1889 Verne wrote a second sequel to the novel, The Purchase of the North Pole, which has the Gun Club members (led by J. T. Maston) plan to use the Columbiad to alter the tilt of the Earth to enable the mineral wealth of the Arctic region to be put within reach of exploitation. In March 1953, the Gilberton Company published a comic-book adaptation of From the Earth to the Moon as issue No. 105 in its Classics Illustrated series. An unidentified scriptwriter combined Verne's From the Earth to the Moon with the sequel, Around the Moon. Gilberton art director Alex A. Blum supplied both the cover painting and the 44 pages of interior art. The title went through twelve printings between 1953 and 1971.. During their return journey from the Moon, the crew of Apollo 11 made reference to Jules Verne's book during a TV broadcast on July 23.. The mission's commander, astronaut Neil Armstrong, said, \\"A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia , took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern-day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow.\\" In Back to the Future Part III, Clara Clayton in 1885 asks Emmett Brown if he believes mankind will ever \\"travel to the Moon the way we travel across the country on trains.\\" Being from the future, Brown already knows that doesn't happen for another 84 years, but he affirms they will while inadvertently quoting a passage of From the Earth to the Moon. Clara calls him out on this, and it's from this encounter that the pair discovers their mutual love of Jules Verne novels. The novel and its sequel were the inspiration for the 2005 point-and-click adventure computer game Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne. In the 2010 The Quantum Thief trilogy, the protagonist enters an uneasy alliance with the \\"Gun Club zoku\\", who specialize in military weaponry, and in The Causal Angel (2014) after escaping Earth using a nuclear powered space gun, sells the \\"Verne gun bullet\\" to them as a unique collectible item; author Hannu Rajaniemi is a fan of Verne.\\"Interview: Hannu Rajaniemi: SciFiNow sits down with a rising star of science fiction.\\"\\"Once a physicist: Hannu Rajaniemi; Hannu Rajaniemi is an Edinburgh-based science-fiction writer whose first novel, The Quantum Thief, is published by Gollancz in paperback this month\\" The Japanese anime adaption of the Space Brothers (2012-2014) opening for episodes 39-51 (\\"Small World\\" by Fujifabric) was a parody of the story, even ending with the cover of an early English translation.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjAyInNb0uo The Japanese otome visual novel, Code: Realize- Guardian of Rebirth (2014), features a datable engineer named Impey Barbicane. Impey's goal is to build the technology to reach the moon, reflecting the story of the novel. In season two of the The Umbrella Academy (TV series), the character Ray gives Allison a copy of the book as an anniversary gift. Later she leaves a note for him in the same copy of the book. \\"R29 Binge Club: Umbrella Academy Season 2 Recap\\" =Disneyland Paris= The first incarnation of the roller coaster Space Mountain in Disneyland Paris, named Space Mountain: De la Terre √† la Lune, was based loosely on this novel. The attraction opened in 1995. The attraction's exterior was designed using a Verne era retro-futuristic influence. Elements of the ambiance include rivet and boiler plate effect and the \\"Columbiad,\\" which recoils with a bang and produces smoke as each car passes, giving riders the perception of being shot into space. During 2005, the ride was refurbished and renamed Space Mountain: Mission 2 as part of the Happiest Celebration on Earth. The ride no longer features elements of the original storyline from the novel. In 1995 the BBC made a documentary about the creation of Space Mountain, called Shoot For The Moon. The 44-minute program followed Tim Delaney and his team in bringing the book From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne to life. The program shows the development of the attraction, from conception to construction to testing the final attraction. The documentary, originally broadcast on BBC Two in the United Kingdom, was also aired on other channels in many countries. =Project Epicus version= In 2013, a new film version of the story was announced, under the banner of Project Epicus‚Äîa film project‚Äîwith the full blessing of Jules Verne's great-grandson Jean Verne that began production in 2017.

Ten percent of the Earth's land area is covered by loess or similar deposits. Loess is an aeolian (windborne) sediment being an accumulation of: twenty percent or less clay and the balance mainly equal parts sand and silt typically from 20 to 50 micrometers per particleSmalley, I.

Prentice Hall often loosely cemented by calcium carbonate. It is usually homogeneous and highly porous and is traversed by vertical capillaries that permit the sediment to fracture and form vertical bluffs. Properties Loess near Hunyuan, Datong, Shanxi, China Loess is homogeneous, porous, friable, pale yellow or buff, slightly coherent, typically non-stratified and often calcareous. Loess grains are angular with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia Loess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of Northwestern China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, Glossary of Geology. Springer-Verlag, New York City, 779 pp., Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without slumping. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making human habitations in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily. In several areas of the world, loess ridges have formed that are aligned with the prevailing winds during the last glacial maximum. These are called \\"paha ridges\\" in America and \\"greda ridges\\" in Europe. The form of these loess dunes has been explained by a combination of wind and tundra conditions. Etymology 'The word loess, with connotations of origin by wind-deposited accumulation, came into English from German L√∂ss, which can be traced back to Swiss German and is cognate with the English word loose and the German word los. It was first applied to Rhine River valley loess about 1821. History of research The term \\"L√∂√ü\\" was first described in Central Europe by Karl C√§sar von Leonhard (1823‚Äì1824)Leonhard K. C. von (1823‚Äì1824). Charakteristik der Felsarten. 3 Vols., J. Engelmann Verlag Heidelberg, pp. 772. who reported yellowish brown, silty deposits along the Rhine valley near Heidelberg. Charles Lyell (1834) brought this term into widespread usage by observing similarities between loess and loess derivatives along the loess bluffs in the Rhine and Mississippi. At that time it was thought that the yellowish brown silt-rich sediment was of fluvial origin being deposited by the large rivers. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that the aeolian origin of loess was recognized (Virlet D'Aoust 1857),Virlet D'Aoust P.T. (1857). \\"Observations sur un terrain d\`origine m√©t√©orique ou de transport aerien qui existe au Mexique et sur le ph√©nom√®ne des trombes de poussi√®re auquel il doit principalement son origine\\".

Verh Geol Reichsanst, Berlin, pp 1‚Äì13. A tremendous number of papers have been published since then, focusing on the formation of loess and on loess/palaeosol (older soil buried under deposits) sequences as archives of climate and environment change. These water conservation works were carried out extensively in China and the research of Loess in China has been continued since 1954. (Liu TS, Loess and the environment) Much effort was put into the setting up of regional and local loess stratigraphies and their correlation (Kukla 1970, 1975, 1977).Kukla G. (1970). \\"Correlation between loesses and deep-sea sediments\\". Geologiske Foreningen Foerhandlingar 92: 148‚Äì180. Stockholm.Kukla G. J. (1975). \\"Loess stratigraphy of Central Europe\\". In: Butzer K. W. & Isaac G. L. (eds.) After the Australopithecus, pp. 99‚Äì188. Mouton, The Hague. But even the chronostratigraphical position of the last interglacial soil correlating to marine isotope substage 5e has been a matter of debate, owing to the lack of robust and reliable numerical dating, as summarized for example in Z√∂ller et al. (1994) and Frechen, Horv√°th & G√°bris (1997) for the Austrian and Hungarian loess stratigraphy, respectively. Since the 1980s, thermoluminescence (TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating are available providing the possibility for dating the time of loess (dust) deposition, i.e. the time elapsed since the last exposure of the mineral grains to daylight. During the past decade, luminescence dating has significantly improved by new methodological improvements, especially the development of single aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocols (Murray & Wintle 2000) resulting in reliable ages (or age estimates) with an accuracy of up to 5 and 10% for the last glacial record. More recently, luminescence dating has also become a robust dating technique for penultimate and antepenultimate glacial loess (e.g. Thiel et al. 2011, Schmidt et al. 2011) allowing for a reliable correlation of loess/palaeosol sequences for at least the last two interglacial/glacial cycles throughout Europe and the Northern Hemisphere (Frechen 2011). Furthermore, the numerical dating provides the basis for quantitative loess research applying more sophisticated methods to determine and understand high- resolution proxy data, such as the palaeodust content of the atmosphere, variations of the atmospheric circulation patterns and wind systems, palaeoprecipitation and palaeotemperature. Besides luminescence dating methods, the use of radiocarbon dating in loess has increased during the past decades. Advances in methods of analyses, instrumentation and refinements to the radiocarbon calibration curve have enabled to obtain reliable ages from loess deposits for the last 40-45 ka. However, the use of this method relies on finding suitable in situ organic material in deposits such as charcoal, seeds, earthworm granules or snail shells. Formation According to Pye (1995), four fundamental requirements are necessary for the formation of loess: a dust source, adequate wind energy to transport the dust, a suitable accumulation area, and a sufficient amount of time. =Periglacial loess= Periglacial (glacial) loess is derived from the floodplains of glacial braided rivers that carried large volumes of glacial meltwater and sediments from the annual melting of continental icesheets and mountain icecaps during the spring and summer. During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like silt and clay, they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and clays by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides of the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley are a classic example of periglacial loess. During the Quaternary, loess and loess-like sediments were formed in periglacial environments on mid-continental shield areas in Europe and Siberia, on the margins of high mountain ranges like in Tajikistan and on semi-arid margins of some lowland deserts like in China. In England, periglacial loess is also known as brickearth. =Non-glacial= Non- glacial loess can originate from deserts, dune fields, playa lakes, and volcanic ash. Some types of nonglacial loess are: * Desert loess produced by aeolian attrition of quartz grains;Whalley, W.B., Marshall, J.R., Smith, B.J. 1982, Origin of desert loess from some experimental observations, Nature, 300, 433-435. * Volcanic loess in Ecuador and Argentina; * Tropical loess in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay; * Gypsum loess in Spain; * Trade wind loess in Venezuela and Brazil; * Anticyclonic loess in Argentina. The thick Chinese loess deposits are non-glacial loess having been blown in from deserts in northern China. The loess covering the Great Plains of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado is considered to be non-glacial desert loess. Non-glacial desert loess is also found in Australia and Africa. Fertility Loess tends to develop into very rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, it is some of the most agriculturally productive terrain in the world. Soils underlain by loess tend to be excessively drained. The fine grains weather rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich. One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to cation exchange capacity (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and porosity (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter. Even well managed loess farmland can experience dramatic erosion of well over 2.5 kg /m2 per year. In China the loess deposits which give the Yellow River its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles, contributing to the Asian Dust pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States, the Loess Hills along the border of Iowa and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and poor farming practices. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with mouldboard ploughs and fall tilled, both intensely erosive. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year. Today this loess deposit is worked as low till or no till in all areas and is aggressively terraced. Large areas of loess deposits and soils = Central Asia = From southern Tajikistan up to Almaty, Kazakhstan, spans an area of multiple loess deposits., Fig. 1 (b) showing the distribution of loess, deserts, and mountains in Central Asia (adopted from [T.S. Liu, Loess and the Environment, China Ocean Press, Beijing, 1985.]). The locality of the Chashmanigar loess section is indicated by the solid arrow. = East Asia = China The Loess Plateau (), also known as the Huangtu Plateau, is a plateau that covers an area of some 640,000 km2 around the upper and middle reaches of China's Yellow River. The Yellow River was so named because the loess forming its banks gave a yellowish tint to the water. The soil of this region has been called the \\"most highly erodible soil on earth\\".John M. Laflen, Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming, 2000, CRC Press, 736 pages The Loess Plateau and its dusty soil cover almost all of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and parts of others. = Europe = Loess deposits of varying thickness (decimeter to several tens of meters) are widely distributed over the European continent. The northern European loess belt stretches from southern England and northern France to Germany, Poland and the southern Ukraine and deposits are characterized by strong influences of periglacial conditions. South-eastern European loess is mainly deposited in plateau-like situations in the Danube basins, likely derived from the Danube River system. In south-western Europe, relocated loess derivatives are mostly restricted to the Ebro Valley and central Spain. =North America= United States Map showing the distribution of loess in United States. The Loess Hills of Iowa owe their fertility to the prairie topsoils built by 10,000 years of post-glacial accumulation of organic-rich humus as a consequence of a persistent grassland biome. When the valuable A-horizon topsoil is eroded or degraded, the underlying loess soil is infertile, and requires the addition of fertilizer in order to support agriculture. The loess along the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi, consist of three layers. The Peoria Loess, Sicily Island Loess, and Crowley's Ridge Loess accumulated at different periods of time during the Pleistocene. Ancient soils, called paleosols, have developed in the top of the Sicily Island Loess and Crowley's Ridge Loess. The lowermost loess, the Crowley's Ridge Loess, accumulated during the late Illinoian Stage. The middle loess, Sicily Island Loess, accumulated during early Wisconsin Stage. The uppermost loess, the Peoria Loess, in which the modern soil has developed, accumulated during the late Wisconsin Stage. Animal remains include terrestrial gastropods and mastodons.Miller, B.J., G.C. Lewis, J.J. Alford, and W.J. Day, 1985, Loesses in Louisiana and at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Two areas of loess are usually distinguished in Argentina: the neotropical loess north of latitude 30¬∞ S and the pampean loess. The neotropical loess is made of silt or silty clay. Relative to the pampean loess the neotropical loess is poor in quartz and calcium carbonate. The source region for this loess is thought by some scientists to be areas of fluvio- glacial deposits the Andean foothills formed by the Patagonian Ice Sheet. Other researchers stress the importance of volcanic material in the neotropical loess. The pampean loess is sandy or made of silty sand.

Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, griddle, grinnel, swamp trout, and choupique. They are regarded as taxonomic relicts, being the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes, which dates from the Jurassic to the Eocene, persisting to the present. Although bowfin are highly evolved, they are often referred to as \\"primitive fish\\" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors. Bowfin are demersal freshwater piscivores native to North America, and commonly found throughout much of the eastern United States, and in southern Ontario and Quebec. Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments with a range that spanned across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Now their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada, including the drainage basins of the Mississippi River, Great Lakes and various rivers exiting in the Eastern Seaboard or Gulf of Mexico. Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps and backwater areas; they are also occasionally found in brackish water. They are stalking, ambush predators known to move into the shallows at night to prey on fish and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects. Like gars, bowfin are bimodal breathers which means they have the capacity to breathe both water and air. Their gills exchange gases in the water allowing them to exploit oxygen for breathing, but they also have a gas bladder that serves to maintain buoyancy, and also allows them to breathe air by means of a small pneumatic duct connected from the foregut to the gas bladder. They can break the surface to gulp air, which allows them to survive conditions of aquatic hypoxia that would be lethal to most other species. Bowfin activity in an aquarium. Morphology The average length of a bowfin is ; females typically grow to , males to . Records indicate bowfin can reach in length, and weigh . Young of the year typically grow to by October. Females tend to grow larger than males. Diagram showing fins and eyespot of a bowfin. USFW&S; The body of the bowfin is elongated and cylindrical, with the sides and back olive to brown in color, often with vertical bars, and dark reticulations, or camouflaged pattern. The dorsal fin has horizontal bars, and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars. The underside is white or cream, and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green. During larval stage, hatchlings from about total length are black and tadpole-like in appearance. At approximately total length they have been described as looking like miniature placoderms. They grow quickly, and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching. Young males have a black eyespot on the base of the tail (caudal peduncle) that is commonly encircled by an orange-yellowish border while the female's is black, if present at all. It is thought the purpose of the eyespot is to confuse predators, deflecting attacks away from the head of the fish to its tail, which affords the bowfin an opportunity to escape predation. The bowfin is so named for its long, undulating dorsal fin consisting of 145 to 250 rays, and running from the middle of the back to the base of the tail. The skull of the bowfin is made of two layers of skull, the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin skull is made up of 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The entirety of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones. Drawing of a bowfin skull showing the bony plates protecting the head Bowfin are often referred to as \\"living fossils\\", or \\"primitive fish\\" because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestral predecessors, including a modified (rounded externally) heterocercal caudal fin, a highly vascularized gas bladder lung, vestiges of a spiral valve, and a bony gular plate. The bony gular plate is located underneath the head on the exterior of the lower jaw between the two sides of the lower jaw bone. Other distinguishing characteristics include long, sharp teeth, and two protruding tube-like nostrils. Unlike all of the most primitive actinopterygians, the scales of bowfin differ in that they are not ganoid scales, rather they are large, single-layered cycloid scales closer in similarity to more derived teleosts.

This specimen came from the Pacific Lutheran University Natural History collection. =Fish similar in appearance= Northern snakeheads (Channa argus) are commonly mistaken for bowfin because of similarities in appearance, most noticeably their elongated, cylindrical shape, and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs. Northern snakeheads are piscivorous fish native to the rivers and estuaries of China, Russia, and Korea. However, unlike bowfin which are native to North America, the northern snakehead is considered an invasive species and environmentally harmful. Some contrasting differences in bowfin include a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle, a tan and olive coloration, a shorter anal fin, a more rounded head, and an upper jaw that is longer than its lower jaw. The burbot, a predatory fish native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also commonly mistaken for bowfin. Burbots can be distinguished by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.  Evolution of bowfin morphology  The first fish lacked jaws and used negative pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin is a result of their evolutionary need to be able to catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it. The vertebral column in bowfin is ossified and in comparison to earlier fish, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the vertebral column allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a rounded heterocercal tail that resembles a homocercal tail. This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy. The lower figure is a skeleton of the bowfin. The pelvic and pectoral girdles are both visible and the axial and cranial elements are also both present. The bowfin is an actinopterygii which means that the pectoral girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fish the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle. The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girdle is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods. Physiology Dissection of a bowfin swim bladder Bowfin, like other physostomes such as bichirs (Polypteridae), gars (Lepisosteidae), and the lungfish (Dipnoi), are capable of bimodal respiration. They can extract oxygen from the water when breathing through their gills, and can also break the water's surface to breathe or gulp air through a small pneumatic duct connected from their foregut to the gas bladder. When performing low-level physical activity, bowfin obtain more than half of their oxygen from breathing air. Bowfin have two distinct air- breathing mechanisms used to ventilate the gas bladder. Type I air breaths are consistent with the action of exhale-inhale stimulated by aerial or aquatic hypoxia to regulate O2 gas exchange; type II air breaths are by inhalation alone which is believed to regulate gas bladder volume for buoyancy control. Bimodal respiration helps bowfin survive and maintain their metabolic rate in hypoxic conditions. The rate of air breathing is higher in darkness, when the fish is more active. Bowfin blood can adapt to warm, acidic waters. The fish becomes inactive in waters below ; at this temperature they breathe almost no air; however, with increasing temperature their air breathing increases. Their preferred temperature range is between , with the temperature of maximum activity. Air breathing is at a maximum in the range . Herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill reported in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber below the ground surface, in diameter, from a river. It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area, and receded. It is not unusual for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents, and become trapped when water levels recede. While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers, laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure. However, no field manipulation has been performed. Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin's ability to aestivate, it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because they have the ability to breathe air. Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure. Evolution and phylogeny Competing hypotheses and debates continue over the evolution of Amia and relatives, including their relationship among basal extant teleosts, and organization of clades. Bowfin are the last remaining member of Halecomorphi, a group that includes many extinct species in several families. Halecomorphs were generally accepted as the sister group to Teleostei but not without question. While a halecostome pattern of neopterygian clades was produced in morphology-based analyses of extant actinopterygians, a different result was produced with fossil taxa which showed a monophyletic Holostei. Monophyletic Holostei were also recovered by at least two nuclear gene analyses, in an independent study of fossil and extant fish, and in an analysis of ultraconserved genomic elements. The extant ray-finned fish of the subclass Actinopterygii include 42 orders, 431 families and over 23,000 species. They are currently classified into two infraclasses, Chondrostei (holosteans) and Neopterygii (teleost fishes). Sturgeons, paddlefish, bichirs and reed fish compose the thirty-eight species of chondrosteans, and are considered relict species. Included in the over 23,000 species of neopterygians are eight relict species comprising gars and the bowfin. Three divisions of Neopterygii comprising Lepisosteiformes, Amiiformes, and Teleostei =Infraclass Neopterygii= Neopterygians are the second major occurrence in the evolution of ray-finned fish and today include the majority of modern bony fish. They are distinguished from their earlier ancestors by major changes to the jaws, shape of the skull, and tail. They are divided into three divisions: * Division 1. Order Lepisosteiformes ‚Äì the relict gars which include extant species of gars that first appeared in the Cretaceous. * Division 2. Order Amiiformes ‚Äì the relict bowfin, (halecomorphids), the only extant species in the order Amiiformes which date back to the Triassic period. * Division 3. Division Teleostei ‚Äì the stem group of Teleostei from which modern fish arose, including most of the bony fish we are familiar with today. =Species= List of species. * ‚Ä†Amia depressa Marsh 1871 * ‚Ä†Amia dictyocephala Cope 1875 * ‚Ä†Amia elegans Leidy 1873 * ‚Ä†Amia exilis Lambe 1908 * ‚Ä†Amia fragosa (Jordan 1927) * ‚Ä†Amia godai Yabumoto & Grande 2013 * ‚Ä†Amia gracilis Leidy 1873 * ‚Ä†Amia lewesiensis Mantell 1822 * ‚Ä†Amia macrospondyla Cope 1891 * ‚Ä†Amia media Leidy 1873 * ‚Ä†Amia morini Priem 1911 * ‚Ä†Amia newberriana Marsh 1871 * ‚Ä†Amia selwyniana Ami 1891 * ‚Ä†Amia uintaensis Leidy 1873 * ‚Ä†Amia whiteavesiana Cope 1891 * ‚Ä†Amia pattersoni * ‚Ä†Amia scutata Cope 1875 * Amia calva Linnaeus 1766 (Bowfin) =Genome evolution= The bowfin genome contains an intact ParaHox gene cluster, similar to the bichir and to most other vertebrates. This is in contrast, however, with teleost fish, which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster, probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage. The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fish before the last common ancestor of all teleosts appeared. Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost model organisms such as zebrafish. Feeding behavior The gill rakers are short with blunt processes and with a small space in between them. They are connected to the gill arch of the gills. Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that customarily move into the shallows at night to prey on fish, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects. Young bowfin feed mostly on small crustaceans, while adults are mostly piscivorous, but also known to be opportunistic. Bowfin are remarkably agile, can move quickly through the water, and they have a voracious appetite. Their undulating dorsal fin propels them silently through the water while stalking their prey. The attack is straightforward and swift with a movement that lasts approximately 0.075 seconds. There were also some studies regarding the capacity of the bowfin to survive without food. In 1916, A female bowfin was starved for twenty months. It was the longest period that any vertebrate had been without food, as far the writer was aware during the observation. Some independent studies focus on the bowfin's ability to use organic material as a source of food and studied the structure of the gill raker. They concluded that it did not benefit from the organic material in the water because the gill rakers were short with blunt processes and a short space between them. Even bacteria could enter and exit through the gill easily. Its structure alone indicated that the Amia don't use microorganisms as a source of food. Distribution and habitat Amia calva distribution in the eastern U.S., as well as from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Champlain drainage of southern Ontario and Quebec, westward around Great Lakes in southern Ontario into Minnesota Fossil deposits indicate amiiforms included freshwater and marine species that were once widely distributed in North America, South America, Eurasia and Africa. Today, bowfin (Amia calva) are the only remaining species in the order Amiiformes; they are demersal freshwater piscivores, and their range is restricted to freshwater environments in North America, including much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Champlain drainage of southern Ontario and Quebec westward around the Great Lakes in southern Ontario into Minnesota. Historically, their distribution in North America included the drainage basins of the Mississippi River from Quebec to northern Minnesota, the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes, including Georgian Bay, Lake Nipissing and Simcoe, Ontario, south to the Gulf of Mexico; Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain from the Susquehanna River drainage in southeastern Pennsylvania to the Colorado River in Texas. =Stocking= Research from the late 1800s to the 1980s suggests a trend of intentional stockings of non- indigenous fish into ponds, lakes and rivers in the United States. At that time, little was known about environmental impacts, or long-term effects of new species establishment and spread as a result of \\"fish rescue and transfer\\" efforts, or the importance of nongame fish to the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems. Introductions of bowfin to areas they were considered a non-indigenous species included various lakes, rivers and drainages in Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Many of the introductions were intentional stockings by various resource management; however, there is no way to positively determine distribution resulting from flood transfers, or other inadvertent migrations. Bowfin are typically piscivorous, but as an introduced species are capable of being voracious predators that pose a threat to native fish and their prey. =Preferred habitat= Bowfin prefer vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps, backwater areas, and are occasionally found in brackish water. They are well camouflaged, and not easy to spot in slow water with abundant vegetation. They often seek shelter under roots, and submerged logs. Oxygen-poor environments can be tolerated because of their ability to breathe air. Life cycle Bowfin spawn in the spring or early summer, typically between April and June, more commonly at night in abundantly vegetated, clear shallow water in weed beds over sand bars, and also under stumps, logs, and bushes. Optimum temperatures for nesting and spawning range between . The males construct circular nests in fibrous root mats, clearing away leaves and stems. Depending on the density of surrounding vegetation there may be a tunnel-like entrance at one side. The diameter of the nests commonly range between , at a water depth of . During spawning season, the fins and underside of male bowfin often change in color to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie side by side in the nest. She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests. Females vacate the nest after spawning, leaving the male behind to protect the eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation.Berra, Tim M. (2001). Freshwater Fish Distribution. San Diego: Academic Press. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, possibly more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation by means of an adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation. Bowfin reach sexually maturity at two to three years of age. They can live ten to twelve years in the wild, and 30 years in captivity. Females are longer-lived than males. Diseases Lernaea, or anchor worm, on a Murray cod. The same parasite also attacks bowfin. A common parasite of bowfin is the anchor worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes. Bowfin with liver cancer and with fatal leukemia have been reported. Utilization Freshly caught bowfin As a sport fish, bowfin are not considered desirable to many anglers. They were once considered a nuisance fish by anglers and early biologists who believed the bowfin's predatory nature was harmful to sport fish populations. As a result, efforts were taken to reduce their numbers. Research has since proven otherwise, and that knowledge together with a better understanding of maintaining overall balance of ecosystems, regulations were introduced to help protect and maintain viable populations of bowfin. Bowfin are strong fighters, a prized trait in game fish. However, they do have a jaw full of sharp teeth which requires careful handling. The current tackle record is Bowfin were once considered to have little commercial value because of its poor-tasting meat which has been referred to as \\"soft, bland-tasting and of poor texture\\". However, it is considered quite palatable if cleaned properly and smoked, or prepared fried, blackened, used in courtbouillion, or in fishballs or fishcakes. Over the years, global efforts have imposed strict regulations on the international trade of caviar, particularly on the harvest of sturgeons from the Caspian Sea where the highly prized caviar from the beluga sturgeon originates. The bans imposed on Caspian sturgeons have created lucrative markets for affordable substitutes in the United States including paddlefish, bowfin, and various species of sturgeon. In Louisiana, bowfin are harvested in the wild, and cultured commercially in hatcheries for their meat and roe. The roe is processed into caviar, and sold as \\"Cajun caviar\\", or marketed under the trade name \\"Choupiquet Royale\\". Accumulation of toxic substances In some areas of the United States where aquatic environments have tested positive for elevated levels of toxins, such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, and copper, there are posted signs with warnings about the consumption of fish caught in those areas. Concentration of mercury biomagnifies as it passes up the food chain from organisms on lower trophic levels to apex predators. It bioaccumulates in the tissues of larger, long-lived predatory fish. When compared to smaller, short-lived fish, bowfin tend to concentrate mercury at higher levels thereby making them less safe for human consumption.

The pagoda has been controversially claimed as a Nestorian Christian church from the Tang Dynasty.Martin Palmer, The Jesus Sutras: Rediscovering the Lost Religion of Taoist Christianity, , 2001 Etymology Daqin is the ancient Chinese name for the Roman Empire or, depending on context, the Near East, especially Syria. History The Daqin Pagoda is first attested in 1064, when the Chinese poet Su Shi visited it and wrote a well-known poem about it, \\"Daqin Temple\\". His younger brother Su Zhe also wrote an \\"echoing\\" poem referring to the monks at the temple. An earthquake severely damaged the pagoda in 1556 and it was finally abandoned. Due to the earthquake, many of the underground chambers of the complex are no longer reachable. Features The seven-storeyed octagonal brick pagoda is about 32 meters high. Each side of the first storey measures 4.3 meters. Speculation about Christianity The Daqin Pagoda was visited by Assyrian Church of the East Bishop Mar Awa Royel in 2012 as part of a follow-up visit to China in 2010, upon invitation from the Jingjiao Fellowship and director Mr. David Tam. In 2001 the pagoda was claimed by Martin Palmer, the translator of several popular books on Sinology, including Zhuangzi and I Ching, as a form of Christianity from the Tang Dynasty, in his controversial book The Jesus Sutras. According to Palmer, the church and the monastery were built in 640 by early Nestorian missionaries. Daqin is the name for the Roman Empire in the early Chinese language documents of the 1st and 2nd centuries, by the mid-9th century it was also used to refer to the mission churches of the Syriac Christians. Supporters of Palmer's claims have drawn attention to details which suggest that the monastery was earlier a Christian church, including a supposed depiction of Jonah at the walls of Nineveh, a nativity scene (depiction of the birth of Jesus) and Syriac graffiti. The east-facing orientation of the complex is also advanced as evidence of its Christian origin since Chinese Daoist and Buddhist temple complexes face north or south. As a potential stimulus to the district's tourist trade, Palmer's claims have been given wide publicity by the local authorities but have also received approbation by Chinese academics. The exterior of the pagoda and its surroundings were featured in the first episode of the 2009 BBC program A History of Christianity. The program also featured an interview with Palmer by the presenter Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch. Despite the publicity they have received, Palmer's claims are controversial, and have been dismissed by Michael Keevak, the author of The Story of a Stele, and by David Wilmshurst, the author of The Martyred Church: A History of the Church of the East.Keevak, The Story of a Stele, 000; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 461 See also *Nestorian Stele *Church of the East in China *Jingjiao Documents *Daqin  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Keevak, Michael, The Story of a Stele: China's Nestorian Monument and Its Reception in the West, 1625-1916 (Hong Kong, 2008). * Palmer, Martin, The Jesus Sutras: Discovering the Lost Scrolls of Taoist Christianity (New York, 2001). * Wilmshurst, David, The Martyred Church: A History of the Church of the East (London, 2011).

Restrictions other than geographical boundaries, such as what grapes may be grown, maximum grape yields, alcohol level, and other quality factors, may also apply before an appellation name may legally appear on a wine bottle label. The rules that govern appellations are dependent on the country in which the wine was produced. History The tradition of wine appellation is very old. The oldest references are to be found in the Bible, where wine of Samaria, wine of Carmel, wine of Jezreel,Geoffrey W. Bromiley, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995, , or wine of HelbonEzekiel 27:18 Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool are mentioned. This tradition of appellation continued throughout the Antiquity and the Middle Ages, though without any officially sanctioned rules. Historically, the world's first exclusive (protected) vineyard zone was introduced in Chianti, Italy in 1716 and the first wine classification system in Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary, in 1730. Europe =France= In 1935, the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO), a branch of the French Ministry of Agriculture, was created to manage wine-processing in France. In the Rhone wine region Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumari√©, a lawyer and winegrower from Ch√¢teauneuf-du- Pape, obtained legal recognition of the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne appellation of origin in 1937. The AOC seal, or Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e, was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Before 1935, despite the fact that the INAO was yet to be created, champagne enjoyed an appellation control by virtue of legal protection as part of the Treaty of Madrid. The treaty stated that only sparkling wine produced in Champagne and adhering to the standards defined for that name as an Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e could be called champagne. This right was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. =Germany= Germany is unusual among wine- producing countries in that its most prestigious classifications, the various grades of Pr√§dikatswein, are based on the ripeness of the grapes, though their geographical origins are also legally defined. Thus Germany's geographical classification, Qualit√§tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA), is akin to France's defunct Vin D√©limit√© de Qualit√© Superieure, which has been subsumed into the current Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e system. =Georgia= Georgia has nineteen registered wine appellations. =Hungary= Historically, the world's first vineyard classification system was introduced in Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary, in 1730. Vineyards were classified into three categories depending on the soil, sun exposure, and potential to develop Botrytis cinerea. The subdivisions were: first-class, second-class and third-class wines. A decree by the Habsburg crown in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj. The classification system was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772. =Italy= Italy's first origin classification system was introduced in Tuscany in 1716 for delimiting Chianti production. After the unification of Italy several attempts were made to introduce some kind of protection for wine appellations, to no avail. Only in 1963 the \\"Denominazione di origine controllata\\" law was approved, starting with 1967 vintage. =Portugal= The world's third-oldest appellation control, after Chianti and Tokaj was introduced in Portugal in 1756, pertaining to port wine, which was produced in the region of the Douro valley. =Spain= Some Spanish wines were already famous or even regulated (Rioja: 1925; Sherry: 1933) when the market started being regulated. It was not until 1980 that legislation on denominaci√≥n de origen was stablished, following the French scheme with more tiers of classification and prompted by the impending accession to the European Union. North America =Canada= Canadian wine appellations are regulated by the Vintners Quality Alliance system. The system covers the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. British Columbia is divided into four \\"Designated Viticultural Areas\\" (\\"DVAs\\"): Okanagan Valley, Vancouver Island, Fraser Valley, and the Similkameen Valley. Ontario includes three DVAs: Niagara Peninsula, Lake Erie North Shore, and Prince Edward County. On June 11, 2012, Nova Scotia launched its first appellation, Tidal Bay. =United States= The American Viticultural Area (\\"AVA\\") is for the United States. The only requirement to use an AVA name on the wine label is that 85% of the wine must have come from grapes grown within the geographical AVA boundaries. The first AVA was in Augusta, Missouri, in 1980. The approval of the Augusta AVA was based largely on its long historical relationship with wine in the United States. The Augusta wine-growing area is a plot of land along the Missouri River, which moderates temperature and provides an appropriate climate for growing grapes. States or counties can also be used in lieu of an AVA to designate the origin of a wine, provided that 75% of the grapes used in the wine are grown in the state or county listed on the label.

Rolleston's Myths & Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911 In the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, a medieval Irish Christian pseudo-history, the Milesians () are the final race to settle in Ireland. They represent the Irish people. The Milesians are Gaels who sail to Ireland from Iberia (Hispania) after spending hundreds of years travelling the earth. When they land in Ireland they contend with the Tuatha D√© Danann, who represent the pagan gods. The two groups agree to divide Ireland between them: the Milesians take the world above, while the Tuath D√© take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld). Whether the word \\"Milesians\\" came before or after the name M√≠l Esp√°ine, which is the Irish form of the Latin Miles Hispaniae (\\"Soldier of Hispania\\") is uncertain. Joseph Lennon writes that \\"no Irish-language cognate of the word exists.\\" and that \\"the word Milesian is not used to refer to the Irish with any regularity until the eighteenth century...\\" Scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Christian writers.Carey, John. The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory. University of Cambridge, 1994. pp.1‚Äì4 Myth The Lebor Gab√°la, which was written in the 11th century AD by Christian monks, purports to be a history of Ireland and the Irish (the Gaels). It tells us that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah, and that a Scythian king named F√©nius Farsaid (descendant of Noah's son Japheth) is the forebear of the Gaels. F√©nius, a prince of Scythia, is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. His son Nel weds Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, and they have a son named Go√≠del Glas. Go√≠del crafts the Goidelic (Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. Go√≠del's offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt at the same time as the Israelites (the Exodus) and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years wandering the Earth, undergoing a series of trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites, who spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. Eventually, they reach Hispania by sea and conquer it. There, Go√≠del's descendant Breog√°n founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son √çth glimpses Ireland. Brigantia refers to Corunna in modern-day Galicia, in Spain, (which was then known as Brigantium)Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"A Coru√±a\\". and Breog√°n's tower is likely based on the Tower of Hercules, which was built at Corunna by the Romans. √çth sails to the island with a group of men. He is welcomed by its three kings: Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gr√©ine. These three are members of the Tuatha D√© Danann, who ruled Ireland at the time. Evidence suggests that Tuath D√© were the main pagan gods of Ireland. √çth is then killed by unnamed attackers and his men return to Iberia. The eight sons of √çth's brother M√≠l Esp√°ine (whose given name was Galam), lead an invasion force to avenge his death and take Ireland. After they land, they fight against the Tuath D√© and make for Tara, the royal capital. On the way, they are met on three mountains by Banba, F√≥dla and √âriu ‚Äì the wives of Ireland's three kings. They are believed to have been a trio of land goddesses. Each woman says that the Gaels will have good fortune if they name the land after her. One of the Gaels, Amergin, promises that it shall be so. At Tara, they meet the three kings, who defend their claim to the joint kingship of the land. They ask that there be a three-day truce, during which the Gaels must stay a distance of nine waves from land. The Gaels agree, but once their ships are nine waves from Ireland, the Tuath D√© conjure up a great wind that prevents them sailing back to land. However, Amergin calms the wind by reciting a verse. The surviving ships return to land and the two groups agree to divide Ireland between them. The Gaels take the world above, while the Tuath D√© take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld) and enter the s√≠dhe, the ancient burial mounds that dot the Irish landscape. Amergin divides the kingship between √âremon, who rules the northern half of Ireland, and √âber Finn, who rules the southern half. This division of the land was probably invented by the writers to explain and justify the 7th/8th-century division between the royal capitals of Tara and Cashel.Koch, John T.. Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.709 The Lebor Gab√°la then traces Ireland's dynasties back to Milesian Gaels such as √âremon and √âber. Modern scholars, however, believe that these were fictional characters and that the writers were attempting to give the medieval dynasties more legitimacy.Carey, The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory, p.10 The Historia Brittonum‚Äîwhich was written before the Lebor Gab√°la‚Äîgives another account of the Milesians. It says that \\"three sons of a Spanish soldier\\" sailed from Iberia to Ireland with thirty ships, each carrying thirty wives. They see a glass tower in the middle of the sea with men on top of it, but the men do not answer their calls. The Milesians set out to take the tower, but when they reach it, all but one of their ships are sunk by a great wave. Only one ship makes it to land, and its passengers are the ancestors of all the Irish. In the Lebor Gab√°la, it is the earlier Nemedians who are drowned while trying to take a tower.Carey, The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory, pp.5-6 Analysis Modern scholars believe that the tale is mostly an invention of medieval Irish Christian writers. They sought to link the Irish to people and events from the Old Testament, to liken the Irish to the Israelites, and to reconcile native pagan myth with Christianity.Carey, The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory, pp.1‚Äì4, 24Koch, p.1130 They were inspired by other medieval Christian pseudo-histories, such as Galician cleric Paulus Orosius's History Against the Pagans, Saint Jerome's Chronicle, and the works of Isidore.Carey, John. \\"Did the Irish Come from Spain? The Legend of the Milesians\\", History Ireland (Autumn 2001), pp.8‚Äì11. The claim that the Irish Gaels came from the Iberian region of Galicia may be based on three things. The first is the coincidental similarity of the names Iberia/Hiberia and Hibernia and the names Galicia and Gael.Monaghan, Patricia. The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.332 Medieval pseudo-historians made similar claims about other nations based only on their names.Carey, The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory, p.13 The second is Isidore of Seville describing Iberia as the \\"mother[land] of the races\\".Carey, The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory, p.12 Isidore's works were a major source of inspiration for the writers of the Lebor Gab√°la. The third is Orosius describing Ireland as lying \\"between Iberia and Britain\\". The Roman historian Tacitus also thought that Ireland lay between Iberia and Britain. John Carey notes that if Iberia was thought to be the part of mainland Europe nearest to Ireland, it would be natural \\"to see it as the source of arrivals from overseas\\". The names of some of the Milesians were based on the names of the Gaels themselves: Goidel Glas (from Go√≠del), Fenius (from F√©ni), Scota (from Scoti), √âber (from Hiberni), √âremon and √çr (from √âire). Legacy Professor D√°ith√≠ √ì h√ìgain writes that the \\"account of how the sons of M√≠l took Ireland was a literary fabrication, but it was accepted as conventional history by poets and scholars down until the 19th century\\". For centuries, the legend was used in Ireland to win and secure dynastic and political legitimacy. For example, in his Two bokes of the histories of Ireland (1571), Edmund Campion tried to use the myth to establish an ancient right of the British monarch to rule Ireland. In A View of the Present State of Ireland, Edmund Spenser accepted and rejected various parts of the myth both to denigrate the Irish of his day and to justify English colonisation of Ireland in the 1590s (at the height of the Anglo-Spanish war).Andrew Hadfield, \\"Briton and Scythian: Tudor representations of Irish origins\\", Irish Historical Studies 28 (1993) pp. 390‚Äì395. The myth was cited during the Contention of the bards, which lasted from 1616 to 1624. During this period poets from the north and south of the island extolled the merits of the dynasties that gave them patronage, and attacked the dynasties from the other half of the island. Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn (written c.1634) used the myth to promote the legitimacy of the Stuart claim to royal authority in Ireland (related to the origin of the Lia F√°il), demonstrating that Charles I was descended, through Brian Boru, √âber and Galamh, from Noah and, ultimately, from Adam.Bernadette Cunningham, The World of Geoffrey Keating: history, myth and religion in 17th century Ireland (Dublin 2000). In the early modern period many Irishmen and women fled to Spain as a result of political and military turmoil in their homeland. The belief that the Gaelic Irish were descended from M√≠l Esp√°ine and his Spanish followers was current in Spain as well as Ireland, and as a result the Irish in Spain were given all the rights and privileges due to Spanish subjects, such as automatic citizenship granted to Irish Catholics who made it to Spanish territory.Micheline Walsh, \\"The Military Order of St Patrick\\" in Seanchas Ardmacha, Vol. 9, No. 2, (1979), p. 279 Among the many theories of Stone of Scone origins, Medieval Scottish lawyer Baldred Bisset put forward the theory it was transported from ancient Egypt via the Iberia peninsula or Celtiberia to Ireland by the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh Scota, who was also the wife of Go√≠del Glas, an ancestor of the Milesians. The stone has been associated to Lia Fail of the Hill of Tara, which was used as an Irish High Kings' Inauguration Stone. According to Bisset, Scota along with a band of Irish warriors later invaded Scotland taking her Royal seat with her. Ultimately it was confiscated by King Edward I of England through conquest.Sacred-Text, The Lia Fail, or the Stone of DestinyStone of Destiny, Masonic Library See also *Gallaeci  Footnotes  Mythological cycle Mythological peoples ","title":"Milesians (Irish)"},{"id":"245159","text":"Castor is the second-brightest object in the zodiac constellation of Gemini and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation Œ± Geminorum, which is Latinised to Alpha Geminorum and abbreviated Alpha Gem or Œ± Gem. It appears singular to the naked eye, but it is actually a sextuple star system organized into three binary pairs, made up of the stars Castor Aa, Castor Ab, Castor Ba, Castor Bb, Castor Ca, and Castor Cb. Although it is the 'Œ±' (alpha) member of the constellation, it is fainter than 'Œ≤' (beta) Geminorum, Pollux.  Stellar system  Hierarchy of orbits in the Castor system Castor is a multiple star system made up of six individual stars; there are three visual components, all which are spectroscopic binaries. Appearing to the naked eye as a single star, Castor was first recorded as a double star in 1718 by James Pound, but it may have been resolved into at least two sources of light by Cassini as early as 1678. The separation between Castor A and Castor B has increased from about 2‚Ä≥ (2 arcseconds of angular measurement) in 1970 to about 6‚Ä≥ in 2017. These two binary pairs have magnitudes of 1.9 and 3.0. Castor Aa and Ba both have orbits of a few days with a much fainter companion. Castor C, or YY Geminorum, was discovered to vary in brightness with a regular period. It is an eclipsing binary with additional variations due to areas of different brightness on the surface of one or both stars, as well as irregular flares. The Castor C components orbit in less than a day. Castor C is believed to be in orbit around Castor AB, but with an extremely long period of several thousand years. It is 73‚Ä≥ distant from the bright components. The combined apparent magnitude of all six stars is +1.58.  Physical properties  Castor is 51 light-years away from Earth, determined from its large annual parallax. The two brightest stars are both A-class main- sequence stars, more massive and brighter than the Sun. The properties of their red dwarf companions are difficult to determine, but are both thought to have less than half the mass of the Sun. Castor B is an Am star, with particularly strong spectral lines of certain metals. Castor C is a variable star, classified as a BY Draconis type. BY Draconis variables are cool dwarf stars which vary as they rotate due to starspots or other variations in their photospheres. The two red dwarfs of Castor C are almost identical, with masses around and luminosities less than 10% of the Sun. All the red dwarfs in the Castor system have emissions lines in their spectra, and all are flare stars. Etymology and culture Œ± Geminorum (Latinised to Alpha Geminorum) is the star system's Bayer designation. Castor and Pollux are the two \\"heavenly twin\\" stars that give the constellation Gemini (meaning twins in Latin) its name. The name Castor refers specifically to Castor, one of the twin sons of Zeus and Leda in Greek and Roman mythology. The star was annotated by the Arabic description Al-Ras al-Taum al-Muqadim, which translates as the head of the foremost twin. In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Aoul al Dzira, which was translated into Latin as Prima Brachii, meaning the first in the paw. In Chinese, (), meaning North River, refers to an asterism consisting of Castor, œÅ Geminorum, and Pollux. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

He was the son of Khufu and the throne successor of Djedefre. According to the ancient historian Manetho, Khafra was followed by king Bikheris, but according to archaeological evidence he was instead followed by king Menkaure. Khafra was the builder of the second largest pyramid of Giza. The view held by modern Egyptology at large continues to be that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500 BC for Khafra. Not much is known about Khafra, except from the historical reports of Herodotus, writing 2,000 years after his life, who describes him as a cruel and heretical ruler who kept the Egyptian temples closed after Khufu had sealed them. Family Cartouche name Kha'afre in the Abydos King List Khafra was a son of king Khufu and the brother and successor of Djedefre. Khafra is thought by some to be the son of Queen Meritites I due to an inscription where he is said to honor her memory. > Kings-wife, his beloved, devoted to Horus, Mertitytes. King's-wife, his > beloved, Mertitytes; beloved of the Favorite of the Two Goddesses; she who > says anything whatsoever and it is done for her. Great in the favor of > Snefr[u] ; great in the favor of Khuf[u], devoted to Horus, honored under > Khafre. Merti[tyt]es.[Breasted; Ancient Records] Others argue that the inscription just suggests that this queen died during the reign of Khafre.Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, Khafre may be a son of Queen Henutsen instead.Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2006. Khafra had several wives and he had at least 12 sons and 3 or 4 daughters. * Queen Meresankh III was the daughter of Kawab and Hetepheres II and thus a niece of Khafra. She was the mother of Khafra's sons Nebemakhet, Duaenre, Niuserre and Khentetka, and a daughter named Shepsetkau. * Queen Khamerernebty I was the mother of Menkaure and his principal queen Khamerernebty II. * Hekenuhedjet was a wife of Khafra. She is mentioned in the tomb of her son Sekhemkare. * Persenet may have been a wife of Khafra based on the location of her tomb. She was the mother of Nikaure.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. Other children of Khafra are known, but no mothers have been identified. Further sons include Ankhmare, Akhre, Iunmin, and Iunre. Two more daughters named Rekhetre and Hemetre are known as well. Reign King Khafre. In √Ñgyptisches Museum Georg Steindorff, Leipzig There is no agreement on the date of his reign. Some authors say it was between 2558 BC and 2532 BC. While the Turin King List length for his reign is blank, and Manetho exaggerates his reign as 66 years, most scholars believe it was between 24 and 26 years, based upon the date of the Will of Prince Nekure which was carved on the walls of this Prince's mastaba tomb. The will is dated anonymously to the Year of the 12th Count and is assumed to belong to Khufu since Nekure was his son. Khafra's highest year date is the \\"Year of the 13th occurrence\\" which is a painted date on the back of a casing stone belonging to mastaba G 7650.Anthony Spalinger, Dated Texts of the Old Kingdom, SAK 21 (1994), p.287 This would imply a reign of 24‚Äì25 years for this king if the cattle count was biannual during the Fourth Dynasty.

Inscriptions from the entrance way have been found which mention Hathor and Bubastis. Blocks have been found showing the partial remains of an inscription with the Horus name of Khafre (Weser-ib). Mariette discovered statues of Khafre in 1860. Several were found in a well in the floor and were headless.

From the mortuary temple come fragments of maceheads inscribed with Khafre's name as well as some stone vessels. =Great Sphinx and Sphinx temple= The sphinx is said to date to the time of Khafra. This is supported by the proximity of the sphinx to Khafra's pyramid temple complex, and a certain resemblance (despite damage) to the facial structure seen in his statues. The Great Sphinx of Giza may have been carved out as a guardian of Khafra's pyramid, and as a symbol of royal power. It became deified during the time of the New Kingdom.  Khafra in ancient Greek traditions  Khafre Enthroned, a funerary statue of Khafre in diorite. Egyptian Museum in Cairo The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho called Khafra ‚ÄúS√ªphis II.‚Äù and credited him with a rulership of 66 years, but didn't make any further comments about him. The ancient Greek historians Diodorus and Herodotus instead depicted Khafra as a heretic and cruel tyrant: They were writing 2,000 years after his time that Khafra (whom they both called ‚ÄúKh√™phren‚Äù) followed his father Kh√™ops on the throne, after the megalomaniac despot had died. Then Herodotus and Diodorus say that Khafra ruled for 56 years and that the Egyptians had to suffer under him like under his father before. Since Khufu was said to have ruled for 50 years, the authors claim that the poor Egyptians had to suffer under both kings for altogether 106 years.Siegfried Morenz: Traditionen um Cheops.

But then they describe a king Menkaura (whom they call ‚ÄúMyker√Æn√≥s‚Äù) as the follower of Khafra and that this king was the counterpart of his two predecessors: Herodotus describes Menkaura as being saddened and disappointed about Khufu's and Khafra's cruelty and that Menkaura brought peace and piety back to Egypt. Modern Egyptologists evaluate Herodotus's and Diodorus's stories as some sort of defamation, based on both authors' contemporary philosophy. Oversized tombs such as the Giza pyramids must have appalled the Greeks, and even the later priests of the New Kingdom because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniacal building projects. This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khafra and his daunting pyramid. This view was possibly promoted by the fact that during Khafra's lifetime the authority to give permission for the creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and for their display in open places in public was restricted to the king only. In their eras, the Greek authors and mortuary priests and temple priests couldn't explain the impressive monuments and statues of Khafra as anything other than the result of a megalomaniacal character. These views and resulting stories were avidly snapped up by the Greek historians and so they made their also negative evaluations about Khafra, since scandalous stories were easier to sell to the public than positive (and therefore boring) tales.Aidan Dodson: Monarchs of the Nile.

In later East Semitic myths, she was said to rule Irkalla alongside her husband Nergal. Sometimes her name is given as Irkalla, similar to the way the name Hades was used in Greek mythology for both the underworld and its ruler, and sometimes it is given as Ninkigal, lit. \\"Lady of the Great Earth\\". In Sumerian myths, Ereshkigal was the only one who could pass judgment and give laws in her kingdom. The main temple dedicated to her was located in Kutha.\\"Ereshkigal\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD, 2003. In the ancient Sumerian poem Inanna's Descent to the Underworld, Ereshkigal is described as Inanna's older sister.Mark, Joshua J. \\"Inanna's Descent: A Sumerian Tale of Injustice.\\" Ancient History Encyclopedia, 23 February 2011. http://www.ancient.eu/article/215/ The two main myths involving Ereshkigal are the story of Inanna's descent into the Underworld and the story of Ereshkigal's marriage to the god Nergal. Mythology In ancient Sumerian mythology, Ereshkigal is the queen of the Underworld. She is the older sister of the goddess Inanna. Inanna and Ereshkigal represent polar opposites: Inanna is the Queen of Heaven, but Ereshkigal is the queen of Irkalla.Wolkstein, Diane, and Samuel Noah Kramer. Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer. Harper & Row, Publishers, 1983, New York. Ereshkigal plays a very prominent and important role in two particular myths. =Inanna's Descent into the Underworld= The first myth featuring Ereshkigal is described in the ancient Sumerian epic poem of \\"Inanna's Descent to the Underworld.\\" In the poem, the goddess Inanna descends into the Underworld, apparently seeking to extend her powers there. Ereshkigal is described as being Inanna's older sister. When Neti, the gatekeeper of the Underworld, informs Ereshkigal that Inanna is at the gates of the Underworld, demanding to be let in, Ereshkigal responds by ordering Neti to bolt the seven gates of the Underworld and to open each gate separately, but only after Inanna has removed one article of clothing. Inanna proceeds through each gate, removing one article of clothing at each gate. Finally, once she has gone through all seven gates she finds herself naked and powerless because she lost one of her magic items to a nymph, standing before the throne of Ereshkigal. The seven judges of the Underworld judge Inanna and declare her to be guilty. Inanna is struck dead and her dead corpse is hung on a hook in the Underworld for everyone to see. Inanna's minister, Ninshubur, however, pleads with Enki and Enki agrees to rescue Inanna from the Underworld. Enki sends two sexless beings down to the Underworld to revive Inanna with the food and water of life. The sexless beings escort Inanna up from the Underworld, but a horde of angry demons follow Inanna back up from the Underworld, demanding to take someone else down to the Underworld as Inanna's replacement. When Inanna discovers that her husband, Dumuzid, has not mourned her death, she becomes ireful towards him and orders the demons to take Dumuzid as her replacement. Another story, found in Return of the Divine Sophia, by Tricia McCannon, describes Tammuz being gored by a wild boar, shortly after being wed. Ishtar or Inanna, the goddess of heaven and earth, was so distraught without him, that she went into the depths of hell to seek and rescue her love. Ishtar willingly sacrifices all aspects of her divinity at each gate, until she had completely forgotten all aspects of her personality and identity. The only thing she could remember was that she was there to rescue Tammuz. The guards took Ishtar to Tammuz's cell, but by the time she found him, he had forgotten not only who he was, but who she was. His memory could not identify her face, and he merely recognized it from his dreams. Instead of fleeing his cage, he sat, despondent and hopeless, convinced that he was an eternal prisoner. After seeing how quickly Tammuz lost all recognition of self, Ishtar mad haste to her sister, the goddess of the underworld, to beg for the release of Tammuz. By the time she reached her sister, the only thing she knew about anything was that she still loved Tammuz. Ereshkigal, proudly gloated over her sisters misfortune. She had always been quite jealous of the light in her sisters life. When Ereshkigal refused to release Tammuz, and asked Ishtar what she would do about it, Ishtar proclaimed \\"It is better to remain on earth where love is than remain in a heaven where it is not.\\" She made a famous speech: \\"Blessed are those who love my sweet Earth, who love the clear running waters, the smell of fresh soil, the grace of the stag and the majesty of the lion. Blessed are those who can see the divine beauty in all of nature, and who know there is no separation from Heaven.\\" Once Ereshkigal and Ishtar realized this, their souls combined into one and the two realized they were the same person the entire time, with complete power to create and choose to live in any type of earth, heaven or underworld they wanted to make for themselves. Inanna's powers and memories were restored and she was reunited with Tammuz. They rejoiced in their knowledge as they continued their divine lives protecting and nurturing humanity. =Marriage to Nergal= The other myth is the story of Nergal, the plague god. Once, the gods held a banquet that Ereshkigal, as queen of the Underworld, could not come up to attend. They invited her to send a messenger, and she sent her vizier Namtar in her place. He was treated well by all, but for the exception of being disrespected by Nergal, who did not rise to him. As a result of this, Ereshkigal demanded Nergal to be sent to the underworld to alone. In a version, Nergal travels to the underworld along with 14 demons. When he arrives, the gatekeeper Neti gets orders from Ereshkigal to allow him through the seven gates, stripping him of everything until the throne room, where he would be killed. But at each gate, Nergal posts two demons. When he gets to the throne he knocks over Namtar and drags Ereshkigal to the floor. He is about to kill her with his ax when she pleads for her life, promising her as his wife and to share her power with him. He consents. However, Nergal must still leave the underworld for six months, so Ereshkigal gives him back his demons and allows him to traverse the upper world for that time, after which he returns to her. This myth shows how war is fought in season.\\"Nergal and Ereshkigal\\" in Myths from Mesopotamia, trans. S. Dalley () In later tradition, Nergal travels under the advice of Enki, who warns him not to sit, eat, drink or wash while in the underworld, as well as not to have sex with Ereshkigal. However, although respecting all the other warnings, Nergal succumbs to the temptation and lies with the goddess for six days. At the seventh, he escapes back to the upperworld, which makes Ereshkigal upset. Namtar is then sent to bring Nergal back, but Enki disguises him as a lesser god and Namtar is foiled. Ereshkigal ultimately realizes the deception and demands Nergal to return again. This time Nergal returns by himself, dethroning her violently, but they then lie again for another six days. Afterwards, Nergal is made Ereshkigal's husband. =Interpretation of myths= It is theorized that the story of Inanna's descent is told to illustrate the possibility of an escape from the Underworld, while the Nergal myth is intended to reconcile the existence of two rulers of the Underworld: a goddess and a god. The addition of Nergal also represents the harmonizing tendency to unite Ereshkigal as the queen of the Underworld with the god who, as god of war and of pestilence, brings death to the living and thus becomes the one who presides over the dead. This takes the metaphor of a love story in the later tradition.Nergal and Ereshkigal: Re-enchanting the Mesopotamian Underworld, 2000, Gateways to Babylon Related deities In some versions of the myths, Ereshkigal rules the Underworld by herself, but in other versions of the myths, Ereshkigal rules alongside a husband subordinate to her named Gugalana, who dies before the events of her sister Inanna's travel to the Underworld. In his book, Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C., the renowned scholar of ancient Sumer, Samuel Noah Kramer writes that, according to the introductory passage of the ancient Sumerian epic poem, \\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld,\\" Ereshkigal was forcibly abducted, taken down to the Underworld by the Kur, and was forced to become queen of the Underworld against her will. In order to avenge the abduction of Ereshkigal, Enki, the god of water, set out in a boat to slay the Kur. The Kur defends itself by pelting Enki with rocks of many sizes and by sending the waves beneath Enki's boat to attack Enki. The poem never actually explains who the ultimate victor of the battle is, but it is implied that Enki wins. Samuel Noah Kramer relates this myth to the ancient Greek myth of the abduction of Persephone, asserting that the Greek story is probably derived from the ancient Sumerian story.Kramer, Samuel Noah. Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.: Revised Edition. University of Pennsylvania, 1944, Philadelphia. (Pages 76-79) http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm In Sumerian mythology, Ereshkigal is the mother of the goddess Nungal. Her son with Enlil is the god Namtar. With Gugalana, her son is Ninazu. In Hittite mythology, the Sun goddess of the Earth rules as an underworld deity. Though the deity is of likely Proto-Indo-European origin (see Sun goddess of Arinna), this is an aspect thought to have been influenced by Ereshkigal.Maciej Popko: Religions of Asia Minor.

Graeco-Roman syncretic folk religion An early nineteenth century drawing of a statuette of Hecate, with whom Ereshkigal was syncretized In later times, the Greeks and Romans appear to have syncretized Ereshkigal with their own goddess Hecate.

Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate‚Äîas her dower‚Äîhad previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's Rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist‚ÄîRichard Neville, Earl of Warwick‚ÄîStafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.  Background and youth  alt=Colour diagram of Stafford's coat of arms Humphrey Stafford was born in Stafford sometime in December 1402. He was the only son of Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, and Anne of Gloucester, who was the daughter of Edward III's youngest son Thomas of Woodstock. This gave Humphrey royal descent, and made him a second cousin to the then King, Henry IV. On 21 July 1403, when Humphrey was less than a year old, his father was killed fighting for Henry IV against the rebel Henry Hotspur at the Battle of Shrewsbury. Humphrey became 6th Earl of Stafford. With the earldom came a large estate with land in more than a dozen counties. Through her previous marriage to Edmund's older brother, Thomas, she accumulated two dowries, each comprising a third of the Stafford estates. She occupied these lands for the next twenty years, and Humphrey received a reduced income of less than ¬£1,260 a year until he came of age. As his mother could not, by law, be his guardian, Humphrey became a royal ward and was put under the guardianship of Henry IV's queen, Joan of Navarre. His minority lasted for the next twenty years.  Early career  Although Stafford received a reduced inheritance, as the historian Carol Rawcliffe has put it, \\"fortunes were still to be made in the French wars\\". Stafford assumed the profession of arms. He fought with Henry V during the 1420 campaign in France and was knighted on 22 April the following year. On 31 August 1422, while campaigning, Henry V contracted dysentery and died. Stafford was present at his death and joined the entourage that returned to England with the royal corpse. When Stafford was later asked by the royal council if the King had left any final instructions regarding the governance of Normandy, he claimed that he had been too upset at the time to be able to remember. Stafford was still a minor, but parliament soon granted him livery of his father's estate, allowing him full possession. The grant was based on Stafford's claim that the King had orally promised him this before dying. The grant did not require him to pay a fee into the Exchequer, as was normal. The new King, Henry VI, was still only a baby, so the lords decided that the dead King's brothers‚ÄîJohn, Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester‚Äîwould have to be prominent in this minority government. Bedford, it was decided, would rule as regent in France, while Gloucester would be chief councillor (although not protector) in England. Stafford became a member of the new royal council on its formation. It first met in November 1422 and Stafford was to be an assiduous attender for the next three years. Gloucester repeatedly claimed the title of Protector based on his relationship to the dead King. By 1424, the rivalry between him and his uncle Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester‚Äîas de facto head of council‚Äîhad become outright conflict. Although Stafford seems to have personally favoured the interests of Gloucester in the latter's struggle for supremacy over Beaufort, Stafford attempted to be a moderating influence. For example, in October 1425, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Portuguese Duke of Coimbra and Stafford helped to negotiate an end to a burst of violence that had erupted in London between followers of the two rivals. In 1428, when Gloucester again demanded an increase in his power, Stafford was one of the councillors who personally signed a strong statement to the effect that Gloucester's position had been formulated six years earlier, would not change now, and that in any case the King would attain his majority within a few years. Stafford was also chosen by the council to inform Beaufort‚Äînow a Cardinal‚Äîthat he was to absent himself from Windsor until it was decided if he could carry out his traditional duty of Prelate to the Order of the Garter now that the Pope had promoted him.alt=2017 colour photograph of the remains of Stafford Castle Stafford was made a knight of the Order of the Garter in April 1429. The following year, he travelled to France with the King for Henry's French coronation, escorting him through the war-torn countryside. The Earl was appointed Lieutenant-General of Normandy, Governor of Paris, and Constable of France over the course of his next two years of service there. Apart from one occasion in November 1430 when he and Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter took the English army to support Philip, Duke of Burgundy, Stafford's primary military role at this time was defending Paris and its environs. He also attended the interrogation of Joan of Arc in Rouen in 1431; at some point during these proceedings, a contemporary alleged, Stafford attempted to stab her and had to be physically restrained. On 11 October 1431 the King created Stafford Count of Perche, which was a province in English-occupied Normandy; he was to hold the title until the English finally withdrew from Normandy in 1450. The county was valued at 800 marks per annum, although the historian Michael Jones has suggested that due to the war, in real terms \\"the amount of revenue that could be extracted ... must have been considerably lower\\". Since Perche was a frontier region, in a state of almost constant conflict, whatever income the estate generated was immediately re-invested in its defence. In England, the King's minority ended in 1436. In preparation for his personal rule, the council reorganised Henry's Lancastrian estates to be under the control of local magnates. This gave Stafford responsibility for much of the north Midlands, which was the largest single area of the duchy to be delegated among the nobility. This put the royal affinity‚Äîthose men retained directly by the Crown to provide a direct link between the King and the localities‚Äîat his command. = Estates = alt=Colour photograph of Brecon Castle in 2006The centrepiece of Stafford's estates, and his own caput, was Stafford Castle. Here he maintained a permanent staff of at least forty people, as well as a large stable, and it was especially well-placed for recruiting retainers in the Welsh Marches, Staffordshire, and Cheshire. He also had manor houses at Writtle and Maxstoke, which he had purchased as part of most of the estates of John, Lord Clinton. Writtle was particularly favoured by the Earl, and they were both useful when the royal court was in Coventry. Likewise, he made his base at Tonbridge Castle when he was acting as Warden of the Cinque Ports or on commission in Kent. His Marcher castles‚ÄîCaus, Hay, Huntingdon, and Bronllys‚Äîhad, by the 1450s, generally fallen into disrepair, and his other border castles, such as Brecon and Newport, he rarely used. Stafford's Thornbury manor was convenient for Bristol and was a stopping point to and from London. Stafford's mother's death in 1438 transformed his fiscal position. He now received the remainder of his father's estates‚Äîworth about ¬£1,500‚Äîand his mother's half of the de Bohun inheritance, which was worth another ¬£1,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, worth ¬£1,000 on its own; Stafford had become one of the greatest landowners in England overnight. \\"His landed resources matched his titles\\", explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland, with only the King and Richard, Duke of York wealthier. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over ¬£5,000 per annum, and K. B. McFarlane estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been ¬£6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, the actual yield may have been lower; around ¬£3,700: rents, for example, were often difficult to collect. Even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, owed Stafford over ¬£100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Stafford's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder. Further‚Äîand like most nobles of the period‚Äîhe substantially overspent, possibly, says Harriss, by as much as ¬£300 a year. His treasurer, William Wistowe, when rendering his accounts for the years 1452‚Äì1453, noted that Stafford was owed ¬£730 by his reckoning, some debts being 20 years old. Despite this, says Woolgar, \\"there [is] no suggestion that [Stafford] found it difficult to obtain cash or goods\\". = Affinity and problems in the localities = In the late medieval period, all great lords created an affinity between themselves and groups of supporters, who often lived and travelled with them for purposes of mutual benefit and defence, and Humphrey Stafford was no exception. These men were generally his estate tenants, who could be called upon when necessary for soldiering, as well as other duties, and were often retained by indenture. In the late 1440s his immediate affinity was at least ten knights and twenty-seven esquires, mainly drawn from Cheshire. By the 1450s‚Äîa period beginning with political tension and ending with civil war‚ÄîStafford retained men specifically \\"to sojourn and ride\\" with him. His affinity was probably composed along the lines laid out by royal ordinance at the time which dictated the nobility should be accompanied by no more than 240 men, including \\"forty gentlemen, eighty yeomen and a variety of lesser individuals\\", suggested T. B. Pugh, although in peacetime Stafford would have required far fewer. It was directly due to the political climate that this increased, especially after 1457. Stafford's household more generally has been estimated at around 150 people by about 1450, and it has been estimated that maintaining both his affinity and household cost him over ¬£900 a year.leftAlong with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Stafford was the major magnatial influence in Warwickshire, so when Warwick left for a lengthy tour of duty in France, in 1437, Stafford became the centre of regional power stretching from Warwickshire to Derbyshire. He was sufficiently involved in the royal court and government that he was often unable to attend to the needs of his region. This caused him local difficulties; on 5May 1430 a Leicestershire manor of Stafford's was attacked and he faced problems in Derbyshire in the 1440s, although there, Helen Castor has said, Stafford \\"made no attempt to restore peace, nor made any attempt to intervene at all\\". Stafford also had major estates on the Welsh Marches. This area was prone to regular lawlessness and particularly occupied his time as a royal justice. One of the best-known disputes Stafford had with his local gentry was in his Midlands heartlands. This was with Sir Thomas Malory. On 4 January 1450, Malory, with twenty-six other armed men, waited for Stafford near Coombe Abbey woods‚Äînear the Stafford's Newbold estate‚Äîintending to ambush him. Stafford fought back, repelling Malory's small force with sixty yeomenry. In another episode, Malory stole deer from the earl's park at Caludon. Stafford personally arrested Malory on 25 July 1451. The Earl also ended up in a dispute with William Ferrers of Staffordshire, even though the region was the centre of Stafford's authority and where he may have expected to be strongest. Ferrers had recently been appointed to the county King's Bench and attempted to assert political control over the county as a result. Following Cade's rebellion in 1450, Stafford's park at Penshurst was attacked by local men whom the historian Ralph Griffiths describes as \\"concealing their faces with long beards and charcoal-blackened faces, calling themselves servants of the queen of the fairies\\". Towards the end of the decade, not only was he unable to prevent feuding amongst the local gentry, but his own affinity was in discord. This may in part be due to the fact that at this time he was not spending much of his time in the Midlands, preferring to stay close to London and the King, dwelling either at his manors of Tonbridge or Writtle.  Later career  In July 1436, Stafford, accompanied by Gloucester, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Earls of Huntingdon, Warwick, Devon, and Ormond, returned to France again with an army of nearly 8,000 men. Although the expedition's purpose was to end the siege of Calais by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, the Burgundians had withdrawn before they arrived, leaving behind a quantity of cannon for the English to seize. Subsequent peace talks in France occupied Stafford throughout 1439, and in 1442 he was appointed Captain of Calais and the Risbanke fort, and was indented to serve for the next decade. Before his departure for Calais in September 1442, the garrison had revolted and seized the Staple's wool in lieu of unpaid wages. Stafford received a pledge from the council that if such a situation arose again during his tenure, he would not be held responsible. In light of the secrecy that cloaked Stafford's appointment in 1442, suggests David Grummitt, it is possible that the revolt had actually been staged by his servants to ensure that Stafford \\"had entry [to Calais] on favourable terms\\". Stafford himself emphasised the need to restore order there in his original application for the office. He also received another important allowance, being granted permission to export gold and jewels (up to the value of ¬£5,000 per trip) for his use in France, even though the export of bullion was illegal at the time. He served the full term of his appointment as Calais captain, leaving office in 1451. Around 1435, Stafford was granted the Honour of Tutbury, which he held until 1443. Then, says Griffiths, Buckingham proceeded to transfer it to one of his councillor's sons. Other offices he held around this time included Seneschal of Halton from 1439, and Lieutenant of the Marches from 1442 to 1451. Stafford became less active on the council around the same time. He became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover Castle and Constable of Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey, in 1450. He again represented the Crown during further peace talks with the French in 1445 and 1446. In the event, Stafford rarely visited Calais. Factional strife had continued intermittently between Beaufort and Gloucester, and Stafford‚Äîwho had also been appointed Constable of England‚Äîwas by now firmly in the Beaufort camp. In 1442, he had been on the committee that investigated and convicted Gloucester's wife, Eleanor Cobham, of witchcraft, and five years later he arrested the Duke at Bury St Edmunds on 18 February 1447 for treason. Like many others, Stafford profited substantially from Gloucester's fall: when the latter's estates were divided up, the \\"major prizes\\" went to the court nobility. In September 1444, as reward for his loyal and continuous service to the Crown, he was created Duke of Buckingham. By then he was already describing himself as \\"the Right Mighty Prince Humphrey Earl of Buckingham, Hereford, Stafford, Northampton and Perche, Lord of Brecknock and Holdernesse\\". Three years later he was granted precedence over all English dukes not of royal blood. Despite his income and titles he was consistently heavily out of pocket. Although rarely in Calais, he was responsible for ensuring the garrison was paid, and it has been estimated that when he resigned and returned from the post in 1450, he was owed over ¬£19,000 in back wages. This was such a large amount that he was granted the wool trade tax from the port of Sandwich, Kent, until it was paid off. His other public offices also forced him to spend over his annual income, and he had household costs of over ¬£2,000. He was also a substantial creditor to the government, which was perennially short of cash. With the outbreak of Jack Cade's rebellion, Buckingham summoned about seventy of his tenants from Staffordshire to accompany him while he was in London in May 1450. He was one of the lords commissioned to arrest the rebels as part of a forceful government response on 6 June 1450, and he acted as a negotiator with the insurgents at Blackheath ten days later. The promises that Buckingham made on behalf of the government were not kept, and Cade's army invaded London. After the eventual defeat of the rebellion, Buckingham headed an investigatory commission designed to pacify rebellious Kent, and in November that year he rode noisily through London‚Äîwith a retinue of around 1,500 armed men‚Äîwith the King and other peers, in a demonstration of royal authority intended to deter potential troublemakers in the future. Following the rebellion, Buckingham and his retinue often acted as a bodyguard to the King.  Wars of the Roses  In 1451, the King's favourite, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, replaced the Duke of Suffolk as the King's chief councillor, and Buckingham supported Somerset's government. At the same time, he tried to maintain peace between Somerset and York, who by now was Somerset's bitter enemy. When York rebelled in 1452 and confronted the King with a large army at Dartford, Buckingham was again a voice of compromise, and, since he had contributed heavily towards the size of the King's army, his voice was heeded. Buckingham took part in a peace commission on 14 February that month in Devon, which prevented Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon from joining York at Dartford. A year later, in August 1453, King Henry became ill, and slipped into a catatonic state; government slowly broke down. At Christmas, Buckingham personally presented the King's son‚Äîthe newly born Edward, Prince of Wales‚Äîto the King. But Henry remained unable to respond. Buckingham took part in the council meeting which resulted in the arrest and subsequent year-long imprisonment of the Duke of Somerset. In the February 1454 parliament Buckingham was appointed Steward of England, although Griffiths called this position \\"largely honorific\\". This parliament also appointed York as Protector of the Realm from 27 March 1454. Buckingham supported York's protectorate, attending York's councils more frequently than most of his fellow councillors. The King recovered his health in January 1455, and, soon after, Somerset was released‚Äîor may have escaped‚Äîfrom the Tower. A contemporary commented how Buckingham \\"straungely conveied\\" Somerset from prison, but it is uncertain whether this was as a result of the King ordering his release or whether Somerset escaped with Buckingham's connivance. Buckingham may well by now have been expecting war to break out, because the same year he ordered the purchase of 2,000 cognizances‚Äîhis personal badge of the 'Stafford knot'‚Äîeven though strictly the distribution of livery was illegal. = Battle of St Albans = Following the King's recovery, York was either dismissed from or resigned his protectorship, and together with his Neville allies, withdrew from London to their northern estates. Somerset‚Äîin charge of government once again‚Äîsummoned a Great Council to meet in Leicester on 22 May 1455. The Yorkists believed they would be arrested or attainted at this meeting. As a result, they gathered a small force and marched south. The King, with a smaller force that nonetheless included important nobles such as Somerset, Northumberland, Clifford and Buckingham and his son Humphrey, Earl of Stafford, was likewise marching from Westminster to Leicester, and in the early morning of 22 May, royal scouts reported the Yorkists as being only a few hours away. Buckingham urged that they push on to St Albans‚Äîso that the King might dine‚Äîwhich was not particularly easy to defend. Buckingham also assumed that York would want to parley before launching an assault on the King, as he had in 1452. The decision to head for the town and not make a stand straight away may have been a tactical error; the contemporary Short English Chronicle describes how the Lancastrians \\"strongly barred and arrayed for defence\\" immediately after they arrived. left The King was lodged in the town and York, with the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, encamped to the south. Negotiations commenced immediately. York demanded that Somerset be released into his custody, and the King replaced Somerset as Lord High Constable with Buckingham, making Somerset subordinate. In that capacity, Buckingham became the King's personal negotiator‚ÄîArmstrong suggests because he was well known to be able to \\"concede but not capitulate\\"‚Äîand received and responded to the Yorkists' messengers. His strategy was to play for time, both to prepare the town's defences and to await the arrival of loyalist bishops, who could be counted on to bring the moral authority of the church to bear on the Yorkists. Buckingham received at least three Yorkist embassies, but the King‚Äîor Buckingham‚Äîrefused to give in to the main Yorkist demand, that Somerset be surrendered to them. Buckingham may have hoped that repeated negotiations would deplete the Yorkists' zest for battle, and delay long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Buckingham made what John Gillingham described as an \\"insidiously tempting suggestion\\" that the Yorkists mull over the King's responses in Hatfield or Barnet overnight. Buckingham's confidence in how reasonable the Yorkists would be was misplaced. The Yorkists realised what Buckingham‚Äî\\"prevaricating with courtesy\\", says Armstrong‚Äîwas trying to do and battle commenced while negotiations were still taking place: Richard, Earl of Warwick, launched a surprise attack at around ten o'clock in the morning. Buckingham commanded the King's army of 2,500 men, although his coordination of the town's defence was problematic, giving the initiative to the Yorkists. Although the defences that Buckingham had organised successfully checked the Yorkists' initial advance, Warwick took his force through gardens and houses to attack the Lancastrians in the rear. The battle was soon over, and had lasted between half an hour and an hour with only about 50 casualties. They included senior Lancastrian captains: Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford had all been killed. Buckingham himself was wounded three times in the face by arrows‚Äîand sought sanctuary in the abbey. His son appears to have been badly wounded. A chronicler reported that some Yorkist soldiers, intent on looting, entered the abbey to kill Buckingham, but that the Duke was saved by York's personal intervention. In any case, says Harriss, Buckingham was probably captured with the King, although he was still able to reward ninety of his retainers from Kent, Sussex and Surrey. It is not known for certain whether these men had actually fought with him at St Albans; as K. B. McFarlane points out, many retinues did not arrive in time to fight.  Last years  York now had the political upper hand, made himself Constable of England and kept the King as a prisoner, returning to the role of Protector when Henry became ill again. Buckingham swore to \\"draw the lyne\\" with York, and supported his second protectorate, although losing Queen Margaret's favour as a result. A contemporary wrote that in April 1456 the Duke returned to his Writtle manor, not looking \\"well plesid\\". Buckingham played an important role at the October 1456 Great Council in Leicester. Here, with other lords, he tried to persuade the King to impose a settlement, and at the same time declared that anyone who resorted to violence would receive \\"ther deserte\\"‚Äîwhich included any who attacked York. In 1459, with other lords, he renewed his oath of loyalty to the King and Prince of Wales. Until this point he had been a voice of restraint within the King's faction. But he had been restored to the Queen's favour that year and‚Äîas she was the de facto leader of the party‚Äîhis realignment was decisive enough that it ultimately hastened the outbreak of hostilities again. Buckingham may also have been partially motivated by financial needs, and encouraged to do so by those retainers reliant on him. He had a bigger retinue than almost any other noble in England and was still the only one who could match York in power and income. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Ludford Bridge in October 1459, where his army played a decisive part in the defeat of the Yorkist forces. Following their defeat, York and the Neville earls fled Ludlow and went into exile; York to Ireland, the earls to Calais. They were attainted at the Coventry parliament later that year, and their estates distributed amongst the Crown's supporters. Buckingham was rewarded by the King with extensive grants from the estates of Sir William Oldhall, worth about ¬£800 per annum. With York in exile, Buckingham was granted custody of York's wife, Cecily, Duchess of York, whom, a chronicler reports, he treated harshly in her captivity. = Death at Northampton = alt=Map of the battle of northampton From the moment the Duke of York and the Neville earls left England it was obvious to the government that they would return; the only question was when. After a series of false alarms in early 1460, they eventually did so in June, landing at Sandwich, Kent. They immediately marched on, and entered London; the King, with Buckingham and other lords, was in Coventry, and on hearing of the earls' arrival, moved the court to Northampton. The Yorkists left London and marched to the King; they were accompanied by the Papal legate Francesco Coppini. In the lead up to the Battle of Northampton, the Earls of Warwick and March sent envoys to negotiate, but Buckingham‚Äîonce again the King's chief negotiator, and backed by his son-in-law, John Talbot and Lords Beaumont and Egremont‚Äîwas no longer conciliatory. Buckingham denied the Yorkists' envoys' repeated requests for an audience with Henry, denouncing the earls: \\"the Earl of Warwick shall not come to the King's presence and if he comes he shall die\\". Buckingham condemned the bishops who had accompanied the Yorkist army as well, telling them that they were not men of peace, but men of war, and there could now be no peace with Warwick. Personal animosity as much as political judgment was responsible for Buckingham's attitude, possibly, suggests Rawcliffe, the result of Warwick's earlier rent evasion. Buckingham's influential voice was chief among those demanding a military response to Warwick and March; the Duke may also have misinterpreted the Yorkists' requests to negotiate as a sign of weakness, seeing the coming battle as an opportunity to settle scores with Warwick. But Buckingham misjudged both the size of the Yorkist army‚Äîwhich outnumbered that of the King‚Äîand the loyalty of the Lancastrian army. Whatever plans Buckingham had, says Carol Rawcliffe, they \\"ended abruptly\\" on the battlefield. Buckingham's men dug in outside Northampton's southern walls, and fortified behind a tributary of the River Nene, close to Delapr√© Abbey. Battle was joined early on 10 July 1460. Although it was expected to be a drawn-out affair‚Äîdue to the near-impregnability of the royal position‚Äîit was shortened considerably when Lord Grey of Ruthin turned traitor to the King. Grey \\"welcomed the Yorkists over the barricades\\" on the Lancastrian wing and ordered his men to lay down arms, allowing the Yorkists access to the King's camp. Within half an hour, the battle was over. By 2:00pm, Buckingham, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Egremont and Viscount Beaumont, had all been killed by a force of Kentishmen. The Duke was buried shortly after at Grey Friars Abbey in Northampton. Buckingham had named his wife Anne sole executrix of his will. She was instructed to provide 200 marks to any clergy who attended his funeral, the remainder being distributed as poor relief. She was also to organise the establishment of two chantries in his memory, and, says Barbara Harriss, he left \\"exceedingly elaborate\\" instructions for the augmentation of Pleshy college.  Aftermath  Michael Hicks has noted that Buckingham was one of the few Lancastrian loyalists who was never accused by the Yorkists of being an \\"evil councillor\\", even though he was‚Äîin Hicks's words‚Äî\\"the substance and perhaps the steel within the ruling regime\\". Although Buckingham was not attainted when the Duke of York's son, the Earl of March, took the throne as King Edward IV in 1461, Buckingham's grandson Henry became a royal ward, which gave the King control of the Stafford estates during the young duke's minority. Henry Stafford entered into his estates in 1473 but was executed by Edward's brother Richard‚Äîby then King, and against whom Henry had rebelled‚Äîin November 1483.  Character  Humphrey Stafford has been described as something of a hothead in his youth, and later in life he was a staunch anti- Lollard. Lustig suggests that it was probably in connection to this that Sir Thomas Malory attempted his assassination around 1450‚Äîif indeed he did, as the charge was never proved. Buckingham did not lack the traits traditionally expected of the nobility in this period of the time, particularly, in dispute resolution, that of resorting to violence as a first rather than last resort. For instance, in September 1429, following an altercation with his brother-in- law the Earl of Huntingdon, he arrived at parliament fully armed. On the other hand, he was also a literary patron: Lord Scrope presented him with a copy of Christine de Pizan's Epistle of Othea, demonstrating his position as a \\"powerful and potentially powerful patron\\", and its dedicatory verse to Buckingham is particularly laudatory. On Buckingham's estates‚Äîespecially on the Welsh marches‚Äîhe has been described as a \\"harsh and exacting landlord\\" in the lengths he went to in maximising his income. He was also competent in his land deals, and seems never‚Äîunlike some contemporaries‚Äîto have had to sell land to stay solvent. B. J. Harris noted that, although he died a staunch Lancastrian, he never showed any personal dislike of York in the 1450s, and that his personal motivation throughout the decade was loyalty to the Crown and keeping the peace between his peers. Rawcliffe has suggested that although he was inevitably going to be involved in the high politics of the day, Buckingham \\"lacked the necessary qualities ever to become a great statesman or leader ... [he] was in many ways an unimaginative and unlikeable man\\". On the latter quality, Rawcliffe points to his reputation as a harsh taskmaster on his estates and his \\"offensive behaviour\\" towards Joan of Arc. Further, she says, his political judgement could be clouded by his attitude. His temper, she says, was \\"ungovernable\\".  Family  Humphrey Stafford married Lady Anne Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland and Lady Joan Beaufort (Westmorland's second wife), at some point before 18 October 1424. Anne Neville was a literary patron in her own right, also receiving a dedication in a copy of Scrope's translated Othea. On her death in 1480, she left many books in her will. Scholars generally agree that Buckingham and Anne had twelve children, consisting of seven sons and five daughters. Sources conflict over the precise details of the Staffords' progeny. The antiquarian I. W. Dunham, writing in 1907, listed them as Humphrey, Henry, John, Anne (married Aubrey de Vere), Joana (married Viscount Beaumont before 1461), Elizabeth, Margaret (born about 1435, married Robert Dinham), and Katherine (married John Talbot, the future 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, before 1467). James Tait lists the daughters as Anne, Joanna, Elizabeth, Margaret and Catherine and suggests that Elizabeth and Margaret never married. Rawcliffe gives the following as dates of birth and death for three of the daughters: Anne, 1446‚Äì1472; Joan, 1442‚Äì1484; and Katherine, 1437‚Äì1476. Edward and the twins, George and William, died young. The seventh son has gone unremarked in the sources.cognizance of the earls of Stafford and dukes of Buckingham, worn by their retainers to indicate their allegiancealt=Scanned drawing of the stafford knotleft The marriages Buckingham arranged for his children were structured around strengthening his ties to the Lancastrian royal family. Of particular importance were the marriages of two of his sons, Humphrey and Henry. They married into the Beaufort family, which was descended from the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt and thus of royal blood. There was also, about 1450, discussion regarding a proposal for one of Buckingham's daughters to marry the Dauphin of France (subsequently Louis XI). Had it proceeded, it would have again linked the French Crown with the Lancastrian regime. Buckingham's eldest son, Humphrey, married Margaret Beaufort. She was the daughter of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Eleanor Beauchamp. Margaret and Humphrey's son was Buckingham's eventual heir. A second link to the Beaufort family was between Buckingham's second son, Sir Henry Stafford (c. 1425‚Äì1471), who became the third husband of Lady Margaret Beaufort, daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Margaret Beauchamp. Margaret Beaufort had previously been married to Edmund Tudor, the eldest half-brother of Henry VI, and had given birth to the future King Henry VII two months after Edmund's death. She and Henry were childless. Buckingham's third surviving son, John (died 8 May 1473) married Constance Green of Drayton, who had previously been the duke's ward. Humphrey Stafford assigned them the manor of Newton Blossomville at the time of their marriage. John was created Earl of Wiltshire in 1470. Buckingham arranged good but costly marriages for three of his daughters. Anne married Aubrey de Vere, son of John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Their 1452 marriage cost Buckingham 2,300 marks; he was slow to pay, and still owed Oxford over ¬£440 seven years later. In 1452, Joan married William Beaumont, heir of Viscount Beaumont. Katherine married John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, six years later. Buckingham had apparently promised to give them ¬£1,000 but died before acting on the promise.  Cultural references and portrayals  Buckingham was depicted, during his son's lifetime, \\"mounted in battle array\\"‚Äîshowing him during the 1436 campaign against Burgundy‚Äîin the pictorial genealogy, the Beauchamp Pageant. Timothy J. Lustig has suggested that Thomas Malory, in his Morte d'Arthur, based his character Gawaine on Buckingham. Lustig suggests that Malory may have viewed the Duke as being \\"peacemaker and warlord, warrior and judge\\"‚Äîqualities which the writer also ascribed to his Arthurian character. Buckingham appears in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 2 (c. 1591), in which his character conspires in the downfall and disgrace of Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester. According to Martin Wiggins of the Shakespeare Institute, Buckingham may be the eponymous character of the early-17th-century play, Duke Humphrey, which is now lost. However, the lost play could instead have been about the equally eventful career of Prince Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1390‚Äì1447), the youngest son of Henry IV of England.

Facing directly from West to East, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx is generally believed to represent the pharaoh Khafre. Cut from the bedrock, the original shape of the Sphinx has been restored with layers of blocks. It measures long from paw to tail, high from the base to the top of the head and wide at its rear haunches. It is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and is commonly believed to have been designed, sculpted, and constructed by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of the pharaoh Khafre ().Dunford, Jane; Fletcher, Joann; French, Carole (ed., 2007). Egypt: Eyewitness Travel Guide . London: Dorling Kindersley, 2007. .  Construction  The Sphinx is a monolith carved into the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and windblown sand), leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinx's body. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The body of the lion up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration. The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder. A number of \\"dead-end\\" shafts are known to exist within and below the body of the Great Sphinx, most likely dug by treasure hunters and tomb robbers. Prior to 1925, a large gaping shaft similar to these existed on the top of the Sphinx's head. It is believed to have possibly been an anchoring point for a sculpted crown or headdress added during the period of the New Kingdom.  Origin and identity  Views, Objects: Egypt. Gizeh [selected images]. View 06: Sphinx and Pyramid., n.d. Brooklyn Museum Archives The Great Sphinx is one of the world's largest and oldest statues, but some basic facts about it, such as when it was built, by whom and for what purpose, are still subject to debate. = Names = It is impossible to identify what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity Hor-em-akhet (; ; Hellenized: Harmachis), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401‚Äì1391 or 1397‚Äì1388 BC) specifically referred to it as such in his Dream Stele.Bryan, Betsy M. (1991) The Reign of Thutmose IV. The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 145‚Äì146 The commonly used name \\"Sphinx\\" was given to it in classical antiquity, about 2000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with a lion's body, a woman's head and the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings). The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek Œ£œÜŒØŒ≥Œæ (transliterated: ) apparently from the verb œÉœÜŒØŒ≥Œ≥œâ (transliterated: / ), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle. Medieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, call the Sphinx balhib and bilhaw, which suggest a Coptic influence. The modern Egyptian Arabic name is ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸáŸàŸÑ ( ºabu alh≈çl /  ºabu alhawl , \\"The Terrifying One\\"; literally \\"Father of Dread\\"). = Builder and timeframe = Though there have been conflicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern Egyptology at large remains that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500 BC for the pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza. Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, summed up the problem: The circumstantial evidence mentioned by Hassan includes the Sphinx's location in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafre.Lehner, Mark (Spring 2002). \\"Giza As Is:Unfinished Business Reveals the Human Hand\\" in Aeragram, 5:2 (Spring 2002), 10‚Äì14. Retrieved 2008. Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple, both of which display similar design of their inner courts. The Sphinx Temple was built using blocks cut from the Sphinx enclosure, while those of the Valley Temple were quarried from the plateau, some of the largest weighing upwards of 100 tons. A diorite statue of Khafre, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafre theory. The Dream Stele, erected much later by the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401‚Äì1391 or 1397‚Äì1388 BC), associates the Sphinx with Khafre. When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete, and only referred to Khaf, not Khafre. An extract was translated: Egyptologist Thomas Young, finding the Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafra's name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed. = Dissenting hypotheses = The Great Sphinx partly under the sand, ca. 1870s French archaeologist Auguste Mariette (seated, far left) and Emperor Pedro II of Brazil (seated, far right) with others in front of the Sphinx, 1871 The Great Sphinx partially excavated, ca. 1878 The Spinx circa 1880s, by Beniamino Facchinelli Theories held by academic Egyptologists regarding the builder of the Sphinx and the date of its construction are not universally accepted, and various persons have proposed alternative hypotheses about both the builder and the dating.  Early Egyptologists  Some early Egyptologists and excavators of the Giza pyramid complex believed the Great Sphinx and associated temples to predate the Fourth Dynasty rule of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Flinders Petrie wrote in 1883 regarding the state of opinion regarding the age of the nearby temples, and by extension the Sphinx: \\"The date of the Granite Temple [Valley Temple] has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point\\".The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, Flinders Petrie London 1883, p133 In 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated to be from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, c. 664‚Äì525 BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence,Hawass, Zahi. (The Khufu at The Plateau. Retrieved 2009. this passage is widely dismissed as Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancient history it never had. Such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priests' domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations. Gaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. He concluded that because the Dream Stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line 13, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors‚Äîpossibly Fourth Dynasty, . English Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge agreed that the Sphinx predated Khafre's reign, writing in The Gods of the Egyptians (1914): \\"This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren, and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [].\\" Maspero believed the Sphinx to be \\"the most ancient monument in Egypt\\".The Sphinx Its History in the Light of Recent Excavations, Selim Hassan Government Press Cairo 1949, p17  Modern dissenting hypotheses  Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the nemes (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh Khufu (2589‚Äì2566 BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafra's father. He supports this by suggesting Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre- existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx. Colin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway. Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.

In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known pharaoh Djedefre (2528‚Äì2520 BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.Riddle of the Sphinx Retrieved 2010. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time.Fleming, Nic (2004-12-14). \\"I have solved riddle of the Sphinx, says Frenchman\\" in The Daily Telegraph.

Aired 2000-12-14. is based on the proposed exact correlation of the three pyramids at Giza with the three stars Zeta Orionis, Epsilon Orionis and Delta Orionis, the stars forming Orion's Belt, in the relative positions occupied by these stars in 10,500 BC. The authors argue that the geographic relationship of the Sphinx, the Giza pyramids and the Nile directly corresponds with Leo, Orion and the Milky Way respectively. Sometimes cited as an example of pseudoarchaeology, the theory is at variance with mainstream scholarship.  Water erosion hypothesis  Vertical weathering on the body of the Sphinx The Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends that the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall, and must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafra. The hypothesis was championed by Ren√© Schwaller de Lubicz (1887‚Äì1961), who studied Egyptology while living in Egypt for 12 years, and by Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University, as well as by John Anthony West, an author and alternative Egyptologist. Colin Reader, a British geologist, studied the erosion patterns and noticed that they are found predominantly on the western enclosure wall and not on the Sphinx itself. He proposed the rainfall water runoff hypothesis, which also recognizes climate change transitions in the area.White, Chris \\"The Age of the Sphinx? Reader versus Schoch,\\" http://ancientaliensdebunked.com/how-old-is- the-sphinx-colin-reader-vs-robert-schoch/  The Great Sphinx as Anubis  Author Robert K. G. Temple proposes that the Sphinx was originally a statue of the jackal god Anubis, the God of the Necropolis, and that its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple bases his identification on the style of the eye make-up and style of the pleats on the headdress.Robert K. G. Temple, The Sphinx Mystery: The Forgotten Origins of The Sanctuary of Anubis (Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions, 2009).  Racial characteristics  Over the years several authors have commented on what they perceive as \\"Negroid\\" characteristics in the face of the Sphinx. This issue has become part of the Ancient Egyptian race controversy, with respect to the ancient population as a whole.Irwin, Graham W. (1977). Africans abroad, Columbia University Press, p. 11  Hidden chambers  There is a long history of speculation about hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx, by esoteric figures such as H. Spencer Lewis. Edgar Cayce specifically predicted in the 1930s that a \\"Hall of Records\\", containing knowledge from Atlantis, would be discovered under the Sphinx in 1998. His prediction fueled much of the fringe speculation that surrounded the Sphinx in the 1990s, which lost momentum when the hall was not found when predicted.  Restoration  At some unknown time the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and drifting sand eventually buried the Sphinx up to its shoulders. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to , when the young Thutmose IV (1401‚Äì1391 or 1397‚Äì1388 BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he placed a granite slab, known as the Dream Stele, inscribed with the following excerpt: Later, Ramesses II the Great (1279‚Äì1213 BC) may have undertaken a second excavation. Mark Lehner, an Egyptologist who has excavated and mapped the Giza plateau, originally asserted that there had been a far earlier renovation during the Old Kingdom (c. 2686‚Äì2184 BC), although he has subsequently recanted this viewpoint. In AD 1817 the first modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinx's chest completely. One of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eug√®ne Gr√©baut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service. In 1931, engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck.Popular Science Monthly, July 1931, page 56. This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered profile. Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s, and then redone in the 1990s.  Missing nose and beard  The Sphinx in profile in 2010 The one-metre-wide nose on the face is missing. Examination of the Sphinx's face shows that long rods or chisels were hammered into the nose, one down from the bridge and one beneath the nostril, then used to pry the nose off towards the south. Mark Lehner, who performed an archaeological study, concluded that it was broken with instruments at an unknown time between the 3rd and 10th centuries AD. Christiane Zivie-Coche ‚ÄúSphinx: History of a Monument‚Äù p. 16 Drawings of the Sphinx by Frederic Louis Norden in 1757 showed the nose missing. Many folk tales exist regarding the destruction of its nose. One tale erroneously attributes it to cannon balls fired by the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Other tales ascribe it to being the work of Mamluks. Since the 10th century some Arab authors have claimed it to be a result of iconoclastic attacks. The Arab historian al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, writing in the 15th century, attributes the loss of the nose to Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr, a Sufi Muslim from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada in AD 1378, who found the local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and therefore defaced the Sphinx in an act of iconoclasm. According to al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, many people living in the area believed that the increased sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahr's act of defacement.The Wonders of the Ancients: Arab-Islamic Representations of Ancient Egypt, Mark Fraser Pettigrew, page 201, University of California, Berkeley Ibn Qadi Shuhba mentions his name as Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tibrizi al-Masri, who died in 1384. He attributed the desecration of the sphinxes of Qanatir al- Siba built by the sultan Baybars to him, and also said he might have desecrated the Great Sphinx. Al-Minufi stated that the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was divine punishment for a Sufi sheikh of the khanqah of Sa'id breaking off the nose.Okasha El Daly \\"Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings\\", Routledge p. 89 Limestone fragments of the Sphinx's beard in the British Museum, 14th Century BC. In addition to the lost nose, a ceremonial pharaonic beard is thought to have been attached, although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling. The lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition. Residues of red pigment are visible on areas of the Sphinx's face. Traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest that the monument \\"was once decked out in gaudy comic book colors\\".  Mythology  Colin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was the focus of solar worship in the Early Dynastic Period, before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the Old Kingdom ().Reader, Colin (2000-03-17). Further considerations on the Age of the Sphinx at Rational Spirituality. Retrieved 2009. He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates the Fourth Dynasty (). The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god Hor-em-akhet (Hellenized: Harmachis) or \\"Horus-at-the-Horizon\\". Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427‚Äì1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of Hor-em-akhet.Stadelmann, Rainer (2001). \\"Giza\\". In Redford, Donald B. (ed), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt. Volume II, p. 29 Some ancient non-Egyptians saw it as a likeliness of the god Horon. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The Sabians of Harran saw it as the burial place of Hermes Trismegistus. Arab authors described the Sphinx as a talisman which guarded the area from the desert.Okasha El Daly \\"Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings\\", Routledge p. 88 Al-Maqrizi describes it as the \\"talisman of the Nile\\" on which the locals believed the flood cycle depended. Muhammad al-Idrisi stated that those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument. Reception In the last 700 years, there has been a proliferation of travellers and reports from Lower Egypt, unlike Upper Egypt, which was seldom reported from prior to the mid-18th century. Alexandria, Rosetta, Damietta, Cairo and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively. Many accounts were published and widely read. These include those of George Sandys, Andr√© Th√©vet, Athanasius Kircher, Balthasar de Monconys, Jean de Th√©venot, John Greaves, Johann Michael Vansleb, Beno√Æt de Maillet, Cornelis de Bruijn, Paul Lucas, Richard Pococke, Frederic Louis Norden and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, Wilhelm von Boldensele, Pierre Belon du Mans, Vincent Stochove, Christophe Harant, Gilles Fermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, Joos van Ghistele, etc. Over the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by John Lawson Stoddard: From the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breast of a woman. Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Beno√Æt de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844). Most early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, Andr√© Th√©vet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as \\"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Th√©vet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while Fran√ßois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz's Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar. Richard Pococke's Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous. The print versions of Norden's careful drawings for his Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie, 1755 are the first to clearly show that the nose was missing. However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others. =Legacy= The Mystery of the Sphinx, narrated by Charlton Heston, a documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West, was shown as an NBC Special on 10 November 1993. A 95-minute DVD, Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition, was released in 2007. Age of the Sphinx, a BBC Two Timewatch documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In 2008, the film 10,000 BC showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lion's head. Before this film, this lion head theory had been published in documentary films about the origin of the Sphinx.

These are distributed among nine geyser basins, with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the Park. The number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows: Upper Geyser Basin (410), Midway Geyser Basin (59), Lower Geyser Basin (283), Norris Geyser Basin (193), West Thumb Geyser Basin (84), Gibbon Geyser Basin (24), Lone Star Geyser Basin (21), Shoshone Geyser Basin (107), Heart Lake Geyser Basin (69), other areas (33). Although famous large geysers like Old Faithful are part of the total, most of Yellowstone's geysers are small, erupting to only a foot or two. The hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera.Windows into the Earth, page 73 Many of the thermal features in Yellowstone build up sinter, geyserite, or travertine deposits around and within them. The various geyser basins are located where rainwater and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt at the surface as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are where most of the large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199 ¬∞F (93 ¬∞C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world's tallest geyser).Windows into the Earth, page 79 Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204 ¬∞F (95.5 ¬∞C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls into hot springs. Prehistoric Native American artifacts have been found at Mammoth Hot Springs and other geothermal areas in Yellowstone. Some accounts state that the early people used hot water from the geothermal features for bathing and cooking. In the 19th century Father Pierre-Jean De Smet reported that natives he interviewed thought that geyser eruptions were \\"the result of combat between the infernal spirits\\".Windows into the Earth, page 70 The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled north of the Yellowstone area in 1806. Local natives that they came upon seldom dared to enter what we now know is the caldera because of frequent loud noises that sounded like thunder and the belief that the spirits that possessed the area did not like human intrusion into their realm.Windows into the Earth, page 71 The first white man known to travel into the caldera and see the geothermal features was John Colter, who had left the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He described what he saw as \\"hot spring brimstone\\". Beaver trapper Joseph Meek recounted in 1830 that the steam rising from the various geyser basins reminded him of smoke coming from industrial smokestacks on a cold winter morning in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the 1850s famed trapper Jim Bridger called it \\"the place where Hell bubbled up\\". Types of features found in the park The heat that drives geothermal activity in the Yellowstone area comes from brine (salty water) that is below the surface. This is actually below the solid volcanic rock and sediment that extends to a depth of 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m) and is inside the hot but mostly solid part of the pluton that contains Yellowstone's magma chamber.Windows into the Earth\\", page 69 At that depth the brine is superheated to temperatures that exceed but is able to remain a liquid because it is under great pressure (like a huge pressure cooker).Yellowstone Resources and Issues: 2006, page 41 Convection of the churning brine and conduction from surrounding rock transfers heat to an overlaying layer of fresh groundwater. Movement of the two liquids is facilitated by the highly fractured and porous nature of the rocks under the Yellowstone Plateau. Some silica is dissolved from the fractured rhyolite into the hot water as it travels through the fractured rock. Part of this hard mineral is later redeposited on the walls of the cracks and fissures to make a nearly pressure-tight system. Silica precipitates at the surface to form either geyserite or sinter, creating the massive geyser cones, the scalloped edges of hot springs, and the seemingly barren landscape of geyser basins. There are at least five types of geothermal features found at Yellowstone: * Fumaroles: Fumaroles, or steam vents, are the hottest hydrothermal features in the park. They have so little water that it all flashes into steam before reaching the surface. At places like Roaring Mountain, the result is loud hissing of steam and gases. * Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are a type of geothermal feature that periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases the pressure of the system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser's recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system's pressure and eventually ending the eruption. * Hot springs: Hot springs such as Grand Prismatic Spring are the most common hydrothermal features in the park. Their plumbing has no constrictions. Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below. This circulation, called convection, prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption. Many hot springs give rise to streams of heated water. * Mudpots: Mudpots such as Fountain Paint Pots are acidic hot springs with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell), which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They convert the gas into sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock into clay. * Travertine terraces: Travertine terraces, found at Mammoth Hot Springs, are formed from limestone (a rock type made of calcium carbonate). Thermal waters rise through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved carbonate. Carbon dioxide is released at the surface and calcium carbonate deposited as travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. These features constantly and quickly change due to the rapid rate of deposition. Geyser basins =Norris Geyser Basin= Porcelain Basin at Norris Geyser Basin Norris Geyser Basin The Norris Geyser Basin is the hottest geyser basin in the parkNorris Geyser Basin Tour and is located near the northwest edge of Yellowstone Caldera near Norris Junction and on the intersection of three major faults. The Norris-Mammoth Corridor is a fault that runs from Norris north through Mammoth to the Gardiner, Montana, area. The Hebgen Lake fault runs from northwest of West Yellowstone, Montana, to Norris. This fault experienced an earthquake in 1959 that measured 7.4 on the Richter scale (sources vary on exact magnitude between 7.1 and 7.8; see 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake). Norris Geyser Basin is so hot and dynamic because these two faults intersect with the ring fracture zone that resulted from the creation of the Yellowstone Caldera of 640,000 years ago.Geological Overview of the Norris Area Cistern Spring in the Back Basin. The Basin consists of three main areas: Porcelain Basin, Back Basin, and One Hundred Springs Plain. Unlike most of other geyser basins in the park, the waters from Norris are acidicNatural Highlights of the Norris Area rather than alkaline (for example, Echinus Geyser has a pH of ~3.5). The difference in pH allows for a different class of bacterial thermophiles to live at Norris, creating different color patterns in and around the Norris Basin waters. The Ragged Hills that lie between Back Basin and One Hundred Springs Plain are thermally altered glacial kames. As glaciers receded the underlying thermal features began to express themselves once again, melting remnants of the ice and causing masses of debris to be dumped. These debris piles were then altered by steam and hot water flowing through them. Madison lies within the eroded stream channels cut through lava flows formed after the caldera eruption. The Gibbon Falls lies on the caldera boundary as does Virginia Cascades. Algae on left bacteria on right at the intersection of flows from the Constant & Whirlgig Geysers at Norris Geyser Basin The tallest active geyser in the world, Steamboat Geyser, is located in Norris Basin. Unlike the slightly smaller but much more famous Old Faithful Geyser located in Upper Geyser Basin, Steamboat has an erratic and lengthy timetable between major eruptions. During major eruptions, which may be separated by intervals of more than a year (the longest recorded span between major eruptions was 50 years), Steamboat erupts over 300 feet (90 m) into the air. Steamboat does not lie dormant between eruptions, instead displaying minor eruptions of approximately 40 feet (12 m). Norris Geyser Basin periodically undergoes a large-scale, basin-wide thermal disturbance lasting a few weeks. Water levels fluctuate, and temperatures, pH, colors, and eruptive patterns change throughout the basin. During a disturbance in 1985, Porkchop Geyser continually jetted steam and water; in 1989, the same geyser apparently clogged with silica and blew up, throwing rocks more than . In 2003 a park ranger observed it bubbling heavily, the first such activity seen since 1991. Activity increased dramatically in mid-2003. Because of high ground temperatures and new features beside the trail much of Back Basin was closed until October. In 2004 the boardwalk was routed around the dangerous area and now leads behind Porkchop Geyser.For the whole paragraph: Yellowstone Resources and Issues: 2006, pages 190‚Äì191 Overview of Artists' Paintpots. North of Norris, Roaring Mountain is a large, acidic hydrothermal area (solfatara) with many fumaroles. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the number, size, and power of the fumaroles were much greater than today. The fumaroles are most easily seen in the cooler, low-light conditions of morning and evening. Artists' Paintpots is a small hydrothermal area south of Norris Junction that includes colorful hot springs and two large mudpots. =Monument Geyser Basin= The Monument Geyser Basin has no active geysers, but its 'monuments' are siliceous sinter deposits similar to the siliceous spires discovered on the floor of Yellowstone Lake. Scientists hypothesize that this basin's structures formed from a hot water system in a glacially dammed lake during the waning stages of the Pinedale Glaciation. The basin is on a ridge reached by a very steep one- mile (1.6 km) trail south of Artists' Paint Pots. =Upper Geyser Basin= Sawmill and Grand geysers erupting South of Norris along the rim of the caldera is the Upper Geyser Basin , which has the highest concentration of geothermal features in the park. This complement of features includes the most famous geyser in the park, Old Faithful Geyser, as well as four other predictable large geysers. One of these large geysers in the area is Castle Geyser which is about northwest of Old Faithful. Castle Geyser has an interval of approximately 13 hours between major eruptions, but is unpredictable after minor eruptions. The other three predictable geysers are Grand Geyser, Daisy Geyser, and Riverside Geyser. Biscuit Basin and Black Sand Basin are also within the boundaries of Upper Geyser Basin. The hills surrounding Old Faithful and the Upper Geyser Basin are reminders of Quaternary rhyolitic lava flows. These flows, occurring long after the catastrophic eruption of 640,000 years ago, flowed across the landscape like stiff mounds of bread dough due to their high silica content. Black Opal Pool at Biscuit Basin Blue Star Spring near Old Faithful Geyser Evidence of glacial activity is common, and it is one of the keys that allows geysers to exist. Glacier till deposits underlie the geyser basins providing storage areas for the water used in eruptions. Many landforms, such as Porcupine Hills north of Fountain Flats, are made up of glacial gravel and are reminders that 70,000 to 14,000 years ago, this area was buried under ice.Yellowstone Resources and Issues, 2006, page 193 Signs of the forces of erosion can be seen everywhere, from runoff channels carved across the sinter in the geyser basins to the drainage created by the Firehole River. Mountain building is evident on the drive south of Old Faithful, toward Craig Pass. Here the Rocky Mountains reach a height of 8,262 feet (2,518 m), dividing the country into two distinct watersheds.Geological Overview of the Old Faithful Area =Midway Geyser Basin= 200px Midway Geyser Basin is much smaller than the other basins found alongside the Firehole River. Despite its small size, it contains two large features, the Excelsior Geyser which pours over per minute into the Firehole River. The largest hot spring in Yellowstone, the and Grand Prismatic Spring is found here.Yellowstone Resources and Issues, 2006, page 194 Also in the basin is Turquoise Pool and Opal Pool. =Lower Geyser Basin= Silex Spring at Fountain Paint Pot Farther north is the Lower Geyser Basin , which is the largest geyser basin in area, covering approximately 11 square miles. Due to its large size, it has a much less concentrated set of geothermal features, including Fountain Paint Pots. Fountain Paint Pots are mud pots, that is, a hot spring that contains boiling mud instead of water. The mud is produced by a higher acidity in the water which enables the spring to dissolve surrounding minerals to create an opaque, usually grey, mud. Also there is Firehole Spring, Celestine Pool, Leather Pool, Red Spouter, Jelly spring, and a number of fumaroles. Geysers in Lower Geyser Basin include Great Fountain Geyser, whose eruptions reach in the air, while waves of water cascade down its sinter terraces., the Fountain group of Geysers (Clepsydra Geyser which erupts nearly continuously to heights of ., Fountain Geyser, Jelly Geyser, Jet Geyser, Morning Geyser, and Spasm Geyser), the Pink Cone group of geysers. ( Dilemma Geyser, Labial Geyser, Narcissus Geyser, Pink Geyser, and Pink Cone Geyser), the White Dome group of geysers( Crack Geyser, Gemini Geyser, Pebble Geyser, Rejuvenated Geyser, and White Dome Geyser), as well as Sizzler Geyser =West Thumb Geyser Basin= West Thumb Geyser Basin Overflow areas of Silex springs The West Thumb Geyser Basin , including Potts Basin to the north, is the largest geyser basin on the shores of Yellowstone Lake. The heat source of the thermal features in this location is thought to be relatively close to the surface, only 10,000 feet (3,000 m) down. West Thumb is about the same size as another famous volcanic caldera, Crater Lake in Oregon, but much smaller than the great Yellowstone Caldera which last erupted about 640,000 years ago. West Thumb is a caldera within a caldera. West Thumb was created approximately 162,000 years ago when a magma chamber bulged up under the surface of the earth and subsequently cracked it along ring fracture zones. This in turn released the enclosed magma as lava and caused the surface above the emptied magma chamber to collapse.Yellowstone Resources and Issues: 2006, page 198 Water later filled the collapsed area of the caldera, forming an extension of Yellowstone Lake. This created the source of heat and water that feed the West Thumb Geyser Basin today. Geyser cone under water at West Thumb Geyser Basin The thermal features at West Thumb are not only found on the lake shore, but extend under the surface of the lake as well. Several underwater hydrothermal features were discovered in the early 1990s and can be seen as slick spots or slight bulges in the summer. During the winter, the underwater thermal features are visible as melt holes in the icy surface of the lake. The surrounding ice can reach three feet (one yard) in thickness.Geological Overview of the Grant Village & West Thumb Areas Perhaps the most famous hydrothermal feature at West Thumb is a geyser on the lake shore known as Fishing Cone. Walter Trumbull of the 1870 Washburn- Langford-Doane Expedition described a unique event while a man was fishing adjacent to the cone: \\"...in swinging a trout ashore, it accidentally got off the hook and fell into the spring. For a moment it darted about with wonderful rapidity, as if seeking an outlet. Then it came to the top, dead, and literally boiled.\\" Fishing Cone erupted frequently to the height of 40 feet (12 m) in 1919 and to lesser heights in 1939. One fisherman was badly burned in Fishing Cone in 1921. Fishing at the geyser is now prohibited.For the whole paragraph: Yellowstone Resources and Issues: 2006, page 199 Early visitors would arrive at West Thumb via stagecoach from the Old Faithful area. They had a choice of continuing on the stagecoach or boarding the steamship Zillah to continue the journey by water to Lake Hotel. The boat dock was located near the south end of the geyser basin near Lakeside Spring. =Backcountry Geyser Basins= The Gibbon , Heart Lake , Lone Star , and Shoshone Geyser Basins are located away from the heavily traveled portions of the park. Some require several miles of off-trail hiking to reach. These areas also generally lack the boardwalks and other safety features of the developed areas. As falling into geothermal features can be fatal, it is usually advisable to visit these areas with an experienced guide or at the very least, travelers need to ensure they remain on well marked trails. Lying in the Snake River watershed east of Lewis Lake and south of Yellowstone Lake, Heart Lake was named sometime before 1871 for Hart Hunney, a hunter. Other explorers in the region incorrectly assumed that the lake's name was spelled 'heart' because of its shape. The Heart Lake Geyser Basin begins a couple miles from the lake and descends along Witch Creek to the lakeshore. Five groups of hydrothermal features comprise the basin, and all of them contain geysers, although some are dormant. The Shoshone Geyser Basin, reached by hiking or by boat, contains one of the highest concentrations of geysers in the world ‚Äì more than 80 in an area .Yellowstone Resources and Issues, 2006, page 200 Hot springs and mudpots dot the landscape between the geyser basin and Shoshone Lake. Hot Spring Basin is located 15 miles (24 km) north-northeast of Fishing Bridge and has one of Yellowstone's largest collections of hot springs and fumaroles.For the whole paragraph, except where noted: Windows into the Earth, page 73, paragraph 5 The geothermal features there release large amounts of sulfur. This makes water from the springs so acidic that it has dissolved holes in the pants of people who sit on wet ground and causes mounds of sulfur three feet (1 m) high to develop around fumaroles. The very hot acidic water and steam have also created voids in the ground that are only covered by a thin crust. =Mammoth Hot Springs= Dead trees at Mammoth Hot Springs Mammoth Hot Springs is a large complex of hot springs on a hill of travertine in Yellowstone National Park adjacent to Fort Yellowstone and the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. It was created over thousands of years as hot water from the spring cooled and deposited calcium carbonate (over two tons flow into Mammoth each day in a solution). Because of the huge amount of geothermal vents, travertine flourishes. Although these springs lie outside the caldera boundary, their energy has been attributed to the same magmatic system that fuels other Yellowstone geothermal areas. =Mud Volcano and Sulfur cauldron= Churning cauldron Dragon's Mouth Spring The thermal features at Mud Volcano and Sulfur cauldron are primarily mud pots and fumaroles because the area is situated on a perched water system with little water available. Fumaroles or \\"steam vents\\" occur when the ground water boils away faster than it can be recharged. Also, the vapors are rich in sulfuric acid that leaches the rock, breaking it down into clay. Because no water washes away the acid or leached rock, it remains as sticky clay to form a mud pot. Hydrogen sulfide gas is present deep in the earth at Mud Volcano. As this gas combines with water and the sulfur is metabolized by cyanobacteria, a solution of sulfuric acid is formed that dissolves the surface soils to create pools and cones of clay and mud. Along with hydrogen sulfide, steam, carbon dioxide, and other gases explode through the layers of mud. A series of shallow earthquakes associated with the volcanic activity in Yellowstone struck this area in 1978. Soil temperatures increased to nearly 200 ¬∞F (93 ¬∞C). The slope between Sizzling Basin and Mud Geyser, once covered with green grass and trees, became a barren landscape of fallen trees known as \\"the cooking hillside\\".

Algae living in the warm pools have tinted the travertine shades of brown, orange, red, and green. Elk on travertine terraces, Mammoth Hot Springs Thermal activity here is extensive both over time and distance. The thermal flows show much variability with some variations taking place over periods ranging from decades to days. Terrace Mountain at Mammoth Hot Springs is the largest known carbonate- depositing spring in the world. The most famous feature at the springs is the Minerva Terrace, a series of travertine terraces. The terraces have been deposited by the spring over many years but, due to recent minor earthquake activity, the spring vent has shifted, rendering the terraces dry. Mineral deposition, Mammoth Hot Springs Travertine Terrace The Mammoth Terraces extend all the way from the hillside, across the Parade Ground, and down to Boiling River. The Mammoth Hotel, as well as all of Fort Yellowstone, is built upon an old terrace formation known as Hotel Terrace. There was some concern when construction began in 1891 on the fort site that the hollow ground would not support the weight of the buildings. Several large sink holes (fenced off) can be seen out on the Parade Ground. This area has been thermally active for several thousand years. Stereo card view of Cleopatra's Terrace by T.W. Ingersoll The Mammoth area exhibits much evidence of glacial activity from the Pinedale Glaciation. The summit of Terrace Mountain is covered with glacial till, thereby dating the travertine formation there to earlier than the end of the Pinedale Glaciation. Several thermal kames, including Capitol Hill and Dude Hill, are major features of the Mammoth Village area.

Based on textual evidence, it was located in the Persian Gulf, on a trade route between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley Civilisation, close to the sea and to artesian springs. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast.Roads of Arabia p.180 Dilmun encompassed Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the eastern portion regions of Saudi Arabia. This area is certainly what is meant by references to \\"Dilmun\\" among the lands conquered by King Sargon of Akkad and his descendants. The great commercial and trading connections between Mesopotamia and Dilmun were strong and profound to the point where Dilmun was a central figure to the Sumerian creation myth.The Arab world: an illustrated history p.4 Dilmun was described in the saga of Enki and Ninhursag as pre-existing in paradisiacal state, where predators don't kill, pain and diseases are absent, and people do not get old. Dilmun was an important trading centre. At the height of its power, it controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. According to some modern theories, the Sumerians regarded Dilmun as a sacred place,, page 230 but that is never stated in any known ancient text. Dilmun was mentioned by the Mesopotamians as a trade partner, a source of copper, and a trade entrep√¥t. The Sumerian tale of the garden paradise of Dilmun may have been an inspiration for the Garden of Eden story. History Receipt for garments sent by boat to Dilmun in the 1st year of Ibbi-Sin's rule, circa 2028 BCE. British Museum BM 130462.Transcription: Dilmun was an important trading center from the late fourth millennium to 800 BC. At the height of its power, Dilmun controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. Dilmun was very prosperous during the first 300 years of the second millennium. Dilmun's commercial power began to decline between 1000 BC and 800 BC because piracy flourished in the Persian Gulf. In 600 BC, the Neo- Babylonian Empire, and later the Persian Empire, ruled Dilmun. The Dilmun civilization was the centre of commercial activities linking traditional agriculture of the land‚Äîthen utterly fertile due to artesian wells that have dried since, and due to a much wetter climate‚Äîwith maritime trade between diverse regions such as the Meluhha (suspected to be Indus Valley Civilisation), Magan (Oman), and Mesopotamia. The Dilmun civilization is mentioned first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the late third millennium BC, found in the temple of goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk. The adjective Dilmun is used to describe a type of axe and one specific official; in addition there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun. One of the earliest inscriptions mentioning Dilmun is that of king Ur- Nanshe of Lagash (c. 2300 BC) found in a door-socket: \\"The ships of Dilmun brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands.\\" = Kingdom of Dilmun = Bull's head, made of copper in the early period of Dilmun (ca. 2000 BC), discovered by Danish archeologists under Barbar Temple, Bahrain. From about 2050 BC onward Dilmun seems to had its heyday. Qal'at al-Bahrain was most likely the capital. From texts found at Isin it becomes clear that Dilmun became an independent kingdom. Royal gifts to Dilmun are mentioned. Contacts with the Syrian city Mari are attested. In about this time the largest royal burial mounds were erected.Steffen Terp Laursen (2017)Àê The Royal Mounds of A'ali in Bahrain, Aarhus, , pp. 381 From about 1780 BC come several inscriptions on stone vessels naming two kings of Dilmun. King Yagli-El and his father Rimum. The inscriptions were found in huge tumuli evidently the burial places of these kings. Rimum was already known to archaeology from the Durand Stone, discovered in 1879.Steffen Terp Laursen: Kings of Dilmun identified by name; Kings of Dilmun identified by name and announced in a press conference held by BACA From about 1720 BC a decline is visible. Many settlements were no longer used and the building of royal mounts stopped. The Barbar Temple felt into ruins.Steffen Terp Laursen (2017)Àê The Royal Mounds of A'ali in Bahrain, Aarhus, , pp. 388-390 From about 1650 BC there is recovering period detectable. New royal burial mounts were built and at Qal'at al-Bahrain there is evidence for increased building activity. To this period belongs a further inscription on a seal found at Failaka and preserving a king's name. The short text readsÀê [La]'√π-la Panipa, daughter of Sumu-lƒõl, the servant of Inzak of Akarum. Sumu-lƒõl was evidently a third king of Dilmun belonging to about this period. Servant of Inzak of Akarum was the king's title in Dilmun. The names of these rulers are Amoritic.Gianni MarchesiÀê Inscriptions from the Royal Mounds of A'alo (Bahrain) and related Texts, inÀê Steffen Terp LaursenÀê The Royal Mounds of A'ali in Bahrain, Aarhus 2017, , pp. 428-430 = Dilmun under foreign rule = Correspondence between Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra, the governor of Dilmun, and Enlil-kidinni, the governor of Nippur, ca. 1350 BC It seems that Dilmun was after 1500 BC under the rule of the Sealand Dynasty. The Sealand- Dynasty king Ea-gamil is mentioned in a text found at Qal'at al-Bahrain. Ea- gamil was the last ruler of the Sealand Dynasty. After his reign Dilmun came under the rule of the Babylonian Kassite dynasty, as they also took over the Sealand Dynasty area.Steffen Terp Laursen (2017)Àê The Royal Mounds of A'ali in Bahrain, Aarhus, , pp. 390 Dilmun was mentioned in two letters dated to the reign of Burna-Buriash II (c. 1370 BC) recovered from Nippur, during the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. These letters were from a provincial official, Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra, in Dilmun to his friend Enlil-kidinni, the governor of Nippur. The names referred to are Akkadian. These letters and other documents, hint at an administrative relationship between Dilmun and Babylon at that time. Following the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, Mesopotamian documents make no mention of Dilmun with the exception of Assyrian inscriptions dated to 1250 BC which proclaimed the Assyrian king to be king of Dilmun and Meluhha, as well as Lower Sea and Upper Sea. Assyrian inscriptions recorded tribute from Dilmun. There are other Assyrian inscriptions during the first millennium BC indicating Assyrian sovereignty over Dilmun. One of the early sites discovered in Bahrain suggests that Sennacherib, king of Assyria (707‚Äì681 BC), attacked northeast Arabia and captured the Bahraini islands. The most recent reference to Dilmun came during the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Neo-Babylonian administrative records, dated 567 BC, stated that Dilmun was controlled by the king of Babylon. The name of Dilmun fell from use after the collapse of Babylon in 538 BC. The \\"Persian Gulf\\" types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun, that appear at Lothal in Gujarat, India, and Failaka, as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known: timber and precious woods, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, and luxury goods such as carnelian and glazed stone beads, pearls from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for silver, tin, woolen textiles, olive oil and grains. Copper ingots from Oman and bitumen which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were in fact identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia. In regard to copper mining and smelting, the Umm al-Nar Culture and Dalma in the United Arab Emirates, and Ibri in Oman were particularly important. Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports, but by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade. The Bahrain National Museum assesses that its \\"Golden Age\\" lasted ca. 2200‚Äì1600 BC. Discoveries of ruins under the Persian Gulf may be of Dilmun. The UK Register, Science, Lost ancient civilisation's ruins lie beneath Gulf, By Lewis Page Science, December 9, 2010 People, language and religion The population was Semitic with an Amorite presence; they used the Sumerian cuneiform, and spoke a language that was either an Akkadian dialect, close to it or greatly influenced by it. Dilmun's main deity was named Inzak and his spouse was Panipa. Mythology Dilmun stamp seal with hunters and goats, rectangular pen, ca early 2nd millennium BC In the early epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the main events, which center on Enmerkar's construction of the ziggurats in Uruk and Eridu, are described as taking place at a time \\"before Dilmun had yet been settled\\". Dilmun, sometimes described as \\"the place where the sun rises\\" and \\"the Land of the Living\\", is the scene of some versions of the Sumerian creation myth, and the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, Utnapishtim (Ziusudra), was taken by the gods to live forever. Thorkild Jacobsen's translation of the Eridu Genesis calls it \\"Mount Dilmun\\" which he locates as a \\"faraway, half-mythical place\\". Dilmun is also described in the epic story of Enki and Ninhursag as the site at which the Creation occurred. The later Babylonian Enuma Elish, speaks of the creation site as the place where the mixture of salt water, personified as Tiamat met and mingled with the fresh water of Abzu. Bahrain in Arabic means \\"the twin waters\\", where the fresh water of the Arabian aquifer mingles with the salt waters of the Persian Gulf. The promise of Enki to Ninhursag, the Earth Mother: > For Dilmun, the land of my lady's heart, I will create long waterways, > rivers and canals, whereby water will flow to quench the thirst of all > beings and bring abundance to all that lives. Ninlil, the Sumerian goddess of air and south wind had her home in Dilmun. However, it is also speculated that Gilgamesh had to pass through Mount Mashu to reach Dilmun in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is usually identified with the whole of the parallel Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, with the narrow gap between these mountains constituting the tunnel. Location Ruins of a settlement, believed to be from the Dilmun civilization, in Sar, Bahrain Location of burial mounds in Bahrain In 1987, Theresa Howard-Carter proposed that Dilmun of this era might be a still unidentified tell near the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab in Arabic) between modern-day Qurnah and Basra in modern-day Iraq. In favor of Howard-Carter's proposal, it has been noted that this area does lie to the east of Sumer (\\"where the sun rises\\"), and the riverbank where Dilmun's maidens would have been accosted aligns with the Shat al-Arab which is in the midst of marshes. The \\"mouth of the rivers\\" where Dilmun was said to lie is for her the union of the Tigris and Euphrates at Qurnah. As of 2008, archaeologists have failed to find a site in existence during the time from 3300 BC (Uruk IV) to 556 BC (Neo-Babylonian Era), when Dilmun appears in texts. According to Hojlund, no settlements exist in the Gulf littoral dating to 3300‚Äì2000 BC. =Garden of Eden theory= In 1922, Eduard Glaser proposed that the Garden of Eden was located in Eastern Arabia within the Dilmun civilization. Scholar Juris Zarins also believes that the Garden of Eden was situated in Dilmun at the head of the Persian Gulf, where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run into the sea, from his research on this area using information from many different sources, including Landsat images from space. In this theory, the Bible's Gihon would correspond with the Karun in Iran, and the Pishon River would correspond to the Wadi Batin river system that once drained the now dry, but once quite fertile central part of the Arabian Peninsula. Known rulers Only a few rulers of the Dilmun kingdom are known:Legrain, 1922; Cameron, 1936; The Cambridge History of Iran; Hinz, 1972; The Cambridge Ancient History; Majidzadeh, 1991; Majidzadeh, 1997. # Ziusudra (27th century BC) # Rimun (c. 1780 BC) # Yagli-El, son of Rimun # Sumu-lƒõl (c. 1650 BC) # Usiananuri, grandfather of Uballissu-Marduk (precise dates unknown) # Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra (contemporary with Burnaburiash II and Kurigalzu II) # Operi (c. 710 BC) # Hundaru I (c. 650 BC) # Qena (c. 680‚Äìc. 670 BC) # Hundaru II (706‚Äì685 BC) See also * Dilmun Burial Mounds * Gerrha * History of Bahrain * DHL International Aviation ME, a cargo airline using ‚ÄúDilmun‚Äù as radio call sign * Bahrain National Museum * Gilgamesh * Uruk References External links *Indus Valley‚ÄîMesopotamian trade passing through Dilmun *Lost ancient civilisation's ruins lie beneath Gulf, says boffin *Bahrain National Museum's hall of Dilmun *Dilmun Site Al-Khidr, Failaka Island, State of Kuwait *Greek inscriptions found on Bahrein (a pdf-file) *Dilmun Calendar Theory Backed, Gulf Daily News, 11 July 2006 Sumer Bronze Age Asia History of Bahrain History of Kuwait Persian Gulf Archaeological sites in Bahrain Tiamat ","title":"Dilmun"},{"id":"245181","text":"Travertine terraces at Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park, in 2016 Calcium-carbonate-encrusted, growing moss in a low-temperature freshwater travertine formation (coin for scale) Travertine ( ) is a form of limestone deposited by mineral springs, especially hot springs. Travertine often has a fibrous or concentric appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and even rusty varieties. It is formed by a process of rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate, often at the mouth of a hot spring or in a limestone cave. In the latter, it can form stalactites, stalagmites, and other speleothems. It is frequently used in Italy and elsewhere as a building material. Travertine is a terrestrial sedimentary rock, formed by the precipitation of carbonate minerals from solution in ground and surface waters, or geothermally heated hot-springs.Dictionary of Geological Terms, 1962. A Dolphin Reference BookA Glossary of Karst Terminology, 1970. Geol. Surv. Water-Supply Paper 1899-K, U. S. Gov. Print. Off., Washington. Similar (but softer and extremely porous) deposits formed from ambient-temperature water are known as tufa. Etymology The word 'travertine' is derived from the Italian travertino, itself a derivation of the Latin tiburtinus 'of Tibur'. Its namesake is also the origin of Tivoli, a district near Rome. Geochemistry Modern travertine is formed from geothermally heated supersaturated alkaline waters, with raised pCO2 (see partial pressure). On emergence, waters degas CO2 due to the lower atmospheric pCO2, resulting in an increase in pH. Since carbonate solubility decreases with increased pH,Bialkowski, S.E. 2004. Use of Acid Distributions in Solubility Problems. precipitation is induced. Precipitation may be enhanced by factors leading to a reduction in pCO2, for example increased air- water interactions at waterfalls may be important,Zhang, D., Y. Zhang, A. Zhu and X. Cheng, 2001, Physical mechanisms of river waterfall tufa (travertine) formation, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 71, pp. 205‚Äì216 as may photosynthesis.Riding, R., 2000, Microbial carbonates: the geological record of calcified bacterial-algal mats and biofilms, Sedimentology, 47, pp. 179‚Äì214 Precipitation may also be enhanced by evaporation in some springs. Both calcite and aragonite are found in hot spring travertines; aragonite is preferentially precipitated when temperatures are hot, while calcite dominates when temperatures are cooler.Pentecost, A., 2005, Travertine, Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers Group. Fouke, B. W., et al., 2000, Depositional facies and aqueous-solid geochemistry of travertine-depositing hot springs (Angel Terrace, Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park, U.S.A.), Journal of Sedimentary Research, 70, pp. 565‚Äì585. When pure and fine, travertine is white, but often it is brown to yellow due to impurities. Travertine may precipitate out directly onto rock and other inert materials as in Pamukkale or Mammoth Hot Springs for example. Occurrence Badab-e Surt's stepped travertine terrace formations. This travertine owes its red color terraces to iron carbonate. Mausoleum submerged in a travertine pool at Hierapolis hot springs, Turkey In Italy, well-known travertine quarries exist in Tivoli and Guidonia Montecelio, where the most important quarries since Ancient Roman times can be found. The Guidonia quarry has major historic value, as it was one of the quarries where Gian Lorenzo Bernini selected material from which to build the famous Colonnade of St. Peter's Square in Rome (colonnato di Piazza S. Pietro) in 1656‚Äì1667. Michelangelo also chose travertine as the material for the external ribs of the dome of St Peter's Basilica.Stone, Irving. The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1961. Travertine derives its name from the former town, known as Tibur in ancient Roman times. The ancient name for the stone was lapis tiburtinus, meaning tibur stone, which was gradually corrupted to travertino (travertine). Detailed studies of the Tivoli and Guidonia travertine deposits revealed diurnal and annual rhythmic banding and laminae, which have potential use in geochronology.Folk, R. L., et al.; (1985) Bizarre forms of depositional and diagenetic calcite in hot spring travertines, in Carbonate Cements: SEPM Special Pub. 36 Cascades of natural lakes formed behind travertine dams can be seen in Pamukkale, Turkey, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other places with such cascades include Huanglong in Sichuan Province of China (another UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Mammoth Hot Springs in the US, Egerszal√≥k in Hungary, Mahallat, Abbass Abad, Atash Kooh, and Badab-e Surt in Iran, Band-i-Amir in Afghanistan, Lagunas de Ruidera, Spain, Hierve el Agua, Oaxaca, Mexico and Semuc Champey, Guatemala. In Central Europe's last post-glacial palaeoclimatic optimum (Atlantic Period, 8000‚Äì5000 BC), huge deposits of tufa formed from karst springs. Important geotopes are found at the Swabian Alb, mainly in valleys at the foremost northwest ridge of the cuesta; in many valleys of the eroded periphery of the karstic Franconian Jura; at the northern Alpine foothills; and the northern Karst Alps. On a smaller scale, these karst processes are still working. Travertine has been an important building material since the Middle Ages. Travertine has formed sixteen huge, natural dams in a valley in Croatia known as Plitvice Lakes National Park. Clinging to moss and rocks in the water, the travertine has built up over several millennia to form waterfalls up to in height.\\"Land Of The Falling Lakes\\" , Nature, PBS In the U.S., the most well-known place for travertine formation is Yellowstone National Park, where the geothermal areas are rich in travertine deposits. Wyoming also has travertines in Hot Springs State Park in Thermopolis. Oklahoma has two parks dedicated to this natural wonder. Turner Falls, the tallest waterfall in Oklahoma, is a cascade of spring water flowing over a travertine cave. Honey Creek feeds this waterfall and creates miles of travertine shelves both up and downstream. Many small waterfalls upstream in the dense woods repeat the travertine-formation effect. The city of Davis now owns thousands of acres of this land and has made it a tourist attraction. Another travertine resource is in Sulphur, Oklahoma, east of Turner Falls. Travertine Creek flows through a spring-water nature preserve within the boundaries of the Chickasaw National Recreation Area. In Texas, the city of Austin and its surrounding \\"Hill Country\\" to the south is built on limestone. The area has many travertine formations, such as those found at Gorman Falls within Colorado Bend State Park, the nature preserve known as Hamilton Pool, the West Cave Preserve, and Krause Springs in Spicewood. Hanging Lake in Glenwood Canyon in Colorado has travertine deposits and aqua blue water. Rifle Falls State Park in Colorado features a triple waterfall over a travertine dam. In Arizona, on the south side of the Grand Canyon there is the Havasupai Reservation. Flowing through it is Havasu Creek, which has extensive travertine deposits. Three major waterfalls, Navajo Falls, Havasu Falls, and Mooney Falls, are all located downstream from the town of Supai. There are numerous smaller cataracts formed by travertine dams. These features are located about from Supai Village (on the floor of the canyon), and are accessible by foot or horseback. In Iceland, the Hvann√° river, located at the north flank of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, was heavily charged with CO2 following the 2010 eruptions. Travertine precipitated along the river.Olsson, J., et al.; (2014) in Chem. Geol. 384, p. 135 By 2014, CO2 concentration in the river has decreased and travertine has started to dissolve. However, in places, where the river changed its bed, travertine covered rocks can still be seen. In North East Sulawesi, Indonesia is the Wawolesea Karst. A notable feature of this area is a pond several meters from the beach, formed by a salty, hot water fountain extant since the Neogene period. Uses Travertine is often used as a building material. The Romans mined deposits of travertine for building temples, aqueducts, monuments, bath complexes, and amphitheaters such as the Colosseum, the largest building in the world constructed mostly of travertine. The Shroud of Turin, when examined by Joseph Kohlbeck from the Hercules Aerospace Company in Utah and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute, was found to contain particles of travertine aragonite limestone. Travertine regained popularity as a building material in the Middle Ages. The central German town of Bad Langensalza has an extant medieval old town built almost entirely of local travertine. 20th Century buildings using travertine extensively include the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica in Paris, the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and Shell-Haus in Berlin. The travertine used in the Getty Center and Shell-Haus constructions was imported from Tivoli and Guidonia.\\"The Getty Center\\" , Official Website Travertine is one of several natural stones that are used for paving patios and garden paths. It is sometimes known as travertine limestone or travertine marble; these are the same stone, although travertine is classified properly as a type of limestone, not marble. The stone is characterised by pitted holes and troughs in its surface. Although these troughs occur naturally, they suggest signs of considerable wear and tear over time. It can also be polished to a smooth, shiny finish, and comes in a variety of colors from grey to coral-red. Travertine is most commonly available in tile sizes for floor installations. Travertine is one of the most frequently used stones in modern architecture. It is commonly used for fa√ßades, wall cladding, and flooring. The lobby walls of the modernist Willis Tower (1970) (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago are made of travertine.\\"The Willis Tower\\" , Official Website Architect Welton Becket frequently incorporated travertine into many of his projects. The first floor of the Becket-designed UCLA Medical Center has thick travertine walls. Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe used travertine in several of his major works, including the Toronto-Dominion Centre, S.R. Crown Hall, the Farnsworth House and the Barcelona Pavilion.

Chernobog (Latin: Zcerneboch, lit. \\"Black God\\", reconstructed as *ƒå—årnobog—ä, from *ƒç—årn—ä (\\"black\\") + *bog—ä (\\"god\\")) is the name of the alleged god of bad fate worshipped by the Polabian Slavs. First mentioned by Helmold in the Chronica Slavorum. The authenticity of the cult of the Chernobog, as well as of the Belebog reproduced by analogy to him, is controversial in the scientific community. Nevertheless, Chernobog is one of the most popular Slavic gods in the world.  Sources  = Chronica Slavorum = The German monk and chronicler Helmold, who accompanied the Christianization missions against the Elbe Slavs, describes in his Chronicle of the Slavs the cult of Chernobog: = Later sources = The next sources that speak of Chernobog and/or Bialobog appear only in the 16th century. Around 1530, a Dominican monk from Pirna, Johan Lindner, recalls the gods in his compilation. Although he lived in or near the Lusatian region, he probably only used written sources and monastic stories, and not field research, which quickly made his work unbelievable by many historicians, including Georg Fabricius and Petrus Albinus. They believed that although his sources were numerous and varied, he used them uncritically. At the end of the 17th century, also mentioned the Chernobog in his list of the Lusatian gods. This information is also considered unbelievable because it came into being late, when the Lusatian paganism was probably completely extinct and about half of the gods he mentioned are of Prussian origin. In 1538, the Pomeranian chronicler Thomas Kantzow in his Chronicle of Pomerania wrote: Then Sebastian M√ºnster, in Cosmographiae universalis of 1550, describes the harvest ritual associated with Svetovit and continues: \\"In general they (the Rugians) worshipped two gods, namely Belbuck and Zernebuck, as if a white and a black god, a good and an evil genius, God and Satan, as the source of good and evil, according to the error of the Manichaeans\\". The works of Kantzov and M√ºnster are probably independent of each other (various forms of recording the name of the Belebog, the Chronicle of Pomerania was first published, but it was not published until the 19th century), but they use a common source, which, according to Miroslava Znayenko, could be the archive of the Abbey of , where the Belebog was forged. Daniel Cramer, a theologian and professor from Szczecin, probably held in his hands a copy of a chronicle from this archive or saw a quote from it, because in his Pommerisches Kirchen-Chronicon he probably paraphrased a part of it: Chernobog also appears in the anonymous History of Caminensis as the god of the Vandals, which is based on a piece by M√ºnster (both works speak of the \\"error of the Manichaeans\\"). Chernobog also appears in other, later, minor texts.  Interpretations  There is no consensus among researchers on the authenticity of the cult of Chernobog and Belebog. Some researchers believe that both gods are Helmod's invention, some assume the possibility of the existence of these gods, some assume that Chernobog and Belebog are nicknames for other gods. According to Aleksander Gieysztor and Andrzej Szyjewski, Chernobog is rather a hypostasis of evil, a renamed chart, bies (demons), or a bad dola. Some authors attempted to prove the cult of the Chernobog by means of the names of the mountains of Czorneboh and Bieleboh in Upper Lusatia, where the gods were supposed to be worshipped, but the names were most likely created in modern times because of the popularity of the gods in the culture of the region. When considering the authenticity of the god, the names of the villages that are supposed to refer to the Chernobog, e.g. the village of ƒåernobo≈æ‚Äôe in Russia or the village of ƒåernobo≈æna in Ukraine, as well as the neighboring villages ƒåern√≠kovice and in the Czech Republic are also mentioned as arguments. Henryk ≈Åowmi≈Ñski recognized that the Chernoglav, mentioned in the Icelandic Kn√Ωtlinga saga, is the \\"cemetery transformation of the Chernobog\\". Yaroslav Gorbachov believes that the third credible potential source (after the Chronica Slavorum and the Kn√Ωtlinga saga) is Al-Masudi's The Meadows of Gold, but he is not sure about the credibility of this work. It describes a idol on the Black Mountain temple with black animals and people with black skin:  Chernobog in popular culture  Chernabog and Maleficent. Modest Mussorgsky: Night on Bald Mountain.

Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome. The smallest single base deletion mutations occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site. Deletions can be caused by errors in chromosomal crossover during meiosis, which causes several serious genetic diseases. Deletions that do not occur in multiples of three bases can cause a frameshift by changing the 3-nucleotide protein reading frame of the genetic sequence. Deletions are representative of eukaryotic organisms, including humans and not in prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria. Causes Causes include the following: * Losses from translocation * Chromosomal crossovers within a chromosomal inversion * Unequal crossing over * Breaking without rejoining For synapsis to occur between a chromosome with a large intercalary deficiency and a normal complete homolog, the unpaired region of the normal homolog must loop out of the linear structure into a deletion or compensation loop. Types Types of deletion include the following: *Terminal deletion ‚Äì a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome. *Intercalary deletion/interstitial addition ‚Äì a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome. *Microdeletion ‚Äì a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5Mb that could include a dozen genes). Micro-deletion is usually found in children with physical abnormalities. A large amount of deletion would result in immediate abortion (miscarriage). Effects Small deletions are less likely to be fatal; large deletions are usually fatal ‚Äì there are always variations based on which genes are lost. Some medium-sized deletions lead to recognizable human disorders, e.g. Williams syndrome. Deletion of a number of pairs that is not evenly divisible by three will lead to a frameshift mutation, causing all of the codons occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during translation, producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional protein. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an in-frame deletion.LSDB ‚Äî Controlled vocabulary terms at The GEN2PHEN Knowledge Centre. Posted Fri, 08/01/2010. Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male infertility, two thirds of cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and two thirds of cases of cystic fibrosis (those caused by ŒîF508). Deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5 results in Cri du chat syndrome. Deletions in the SMN-encoding gene cause spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of infant death. Recent work suggests that some deletions of highly conserved sequences (CONDELs) may be responsible for the evolutionary differences present among closely related species. Such deletions in humans are referred to as hCONDELs may be responsible for the anatomical and behavioral differences between humans, chimpanzees and other varieties of mammals like ape or monkeys. Detection The introduction of molecular techniques in conjunction with classical cytogenetic methods has in recent years greatly improved the diagnostic potential for chromosomal abnormalities. In particular, microarray- comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) based on the use of BAC clones promises a sensitive strategy for the detection of DNA copy-number changes on a genome-wide scale. The resolution of detection could be as high as >30,000 \\"bands\\" and the size of chromosomal deletion detected could as small as 5‚Äì20 kb in length. Other computation methods were selected to discover DNA sequencing deletion errors such as end-sequence profiling.

The identity of Menes is the subject of ongoing debate, although mainstream Egyptological consensus identifies Menes with the Naqada III ruler Narmer (most likely) or First Dynasty pharaoh Hor-Aha. Both pharaohs are credited with the unification of Egypt to different degrees by various authorities.  Name and identity  The Egyptian form, mnj, is taken from the Turin and Abydos King Lists, which are dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty, whose pronunciation has been reconstructed as . By the early New Kingdom, changes in the Egyptian language meant his name was already pronounced . The name mnj means \\"He who endures\\", which, I.E.S. Edwards (1971) suggests, may have been coined as \\"a mere descriptive epithet denoting a semi-legendary hero [...] whose name had been lost\\". Rather than a particular person, the name may conceal collectively the Naqada III rulers: Ka, Scorpion II and Narmer. The commonly-used name Menes derives from Manetho, an Egyptian historian and priest who lived during the pre-Coptic period of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Manetho noted the name in Greek as ŒúŒÆŒΩŒ∑œÇ (transliterated: M√™n√™s).Manetho, Fr. 6, 7a, 7b. Text and translation in Manetho, translated by W.G. Waddell (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1940), pp.26-35 An alternative Greek form, ŒúŒπŒΩ (transliterated: Min), was cited by the fifth-century-BC historian Herodotus,Herodotus: 2.4.1, 2.99.1ff. but is a variant no longer accepted; it appears to have been the result of contamination from the name of the god Min. = Narmer and Menes = Two Horus names of Hor-Aha (left) and a name of Menes (right) in hieroglyphs. The almost complete absence of any mention of Menes in the archaeological record and the comparative wealth of evidence of Narmer, a protodynastic figure credited by posterity and in the archaeological record with a firm claim to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, has given rise to a theory identifying Menes with Narmer. The chief archaeological reference to Menes is an ivory label from Nagada which shows the royal Horus-name Aha (the pharaoh Hor-Aha) next to a building, within which is the royal nebty-name mn, generally taken to be Menes. From this, various theories on the nature of the building (a funerary booth or a shrine), the meaning of the word mn (a name or the verb endures) and the relationship between Hor-Aha and Menes (as one person or as successive pharaohs) have arisen. The Turin and Abydos king lists, generally accepted to be correct, list the nesu-bit-names of the pharaohs, not their Horus-names, and are vital to the potential reconciliation of the various records: the nesu-bit-names of the king lists, the Horus-names of the archaeological record and the number of pharaohs in Dynasty I according to Manetho and other historical sources. Flinders Petrie first attempted this task, associating Iti with Djer as the third pharaoh of Dynasty I, Teti (Turin) (or another Iti (Abydos)) with Hor-Aha as second pharaoh, and Menes (a nebty-name) with Narmer (a Horus-name) as first pharaoh of Dynasty I. Lloyd (1994) finds this succession \\"extremely probable\\", and Cervell√≥-Autuori (2003) categorically states that \\"Menes is Narmer and the First Dynasty begins with him\\". However, Seidlmayer (2004) states that it is \\"a fairly safe inference\\" that Menes was Hor-Aha.  Dates  Egyptologists, archaeologists, and scholars from the 19th century have proposed different dates for the era of Menes, or the date of the first dynasty: * John Gardner Wilkinson (1835) ‚Äì 2320 BC * Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion (1840) ‚Äì 5867 BC * August B√∂ckh (1845) ‚Äì 5702 BC * Christian Charles Josias Bunsen (1848) ‚Äì 3623 BC * Reginald Stuart Poole (1851) ‚Äì 2717 BC * Karl Richard Lepsius (1856) ‚Äì 3892 BC * Heinrich Karl Brugsch (1859) ‚Äì 4455 BC * Franz Joseph Lauth (1869) ‚Äì 4157 BC * Auguste Mariette (1871) ‚Äì 5004 BC * James Strong (1878) ‚Äì 2515 BC * Flinders Petrie (1887) ‚Äì 4777 BC Modern consensus dates the era of Menes or the start of the first dynasty between c. 3200‚Äì3030 BC; some academic literature uses c. 3000 BC.  History  By 500 BC, mythical and exaggerated claims had made Menes a culture hero, and most of what is known of him comes from a much later time. Ancient tradition ascribed to Menes the honour of having united Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom and becoming the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty. However, his name does not appear on extant pieces of the Royal Annals (Cairo Stone and Palermo Stone), which is a now-fragmentary king's list that was carved onto a stela during the Fifth Dynasty. He typically appears in later sources as the first human ruler of Egypt, directly inheriting the throne from the god Horus. He also appears in other, much later, king's lists, always as the first human pharaoh of Egypt. Menes also appears in demotic novels of the Hellenistic period, demonstrating that, even that late, he was regarded as an important figure. Menes was seen as a founding figure for much of the history of ancient Egypt, similar to Romulus in ancient Rome. Manetho records that Menes \\"led the army across the frontier and won great glory\\". = Capital = Manetho associates the city of Thinis with the Early Dynastic Period and, in particular, Menes, a \\"Thinite\\" or native of Thinis. Herodotus contradicts Manetho in stating that Menes founded the city of Memphis as his capitalHerodotus: 2.99.4. after diverting the course of the Nile through the construction of a levee.Herodotus: 2.109 Manetho ascribes the building of Memphis to Menes' son, Athothis, and calls no pharaohs earlier than Third Dynasty \\"Memphite\\". Herodotus and Manetho's stories of the foundation of Memphis are probably later inventions: in 2012 a relief mentioning the visit to Memphis by Iry-Hor‚Äîa predynastic ruler of Upper Egypt reigning before Narmer‚Äîwas discovered in the Sinai Peninsula, indicating that the city was already in existence in the early 32nd century BC.P. Tallet, D. Laisnay: Iry- Hor et Narmer au Sud-Sina√Ø (Ouadi 'Ameyra), un compl√©ment √† la chronologie des exp√©ditios mini√®re √©gyptiene, in: BIFAO 112 (2012), 381-395, available online = Cultural influence = Labels from the tomb of Menes Diodorus Siculus stated that Menes had introduced the worship of the gods and the practice of sacrifice as well as a more elegant and luxurious style of living. For this latter invention, Menes' memory was dishonoured by the Twenty-fourth Dynasty pharaoh Tefnakht and Plutarch mentions a pillar at Thebes on which was inscribed an imprecation against Menes as the introducer of luxury. In Pliny's account, Menes was credited with being the inventor of writing in Egypt. = Crocodile episode = Diodorus Siculus recorded a story of Menes related by the priests of the crocodile god Sobek at Crocodilopolis, in which the pharaoh Menes, attacked by his own dogs while out hunting, fled across Lake Moeris on the back of a crocodile and, in thanks, founded the city of Crocodilopolis.Diodorus: 45 George Stanley Faber (1816), taking the word campsa to mean either crocodile or ark and preferring the latter, identifies Menes with Noah and the entire story as a flood myth. Gaston Maspero (1910), while acknowledging the possibility that traditions relating to other kings may have become mixed up with this story, dismisses the suggestions of some commentators that the story should be transferred to the Twelfth Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III and sees no reason to doubt that Diodorus did not correctly record a tradition of Menes. Later, Edwards (1974) states that \\"the legend, which is obviously filled with anachronisms, is patently devoid of historical value\\". = Death = According to Manetho, Menes reigned for 62 years and was killed by a hippopotamus.  In popular culture  Alexander Dow (1735/6‚Äì79), a Scottish orientalist and playwright, wrote the tragedy Sethona, set in ancient Egypt. The lead part of Menes is described in the dramatis person√¶ as \\"next male-heir to the crown\\" now worn by Seraphis, and was played by Samuel Reddish in a 1774 production by David Garrick at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

The temple is better called the Lord's Enclosure (i.e. shrine), the traditional name among the Mongols, as it has never truly contained the khan's body. It is the main centre of the worship of Genghis Khan, a growing practice in the Mongolian shamanism of both Inner Mongolia, where the temple is located, and Mongolia. The temple is located in the Kandehuo Enclosure in the town of Xinjie, in the Ejin Horo Banner in the Ordos Prefecture of Inner Mongolia, in China. The main hall is actually a cenotaph where the coffin contains no body (only headdresses and accessories), because the actual tomb of Genghis Khan has never been discovered. The present structure was built between 1954 and 1956 by the government of the PRC in the traditional Mongol style. It was desecrated and its relics destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but it was restored with replicas in the 1980s and remains the center of Genghis Khan worship. It was named a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction by China's National Tourism Administration in 2011. Location In 1995 The cenotaph is located at an elevation of on the Gandeli or Gande'er Prairie about southeast of Xilian and about south of the county seat of Ejin Horo Banner, Inner Mongolia. It is the namesake of its surrounding banner, whose name translates from Mongolian as \\"the Lord's Enclosure\\". The site is north of Yulin; south of Dongsheng; and from Baotou. There is a new interchange on highway 210 leading directly to the site.  History  =Early sites= Stralenberg's 18th- century map of \\"Great Tartary\\", showing \\"Karakoschun, or, the Tomb of the Great and Famous Genghis Khan\\" in the southern \\"Ordus\\". After Genghis Khan died in or around Gansu on 12 July 1227, his remains were supposedly carried back to central Mongolia and buried secretly and without markings, in accordance with his personal directions. His actual burial site remains unknown but was almost certainly not in Ejin Horo, which had only recently been conquered from the Tangut Empire. Without a body, the Mongols honored the khan's memory and spirit through his personal effects. These ceremonies allegedly date to the same year as his death. Kublai Khan built temples for his grandfather's cult in Daidu and Shangdu. Nine \\"palaces\\" for rituals concerning his cult were maintained by an imperial official in Karakorum.. After the fall of the Yuan in 1368, these permanent structures were replaced by portable mausoleums called the \\"eight white yurts\\" (naiman tsagaan ger). These had originally been palaces where the khan had lived, but were altered to mausoleums by √ñgedei Khan. These yurts were first encamped at Avraga site at the base of the Khentii Mountains in Delgerkhaan in Mongolia's Khentii Province. =Ordos= 's 1897 photograph of the mausoleum Bonin's photograph of some Darkhad guardians at the mausoleum the same year The shrine was entrusted to caretakers known as the Darkhad. Their leader was chosen from the Borjigin clan and was known as the Jinong since the first, Kamala, had been appointed King of Jin. The Darkhad moved from the Kherlen River to the Ordos, which took its name (Mongolian for \\"palaces\\") from the mausoleum's presence there. The caretakers oversaw commemorative and religious rituals and were visited by pilgrims. Mongol khans were also crowned at the yurts. Under the Qing, 500 Darkhad were exempted from military service and taxation; the shrine also received 500 taels (about ) of silver each year to maintain its rituals.. The site's rituals became more local, more open to lower-class people, and more Buddhist.. The Mongolian prince Toghtakhut√∂r√º and the Darkhad built a permanent mausoleum in Setsen Khan Aimag in 1864. This traditional Chinese structure was described by a Belgian missionary in 1875. but was destroyed at the Panchen Lama's suggestion in order to end an outbreak of plague among the Darkhad in early 20th century. Around the fall of the Qing, the mausoleum became notable as a symbol for Mongolian nationalists. The Buryat scholar Tsyben Zhamtsarano advocated a removal of the shrine to northern Mongolia . After the Mongolian Revolution, a sacrificial rite was held for Genghis Khan to \\"bring peace and safety to... human beings and other creatures\\" and to \\"drive out bandits, thieves, illness, and other internal and external malefactions\\" in 1912.. Some Mongolians planned to remove some of the ritual objects‚Äîparticularly the Black S√ºlde, an allegedly magical heaven-sent trident‚Äîto the independent northern Mongolian territory from the Inner Mongolian shrine; in 1914, a letter from the Beijing office overseeing Mongolia and Tibet ordered Arbinbayar, the head of the Ihe Juu League, that In 1915, Zhang Xiangwen (t s pZhƒÅng XiƒÅngw√©n, wChang Hsiang-wen) began the scholarly controversy over the site of Genghis Khan's tomb by publishing an article claiming that it was in Ejin Horo. During World War II, Prince Demchugdongrub, the notional leader of the Japanese puppet government in Mongolia, ordered that the mobile tomb and its relics be moved to avoid a supposed \\"Chinese plot to plunder it\\".. This was rebuffed by the local leader Shagdarjab, who claimed that the shrines could never be moved and locals would resist any attempt to do so. When he accepted Japanese weaponry to defend it, however, the Nationalist government became alarmed at the possibility of Japan using the cult of Genghis Khan to lead a Mongolian separatist movement. The yurts and their relics were to be removed to Qinghai either at their armed insistence or at Shagdarjab's invitation. (Accounts differ.) The Japanese still attempted to use the cult of Genghis Khan to fan Mongolian nationalism; from 1941‚Äì4,. the IJA colonel Kanagawa Kosaku constructed a separate mausoleum in Ulan Hot consisting of 3 main buildings in a estate. =Gansu= Once in Chinese hands, the relics did not go to Qinghai as planned. On 17 May 1939, 200 specially-selected Nationalist troops conveyed the relics to Yan'an, then the principal base of the Chinese Communists. Upon their arrival on 21 June 1939, the Communists held a large public sacrifice to Genghis Khan with a crowd of about ten thousand spectators; the Central Committee presented memorial wreathes; and Mao Zedong produced a new sign for it in his calligraphy, reading \\"Genghis Khan Memorial Hall\\" (t s Ch√©ngj√≠sƒ´ H√°n J√¨ni√†nt√°ng). As part of the Second United Front, it was allowed to pass out of the Communist controlled area to Xi'an, where Shaanxi governor Jiang Dingwen officiated another religious ritual before a crowd of tens of thousands on 25 June. (Accounts vary from thirty to 200,000.) Li Yiyan, a member of the Nationalists' provincial committee, wrote the booklet China's National Hero Genghis Khan (t s Zh≈çnghu√° M√≠nz√∫ Yƒ´ngxi√≥ng Ch√©ngj√≠sƒ´ H√°n) to commemorate the event, listing the khan as a great Chinese leader in the mold of the First Emperor, Emperor Wu, and Emperor Taizong.. A few days later, the Gansu governor Zhu Shaoliang held a similar ritual. before enshrining the khan's relics at the Dongshan Dafo Dian on Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong County. The Gansu government sent soldiers and a chief official for the shrine and brought the remaining Darkhad onto the provincial government's payroll; the original 500 Darkhad were reduced to a mere seven or eight. Following this journey, the shrine remained there for ten years. =Qinghai= At the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist guard at the temple fled before the Communist advance into Gansu in the summer of 1949. Plans were put forward to move the khan's shrine to the Alxa League in western Inner Mongolia or to Mount Emei in Sichuan. Ultimately, Qinghai's local warlord Ma Pufang intervened and moved it west to Kumbum Monastery near his capital Xining, consecrating it with the help of local and Mongolian lamas under Ulaan Gegen. Following the Communist conquest of Xining a few months later, the Communist general He Banyan sacrificed three sheep to the khan and offered ceremonial scarves (hadag) and a banner reading \\"National Hero\\" ( M√≠nz√∫ Yƒ´ngxi√≥ng) to the temple housing his shrine.. =Present-day mausoleum= Ejin Horo fell to the Communists at the end of 1949 and was controlled by their Northwest Bureau until the establishment of Suiyuan Province the next year. The district's Communists set up rituals honouring Genghis Khan in the early 1950s, but abolished the traditional religious offices surrounding them like the Jinong and controlled the cult through local committees with loyal Party cadres. Without the relics, they relied largely on singing and dancing groups. In 1953, the PRC's central government approved the recently-formed Inner Mongolian provincial government's request for 800,000 to create the present permanent structures. Early the next year, the central government permitted the return of the objects at Kumbum to the site being constructed at Ejin Horo. The region's chairman Ulanhu officiated at the first ritual after their return, decrying the Nationalists for having \\"stolen\\" them. After this ritual, he immediately held a second ceremony to break ground on a permanent temple to house the objects and the khan's cult, again approved and paid for by China's central government. By 1956, this new temple was completed, greatly expanding the purview of the original shrine. Rather than having eight separate shrines throughout Ejin Horo for the Great Khan, his wives, and his children, all were placed together; a further 20 sacred and venerated objects from around the Ordos were also brought to the new site. The government also mandated that the main ritual would be held in the summer rather than in the third lunar month, in order to make it more convenient for the headers to maintain their spring work schedules. With the Darkhads no longer liable for personally paying for maintenance of the shrine, most accepted these changes. An especially large celebration was held in 1962 to mark the 800th anniversary of Genghis Khan's birth. In 1968, the Cultural Revolution's Red Guards destroyed almost everything of value at the shrine. For 10 years, the buildings themselves were turned into a salt depot as part of preparations for a potential war with the Soviet Union. Following Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy, the site was restored by 1982 and sanctioned for \\"patriotic education\\" as a AAAA-rated tourist attraction. Replicas of the former relics were made, and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989. Priests at the museum now claim that all of the Red Guards who desecrated the tomb have died in abnormal ways, suffering a kind of curse. Inner Mongolians continued to complain about the poor state of the mausoleum. A 2001 proposal for its refurbishment was finally approved in 2004. Unrelated houses, stores, and hotels were removed from the area of the mausoleum to a separate area away and replaced with new structures in the same style as the mausoleum. The 150-million- (about $20 million) improvement plan was carried out from 2005 to 2006, improving the site's infrastructure, expanding its courtyard, and decorating and repairing its existing buildings and walls. The China National Tourism Administration named the site a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction in 2011.. On 10 July 2015, 20 tourists aged 33 to 74‚Äî10 South Africans, 9 Britons, and an Indian‚Äîwere detained at Ordos Ejin Horo Airport, arrested on terrorism-related charges the next day, and ultimately deported from China after they watched a BBC documentary about Genghis Khan in their hotel rooms prior to visiting the mausoleum. Authorities had considered it \\"watching and spreading violent terrorist videos\\". In 2017, the Genghis Khan Mausoleum averaged about 8000 visitors a day during its peak season and about 200 visitors a day at other times. Administration The site is overseen by the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Administration Bureau. It was headed by Chageder and then Mengkeduren in the early 2000s.  Architecture  The tomb complex at the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Scenic Area in 2007 The present Genghis Khan Mausoleum Scenic Area stretches about , covering about in total.. It consists of the Sulede Altar, the Sightseeing District for the Protection of Historic Relics, the Conservation District for Ecosystem Preservation, the Development-Restricted District of Visual Spectacles, the long Sacred Pathway of Genghis Khan between the entrance and the cenotaph, the long scenic pathway around the Bayinchanghuo Prairie, a Tourist Activity Centre, a Tourist Education Centre, the Sacrificial Sightseeing District, the Mongolian Folk Custom Village, the Shenquan Ecological Tourism Region, the Nadam Equestrian Sport Centre, and the Hot Air Balloon Club. The tomb complex consists of the Main Hall, the Imperial Burial Palace, the Western Hall, the Eastern Hall, the Western Corridor, and the Eastern Corridor. The Main Hall (Ê≠£ÊÆø) is octagonal, high, and covers about . It is shaped like a flying eagle as a symbol of the khan's bravery and adventurousness. Its plaque, reading \\"Mausoleum of Genghis Khan\\", was written by Ulanhu in 1985. The site includes a high statue of Genghis Khan and two murals about his life, including a wall map of the extent of the Mongol Empire. The Imperial Burial Palace (ÂØ¢ÂÆÆ) or Back Palace (ÂæåÊÆø) is high and covers about . It has three yurts with yellow silk roofs; the central yurt houses the coffins of Genghis Khan and one of his four. wives and the side yurts house the coffins of his brothers. Genghis Khan's coffin is silver decorated with engraved roses and a golden lock; weapons allegedly used by Genghis lie around it. There are also two other coffins for another two of his consorts. The site's main altar lies in front of this yurt. The cenotaph and its placement are highly unusual in China, which usually follows Han principles like feng shui in the placement of tombs, employing mountains, rivers, and forests in the belief that this increases its spiritual power. The Eastern Hall or Palace (Êù±ÊÆø) is high. It holds the coffin of Tolui (Genghis Khan's 4th and favourite son) and his wife Sorghaghtani. The Western Hall or Palace (Ë•øÊÆø) is high. It holds nine banners with holy arrows thought to house or connect with the soul of the Great Khan. They also represent 9 of Genghis's generals. It also holds Genghis's saddle and reins, some weapons, and some other objects like the khan's milk barrel. All of the items currently displayed are replicas. The high Eastern (Êù±Âªä) and Western Corridors (Ë•øÂªä) connecting these halls are decorated with of murals about the lives of Genghis Khan and his descendants. The site uses a five-colour scheme of blue, red, white, gold, and green to represent the multiethnic nature of Genghis Khan's empire and also the sky, sun and fire, milk, earth, and prairie.  Worship  Outdoors sacrificial altar to Heaven. The temple's ovoo. Genghis Khan worship is a practice of Mongolian shamanism.

The mausoleum is guarded by the Darkhad or Darqads (\\"Untouchables\\"), who also oversee its religious festivals, stop tourists from taking photographs, keep candles lit, and watch over the site's keys and books. The 30 or so official Darkhad at the mausoleum are paid about 4000 a month for their services. Mongols gather four times annually: * 21st day of the 3rd month of the Mongolian calendar, the most important * 15th day of the 5th lunar month * 12th day of the 9th lunar month * Goat Hide Stripes Ceremony on the 3rd day of the 10th lunar month There is also a major ceremony in honor of the Black S√ºlde on the 14th day of the 7th lunar month. They follow traditional ceremonies, such as offering flowers and food to Heaven (Tengri). The ritual sacrifice to the spirit of Genghis Khan was listed as national-level intangible cultural heritage in 2006, and the sacrifice to the Black S√ºlde was given similar status at the provincial level in 2007. After the ceremonies, there are Naadam competitions, primarily wrestling, horse-riding, and archery, but also singing.Almaz Khan, \\"Chinggis Khan, From Imperial Ancestor to Ethnic Hero,\\" in Harrell, Stevan, Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers, pp. 248‚Äì77. Performance The mausoleum complex is also hosts three plays concerning the khan and Mongolian culture: Proud Son of Heaven: Eternal Genghis Khan or The Mighty Genghis Khan (), The Grand Ceremony of Genghis Khan (), and An Ordos Wedding Ceremony (). There is also an annual Genghis Khan Mausoleum Tourism Cultural Week.

Definition A sphenic number is a product pqr where p, q, and r are three distinct prime numbers. This definition is more stringent than simply requiring the integer to have exactly three prime factors. For instance, 60 = 22 √ó 3 √ó 5 has exactly 3 prime factors, but is not sphenic. Examples The sphenic numbers are the square- free 3-almost primes. The smallest sphenic number is 30 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 5, the product of the smallest three primes. The first few sphenic numbers are :30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154, 165, ... the largest known sphenic number is :(282,589,933 ‚àí 1) √ó (277,232,917 ‚àí 1) √ó (274,207,281 ‚àí 1). It is the product of the three largest known primes. Divisors All sphenic numbers have exactly eight divisors.

It encompasses the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City and the counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester. The Archdiocese of New York is the second-largest diocese in the United States by population, encompassing 296 parishes that serve around 2.8 million Catholics, in addition to hundreds of Catholic schools, hospitals and charities. The Archdiocese also operates the well-known St. Joseph's Seminary, commonly referred to as Dunwoodie. The Archdiocese of New York is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of New York which includes the suffragan dioceses of Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Ogdensburg, Rochester, Rockville Centre and Syracuse. The Latin name of the archdiocese is Archidioecesis Neo- Eboracensis (Eboracum being the Roman name of York, England), and the corporate name is Archdiocese of New York. It publishes a bi-weekly newspaper, Catholic New York, the largest of its kind in the United States.  Prelature  The ordinary of the Archdiocese of New York is an archbishop whose cathedra is The Cathedral of St. Patrick (commonly St. Patrick's Cathedral) in Manhattan, New York. The Archbishop of New York is also the metropolitan of the larger Ecclesiastical Province of New York, which consists of the eight dioceses that comprise the State of New York with the exception of a small portion (Fishers Island) that belongs to the Province of Hartford. As such, the metropolitan archbishop possesses certain limited authority over the suffragan sees of the province (see ecclesiastical province). R. Luke Concanen became the first Bishop of the (then) Diocese of New York in 1808. The current Archbishop of New York is Timothy Michael Cardinal Dolan. History Initially, the territory that now makes up the Archdiocese of New York was part of the Prefecture Apostolic of United States of America which was established on November 26, 1784. On November 6, 1789, the Prefecture was elevated to a diocese and the present territory of the Archdiocese of New York fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Baltimore, headed by the first American bishop, John Carroll. At the time, there was a dearth of priests to minister to the large territory. The first Roman Catholic Church in New York City was St. Peter's on Barclay Street. The land was purchased from Trinity Church with community donations and a gift of 1,000 pieces of silver from King Charles III of Spain. The church was built in the federal style. Among its regular worshippers were Saint Elizabeth Seton and Venerable Pierre Toussaint. On April 8, 1808, the Holy See raised Baltimore to the status of an Archdiocese. At the same time, the dioceses of Philadelphia, Boston, Bardstown (now Louisville, KY) and New York were created as suffragan dioceses of Baltimore. At the time of its establishment, the Diocese of New York covered all of the State of New York, as well as the northeastern New Jersey counties of Sussex, Bergen, Morris, Essex, Somerset, Middlesex, and Monmouth. Since the first appointed bishop could not set sail from Italy due to the Napoleonic blockade, a Jesuit priest, Anthony Kohlmann, was appointed administrator. He was instrumental in organizing the diocese and preparing for its original Cathedral of St. Patrick to be built on Mulberry Street. Among the difficulties faced by Catholics at the time was anti-Catholic bigotry in general and in the New York school system. A strong Nativist movement sought to keep Catholics out of the country and to prevent those already present from advancing. On April 23, 1847, territory was taken from the diocese to form the dioceses of Albany and Buffalo. The New York diocese was elevated to an archdiocese on July 19, 1850. On July 29, 1853, territory was again taken from the diocese, this time to form the Diocese of Newark and the Diocese of Brooklyn. The Bahamas were made a part of the Archdiocese of New York on July 25, 1885, establishing their first permanent Catholic presence, due to their proximity to New York's busy port. Churches and schools were constructed and administered until The Bahamas' eventual dissociation to form the Prefecture Apostolic of Bahama (now the Archdiocese of Nassau) on March 21, 1929. By 1932, The Bahamas were no longer under the spiritual jurisdiction of New York. Archdiocesan demographics As of 2016, the Catholic population of the Archdiocese was 2,642,740. These Catholics were served by 696 archdiocesan priests and 590 priests of religious orders. Also laboring in the diocese were 319 permanent deacons, 962 religious brothers, and 2,260 nuns. For comparison, in 1929, the Catholic population of the Archdiocese was 1,273,291 persons. There were 1,314 clergy ministering in the archdiocese and 444 churches. There were also 170,348 children in Catholic educational and welfare institutions. In 1959, there were 7,913 nuns and sisters ministering in the Archdiocese, representing 103 different religious orders.

Reports of sex abuse In August 2018, the archdiocese reported that between 2016 and 2018, its Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program paid nearly $60 million to 278 victims of sex abuse by clergy. On September 26, 2018, it was reported that the Archdiocese of New York, and the three other dioceses where Theodore McCarrick served as a bishop, were facing an investigation by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for McCarrick's alleged sex abuse. On January 28, 2019, the New York state Assembly and Senate passed a law allowing prosecutors to bring criminal charges until a victim turned 28, and permitting victims to sue until age 55. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law on February 14, 2019. On April 26, 2019, the Archdiocese released a list of 120 Catholic clergy accused of committing acts of sexual abuse. Some of those on the list, which includes both male and female church workers, have been convicted and many are deceased. The list was accompanied by a letter of apology from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who asked for forgiveness. On August 14, 2019, James Grien, who has accused McCarrick of sexually abusing him when McCarrick was an Auxiliary Bishop of New York, filed a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of New York for shielding McCarrick from a potential criminal investigation. In his lawsuit, Grien also stated that McCarrick's status as a friend of his family allowed the former New York Auxiliary Bishop to continue to visit and sexually abuse him after being transferred to New Jersey's Diocese of Metuchen and Archdiocese of Newark. On September 30, 2019, Dolan released a report written by Barbara S. Jones, a former judge and prosecutor. Her report stated, among other things, that the Archdiocese had completed the process of removing all of its remaining accused clergy from active ministry. In the same report, Jones recommended that the Archdiocese should also hire a sex abuse \\"czar\\" to vet all complaints. Jones, who was commissioned by Dolan in 2018 to conduct the review of the church's handling of abuse allegations, also recommended hiring \\"a compliance officer for the Office of Priest Personnel to monitor its functions and oversee the new document management system\\". Dolan also backed the Jones Report and stated at a press conference that the Archdiocese was expanding its sex abuse policy as well. On October 10, 2019, it was announced that Pope Francis had accepted the resignation of Bronx-based Auxiliary Bishop John Jenik following an accusation of sex abuse. Appointed Auxiliary Bishop by Pope Francis in 2014, Jenik also served as vicar for the Northwest Bronx, appointed by Dolan's predecessor Edward Egan in 2006. Jenik, who submitted his resignation letter upon turning 75 in March 2019, had stepped out of public ministry in October 2018 after the allegation surfaced. On May 8, 2020, Cuomo extended the 2019 New York Child Victim Act's statewide statute of limitations deadline to file sex abuse lawsuits, which was originally set for August 14, 2020, to January 14, 2021. On July 27, 2020, it was revealed that a Catholic priest who served the Archdiocese of New York in upstate New York's Orange Coutny was named in a new sex abuse lawsuit.https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2020/07/27/more-child-sex- abuse-lawsuits-have-been-filed-court-deadline-nears/5500519002/ In the lawsuit, eight men alleged that longtime Orange County priest Rev. George Boxelaar, who is now deceased, sexually abused them when they were children, adding their claims to those of at least three other accusers of the late Boxelaar who have sued. These three other accusers had filed lawsuits through the state Supreme Court in Orange County in late 2019, with one also naming the Archdiocese of New York and both Holy Cross and Our Lady of Mount Carmel churches as defendants.https://www.recordonline.com/news/20191203/2-more-sue- alleging-sex-abuse-by-late-orange-county-priest In addition to these new lawsuits, a Scarsdale Catholic school teacher identified as Edwin Gaylor also confessed to committing acts of sex abuse.https://www.lohud.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lohud.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fscarsdale- catholic-school-teacher-edwin-gaynor-admits-sex-abuse%2F5492497002%2F  Province of New York  See also * :People of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York * John P.

He served as Bishop of Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000, and as Archbishop of New York from 2000 to 2009. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2001. He was the twelfth Bishop, ninth Archbishop, and seventh Cardinal of the See of New York. Early life and education The third of four children, Edward Egan was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Thomas J. and Genevieve (n√©e Costello) Egan. His father was a sales manager and his mother was a homemaker and former teacher; his parents' families were from County Mayo and County Clare, Ireland. In 1943, Egan and his older brother contracted polio,McFadden, Robert D., \\"Cardinal Edward M. Egan, 82, Dies; Led New York Archdiocese in Trying Time\\", The New York Times, March 5, 2015 causing them to miss two years of school while convalescing at home. He graduated from Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, where he had been student body president and editor of the student newspaper and yearbook, in 1951. Egan then entered St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in philosophy. He was then sent to continue his formation for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, taking his academic courses in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Priesthood Egan was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Martin John O'Connor on December 15, 1957, and earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1958. Upon his return to the United States, he served as associate pastor of Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago, assistant chancellor for the Archdiocese, and secretary to Cardinal Albert Gregory Meyer until 1960. During this time, he also taught evening classes for potential Catholic converts and served as a chaplain at Wesley Memorial Hospital. In 1960, Egan returned to the Gregorian in Rome to pursue his doctorate. During his studies, he became assistant vice-rector and repetitor of moral theology and canon law at the Pontifical North American College. He received his doctorate in canon law summa cum laude in 1964. Egan, returning to the Archdiocese of Chicago, became secretary to John Cardinal Cody. As his secretary, he \\"saw Cardinal Cody take the heat for good causes\\" such as the Civil Rights Movement and desegregation. Egan was later appointed Secretary of the Archdiocesan Commissions on Ecumenism and Human Relations, sitting on several interfaith organizations and establishing dialogue with Jews and Protestants alike. From 1969 to 1971, he served as co-chancellor for the Archdiocese. Egan once again returned to Rome in 1971, when Pope Paul VI named him an auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota. While serving on the Roman Rota, he was also a professor of canon law at the Gregorian and of civil and criminal procedure at the Studio Rotale. Egan served as a commissioner of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship and a consultor of the Congregation for the Clergy as well. In 1982, he was chosen to be one of the six canonists who reviewed the new Code of Canon Law with Pope John Paul II before its promulgation in 1983. Episcopal career On April 1, 1985, Egan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Allegheny by John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration in Rome on the following May 22 from Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, with Archbishop John Joseph O'Connor and Bishop John Richard Keating serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: \\"In the Holiness of the Truth\\" (). As an auxiliary to O'Connor, he served as Vicar for Education in the Archdiocese from 1985 to 1988. =Bishop of Bridgeport= Egan was later named the third Bishop of Bridgeport, Connecticut, on November 5, 1988.\\"Death of Cardinal Egan\\", Catholic New York, March 5, 2015 He was formally installed on December 14 of that year. During his tenure, he oversaw the reorganization of Catholic schools. He also raised $45 million for diocesan schools through a fundraising campaign, \\"Faith in the Future.\\" The diocesan Catholic Charities under his tenure became the largest private social service agency in Fairfield County. To support the 12 Hispanic parishes in the diocese, he brought Spanish-speaking priests to Bridgeport from Colombia. He also established a home for retired priests and a school for children with special needs. Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Pontifical North American College and of the Committee on Science and Human Values. He was also a member of the Committee on Canonical Affairs, the Committee on Education, the Committee on National Collections, and the Committee on Nominations, and served two terms on the Conference's Administrative Board. =Archbishop of New York= Egan was appointed Archbishop of New York on May 11, 2000, a week after O'Connor's death, and installed in that position on June 19, 2000. Soprano Ren√©e Fleming sang at the ceremony. On becoming archbishop of New York, Egan made it a priority to encourage vocations to the priesthood. Besides private initiatives, each year on the Feast of St. Joseph (March 19) he offered a Mass to which high school and college men attracted to the priestly vocation were invited. He appointed two priests as vocation directors to aid him in promoting the vocation to the priesthood, although they were unable to reverse the declining trend. He was elevated to the Cardinalate by Pope John Paul II at the Consistory of February 21, 2001,Howe, Bob. \\"Edward Cardinal Egan 1932-2015\\", Fordham News, March 5, 2015 becoming the Cardinal- Priest of Ss. Ioannis et Pauli (Sts. John and Paul). This was the same title held by all of the archbishops of New York since Cardinal Francis Spellman in 1946 was given the title by Pope Pius XII, who had held it himself when he was Cardinal Pacelli. A main concern of the new Cardinal Egan was the archdiocesan seminary in Yonkers, New York. In March 2001, he announced his decision to restructure the seminary faculty. A Staten Island pastor, Monsignor Peter Finn, was chosen as seminary rector. Among others, the cardinal added Avery Dulles, S.J., Sister Sara Butler, M.S.B.T., and Father John Augustine DiNoia, O.P., to the faculty. The minor seminary, then in Riverdale, Bronx, was moved to the campus of the major seminary. To maintain regular contact with the seminarians, Egan invited them to serve his 10:15 am Mass at Saint Patrick's Cathedral on one Sunday each month, and afterward would meet with them in his residence. Moreover, each year, he personally led a day of prayer and reflection for the seminary students and faculty. Egan was a prominent and steadying influence in New York after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 killed nearly 3,000 at the World Trade Center. \\"The cardinal responded to the disaster ‚Äì ministering to the injured and anointing the dead at St. Vincent's Hospital and at Ground Zero itself, chairing committees and planning a center for victims' families at the New School and an interfaith service at Yankee Stadium, and offering Masses at St. Patrick's Cathedral in the immediate aftermath and funerals there and around the archdiocese for months.\\" In 2002 the \\"Instituci√≥n del M√©rito Humanitario\\" with its seat in Barcelona (Spain) awarded him with the \\"Gran Cruz al M√©rito Humanitario\\". In 2002 Pope John Paul II named Egan, along with five other cardinals, to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature, the Church's highest court in matters of Canon Law. In addition to his native English, Egan spoke French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. For retired priests of the archdiocese, Egan established the John Cardinal O'Connor residence in 2003, at the previous site of the minor seminary in Riverdale. In June 2003, Egan was accused of concealing the names of priests who had been accused of child molestation and found not guilty by the Church. His spokesman argued that the innocent should be protected, while groups such as Voice of the Faithful criticized the process as being out of the public view. Egan was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. In December 2006, Egan began hosting a weekly program on The Catholic Channel of Sirius Satellite Radio in which he discussed a variety of topics, including events in the Archdiocese and issues in the Church. The station launched by the Cardinal's initiative also broadcast his Sunday Mass from the Cathedral. At other times, scheduled programs included news, human-interest stories and inspirational themes, reflections on Scripture, Catholic education, social ministry, sacred music, interviews, call-in, and spiritual guidance. On January 19, 2007, after several years of study and consultation, Egan announced that ten under-utilized parishes of the Archdiocese would be canonically suppressed and eleven would be merged with other parishes, \\"based on the migration of Catholics in the inner-city to the outer boroughs\\". At the same time, he made known that he had decided not to close or merge nine parishes and six missions originally recommended either for closing or merger. Moreover, five new parishes would be established, three in Orange County, and one each in Staten Island and Dutchess County due to population increases. Building projects were also approved for nine parishes. The closures caused some discontent. On December 15, 2007, Egan celebrated his 50th anniversary as a priest. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on January 26, 2008. Egan then hosted the papal visit to New York during April 2008, marking the 200th anniversary of the diocese. In January 2009, Egan publicly condemned controversial statements made by Society of Saint Pius X Bishop Richard Williamson about the Holocaust. Resignation and final years Egan, in keeping with the Code of Canon Law, offered his resignation as archbishop of New York to Pope Benedict XVI on April 2, 2007, when he reached 75 years of age. His resignation became official on February 23, 2009, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Timothy Dolan as his successor. Dolan took possession of the archdiocese on April 15, 2009. Egan was the first Archbishop of New York to retire; all previous Archbishops of New York had died in office, even after the introduction of the requirement for bishops to offer their resignation from their positions of pastoral care upon reaching age 75. He was a member of the Board of Trustees at the Catholic University of America and a member of the Board of Governors at Ave Maria School of Law. He reached age 80 on April 2, 2012, and from then on ceased to be Cardinal-elector. Egan was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital on April 4, 2009, experiencing stomach pains. After undergoing various tests, he was released from the hospital on April 7, and was later given a pacemaker in a low-risk surgery. He was well enough to preside over major liturgical services for the April 9‚Äì12 Easter Triduum, days before the arrival of his successor. Death and legacy Cardinal Egan died, shortly after eating lunch, at his residence at the Chapel of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, on Thursday, March 5, 2015, having been rushed to NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan, New York City, after suffering cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead at 2:20 PM. Before his death, he had been given the sacraments by his priest secretary, Father Douglas Crawford. His death was publicly announced by his successor, Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Many other bishops released statements mourning Egan's abrupt death. Views and controversies =Abortion= In a strongly worded article published next to a photo of an unborn baby in the womb, Edward Cardinal Egan compared tolerating abortions to the reasoning used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to commit mass murders.Cardinal Egan: Abortion support equal to Nazism With regard to self-professed Catholic politicians who support abortion, Egan adhered to the Church's discipline of forbidding Holy Communion to such persons due to the public scandal. In April 2008, after newspapers had published photographs of former Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani receiving Communion at a Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral offered by Pope Benedict XVI, Egan issued a public statement: > The Catholic Church clearly teaches that abortion is a grave offense against > the will of God. Throughout my years as Archbishop of New York, I have > repeated this teaching in sermons, articles, addresses, and interviews > without hesitation or compromise of any kind. Thus it was that I had an > understanding with Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, when I became Archbishop of New > York and he was serving as Mayor of New York, that he was not to receive the > Eucharist because of his well-known support of abortion. I deeply regret > that Mr. Giuliani received the Eucharist during the Papal visit here in New > York, and I will be seeking a meeting with him to insist that he abide by > our understanding. =Gay marriage= Edward Cardinal Egan assailed the notion of gay marriage and criticized Hollywood for \\"desecrating\\" marriage and destroying \\"something sacred and holy.\\" Egan said the specter of legal same-sex marriage would have a devastating effect on traditional values already eroded by a crude pop culture, the Daily News reported. =Alleged abuse in Bridgeport= The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in May 2009 that records detailing allegations of sexual abuse by priests in the Diocese of Bridgeport should be released. The court's 4-1 ruling covers more than 12,600 pages of documents from 23 lawsuits against six priests that have been under seal since the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport settled the cases in 2001. In April 2002, in a letter read out at Mass, Egan apologized saying, \\"If in hindsight we also discover that mistakes may have been made as regards prompt removal of priests and assistance to victims, I am deeply sorry.\\" Ten years later, in February 2012, the retired archbishop retracted his apology. In an interview with Connecticut magazine he said: \\"I never should have said that,\\" and \\"I don't think we did anything wrong.\\" He repeatedly denied any sexual abuse happened while he was leading Bridgeport diocese. In August 2018, Father Boniface Ramsey said that he once tried to speak with Egan concerning the sexual activities of then-cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who after Egan's death was publicly accused of sexual misconduct against seminarians and minors, but that Egan \\"didn't want to hear it.\\" McCarrick maintained his innocence but the Vatican found him guilty and dismissed him from the clergy. In October 2019, former Connecticut Superior Court Judge Robert Holzberg released the results of his investigation, commissioned by Bridgeport Bishop Frank Caggiano, into the Diocese's handling of accusations of sexual abuse by its priests. Holzberg found that all three of Bridgeport's bishops over forty years had consistently failed to fulfill their moral and legal responsibilities. Holzberg found that Egan took a \\"dismissive, uncaring, and at times threatening attitude toward survivors\\"; he characterized Egan's behavior as \\"profoundly unsympathetic, inadequate, and inflammatory\\". Holzberg said that Egan broke a 1971 state law by not reporting abuse allegations and that he deliberately concealed the reasons for abusive priests' transfers. Among other findings, in a July 12, 1993 letter to diocesan counsel Renato Ottaviani, explaining his refusal to seek the involuntary laicization of serial abuser Father Raymond Pcolka, Egan wrote: \\"... it is obvious that there can be no canonical process either for the removal of a diocesan priest from his priestly duties or for the removal of a priest from his parish when there is serious reason to believe that the priest in question is guilty of the sexual violation of children, and especially when he has confessed such a violation to the bishop or a delegate of the bishop. For the bishop who would countenance such a process would be opening the way to the gravest of evils, among them the financial ruin of the diocese which he is to serve.\\" =Clerical celibacy= In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, at the end of his tenure as archbishop, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion. He added, \\"I think it has to be looked at, and I'm not so sure it wouldn't be a good idea to decide on the basis of geography and culture‚Äînot to make an across-the-board determination.\\" He further noted that Eastern Rite priests are allowed to marry, with \\"no problem at all.\\" Egan later moderated his statement, saying, \\"Celibacy is one of the Church's greatest blessings. I will have to be more careful about trying to explain a somewhat complicated matter in 90 seconds.\\" References External links * Official biography - Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York 1932 births 2015 deaths People from Chicago People from Oak Park, Illinois University of Saint Mary of the Lake alumni Pontifical Gregorian University alumni American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent Roman Catholic bishops of Bridgeport Roman Catholic Archbishops of New York Burials at St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan) American cardinals Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Catholic University of America trustees Members of the Apostolic Signatura Members of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches Members of the Congregation for Bishops People with polio Members of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre Catholics from Illinois Ave Maria School of Law ","title":"Edward Egan"},{"id":"245240","text":"Francis Joseph Spellman (May 4, 1889 ‚Äì December 2, 1967) was an American bishop and cardinal of the Catholic Church. From 1939 until his death in 1967, he served as the sixth Archbishop of New York; he had previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston from 1932 through 1939. He was created a cardinal in 1946. Early life and education Francis Spellman was born in Whitman, Massachusetts, to William Spellman (1858‚Äì1957) and Ellen (n√©e Conway) Spellman. His father was a grocer whose own parents had emigrated to the United States from Clonmel and Leighlinbridge in Ireland. The eldest of five children, Spellman had two brothers, Martin and John, and two sisters, Marian and Helene. As a child, he served as an altar boy at Holy Ghost Church.TIME 1959 Spellman attended Whitman High School (now Whitman-Hanson Regional High School) because there was no local Catholic school. He enjoyed photography and baseball; he was a first baseman during his first year of high school until a hand injury forced him to stop playing, and later managed the team. Following his high school graduation, Spellman entered Fordham University in New York City in 1907. He graduated in 1911 and decided to study for the priesthood. He was then sent by Archbishop William Henry O'Connell to study at the Pontifical North American College in Rome.Thornton During his years in Rome, Spellman befriended such figures as Gaetano Bisleti, Francesco Borgongini Duca and Domenico Tardini. He suffered from pneumonia, however, leaving his state of health so poor that the seminary administration wanted to send him home. He nevertheless remained and managed to complete his theological studies. Priesthood Spellman was ordained a priest by Patriarch Giuseppe Ceppetelli on May 14, 1916. Upon his return to the United States, he did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Boston. Cardinal O'Connell, who had earlier sent Spellman to Rome, took an apparent dislike to the young priest. O'Connell referred to him as a \\"little popinjay\\" and later said, \\"Francis epitomizes what happens to a bookkeeper when you teach him how to read.\\"TIME 1967 Spellman served a series of relatively insignificant assignments. Following the United States' entry into World War I in 1917, Spellman applied to become a military chaplain in the Army but did not meet the height requirement. Spellman's comparable application to the Navy was personally rejected, twice, by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Finally, O'Connell assigned him to promote subscriptions for the archdiocesan newspaper, The Pilot, instead. He was named assistant chancellor in 1918 and in 1924 archivist of the Archdiocese. After translating into English two books written by his friend Borgongini Duca, Spellman was made the first American attach√© of the Vatican Secretariat of State in 1925. He also worked with the Knights of Columbus in running children's playgrounds in Rome, and was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain on October 4, 1926, by Pope Pius XI. During a trip to Germany in 1927, Spellman established a lifelong friendship with Archbishop Eugenio Pacelli, who was serving as Apostolic Nuncio. He translated Pius XI's first broadcast over Vatican Radio in 1931.TIME August 15, 1932 Later that year, Spellman was charged with smuggling Non abbiamo bisogno, the papal encyclical condemning Benito Mussolini, out of Rome to Paris, where he then delivered it to the press; he was subsequently attacked by Italian newspapers. He also served as secretary to Cardinal Lorenzo Lauri at the 1932 International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, and helped reform the Vatican's press office, introducing mimeograph machines and issuing press releases. Episcopal career =Auxiliary Bishop of Boston= On July 30, 1932, Spellman was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Boston and Titular Bishop of Sila by Pope Pius XI. He had originally been considered for the Dioceses of Portland, Maine, and Manchester, New Hampshire. He received his consecration on the following September 8 from Pacelli (wearing the vestments Pacelli wore when he was consecrated by Benedict XV), with Archbishops Giuseppe Pizzardo and Francesco Borgongini Duca serving as co- consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica. His was the first consecration of an American bishop ever held at St. Peter's.TIME September 19, 1932 Borgongini- Duca designed for him a coat of arms incorporating Columbus's ship the Santa Maria. Pope Pius XI gave him the motto Sequere Deum (to follow God). After his return to the United States, Spellman resided at St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts. He was later made pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Newton Centre; there he erased the church's $43,000 debt through different fundraising activities. When his mother died in 1935, her funeral was attended by Governor James Curley, Lieutenant Governor Joseph Hurley, and many members of the clergy, with the exception of O'Connell. In the autumn of 1936, Cardinal Pacelli came to the United States, visiting New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Saint Paul, MN, and Chicago.Cortesi, Arnoldo. \\"Papal Secretary of State Coming Here; Rome Speculates on Subject of Mission\\". New York Times. October 1, 1936, p. 1 The ostensible purpose of the trip was personal; he was to be the guest of Genevieve Brady, the wealthy widow of Nicholas Brady. However, during the trip Pacelli met with Roosevelt to discuss diplomatic recognition of the sovereignty of Vatican City. Spellman was present at the meeting, which he arranged to take place at the president's boyhood home at Hyde Park, New York, on November 5, 1936, two days after his reelection to a second term. Pacelli also looked into \\"the radio priest\\" Father Charles Coughlin of Detroit. Though an early supporter of Roosevelt, Coughlin became increasingly disenchanted with him and made increasingly sharp national radio attacks on Roosevelt and the New Deal. He also expressed sympathy for the governments of Hitler and Mussolini as opponents of Communism. The Catholic hierarchy for its part did not like Coughlin. The Vatican and the Apostolic Legation in Washington, D.C. wanted him silenced.Boyea, Earl. \\"The Reverend Charles Coughlin and the Church: the Gallagher Years, 1930-1937\\". Catholic Historical Review 81 (2) (1995): 211‚Äì225 Spellman worked with Joseph P. Kennedy and Pacelli to stop Coughlin. However, only Coughlin's superior, Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit, had the canonical authority to curb him, and Gallagher supported Coughlin. Coughlin was in Boston at the same time as Pacelli, but they did not meet.Ware, Leonard. \\"Coughlin Imperils Curley's Chances\\". The New York Times, October 18, 1938 p. E6 In 1939, Coughlin was finally forced off the air under rules adopted by the Code Committee of the National Association of Broadcasters. =Archbishop of New York= Following the death of Pope Pius XI, Pacelli was elected as Pope Pius XII, and one of his first acts was to appoint Spellman the sixth Archbishop of New York on April 15, 1939. He succeeded the late Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, and was formally installed as Archbishop on the following May 23. He was painted twice in 1940 and again in 1941 by the prominent Roman Catholic Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury. The first regularly scheduled Masses in Spanish in New York began when Spellman gave authorization to the Redemptorists at St. Cecilia's parish in East Harlem.Ricourt, Milagros and Danta, Ruby. Hispanas de Queens, Cornell University Press, 2003 In addition to his duties as diocesan bishop, he was named Apostolic Vicar for the U.S. Armed Forces on December 11, 1939. He spent many Christmases with American troops in Japan, Korea and Europe in this capacity. During his tenure in New York, Spellman's considerable national influence in religious and political matters earned his residence the nickname of \\"the Powerhouse\\".Quinn 2006 He hosted such prominent figures as Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., Bernard Baruch, David I. Walsh, John William McCormack, and numerous other politicians, entertainers, and clergymen. In 1945, he instituted the Al Smith Dinner, an annual white tie fundraiser for Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese which is attended by prominent national figures, including presidential nominees. Following his promotion to New York, Spellman also became a close confidant of President Roosevelt. During World War II, he was chosen by Roosevelt to act as the latter's agent and visit Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in 1943, visiting a total of 16 countries in four months.TIME June 7, 1943 As archbishop and a military vicar, he would have greater freedom than official diplomats. Spellman also acted as a liaison between Pope Pius XII and Roosevelt in the Pope's attempts to have Rome declared an open city, in order to save it from the relentless bombing other European capitals had suffered and potentially destroying Rome's historical sites and ruins, including Vatican City. In 1946, he received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York\\". Cardinal Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in the consistory of February 18, 1946; his titular church was the same one held by Pius before his election to the papacy. According to historian William V. Shannon, \\"Spellman was deeply reactionary in his theology and secular politics.\\" Vehemently anti-Communist, Spellman once said that \\"a true American can neither be a Communist nor a Communist condoner\\" and that \\"the first loyalty of every American is vigilantly to weed out and counteract Communism and convert American Communists to Americanism\\". Spellman defended Senator Joseph McCarthy's 1953 investigations of Communist subversives in the federal government, stating at an April 1954 breakfast attended by the Senator that McCarthy had \\"told us about the Communists and about Communist methods\\" and that he was \\"not only against communism‚Äîbut ... against the methods of the Communists\\".NYT November 8, 1954 In 1949, when gravediggers at Calvary Cemetery in Queens went on strike for a pay raise, the Cardinal accused them of being Communists and recruited seminarians of the Archdiocese from St. Joseph's Seminary as strikebreakers.TIME March 14, 1949 He described the actions of the gravediggers, who belonged to the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union of America, as \\"an unjustified and immoral strike against the innocent dead and their bereaved families, against their religion and human decency\\". The strike was supported by such figures as the religious activist (now Servant of God) Dorothy Day and Ernest Hemingway, who wrote a scathing letter to Spellman. Spellman denounced the efforts of Congressman Graham Arthur Barden to provide federal funding only to public schools as \\"a craven crusade of religious prejudice against Catholic children\\",Truman Library even calling Barden himself an \\"apostle of bigotry\\". The Cardinal engaged later in a heated public dispute with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1949 when she expressed her opposition to providing federal funding to parochial schools in her column, My Day. In response, Spellman accused her of anti-Catholicism and called her column a \\"[document] of discrimination unworthy of an American mother\\". He eventually met with her at her Hyde Park home to quell the dispute. Spellman frequently criticized films he perceived to be immoral or indecent. He described Two-Faced Woman as \\"an occasion of sin ... dangerous to public morals\\", The Miracle (which led to Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson) as a \\"vile and harmful picture ... a despicable affront to every Christian\\", and Baby Doll as \\"revolting\\" and \\"morally repellent\\". His condemnation of Forever Amber caused producer William Perlberg to publicly refuse to \\"bowdlerize the film to placate the Roman Catholic Church\\". He was instrumental in getting William Brennan appointed to the Supreme Court in 1956, but would later regret the decision. Justice William O. Douglas once said, \\"I came to know several Americans who I felt had greatly dishonored our American ideal. One was Cardinal Spellman.\\"Cooney Spellman participated in the 1958 papal conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII. He was considered dismissive of Pope John and is reported to have said, \\"He's no Pope. He should be selling bananas.\\" In 1959, he served as papal delegate to the Eucharistic Congress in Guatemala; during his journey, he stopped in Nicaragua and, contrary to the Pope's orders, publicly appeared with dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Madame Hope Somoza at a reception in New York City. Although John F. Kennedy was a Catholic, Spellman supported Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, due to Kennedy's opposition to federal aid for parochial schools and to appointing a U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. His support for Nixon ended a long partnership with Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. Kennedy aide David Powers recalled that in 1960, Kennedy asked him \\"Why is Spellman against me?\\", to which he replied, \\"Spellman is the most powerful Catholic in the country. When you become president, you will be.\\" Spellman had previously presided over the weddings of Robert, Jean, Eunice and Ted Kennedy. Historian Pat McNamara views Spellman's outreach to the city's growing Puerto Rican community as years ahead of its time. He sent priests overseas to study Spanish, and by 1960 a quarter of all the archdiocese's parishes had an outreach to Spanish-speaking Catholics. In his years as a cardinal Spellman built 15 churches, 94 schools, 22 rectories, 60 convents, and 34 other institutions. He also visited Ecuador, where he founded three schools: Cardinal Spellman High School and Cardinal Spellman Girls' School, both in Quito; and Cardinal Spellman High School in Guayaquil. All of these schools are still currently open. Second Vatican Council Spellman attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and sat on its Board of Presidency. The Cardinal believed that predominantly liberal clergymen were being appointed to the Council's commissions, and opposed the introduction of vernacular into the Mass, saying, \\"The Latin language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the Western Church.\\" A theological conservative, he supported ecumenism on pragmatic grounds. However, in April 1963 Spellman brought to the Second Vatican Council John Courtney Murray as a peritus (expert) despite Cardinal Ottaviani‚Äôs well-known animosity towards him. With Apostolic Delegate to the U.S. Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi attempting to silence Murray, Spellman, along with Murray's Jesuit superiors, continued to shield him from most attempts at Curial interference. Murray's work helped shape the council's declaration on religious freedom. Growing revolution Spellman, following the death of John XXIII, participated in the conclave of 1963, which resulted in the election of Pope Paul VI. When The Deputy, a controversial play about Pius XII's actions during the Holocaust, opened on Broadway in 1964, Spellman condemned the play as \\"an outrageous desecration of the honor of a great and good man\\".DeMarco 1998 The play's producer, Herman Shumlin, responded by calling Spellman's words a \\"calculated threat to really drive a wedge between Christians and Jews\\". Although he once expressed his personal opposition to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, Spellman declined J. Edgar Hoover's requests to condemn Martin Luther King, Jr. and funded the trip of a group of New York priests and Religious Sisters to the Selma to Montgomery marches. He opposed racial discrimination in public housing but also the social activism of such priests as Daniel Berrigan and his brother, Philip Berrigan, as well as a young Melkite priest, David Kirk. Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam During the 1964 presidential election, Spellman supported Lyndon B. Johnson, whose Higher Education Facilities Act and Economic Opportunity Act had greatly benefited the Church. The Cardinal later agreed to Johnson's requests to send priests to the Dominican Republic to defuse anti-American sentiments following the invasion of 1965. Spellman was an outspoken supporter of the Vietnam War, to the extent that the conflict became known as \\"Spelly's War\\" and the Cardinal as the \\"Bob Hope of the clergy\\". He met Ngo Dinh Diem in 1950 and, favorably impressed by his strongly Catholic and anti-Communist views, promoted his career; however, he disassociated from Diem before the latter's assassination in 1963. Fearful of Communist gains in Vietnam, Spellman had urged American intervention since late 1954, but by the 1960s his views were strongly criticized by antiwar activists and even his fellow religious leaders. When Pope Paul VI visited the United States in October 1965, he indirectly rebuked Spellman's hawkish stance by pleading for peace before the United Nations. A group of college students protested outside his residence in December 1965 for suppressing antiwar priests, and he later spent that year's Christmas with troops in South Vietnam. While in Vietnam, Spellman quoted Stephen Decatur in declaring, \\"My country, may it always be right, but right or wrong, my country\\". He also described Vietnam as a \\"war for civilization\\" and \\"Christ's war against the Vietcong and the people of North Vietnam\\". One priest accused Spellman of \\"[blessing] the guns which the pope is begging us to put down\\".O'Donnell 2009 In January 1967, antiwar protestors disrupted a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. His support for the Vietnam War, along with his opposition to church reform, greatly undermined Spellman's clout within the church and country. Spellman was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1967. Illustrator Edward Sorel designed a poster in 1967 titled Pass the Lord and Praise the Ammunition, showing Spellman carrying a rifle with bayonet, but the poster was never distributed because Spellman died right after it was printed.National Portrait Gallery Website, annotated image of the poster Later life and death In 1966, Spellman offered his resignation to Pope Paul VI after the latter instituted a policy whereby bishops retire at age 75, but Paul VI asked him to remain in his post. He led his archdiocese through an extensive period of building the Catholic infrastructure, particularly the construction of numerous churches, schools, and hospitals. He consolidated all parish building programs into his own hands, thereby getting better interest rates from bankers, and convinced Pius XII of the need to internationalize the Vatican's Italy-centered investments after World War II; for his financial skill, he was sometimes called \\"Cardinal Moneybags\\". Spellman died in New York City on December 2, 1967, at age 78, and was interred in the crypt under the main altar at St. Patrick's Cathedral. His funeral Mass was attended by President Johnson, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Robert F. Kennedy, Jacob Javits, Nelson Rockefeller, John Lindsay, Arthur Goldberg, and Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos. To date, Spellman's twenty-eight year tenure as archbishop is the longest in the history of the Archdiocese of New York. =Homosexuality= John Cooney published a 1984 biography of Spellman entitled The American Pope. Before publication, he circulated galley proofs of the book, which included several pages arguing that Spellman had been a homosexual, based on multiple anonymous sources. This draft of the book was covered in the press. However, the final published version removed this material, replacing it with two sentences: \\"For years rumors abounded about Cardinal Spellman being a homosexual. As a result many felt ‚Äì and continue to feel ‚Äì that Spellman the public moralist may well have been a contradiction of the man of the flesh.\\" Journalist Michelangelo Signorile describes Spellman as \\"one of the most notorious, powerful and sexually voracious homosexuals in the American Catholic Church's history.\\" Signorile reported that Cooney's manuscript initially contained interviews with several people with personal knowledge of Spellman's homosexuality, including researcher and historian C. A. Tripp. According to Signorile, the Catholic Church pressured Cooney's publisher, Times Books, to reduce the four pages discussing Spellman's sexuality to a single paragraph. Both Signorile and John Loughery cite a story suggesting that Spellman was sexually active and carrying on a relationship with a male member of the chorus in the Broadway revue One Touch of Venus. Additionally, Curt Gentry, biographer of J. Edgar Hoover, says that Hoover's files also had \\"numerous allegations that Spellman was a very active homosexual.\\" Legacy Russell Shaw states that Spellman \\"embodied the fusion of Americanism and Catholicism\\" in the mid-twentieth century. Spellman's support of John Courtney Murray contributed to Murray's significant influence on the drafting of Dignitatis humanae, the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom. \\"Spellman's enduring accomplishments were his personal acts of kindness toward individuals and the religious and charitable institutions he founded or strengthened.\\" Henry Morton Robinson's novel The Cardinal (1950) was based in part on Spellman's career that was made in 1963 into a film of the same name with Tom Tryon as the eventual Cardinal. In July 1947, a Jesuit residential building opened on the campus of Fordham University, Spellman's alma mater, named in his honor.

He served as Archbishop of New York from 1919 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1924. Life and career =Early life and education= Patrick Hayes was born in the Five Points section of Manhattan to Daniel Hayes and Mary Gleason. In his own words, Hayes \\"was born very humble and, I may say, of poor people.\\" Both of his parents were from County Kerry, Ireland, and moved to the United States in 1864. A younger brother, John, was born in 1870. Hayes' mother died in June 1872, and his father later remarried around 1876; a half-sister, Anastasia, was also born that year. At age 15, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, who ran a grocery store where Hayes then worked. After attending La Salle Academy, Hayes studied at Manhattan College, where he excelled at philosophy and the classics and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors in 1888. At Manhattan, he also befriended George Mundelein, who would later become Archbishop of Chicago. Hayes then attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy. =Ordination and ministry= Hayes was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Michael Corrigan on September 8, 1892. He was then sent for further studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1894. Upon his return to New York City, Hayes was appointed Curate at St. Gabriel's Church on the Lower East Side, where he served under its pastor, John Murphy Farley (whom he would later succeed as Archbishop of New York). Hayes, following Farley's elevation to the episcopacy, served as his private secretary from 1895 to 1903, thereafter he was appointed chancellor of the Archdiocese and Rector of the Cathedral College. He was named Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on October 15, 1907. =Auxiliary Bishop of New York= On July 3, 1914, Hayes was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Thagaste by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 28 from Cardinal Farley, with Bishops Henry Gabriels and Thomas Cusack serving as co- consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. =Bishop for the Military Services= Hayes was later named Vicar Apostolic of Military, USA, on November 24, 1917. Serving as head of the American military ordinariate during World War I, he recruited hundreds of priests as commissioned officers or chaplains. He was also one of the four episcopal members of the executive committee of the National Catholic War Council. =Archbishop of New York= Following the death of Cardinal Farley in September 1918, Hayes was appointed by Pope Benedict XV as the fifth Archbishop of New York on March 10, 1919. He was formally installed as Archbishop on the following March 19. He founded the archdiocesan Catholic Charities in 1920, and subsequently became known as \\"the Cardinal of Charities.\\" In a 1921 pastoral letter, Hayes strongly condemned abortion, contraception and divorce. He had the first convention of the American Birth Control League raided, and later called its members \\"prophets of decadence\\". He welcomed the election of √âamon de Valera as President of the Irish Republic and contributed $1,000 to Sinn F√©in. =Cardinal= Pope Pius XI created him Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Via in the consistory of March 24, 1924. It was speculated that the Pope delayed his elevation to the Sacred College of Cardinals because a group from St. Patrick's Cathedral had stoned the Union Club for flying a British flag, but Pius nevertheless warmly greeted Hayes at the consistory as \\"dear little brother\\". The cardinal opposed Prohibition, backed legislation to limit indecency on the stage, and endorsed unemployment relief during the Great Depression. Commenting on the Depression in 1931, he stated, \\"The American people are experiencing a return to religion following a period of carelessness and cynicism marked by the prosperity of the land...Now they are returning when they find they are in need of something greater than the material in facing adversity and stress.\\" After the Rev. Charles Coughlin praised the late Mayor Jimmy Walker in New York, Hayes, who had earlier denounced Walker for his perceived lack of morality, ruled that no ecclesiastical visitor might address a religious gathering without the cardinal's permission. On June 24, 1924, he offered the invocation at the opening of the 1924 Democratic National Convention.Official Report of the Proceedings of the Democratic National Convention, published by the Democratic National Committee (1924) He used his Tammany Hall connections to line up Democratic support in Congress for legislation protecting Catholic schools in the Philippines in 1932. Hayes had a summer house in the Catskills, near St. Joseph's camp, maintained by the Amityville Dominican nuns; he once encountered a group of Klansmen there. Hayes died from a heart attack, caused by coronary thrombosis, in Monticello, New York, at age 70. He was originally interred in a grotto chapel at St. Joseph's camp. When the sisters sold the property he was then interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Cardinal Hayes High School in The Bronx is named after him.

At age twelve, he was orphaned and went to live with his mother‚Äôs family in the townland of Moyles.\\"John Murphy Farley (or Farrelly) (1842 ‚Äì 1918)\\", Parish of Lower Creggan He received his early education under the direction of a private tutor named Hugh McGuire. He then attended St. Macartan's College in Monaghan from 1859 to 1864. Under the auspices of an uncle, Farley emigrated to the United States at the height of the Civil War in 1864. He immediately enrolled at St. John's College in New York City, graduating in 1865. He then began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Provincial Seminary in Troy. In 1866, he was sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He was present in Rome during the whole period of the First Vatican Council. Priesthood Farley was ordained a priest by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro on June 11, 1870. His first assignment, following his return to New York, was as a curate at St. Peter's Church (Staten Island), where he remained for two years. Following the appointment of Francis McNeirny to the Diocese of Albany, in 1872 Farley became secretary to Archbishop John McCloskey, whom he had earlier met while in Rome. It was about this time that he changed the spelling of his name from 'Farrelly\\" to \\"Farley\\". He accompanied McCloskey to the 1878 papal conclave, but they arrived after the election of Pope Leo XIII had already taken place. Farley wrote the article on Cardinall McCloskey for the Catholic Encyclopedia. From 1884 to 1902, Farley served as pastor of St. Gabriel's Church in Manhattan. During his tenure at St. Gabriel's, he freed the parish from debt, oversaw the consecration of the church, and built a parish hall. He was named a papal chamberlain in 1884 with the title of \\"monsignor\\", and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1892. In addition to his pastoral duties at St. Gabriel's, Farley served as vicar general for the Archdiocese of New York from 1891 to 1902. He also served as president of the Catholic school board, in which position he organized a Catholic school parade in 1892. He later organized a Catholic school exhibit in 1894. He became a protonotary apostolic in 1895. Episcopal career On November 18, 1895, Farley was appointed auxiliary bishop of New York and titular bishop of Zeugma in Syria by Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 from Archbishop Michael Corrigan, with Bishops Charles Edward McDonnell and Henry Gabriels serving as co- consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Farley became Apostolic Administrator of the archdiocese upon the death of Archbishop Corrigan on May 5, 1902, and was himself named the fourth Archbishop of New York on September 15 of that year.\\"John Cardinal Farley\\", Hall of Honor, Fordham University. He was honored as an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1905. Pope Pius X created him Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in the consistory of November 27, 1911. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV. Following the outbreak of World War I, Farley stated, \\"As Catholics in America, we owe unswerving allegiance to the Government of America, and it is our sacred duty to answer with alacrity every demand our country makes upon our loyalty and devotion... I would that peace could come by arbitration and diplomacy. It seems, however, that no permanent peace can be hoped for except through the defeat of German arms in the field or the repudiation of the Prussian autocracy by the German people themselves. Criticism of the government irritates me. I consider it little short of treason.\\" His dedication to victory in the war angered the Sinn F√©in element of the New York clergy, who believed the Cardinal was bowing to anti-Irish bigots. He made progress in Catholic education in the archdiocese the keynote of his tenure as Archbishop, and established nearly fifty new parochial schools within his first eight years; he also founded the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary. He was known to take daily walks with one of his priests down Madison or Fifth Avenue, noting, \\"A man never collects his thoughts so well as when he walks alone or with a congenial spirit.\\" Farley died in Mamaroneck, at age 76. He is buried in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Further reading * Thomas J.

Early life Michael Augustine Corrigan was born August 13, 1839 in Newark, New Jersey, the fifth of nine children of Thomas and Mary English Corrigan, both of whom had emigrated from Ireland. Thomas Corrigan owned a retail grocery and liquor business in Newark, and the family's well-to-do status allowed Michael to pursue his educational interests. He attended St. Mary's College in Wilmington, Delaware, from 1853‚Äì1855, Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland from 1855‚Äì1857, spent a year in Europe, and received his bachelor's degree from Mount Saint Mary's in 1859. He became a member of the first class at the North American College in Rome, was ordained to the priesthood in September 1863 at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and received a doctorate of divinity in 1864.Mooney, Joseph. \\"Michael Augustine Corrigan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 October 2015 Corrigan returned to New Jersey in 1864, where he joined the faculty at Seton Hall College and the Immaculate Conception Seminary, both in South Orange, as professor of theology and history. He soon achieved a reputation within the hierarchy for sound scholarship, and he also provided pastoral care to Catholics in the Seton Hall vicinity. When Bernard J. McQuaid left Seton Hall in 1869 to assume his duties as bishop of the Diocese of Rochester, Corrigan succeeded him as college president and also became vicar general of the Diocese of Newark. Bishop of Newark Corrigan succeeded James Roosevelt Bayley as bishop of Newark, becoming the second ordinary of the diocese. He was consecrated bishop on May 4, 1873. The diocese encompassed the entire state of New Jersey during Corrigan's tenure. He administered diocesan affairs during a time of rapid population growth, Roman Catholic institutional development, immigration from Ireland and Germany, and considerable urbanization in the northern part of the state.

Corrigan\\", OSV Newsweekly, August 28, 2009 with the titular see of Petra, and succeeded to the archbishopric on October 10, 1885, serving as archbishop until his death. Corrigan's career in New York proved controversial on a number of levels. He aligned himself closely with his former mentor, Bernard J. McQuaid and has been considered one of the leaders of the \\"conservative\\" movement within the American Catholic hierarchy. He proved to be a strong supporter of national parishes and parochial schools, a vocal opponent of John Ireland, James Gibbons and other bishops who advocated \\"Americanization\\" within the Catholic Church. Within the American hierarchy, he was the closest supporter of Pope Leo XIII on Testem benevolentiae nostrae. He also proved unpopular with many bishops for his involvement in backstage intrigue at the Vatican. Within the Archdiocese of New York his most serious controversy involved his conflict with Father Edward McGlynn. During the 1886 mayoral campaign in New York City, the outspoken McGlynn supported Henry George, the candidate of the United Labor Party who proved popular with labor organizers, radicals, socialists, and Irish nationalists. Corrigan himself had been very close to Tammany Hall and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen's Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie. In 1897, Edgardo Mortara preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral New York City, but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara's efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the United States government. Corrigan was rebuked by the Vatican in 1887 for neglecting the spiritual needs of the surge of Italian immigrants settling in New York and for treating them in a humiliating way. Italians were neither permitted to attend Mass at Irish churches nor construct their own churches, instead being permitted to say Mass only in the basements of Irish churches. Corrigan justified this exclusion on the grounds that the Italians were \\"filthy.\\" He also had invited Mother Cabrini to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York. Corrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral.

He was the first American born Archbishop of New York from 1864 until his death in 1885, having previously served as Bishop of Albany (1847‚Äì64). In 1875, McCloskey became the first American cardinal. He served as the first president of St. John's College, now Fordham University, beginning in 1841. Early life and education John McCloskey was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Patrick and Elizabeth (n√©e Hassan) McCloskey, who had immigrated to the United States from County Londonderry, Ireland, shortly after their marriage in 1808. He was baptized by Rev. Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., on May 6, 1810, at St. Peter's Church in Manhattan. At that time Brooklyn did not yet have a Catholic church, so the family would row across the East River to Manhattan to attend Mass. At age 5, he was enrolled at a boarding school for boys in Brooklyn; even in his advanced years, he attributed his distinct enunciation to his training there. He moved with his family to Manhattan in 1817, and then entered the Latin school run by Thomas Brady, father of attorney James T. Brady and Judge John R. Brady. Following his father's death in 1820, the family moved to a farm in Bedford, Westchester County, adjoining to the estate of statesman John Jay. He also became the ward of Cornelius Heeney, a wealthy merchant and family friend. The 11-year-old McCloskey, after a brief visit with Rev. John Dubois, entered Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in September 1821. As a student at Mount St. Mary's, he was described as having \\"won the admiration and esteem of his teachers and the respect and love of his college-mates by the piety and modesty of his character, his gentleness, and sweet disposition, the enthusiasm with which he threw himself into his studies, and his prominent standing in class.\\" In his graduating year, he delivered a speech on patriotism that doubled as a defense of Horace's phrase, \\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country\\". Following his graduation in 1826, he returned to his mother's farm in Bedford. Priesthood In a dramatic event during the spring of 1827, McCloskey was attempting to drive a team of oxen drawing a heavy load of logs when the wagon overturned and he was buried under the logs for several hours. After being discovered and taken to the house, he was completely blind and unconscious for several days. Although he regained his eyesight, he tired easily and was generally in poor health throughout the rest of his life. During his convalescence, however, McCloskey decided upon a vocation to the priesthood and later returned to Mount St. Mary's in September 1827 for his seminary training. In addition to his studies, he became a professor of Latin in 1829 and a prefect of discipline in 1831. He received the tonsure, minor orders, and subdiaconate all from Bishop Francis Kenrick. On January 12, 1834, McCloskey was ordained a priest for the Diocese of New York by Bishop John Dubois, at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. He thus became the first native New Yorker to enter the diocesan priesthood. He then served as a parochial vicar at St. Patrick's Cathedral and a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital until February 1834, when he became professor of philosophy and vice-president at the newly established St. Joseph's Seminary in Nyack. However, the seminary was destroyed by a fire in August of that same year. McCloskey expressed his desire to minister to the victims of the cholera epidemic in New York City, but Bishop Dubois instead sent him to Rome to strengthen his health and to further his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University and University of the Sapienza (1834‚Äì1837). While in Rome, he befriended the likes of P√®re Lacordaire and Cardinals Thomas Weld and Joseph Fesch. Abandoning his pursuit of the degree of Doctor of Divinity in Rome, and departing from there in February 1837, he visited Germany, Belgium, France and England before returning to New York that summer. From August 1837 to March 1844, McCloskey served as pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Greenwich Village. His tenure at the parish was initially a rather contentious one, with the trustees refusing to pay him a salary or furnish his house; one of his younger parishioners was Eugene Casserly, later a U.S. Senator from California. He also showed concern for the needs of the homeless children living in Greenwich Village. In addition to his duties at St. Joseph's, McCloskey was the first President of St. John's College in Fordham from 1841 to 1842. Episcopal ministry =Coadjutor Bishop of New York= On November 21, 1843, McCloskey was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Axieri by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 10, 1844‚Äîhis 34th birthday‚Äîfrom Bishop John Hughes, with Bishops Benedict Fenwick (who had baptized him as a child) and Richard Vincent Whelan serving as co- consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Whereas Bishop Hughes was active and aggressive, his coadjutor was more meek and gentle.Palmo, Rocco. \\"The First Prince... and His Patrons\\", Whispers in the Loggia, March 15, 2009 McCloskey busied himself primarily with a visitation of the entire diocese, and was also instrumental in the conversion of Isaac Hecker, founder of the Paulist Fathers, and of James Roosevelt Bayley, later Archbishop of Baltimore. =Bishop of Albany= St. Mary's Church, Albany McCloskey was named the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Albany by Pope Pius IX on May 21, 1847. He was formally installed by Bishop Hughes on the following September 19. At the time of his arrival, the Upstate New York diocese covered , containing 60,000 Catholics, 25 churches, 34 priests, 2 orphanages, and 2 free schools. McCloskey first selected St. Mary's Church as his episcopal see but it soon proved unsuitable, leading him to construct the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, whose cornerstone was laid in July 1848 and dedication took place in November 1852.Walsh, John. \\"Albany.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1.

During his tenure, he increased the number of parishes to 113 and the number of priests to 84, and established three academies for boys and one for girls, four orphanages, fifteen parochial schools, and St. Joseph's Provincial Seminary in Troy. He also introduced the Augustinians, Jesuits, Franciscans, Capuchins, Religious of the Sacred Heart, Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Joseph, and Christian Brothers into the diocese. =Archbishop of New York= Lithograph of McCloskey, 1878 Following the death of Archbishop Hughes in January 1864, McCloskey was widely expected to be named his successor. Distressed by the rumors, he wrote to Cardinal Karl von Reisach of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, objecting, \\"I possess neither the learning, nor prudence, nor energy, nor firmness, nor bodily health or strength.\\" Nevertheless, he was appointed the second Archbishop of New York on May 6, 1864. McCloskey, following the end of the Civil War in 1865, resumed the construction of the new cathedral begun under his predecessor; he later dedicated it in May 1879. In 1866 he attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, where he preached the opening sermon with remarkable self-control and composure given the fact he had learned only moments before that St. Patrick's Old Cathedral had been gutted by a fire. However, the Trustees of the Cathedral immediately affirmed their intention to rebuild the Cathedral, and under the supervision of the Archbishop, the Cathedral was rebuilt sufficiently enough to celebrate Mass by Easter Sunday, April 21, 1867, just six months after the conflagration. The Cathedral rebuilding project was completed in full by March 13, 1868, and rededicated four days later on St. Patrick's Day by Archbishop McCloskey, and assisted by the pastor of the Cathedral, Father William Starrs. McCloskey participated in the First Vatican Council from 1869 to 1870, and voted in favor of papal infallibility despite his feelings that such a declaration was \\"untimely.\\" In 1873, he solemnly dedicated the Archdiocese of New York to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Imposing the Cardinal's Berretta, lithograph depicting McCloskey receiving the Cardinal's biretta from Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley. McCloskey was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria sopra Minerva by Pius IX in the consistory of March 15, 1875, thus becoming the first American cardinal. The news of his elevation was well received by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and was viewed as a sign of the growing prestige of the United States. He received the red biretta from Archbishop Bayley in a ceremony at the rebuilt St. Patrick's Cathedral on Mott Street on the following April 27. The Cardinal declared, \\"Not to my poor merits but to those of the young and already vigorous and most flourishing Catholic Church of America has this honor been given by the Supreme Pontiff. Nor am I unaware that, when the Holy Father determined to confer me this honor he had regard to the dignity of the See of New York, to the merits and devotion of the venerable clergy and numerous laity, and that he had in mind even the eminent rank of this great city and the glorious American nation.\\" Following the death of Pius IX in February 1878, McCloskey left for Rome but arrived too late to participate in the papal conclave, which elected Pope Leo XIII. The new Pope bestowed the red hat upon him on March 28, 1878. When Thomas Ewing Sherman, son of the famed Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, expressed his desire to become a Jesuit to his father, the elder Sherman wrote a letter to McCloskey in 1879 telling him to dissuade his son from such a course of action. However, the Cardinal encouraged the boy in his vocation after visiting with him. In response, the General condemned McCloskey in a St. Louis, Missouri newspaper in offensive terms and accused him of robbing him of a son. When pressed for comment by the newspaper's editor, McCloskey simply replied: \\"General Sherman's letter was marked 'personal and confidential.'\\" In 1880, he received Michael Corrigan, Bishop of Newark, as his coadjutor. His last major public appearance was in January 1884 for the Golden Jubilee celebration of his priestly ordination, for which Leo XIII sent him a jeweled chalice. In March 1884, with the help of President Chester A. Arthur and Secretary of State Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, the Cardinal helped save the Pontifical North American College from spoliation by the Italian government. McCloskey's 21-year-long tenure as Archbishop of New York was a productive one. In response to the growing Catholic population in New York, he established 88 additional parishes (for a total of 229) in the Archdiocese, 25 of them in Manhattan, four in the Bronx, and one in Staten Island; the remaining were established outside the city. Among these was the first parish for African American Catholics. The number of priests also rose from 150 to 400 during his tenure. An advocate of Catholic education, at the time of his death there were 37,000 children enrolled at archdiocesan schools. He established several charitable societies for children and a hospital for the mentally ill. Death Throughout 1885 McCloskey suffered from bouts of fever, intense pain, loss of sight, and a recurrence of malaria that aggravated what appeared to be signs of Parkinson's disease. Within a few months, he was hospitalized and later died at 75. His funeral Mass was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral on October 25, 1885; during the eulogy, Archbishop James Gibbons described him as \\"a kind father, a devoted friend, a watchful shepherd, a fearless leader and, above all, an impartial judge.\\" References External links * 1810 births 1885 deaths Pope Pius IX 19th- century Roman Catholic archbishops American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent American cardinals Cardinals created by Pope Pius IX Fordham University faculty People from Brooklyn Roman Catholic Archbishops of New York Burials at St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan) Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany Mount St. Mary's University alumni Religious leaders from New York (state) Catholics from New York (state) ","title":"John McCloskey"},{"id":"245245","text":"John Joseph Hughes (June 24, 1797 ‚Äì January 3, 1864) was an Irish-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. He was the fourth Bishop and first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, serving between 1842 and his death in 1864. In 1841, he founded St. John's College, which would later become Fordham University. A native of Ireland, Hughes was born and raised in the south of County Tyrone. He emigrated to the United States in 1817, and became a priest in 1826 and a bishop in 1838. A figure of national prominence, he exercised great moral and social influence, and presided over a period of explosive growth for Catholicism in New York. He was regarded as \\"the best known, if not exactly the best loved, Catholic bishop in the country.\\" He became known as \\"Dagger John,\\" both for his following the Catholic practice wherein a bishop precedes his signature with a cross, as well as for his aggressive personality. Early life Hughes was born in the hamlet of Annaloghan, near Aughnacloy, in County Tyrone, part of the Province of Ulster in the north of Ireland. He was the third of seven children of Patrick and Margaret (n√©e McKenna) Hughes. In reference to the anti-Catholic penal laws of Ireland, he later observed that, prior to his baptism, he had lived the first five days of his life on terms of \\"social and civil equality with the most favored subjects of the British Empire.\\" He and his family suffered religious persecution in their native land; his late sister was denied a Catholic burial conducted by a priest, and Hughes himself was nearly attacked by a group of Orangemen when he was about 15. He was sent with his elder brothers to a day school in the nearby village of Augher, and afterwards attended a grammar school in Aughnacloy. Patrick Hughes, a poor but respectable tenant farmer, was forced to withdraw John from school and sent him to work one of his farms. However, being disinclined to farm life, he was placed as an apprentice to Roger Toland, the gardener at Favour Royal Manor, to study horticulture. His family emigrated to the United States in 1816 and settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Hughes joined them there the following year. He made several unsuccessful applications to Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he was eventually hired by its Rector, the Abb√© John Dubois, S.S., as a gardener. During this time he befriended Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was favorably impressed by Hughes and persuaded Dubois to reconsider his admission. Hughes was subsequently admitted as a regular student of Mount St. Mary's in September 1820. In addition to his studies, he continued to supervise the garden, and served as a tutor in Latin and mathematics as well as prefect over the other students. At that time, the president of Mount St. Mary's was the brilliant Simon Brut√©, who also lectured on Sacred Scripture and taught Theology and Moral Philosophy. (Brut√© would later become the first bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana.) Hughes would on numerous occasions consult with his former teacher for advice long after he had left Emmitsburg. Priesthood As a seminarian, Hughes resolved to serve his home Diocese of Philadelphia, then governed by Bishop Henry Conwell. The bishop, while performing a canonical visitation of his diocese, met Hughes at his parents' home in Chambersburg and invited him to accompany him on the remainder of his visitation. On October 15, 1826, Hughes was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Conwell at Old St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. Hughes' first assignment was as a curate at St. Augustine's Church in Philadelphia, where he assisted its pastor, the Rev. Father Michael Hurley, O.E.S.A., by celebrating Mass, hearing confessions, preaching sermons, and other duties in the parish. Later that year he was sent to serve as a missionary in Bedford, where he secured the conversions of several Protestants. In January 1827, he was recalled to Philadelphia and named pastor of St. Joseph's Church. He laboured afterwards at St. Mary's Church, whose trustees were in open revolt against the bishop, and were subdued by Hughes only when he built St. John the Evangelist Church in 1832, then considered one of the finest in the country. Previous to this, in 1829, he founded St. John's Orphan Asylum. About this time Hughes became engaged in a public controversy over Catholic beliefs with the Rev. John A. Breckinridge, a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman and son of the former Attorney General in the Jefferson Administration. Several debates ensued between the two concerning whether Catholicism was compatible with American republicanism and liberty. Though it was predicted that the Irish immigrant would be outclassed by his better educated Protestant adversary, Hughes acquitted himself very well against his opponent's attacks on his religion. The debates resulted in the pugnacious Hughes' emergence as a vigorous defender of Catholicism in America. His name was mentioned for the vacant see of Cincinnati and as a coadjutor for Philadelphia. Episcopacy The episcopal coat of arms of Archbishop John J. Hughes =Coadjutor bishop= Hughes was chosen by Pope Gregory XVI as the coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of New York on August 7, 1837. He was consecrated bishop at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral on January 7, 1838, with the title of the titular see of Basilinopolis, by the Bishop of New York, John Dubois, S.S., his former Rector. Although wishing Hughes no ill, many of the priests in the diocese had favored the popular Rev John Power, Vicar-General. Power had been overlooked for the position in 1826 when Dubois won the appointment as bishop. The clergy demonstrated their disappointment by not attending the consecration. =Trusteeism= One challenge Hughes took on upon arriving in New York was the dispute between the trustees of various parishes in the city, who held the control of these institutions. This practice was known as trusteeism, and the bishop challenged both the practicality and the legitimacy of it. Hughes drew upon his experience with this situation in Philadelphia and was able to get a referendum passed by the Catholics of the city in 1841 supporting the authority of the bishop. =Education= Hughes also campaigned actively on behalf of Irish immigrants, and attempted to secure state support for parochial schools; the effort failed. He protested against the standard use of the King James Bible in public schools by the Public School Society, a private organization which operated the schools of New York City. He claimed that it was an attack on Catholic constitutional rights of double taxation, because Catholics would need to pay taxes for public school and also pay for the parochial school to send their children, to avoid having their children indoctrinated by teachers following the Protestant teachings footnoted in that translation of the Bible. However there are no footnotes in the King James Bible. When he failed to secure state support, he founded an independent Catholic school system in New York, as did other Catholic centers. The resulting parochial school systems which became an integral part of the Catholic Church's structure two decades after Hughes died, at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884). It mandated that all parishes nationwide have a school and that all Catholic children be sent to those schools.David Tyack, The One Best System: A History of American Urban Education (2nd ed. 1974) pp 84-85. =Bishop of New York= Hughes was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the diocese the following year, due to Dubois' failing health. As coadjutor, he automatically succeeded Dubois upon the bishop's death on December 20, 1842. He took over a diocese which covered the entire State of New York and northern New Jersey, having only some 40 priests to serve a Catholic population estimated to be about 200,000 at the time. In 1844 anti-Catholic riots instigated by Nativist agitators threatened to spread to New York from Philadelphia, where two churches had been burned and twelve people had died. Hughes put armed guards at Catholic churches and, after learning a Nativist rally was scheduled to take place in New York, famously told the Nativist sympathizing mayor that \\"if a single Catholic Church were burned in New York, the city would become a second Moscow\\" ‚Äì a reference to the Fire of Moscow. City leaders took him at his word, and the anti-Catholic faction was not allowed to conduct its rally. Hughes founded the Ultramontane newspaper the New York Freeman to express his ideas. In 1850 he delivered an address entitled \\"The Decline of Protestantism and Its Causes,\\" in which he announced as the ambition of Catholicism \\"to convert all Pagan nations, and all Protestant nations. . . . Our mission [is] to convert the world ‚Äìincluding the inhabitants of the United States ‚Äì the people of the cities, and the people of the country, . . . the Legislatures, the Senate, the Cabinet, the President, and all!\\"James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (New York: Bantam Books, 1989), p. 132. Hughes held a \\"strong commitment to the cause of Irish freedom\\" but also felt that immigrants, particularly his fellow Irish immigrants, \\"should demonstrate their unswerving loyalty to their adopted land.\\" =Archbishop= Hughes became an archbishop on July 19, 1850, when the diocese was elevated to the status of archdiocese by Pope Pius IX. As archbishop, Hughes became the metropolitan for the Catholic bishops serving all the dioceses established in the entire Northeastern United States. He convened the first meeting of the Ecclesiastical Province of New York in September 1854. After this he traveled to Rome, where he was present at the proclamation of the Immaculate Conception as a dogma of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius. Hughes served as President Lincoln's semiofficial envoy to the Vatican and to France in later 1861 and early 1862. Lincoln also sought Hughes' advice on the appointment of hospital chaplains. In an address in March 1852, Hughes lionized what he referred to as the \\"spirit of the constitution,\\" expressed hope that the \\"parties\\" of the republic would be completely \\"penetrated\\" by that spirit, and stated that the founders' achievements in the realm of religious freedom were \\"original\\" in history and that the constitution's \\"negation of all power to legislate\\" on \\"rights of conscience\\" made American law on that topic superior to that of other countries which had secured these rights \\"by some positive statute.\\" In the same address, Hughes also expressed sentiments of religious toleration, stating that \\"we are indebted\\" to the \\"liberality of Protestantism,\\" in light of the fact that the framers of the Constitution \\"were almost, if not altogether, exclusively Protestants,\\" while averring that the strong leadership of Washington and the variety of opposing Protestant views were likely more influential to the framers' stance on religious freedom than Protestantism itself. Hughes also stated that \\"the great men who framed the Constitution saw, with keen and delicate perception, that the right to tolerate implied the equal right to refuse toleration, and on behalf of the United States, as a civil government, they denied all right to legislate in the premises, one way or the other.\\" He affirmed the role of Catholic soldiers in American wars, declaring, \\"I think I shall be safe in saying that there has not been one important campaign or engagement in which Catholics have not bivouacked, fought, and fallen by the side of Protestants, in maintaining the rights and honor of their common country.\\" Hughes also said that \\"It is... out of place, and altogether untrue, to assert or assume that this is a Protestant country or a Catholic country. It is neither. It is a land of religious freedom and equality; and I hope that, in this respect, it shall remain just what it now is to the latest posterity,\\" and also that \\"Catholics, as such, are by no means strangers and foreigners in this land.... The Catholics have been here from the earliest dawn of the morning.\\" Hughes held misgivings regarding slavery, but felt that the conditions of the \\"starving laborers\\" in the Northern states were often worse than that of slaves in the South, and also believed that the Abolitionist movement could veer towards ideological excess. He felt that Abolitionists were wrong when they focused on the hardships of Southern slaves while disregarding the issues facing Northern urban workers. Death Archbishop Hughes, prepared for burial Hughes served as archbishop until his death. He was originally buried in the old St. Patrick's Cathedral, but his remains were exhumed in 1882 and reinterred in the crypt under the altar of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral which he had undertaken to build. Character Monsignor Thomas Shelley in his study on Hughes described him as a very \\"complex character,\\" with one side that was \\"impetuous and authoritarian, a poor administrator and worse financial manager, indifferent to the non-Irish members of his flock, and prone to invent reality when it suited the purposes of his rhetoric.\\" But Shelley finds this did not detract from the effectiveness of Hughes, who established 61 new parishes along with many other institutions. Historian Daniel Walker Howe writes that Hughes \\"labored to bring a largely working-class Irish community into a meaningful relationship with Catholic Christianity\\" while at the same time working \\"to conciliate middle-class Catholics and Protestant well-wishers whose financial support he needed for his amazingly ambitious program of building.\\" Howe continues, \\"Although no theologian, John Hughes ranks high for political judgment and in the significance of his accomplishments among nineteenth century American statesmen, civil as well as ecclesiastical. He successfully coped with fierce party competition in New York, bitter battles over the public school system, revolutions in Europe, the rise of nativism across the United States, and soaring rates of immigration after the Great Famine of Ireland. He encouraged his people to hard work, personal discipline, and upward social mobility.\\" \\"Crucially, he combined his staunch American patriotism with staunch devotion to a nineteenth-century papacy deeply suspicious of all liberalism, especially American.\\" Hughes \\"succeeded in fostering a strong Irish American identity, one centered on the Catholic faith rather than on the secular radicalism of the Irish nationalists who competed with him for community leadership.\\" This achievement, however, came \\"at the cost of losing to the Irish-American community the Irish Protestant immigrants.\\"Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought?, Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 199-200. According to his later successor, Patrick Cardinal Hayes, named archbishop of New York in 1919, Archbishop Hughes was severe of manner, and kindly of heart, but was not aggressive until assailed. Legacy In New York, Hughes founded St. John's College (now Fordham University) and, under his administration, invited many religious congregations to staff schools in New York, among them members of the Society of Jesus to whom he entrusted the care of his college, who also established Fordham Prep; the Brothers of the Christian Schools who founded Manhattan College; and he established as an autonomous congregation the Sisters of Charity of New York, in which his sister Angela was a member, who founded the Academy of Mount St. Vincent (now College of Mount Saint Vincent). \\"Hughes Hall,\\" the first purpose-built home of Fordham Prep, was named for the archbishop in 1935. The building currently houses Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business on its Rose Hill campus. There is also a dining space on the Rose Hill campus named \\"Dagger John's\\" in honor of Hughes. In addition, each year, Fordham recognizes a graduating senior who has demonstrated achievement in the study of philosophy with an award named in honor of Hughes. To the dismay of many in New York's Protestant upper-class, Hughes foresaw the uptown expansion of the city and began construction of the current St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Street, laying its cornerstone on August 15, 1858. It was not completed until after his death. At the time, due to its remote location in a still-rural part of Manhattan, the new cathedral was initially dubbed \\"Hughes' Folly\\" by the press for many years. Ultimately, Hughes' foresight proved providential, as the rapid urban growth uptown would soon place the new cathedral in the emerging urban center of midtown Manhattan.

Deeply interested in the missions of the United States, Concanen was instrumental in procuring permission for Father Edward Fenwick OP to leave England to set up a Dominican province in America. He made large contributions to St. Rose Priory in Kentucky, and bequeathed the Priory his library. On April 8, 1808, Concanen was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Diocese of New York by Pope Pius VII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 24 from Cardinal Michele di Pietro, with Archbishops Tommaso Arezzo and Benedetto Sinibaldi serving as co-consecrators. However, Concanen never stepped on American soil; due to the embargoes enacted during the Napoleonic Wars, he was unable to sail from the Port of Naples and was even detained as a British subject by the French forces in possession of the city.

The dative has replaced the nominative in a few regional Irish dialects (particularly Galway-Connemara and Waterford).Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Erin Poets and nineteenth-century Irish nationalists used Erin in English as a romantic name for Ireland. Often, \\"Erin's Isle\\" was used. In this context, along with Hibernia, Erin is the name given to the female personification of Ireland, but the name was rarely used as a given name, probably because no saints, queens, or literary figures were ever called Erin. According to Irish mythology and folklore, the name was originally given to the island by the Milesians after the goddess √âriu. Erin go bragh (\\"√âire go br√°ch\\" in standard orthography, dative \\"in √âirinn go br√°ch\\" \\"in Ireland forever\\"), a slogan dating from the 1798 revolution, is often translated as \\"Ireland forever\\".

In mathematics, an L-function is a meromorphic function on the complex plane, associated to one out of several categories of mathematical objects. An L-series is a Dirichlet series, usually convergent on a half- plane, that may give rise to an L-function via analytic continuation. The Riemann zeta function is an example of an L-function, and one important result involving L-functions is the Riemann hypothesis and its generalization. The theory of L-functions has become a very substantial, and still largely conjectural, part of contemporary analytic number theory. In it, broad generalisations of the Riemann zeta function and the L-series for a Dirichlet character are constructed, and their general properties, in most cases still out of reach of proof, are set out in a systematic way. Because of the Euler product formula there is a deep connection between L-functions and the theory of prime numbers.  Construction  We distinguish at the outset between the L-series, an infinite series representation (for example the Dirichlet series for the Riemann zeta function), and the L-function, the function in the complex plane that is its analytic continuation. The general constructions start with an L-series, defined first as a Dirichlet series, and then by an expansion as an Euler product indexed by prime numbers. Estimates are required to prove that this converges in some right half-plane of the complex numbers. Then one asks whether the function so defined can be analytically continued to the rest of the complex plane (perhaps with some poles). It is this (conjectural) meromorphic continuation to the complex plane which is called an L-function. In the classical cases, already, one knows that useful information is contained in the values and behaviour of the L-function at points where the series representation does not converge. The general term L-function here includes many known types of zeta-functions. The Selberg class is an attempt to capture the core properties of L-functions in a set of axioms, thus encouraging the study of the properties of the class rather than of individual functions.  Conjectural information  One can list characteristics of known examples of L-functions that one would wish to see generalized: * location of zeros and poles; * functional equation, with respect to some vertical line Re(s) = constant; * interesting values at integers related to quantities from algebraic K-theory. Detailed work has produced a large body of plausible conjectures, for example about the exact type of functional equation that should apply. Since the Riemann zeta-function connects through its values at positive even integers (and negative odd integers) to the Bernoulli numbers, one looks for an appropriate generalisation of that phenomenon. In that case results have been obtained for p-adic L-functions, which describe certain Galois modules. The statistics of the zero distributions are of interest because of their connection to problems like the generalized Riemann hypothesis, distribution of prime numbers, etc. The connections with random matrix theory and quantum chaos are also of interest. The fractal structure of the distributions has been studied using rescaled range analysis. The self- similarity of the zero distribution is quite remarkable, and is characterized by a large fractal dimension of 1.9. This rather large fractal dimension is found over zeros covering at least fifteen orders of magnitude for the Riemann zeta function, and also for the zeros of other L-functions of different orders and conductors.  Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture  One of the influential examples, both for the history of the more general L-functions and as a still-open research problem, is the conjecture developed by Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer in the early part of the 1960s. It applies to an elliptic curve E, and the problem it attempts to solve is the prediction of the rank of the elliptic curve over the rational numbers (or another global field): i.e. the number of free generators of its group of rational points. Much previous work in the area began to be unified around a better knowledge of L-functions. This was something like a paradigm example of the nascent theory of L-functions.  Rise of the general theory  This development preceded the Langlands program by a few years, and can be regarded as complementary to it: Langlands' work relates largely to Artin L-functions, which, like Hecke L-functions, were defined several decades earlier, and to L-functions attached to general automorphic representations. Gradually it became clearer in what sense the construction of Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta-functions might be made to work to provide valid L-functions, in the analytic sense: there should be some input from analysis, which meant automorphic analysis. The general case now unifies at a conceptual level a number of different research programs.

It is nominally associated with Sandwich, Kent. It was created in 1660 for the prominent naval commander Admiral Sir Edward Montagu. He was made Baron Montagu, of St Neots in the County of Huntingdon, and Viscount Hinchingbrooke, at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. The viscountcy is used as the courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. A member of the prominent Montagu family, Lord Sandwich was the son of Sir Sidney Montagu, youngest brother of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (from whom the Dukes of Manchester descend), and Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton (from whom the Dukes of Montagu descended). He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He briefly represented Dover in the House of Commons and served as Ambassador to Portugal and as Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire. The second Earl's great-grandson was The 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was a prominent statesman and served as First Lord of the Admiralty and as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Lord Sandwich is also remembered for sponsoring the voyages of discovery made by Captain James Cook, R.N., who named the Sandwich Islands in his honour, and as the namesake of the sandwich. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Brackley and Huntingdonshire and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and as Master of the Buckhounds. His son, the sixth Earl, also represented Huntingdonshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He held office in the first two Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Master of the Buckhounds and was also Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire. His eldest son, the eighth Earl, represented Huntingdon in the House of Commons as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire. He was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Victor Alexander Montagu, second son of the seventh Earl. Lord Sandwich was Member of Parliament for Huntingdon and Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire. His son, the tenth Earl, represented South Dorset in Parliament as a Conservative from 1941 to 1962, when he succeeded his father in the earldom and had to resign his seat in the House of Commons and enter the House of Lords. He disclaimed his peerages in 1964 but never returned to the House of Commons. , the titles are held by his eldest son, the eleventh Earl, who succeeded in 1995. Lord Sandwich is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. The family seat is today at Mapperton in Dorset. From the 17th century until the 1960s, the family also owned Hinchingbrooke House in Huntingdonshire, from which the title Viscount Hinchingbrooke was derived. Some historical papers of the family and its Hinchingbrooke estate are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Huntingdon.

It has a population of about 21,000. History Silver mining and processing in Kutn√° Hora, 1490s The town began in 1142 with the settlement of Sedlec Abbey, the first Cistercian monastery in Bohemia, Sedlec Monastery, brought from the Imperial immediate Cistercian Waldsassen Abbey. By 1260, German miners began to mine for silver in the mountain region, which they named Kuttenberg, and which was part of the monastery property. The name of the mountain is said to have derived from the monks' cowls (the Kutten) or from the word mining (kut√°n√≠ in old Czech). Under Abbot Heidenreich, the territory greatly advanced due to the silver mines which gained importance during the economic boom of the 13th century. The earliest traces of silver have been found dating back to the 10th century, when Bohemia already had been in the crossroads of long-distance trade for many centuries. Silver dinars have been discovered belonging to the period between 982 and 995 in the settlement of Mal√≠n, which is now a part of Kutn√° Hora. From the 13th to 16th centuries, the town competed with Prague economically, culturally, and politically. Since 1995, the town center has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1300, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia issued the new royal mining code Ius regale montanorum (also known as Constitutiones Iuris Metallici Wenceslai II). This was a legal document that specified all administrative as well as technical terms and conditions necessary for the operation of mines. The town developed with great rapidity, and at the outbreak of the Hussite Wars in 1419 was the second most important town in Bohemia after Prague, having become the favourite residence of several Bohemian kings. It was here that, on January 18, 1409, Wenceslaus IV signed the famous Decree of Kutn√° Hora, by which the Czech university nation was given three votes in the elections to the faculty of Prague University as against one for the three other nations. In 1420, Emperor Sigismund made the town the base for his unsuccessful attack on the Taborites during the Hussite Wars, leading to the Battle of Kutn√° Hora. Kuttenberg (Kutn√° Hora) was taken by Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, and after a temporary reconciliation of the warring parties was burned by the imperial troops in 1422, to prevent its falling again into the hands of the Taborites. ≈Ωi≈æka nonetheless took the place, and under Bohemian auspices it awoke to a new period of prosperity. Along with the rest of Bohemia, Kuttenberg (Kutn√° Hora) passed to the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526. In 1546, the richest mine was severely flooded. In the insurrection of Bohemia against Ferdinand I the town lost all its privileges. Repeated visitations of the plague and the horrors of the Thirty Years' War completed its ruin. Half-hearted attempts after the peace to repair the ruined mines failed; the town became impoverished, and in 1770 was devastated by fire. The mines were abandoned at the end of the 18th century. In this town, Prague groschen were minted between 1300 and 1547/48. In May 1742 during the First Silesian War, a Prussian force under Frederick the Great stopped in the town prior to the Battle of Chotusitz. Bohemia was a crownland of the Austrian Empire in 1806, and remained controlled by the Austrian monarchy after the compromise of 1867). Until 1918, Kuttenberg was the capital of the district of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Wilhelm Klein (1967). Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890 Together with the rest of Bohemia, the town became part of the newly founded Czechoslovakia after World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary. Kutn√° Hora was incorporated into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia by Nazi Germany in the period 1939‚Äì1945, but was restored to Czechoslovakia after World War II. The town became part of the Czech Republic in 1993, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Architecture The center of Kutn√° Hora and Sedlec Abbey with its famous ossuary are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is estimated that the ossuary is decorated with bones of more than 40,000 skeletons. Among the most important buildings in the town are the Gothic, five-naved St. Barbara's Church, begun in 1388, and the Italian Court, formerly a royal residence and mint, which was built at the end of the 13th century. The Gothic Stone Haus, which since 1902 has served as a museum, contains one of the richest archives in the country. The Gothic St. James's Church, with its tower, is another prominent building. Sedlec is the site of the Gothic Cathedral of Our Lady and the famous Ossuary.

The family contains a single genus, Hemiprocne, with four species. They are distributed from India and South East Asia through Indonesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Treeswifts are small to medium-sized swifts, ranging in length from 15‚Äì30 cm. They have long wings, with most of the length coming from the length of the primaries; their arms are actually quite short. They visibly differ from the other swifts in matters of plumage, which is softer, and they have crests or other facial ornaments, and long forked tails. Anatomically they are separated from the true swifts by skeletal details in the cranium and palate, the anatomy of the tarsus, and a non-reversible hind toe which is used for perching on branches (an activity that true swifts are unable to engage in). The males have iridescent mantle plumage. They also have diastataxic wings, that is they lack a fifth secondary feather unlike swifts in the Apdodini which are eutaxic. Moustached treeswift on its nest. Biak, New Guinea. The treeswifts exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences. One species, the whiskered treeswift, is a species of primary forest. Highly manoeuvrable, it feeds close to vegetation beneath the canopy, and only rarely ventures into secondary forests or plantations, but never over open ground. Other species are less restricted; the crested treeswift makes use of a range of habitats including humid forests and deciduous woodland, and the grey-rumped treeswift occupies almost every habitat type available from the mangrove forests to hill forests. All species feed on insects, although exact details of what prey are taken has not been studied in detail. Nest building responsibilities are shared by the male and female. They lay one egg in the nest, which is glued to an open tree branch. Egg colour varies from white to grey. There is little information about incubation times, but they are thought to be longer for the larger species. Chicks are born with a covering of grey down and are fed a bolus of regurgitated food by the parents.

He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror and, while he saved Madame Tussaud from the Guillotine,Undine Concannon, 'Tussaud , Anna Maria (bap. 1761, d. 1850)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 he administered the execution of more than 2,000 people in the city of Lyon. Early life Born in Paris, Collot left his home in the rue St. Jacques in his teens to join the travelling theatres of provincial France. His moderately successful career as an actor, supplemented by a vigorous outpouring of works for the stage, took him from Bordeaux in the south of France to Nantes in the west and Lille in the north and even into the Dutch Republic, where he met his wife. In 1784 he became director of the theatre in Geneva, Switzerland, and then at the prestigious playhouse at Lyon in 1787. At the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 he dropped everything and returned to Paris, where his lead actor's voice, his writing skills, and his ability to organise and direct large-scale f√™tes (civic feasts) were to make him famous. Activism He contributed to revolutionary agitation from the very beginning; but it was not until 1791 that he became a figure of importance. With the publication of L'Almanach du P√®re G√©rard, a book advocating a constitutional monarchy in popular terms, he suddenly acquired great popularity. His fame was soon increased by his involvement on behalf of the Swiss of the Ch√¢teau-Vieux Regiment, condemned to the galleys for mutiny at Nancy. Collot d'Herbois' efforts resulted in their freedom; he went to Brest in search of them; and a civic feast was held on his behalf and theirs, which occasioned for a poem by Andr√© de Ch√©nier. His opinions became more and more radical. Collot d'Herbois was a member of the Paris Commune during the insurrection of 10 August 1792, and was elected deputy for Paris to the National Convention. On the first day of the Convention (21 September 1792) he was the first to demand the abolition of the French monarchy. Collot d'Herbois later voted for the death of Louis XVI \\"sans sursis\\" (\\"without delay\\"). Terror, Thermidor, Deportation and Death He was engaged in the struggle between the Mountain and the Girondists. After Fran√ßois Hanriot's coup d'√©tat of 31 May 1793, he was conspicuous in his attack on the defeated Girondist party. Along with his close friend Billaud-Varenne, he sat at the extreme left of the Convention, attacking speculators, and proposing egalitarian programmes. In June, he was made president of the Convention; and in September he joined the Committee of Public Safety, where he was active as a sort of general secretary. After having entrusted him with several missions to Nice, Nevers, and Compi√®gne, the Convention sent him along with Joseph Fouch√©, on 30 October 1793, to punish the revolt of Lyon. There, he introduced the Reign of Terror in its most violent form, with mass executions, including more than a hundred priests and nuns, and beginning the dismantling of the city itself.Citizens: A Chronicle of The French Revolution, Simon Schama, Penguin UK 2004 His excessive behavior led the Committee of Public Safety to have Collot return to Paris as a suspect. The month of May 1794 saw assassination attempts on both himself on the 23rd and on Maximilien Robespierre on the 25th. As Collot was accused of excessive slaughter and destruction and he suspected that he might soon be arrested and executed, he opposed Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction, when he presided over the Convention during the initial session. Despite this change of heart, Collot d'Herbois was accused of complicity with Robespierre, the two having previously been colleagues on the Committee of Public Safety, but was acquitted. Denounced a second time, he defended himself by pleading that he had acted for the Revolution; but, in March 1795, he was condemned with Bertrand Bar√®re de Vieuzac and Billaud-Varenne to transportation to Cayenne, French Guiana where he exerted a brief revolutionary influence before dying of yellow fever in 1796.Narrative of the Deportation to Cayenne, of Barth√©lemy, Pichegru, &c.; in Consequence of the Revolution of the 18th Fructidor, (General J.P. Ramel) J. Wright, 1799 p.91  Works  Beginning his literary career in 1772 with the critically acclaimed Lucie, ou les Parents imprudents and finishing in 1792 with L'A√Æn√© et le cadet, Collot was an accomplished, if minor, dramatist in a turbulent period of the French stage. Before the Revolution, he wrote at least fifteen plays, of which ten survive, including Lucie, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor (as M. Rodomont, ou l'Amant loup-garou), and an adaptation of Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca's El Alcalde de Zalamea (Il y a bonne justice, ou le Paysan magistrat), all three of which kept the stage throughout France for over a decade. During the first three years of the Revolution he wrote at least seven more plays, of which six survive, juggling the tearful love themes of le drame bourgeois with political themes and messages in such plays as L'Inconnu, ou le Pr√©jug√© vaincu and Socrate (on Socrates). In 1791, he wrote the prize-winning L'Almanach de p√®re G√©rard, a fictional account of revolutionary morality which went on to become the best-seller of the period, establishing his political credentials in the process. He was also one of the authors of the first French republican Constitution, which was written in 1793 but never applied.Crowe, Michael Bertram. 1977. The Changing Profile of the Natural Law.

The resulting poem can be defined as either treated: changed in a profound and systematic manner; or untreated: virtually unchanged from the order, syntax and meaning of the poem. The form was popularised by comedian Dave Gorman, who would include a found poem compiled from Internet comments around a topical theme in every episode of his television show Dave Gorman: Modern Life Is Goodish. Concepts The concept of found poetry is closely connected to the revision of the concept of authorship in the 20th century, (as John Hollander put it, \\"anyone may 'find' a text; the poet is he who names it, 'TextHollander, John. Vision and Resonance, Two Senses of Poetic Form. Oxford University Press, 1975. 215.) and its first known use was in 1966. (First known use of the form) Types of common forms and practices of found poetry include free form excerpting and remixing, erasure, cento and cut-up.'Types of Found Poetry' Found Poetry Review  Comparisons and predecessors  Marquive Stenzel describes the Dadaism movement with its readymade philosophy as a predecessor for the practice that later became found poetry. Dadaists like Duchamp placed everyday practical objects in an environment that was aesthetic and in so doing called into question that object as art, the observer, the aesthetic environment and the definition of what is art.Stanzel, Franz K. \\"Texts Recycled: 'Found' Poems Found in Canada.\\" Gaining Ground: European Critics on Canadian Literaturee. Eds. Robert Kroetsch and Reingard M. Nischik. Edmonton: NeWest Press, 1985. 91-106. Stylistically, found poetry is similar to the visual art of \\"appropriation\\" in which two- and three-dimensional art is created from recycled items, giving ordinary/commercial things new meaning when put within a new context in unexpected combinations or juxtapositions.  Examples  An example of found poetry appeared in William Whewell's \\"An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics\\":Whewell, William. An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics, page 44. Cambridge (England), 1819. > Hence no force, however great, can stretch a cord, however fine, into a > horizontal line which is accurately straight. In 2003, Slate writer Hart Seely found poetry in the speeches and news briefings of Donald Rumsfeld. In a transcript of a Department of Defense news briefing from February 12, 2002, Rumsfeld ruminated on \\"The Unknown\\":The Poetry of D.H. Rumsfeld, Hart Seely, Slate Magazine, 2 April 2003 > As we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We > also know There are known unknowns. That is to say We know there are some > things We do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, The ones we > don't know We don't know. Hart Seely published Rumsfeld's poetry in the book, Pieces of Intelligence: The Existential Poetry of Donald H. Rumsfeld (2003). American composer Phil Kline set Rumsfeld's lyrics to music in \\"Rumsfeld's Songs\\", a song cycle released on Zippo Songs (2004). Pianist Bryant Kong also used Rumsfeld's lyrics on his release \\"Poetry of Donald Rumsfeld\\". In 2009, on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, the talk show host twice asked actor William Shatner to deliver the written words of former Alaskan Governor and Vice-Presidential nominee Sarah Palin in the style of beat poetry. Shatner performed Palin's farewell speech on July 27, and several of her tweets on July 29. Shatner was supported by a bongo player and contrabassist. Another well-known example of a public figure's speech being converted into found poetry was the baseball play calls of Phil Rizzuto. Rizzuto was the announcer for the New York Yankees baseball team for some 40 years, and some of his at times rambling or disjointed commentary was collected and reformatted by Hart Seely and Tom Peyer into a collection of Rizzuto's found poetry. An example is Rizzuto's thoughts on the death of Yankees catcher Thurmon Munson in an airplane crash: > \\"The Man in the Moon\\" The Yankees have had a traumatic four days. Actually > five days. That terrible crash with Thurman Munson. To go through all that > agony, And then today, You and I along with the rest of the team Flew to > Canton for the services, And the family... Very upset.

I just saw the full moon, And it just reminded me of > Thurman Munson, And that's it. The website Verbatim Poetry has been publishing found poems weekly since March 2009. It emphasizes the poetry found in ordinary places, and employs traditional poetic forms such as the Shakespearean sonnet as well as free verse. The Internet's first formal literary journal devoted to found poetry, The Found Poetry Review, debuted in 2011. Since its inception, the quarterly journal has featured traditional centos and poems taken from textbooks, Marcel Duchamp paintings, Charles Manson's trial testimony, AOL search data, Emily Post's etiquette books, Wikipedia articles, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, Wonder Woman comics and more. Comedian Dave Gorman frequently creates comical found poems using bizarre or humorous comments that people have left in the comment sections of online news websites on his Dave series Dave Gorman: Modern Life Is Goodish.

The earliest works in Galician language are from the early 13th-century trovadorismo tradition. In the Middle Ages, Galego-portugu√™s (Galician- Portuguese) was a language of culture, poetry (troubadours) and religion throughout not only Galicia and Portugal but also Castile. After the separation of Portuguese and Galician, Galician was considered provincial and was not widely used for literary or academic purposes.

Much literature by Galician authors is written in Spanish, such as by Ignacio Ramonet or Gonzalo Torrente Ballester - though such writers tend to be excluded from discussion of Galician literature and counted as Spanish-language literature.Jo Labanyi Spanish Literature: A Very Short Introduction 2010 \\"An issue here is how to classify Catalan, Galician, and Basque authors who write in Castilian.

Artin was one of the leading mathematicians of the twentieth century. He is best known for his work on algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields. Along with Emmy Noether, he is considered the founder of modern abstract algebra. Early life and education =Parents= Emil Artin was born in Vienna to parents Emma Maria, n√©e Laura (stage name Clarus), a soubrette on the operetta stages of Austria and Germany, and Emil Hadochadus Maria Artin, Austrian-born of mixed Austrian and Armenian descent.Armenia honors mathematician Dmitry Mirimanoff Ben Yandell, The honors class: Hilbert‚Äôs problems and their solvers, A K Peters, Ltd., 2002, , 9781568812168Notices of the AMS. Vol. 49, # 4, April 2002, pp. 469‚Äì470 Several documents, including Emil's birth certificate, list the father's occupation as ‚Äúopera singer‚Äù though others list it as ‚Äúart dealer.‚Äù It seems at least plausible that he and Emma had met as colleagues in the theater. They were married in St. Stephen's Parish on July 24, 1895. =Early education= Artin entered school in September 1904, presumably in Vienna. By then, his father was already suffering symptoms of advanced syphilis, among them increasing mental instability, and was eventually institutionalized at the recently established (and imperially sponsored) insane asylum at Mauer √ñhling, 125 kilometers west of Vienna. It is notable that neither wife nor child contracted this highly infectious disease. Artin's father died there July 20, 1906. Young Artin was eight. On July 15, 1907, Artin's mother remarried to a man named Rudolf H√ºbner: a prosperous manufacturing entrepreneur in the German-speaking city then called Reichenberg, Bohemia (currently known as Liberec, in the Czech Republic). Documentary evidence suggests that Emma had already been a resident in Reichenberg the previous year, and in deference to her new husband, she had abandoned her vocal career. H√ºbner deemed a life in the theater unseemly ‚Äî unfit for the wife of a man of his position. In September, 1907, Artin entered the Volksschule in Strobnitz, a small town in southern Czechoslovakia near the Austrian border. For that year, he lived away from home, boarding on a local farm. The following year, he returned to the home of his mother and stepfather, and entered the Realschule in Reichenberg, where he pursued his secondary education until June, 1916. In Reichenberg, Artin formed a lifelong friendship with a young neighbor, Arthur Baer, who became an astronomer, teaching for many years at Cambridge University. Astronomy was an interest the two boys shared already at this time. They each had telescopes. They also rigged a telegraph between their houses, over which once Baer excitedly reported to his friend an astronomical discovery he thought he had made‚Äîperhaps a supernova, he thought‚Äîand told Artin where in the sky to look. Artin tapped back the terse reply ‚ÄúA-N-D-R-O-M-E-D-A N-E-B- E-L.‚Äù (Andromeda nebula) Artin's academic performance in the first years at the Realschule was spotty. Up to the end of the 1911‚Äì1912 school year, for instance, his grade in mathematics was merely ‚Äúgen√ºgend,‚Äù (satisfactory). Of his mathematical inclinations at this early period he later wrote, ‚ÄúMeine eigene Vorliebe zur Mathematik zeigte sich erst im sechzehnten Lebensjahr, w√§hrend vorher von irgendeiner Anlage dazu √ºberhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte.‚Äù (‚ÄúMy own predilection for mathematics manifested itself only in my sixteenth year; before that, one could certainly not speak of any particular aptitude for it.‚Äù) His grade in French for 1912 was actually ‚Äúnicht gen√ºgend‚Äù (unsatisfactory). He did rather better work in physics and chemistry. But from 1910 to 1912, his grade for ‚ÄúComportment‚Äù was ‚Äúnicht gen√ºgend.‚Äù Artin spent the school year 1912‚Äì1913 away from home, in France, a period he spoke of later as one of the happiest of his life. He lived that year with the family of Edmond Fritz, in the vicinity of Paris, and attended a school there. When he returned from France to Reichenberg, his academic work markedly improved, and he began consistently receiving grades of ‚Äúgut‚Äù or ‚Äúsehr gut‚Äù (good or very good) in virtually all subjects‚Äîincluding French and ‚ÄúComportment.‚Äù By the time he completed studies at the Realschule in June, 1916, he was awarded the Reifezeugnis (diploma‚Äînot to be confused with the Abitur) that affirmed him ‚Äúreif mit Auszeichnung‚Äù (qualified with distinction) for graduation to a technical university. =University education= Now that it was time to move on to university studies, Artin was no doubt content but to leave Reichenberg, for relations with his stepfather were clouded. According to him, H√ºbner reproached him ‚Äúday and night‚Äù with being a financial burden, and even when Artin became a university lecturer and then a professor, H√ºbner deprecated his academic career as self-indulgent and belittled its paltry emolument. In October, 1916, Artin matriculated at the University of Vienna, having focused by now on mathematics. He studied there with Philipp Furtw√§ngler, and also took courses in astrophysics and Latin. Studies at Vienna were interrupted when Artin was drafted in June, 1918 into the Austrian army (his Army photo ID is dated July 1, 1918). Assigned to the K.u. K. 44th Infantry Regiment, he was stationed northwest of Venice at Primolano, on the Italian front in the foothills of the Dolomites. To his great relief, Artin managed to avoid combat by volunteering for service as a translator‚Äîhis ignorance of Italian notwithstanding. He did know French, of course, and some Latin, was generally a quick study, and was motivated by a highly rational fear in a theater of that war that had often proven a meat-grinder. In his scramble to learn at least some Italian, Artin had recourse to an encyclopedia, which he once consulted for help in dealing with the cockroaches that infested the Austrian barracks. At some length, the article described a variety of technical methods, concluding finally with‚ÄîArtin laughingly recalled in later years‚Äî‚Äúla caccia diretta\\" (\\"the direct hunt\\"). Indeed, ‚Äúla caccia diretta‚Äù was the straightforward method he and his fellow infantrymen adopted. Artin survived both war and vermin on the Italian front, and returned late in 1918 to the University of Vienna, where he remained through Easter of the following year. By June 1919, he had moved to Leipzig and matriculated at the University there as a \\"Class 2 Auditor\\" (\\"H√∂rer zweiter Ordnung\\"). Late the same year, Artin undertook the formality of standing for a qualifying examination by an academic board of the Oberrealschule in Leipzig, which he passed with the grade of ‚Äúgut‚Äù (good), receiving for the second time the Reifezeugnis (diploma attesting the equivalence of satisfactory completion of 6 years at a Realschule). How this Leipzig Reifezeugnis differed technically from the one he had been granted at Reichenberg is unclear from the document, but it apparently qualified him for regular matriculation as a student at the University, which normally required the Abitur. From 1919 to June 1921, Artin pursued mostly mathematical studies at Leipzig. His principal teacher and dissertation advisor was Gustav Herglotz. Additionally, Artin took courses in chemistry and various fields of physics, including mechanics, atomic theory, quantum theory, Maxwellian theory, radioactivity, and astrophysics. In June, 1921 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree, based on his ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù dissertation, ‚ÄúQuadratische K√∂rper im Gebiete der h√∂heren Kongruenzen‚Äú (\\"On the Arithmetic of Quadratic Function Fields over Finite Fields\\"), and the oral examination which‚Äîhis diploma affirms‚Äîhe had passed three days earlier ‚Äúwith extraordinary success.‚Äù In the fall of 1921, Artin moved to the University of G√∂ttingen, considered the \\"Mecca\\" of mathematics at the time, where he pursued one year of post-doctoral studies in mathematics and mathematical physics with Richard Courant and David Hilbert. While at G√∂ttingen, he worked closely with Emmy Noether and Helmut Hasse. Aside from consistently good school grades in singing, the first documentary evidence of Artin's deep and lifelong engagement with music comes from the year in G√∂ttingen, where he was regularly invited to join in the chamber music sessions hosted by Richard Courant. He played all the keyboard instruments, and was an especially accomplished flautist, although it is not known exactly by what instruction he had achieved proficiency on these instruments. He became especially devoted to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Career =Professorship at Hamburg= Courant arranged for Artin to receive a stipend for the summer of 1922 in G√∂ttingen, which occasioned his declining a position offered him at the University of Kiel. The following October, however, he accepted an equivalent position at Hamburg, where in 1923, he completed the Habilitation thesis (required of aspirants to a professorship in Germany), and on July 24 advanced to the rank of Privatdozent. On April 1, 1925, Artin was promoted to Associate Professor (au√üerordentlicher Professor). In this year also, Artin applied for and was granted German citizenship. He was promoted to full Professor (ordentlicher Professor) on October 15, 1926. Early in the summer of 1925, Artin attended the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near Kassel with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through Iceland later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during World War II) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure. Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August, 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to Norway, where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, H√∫sav√≠k in the north of the island. Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Lax√° River to Lake M√Ωvatn. They made a circuit of the large, irregular lake, staying in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well. Artin kept a meticulous journal of this trip, making daily entries in a neat, minuscule hand. He and several of the young men had brought cameras, so that the trek is documented also by nearly 200 small photographs. Artin's journal attests to his overarching interest in the geology of this mid-Atlantic island, situated over the boundary of two tectonic plates whose shifting relation makes it geologically hyperactive. In keeping with the Wandervogel ethos, Artin and his companions carried music with them wherever they visited. The young men had packed guitars and violins, and Artin played the harmoniums common in the isolated farmsteads where they found lodging. The group regularly entertained their Icelandic hosts, not in full exchange for board and lodging, to be sure, but for goodwill certainly, and sometimes for a little extra on their plates, or a modestly discounted tariff. From Lake M√Ωvatn, Artin and his companions headed west towards Akureyri, passing the large waterfall Go√∞afoss on the way. From Akureyri, they trekked west down the √ñxnadalur (Ox Valley) intending to rent pack horses and cross the high and barren interior by foot to Reykjav√≠k. By the time they reached the lower end of Skagafj√∂r√∞ur, however, they were persuaded by a local farmer from whom they had hoped to rent the horses that a cross-country trek was by then impracticable; with the approach of winter, highland routes were already snow- bound and impassable. Instead of turning south, then, they turned north to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, where they boarded another steamer that took them around the western peninsula and down the coast to Reykjav√≠k. From Reykjav√≠k, they returned via Norway to Hamburg. By Artin's calculation the distance they had covered on foot through Iceland totaled 450 kilometers. Early in 1926, the University of M√ºnster offered Artin a professorial position; however, Hamburg matched the offer financially, and (as noted above) promoted him to full professor, making him (along with his young colleague Helmut Hasse) one of the two youngest professors of mathematics in Germany. It was in this period that he acquired his lifelong nickname, ‚ÄúMa,‚Äù short for mathematics, which he came to prefer to his given name, and which virtually everyone who knew him well used. Although the nickname might seem to imply a narrow intellectual focus, quite the reverse was true of Artin. Even his teaching at the University of Hamburg went beyond the strict boundaries of mathematics to include mechanics and relativity theory. He kept up on a serious level with advances in astronomy, chemistry and biology (he owned and used a fine microscope), and the circle of his friends in Hamburg attests to the catholicity of his interests. It included the painter Heinrich Stegemann, and the author and organ-builder Hans Henny Jahnn. Stegemann was a particularly close friend, and made portraits of Artin, his wife Natascha, and their two Hamburg-born children. Music continued to play a central role in his life; he acquired a Neupert double manual harpsichord, and a clavichord made by the Hamburg builder Walter Ebeloe, as well as a silver flute made in Hamburg by G. Urban. Chamber music gatherings became a regular event at the Artin apartment as they had been at the Courants in G√∂ttingen. On August 15, 1929, Artin married Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha), a young Russian √©migr√© who had been a student in several of his classes. One of their shared interests was photography, and when Artin bought a Leica for their joint use (a Leica A, the first commercial model of this legendary camera), Natascha began chronicling the life of the family, as well as the city of Hamburg. For the next decade, she made a series of artful and expressive portraits of Artin that remain by far the best images of him taken at any age. Artin, in turn, took many fine and evocative portraits of Natascha. Lacking access to a professional darkroom, their films and prints had to be developed in a makeshift darkroom set up each time (and then dismantled again) in the small bathroom of whatever apartment they were occupying. The makeshift darkroom notwithstanding, the high artistic level of the resulting photographic prints is attested to by the exhibit of Natascha's photographs mounted in 2001 by the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, and its accompanying catalogue, ‚ÄúHamburg‚ÄîWie Ich Es Sah.‚Äù In 1930, Artin was offered a professorship at ETH (Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule) in Z√ºrich, to replace Hermann Weyl, who had moved to G√∂ttingen. He chose to remain at Hamburg, however. Two years later, in 1932, for contributions leading to the advancement of mathematics, Artin was honored‚Äîjointly with Emmy Noether‚Äîwith the Ackermann‚ÄìTeubner Memorial Award, which carried a grant of 500 marks. =Nazi period= In January 1933, Natascha gave birth to their first child, Karin. A year and a half later, in the summer of 1934, son Michael was born. The political climate at Hamburg was not so poisonous as that at G√∂ttingen, where by 1935 the mathematics department had been purged of Jewish and dissident professors. Still, Artin's situation became increasingly precarious, not only because Natascha was half Jewish, but also because Artin made no secret of his distaste for the Hitler regime (he evidently signed the 1933 Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State) At one point, Wilhelm Blaschke, by then a Nazi Party member, but nonetheless solicitous of the Artins‚Äô well-being, warned Artin discreetly to close his classroom door so his frankly anti-Nazi comments could not be heard by passersby in the hallway. Natascha recalled going down to the newsstand on the corner one day and being warned in hushed tones by the man from whom she and Artin bought their paper that a man had daily been watching their apartment from across the street. Once tipped off, she and Artin became very aware of the watcher (Natascha liked to refer to him as their ‚Äúspy‚Äù), and even rather enjoyed the idea of his being forced to follow them on the long walks they loved taking in the afternoons to a caf√© far out in the countryside. Toying with their watcher on a fine autumn afternoon was one thing, but the atmosphere was in fact growing inexorably serious. Natascha's Jewish father and her sister, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had already left for the U.S. in the summer of 1933. As half-Jewish, Natascha's status was, if not ultimately quite hopeless, certainly not good. Hasse, like Blaschke a nationalistic supporter of the regime, had applied for Party membership, but was nonetheless no anti-Semite. Besides he was a long-time friend and colleague of Artin's. He suggested that the two Artin children‚Äîonly one quarter Jewish, or in Nazi terminology, ‚ÄúMischlinge zweiten Grades‚Äù‚Äîmight, if a few strategic strings could be pulled, be officially ‚Äúaryanized.‚Äù Hasse offered to exert his influence with the Ministry of Education (Kultur- und Schulbeh√∂rde, Hochschulwesen), and Artin‚Äînot daring to leave any stone unturned, especially with respect to the safety of his children‚Äîwent along with this effort. He asked his father-in-law, by then resident in Washington D.C., to draft and have notarized an affidavit attesting to the Christian lineage of his late wife, Natascha's mother. Artin submitted this affidavit to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail. By this time, to be precise, on July 15, 1937, because of Natascha's status as ‚ÄúMischling ersten Grades,‚Äù Artin had lost his post at the University‚Äîtechnically, compelled into early retirement‚Äîon the grounds of paragraph 6 of the Act to Restore the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums) of April 7, 1933. Ironically, he had applied only some months earlier, on February 8, 1937, for a leave of absence from the University in order to accept a position offered him at Stanford. On March 15, 1937, the response had come back denying his application for leave on the grounds that his services to the University were indispensable (‚ÄúDa die T√§tigkeit des Professors Dr. Artin an der Universit√§t Hamburg nicht entbehrt werden kann. . .‚Äù). By July, when he was summarily ‚Äúretired,‚Äù (‚Äúin Ruhestand versetzt‚Äù) the position at Stanford University had been filled. However, through the efforts of Richard Courant (by then at New York University), and Solomon Lefschetz at Princeton University, a position was found for him at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. =Emigration to the U.S.= The family must have worked feverishly to prepare for emigration to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment. Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of money out of the country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double- manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and potato masher to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment (see Natascha A. Brunswick, ‚ÄúHamburg: Wie Ich Es Sah,‚Äù Dokumente der Photographie 6, Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, 2001, pp. 48‚Äì53) . On the morning they were to board the Hamburg-Amerika line ship in Bremerhaven, October 21, 1937, daughter Karin woke with a high temperature. Terrified that should this opportunity be missed, the window of escape from Nazi Germany might close forever, Artin and Natascha chose to risk somehow getting Karin past emigration and customs officials without their noticing her condition. They managed to conceal Karin's feverish state, and without incident boarded the ship, as many left behind were tragically never able to do. When they landed a week later at Hoboken, New Jersey, Richard Courant and Natascha's father, the Russian agronomist Naum Jasny (then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were on the dock to welcome the family to the United States. =Bloomington years= It was early November, 1937 by the time they arrived in South Bend, where Artin joined the faculty at Notre Dame, and taught for the rest of that academic year. He was offered a permanent position the following year 170 miles to the south at Indiana University, in Bloomington. Shortly after the family resettled there, a second son, Thomas, was born on November 12, 1938. After moving to Bloomington, Artin quickly acquired a piano, and soon after that a Hammond Organ, a recently invented electronic instrument that simulated the sound of a pipe organ. He wanted this instrument in order primarily to play the works of J. S. Bach, and because the pedal set that came with the production model had a range of only two octaves (not quite wide enough for all the Bach pieces), he set about extending its range. Music was a constant presence in the Artin household. Karin played the cello, and then the piano as well, and Michael played the violin. As in Hamburg, the Artin living room was regularly the venue for amateur chamber music performances. The circle of the Artins‚Äô University friends reflected Artin's wide cultural and intellectual interests. Notable among them were Alfred Kinsey and his wife of the Psychology Department, as well as prominent members of the Fine Arts, Art History, Anthropology, German Literature, and Music Departments. For several summer semesters, Artin accepted teaching positions at other universities, viz., Stanford in 1939 and 1940, The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1941 and 1951, and The University of Colorado, in Boulder, in 1953. On each of these occasions, the family accompanied him. Artin insisted that only German be spoken in the house. Even Tom, born in the U.S., spoke German as his first language, acquiring English only from his siblings and his playmates in the neighborhood; for the first four or five years of his life, he spoke English with a pronounced German accent. Consistent with his program of maintaining the family's German cultural heritage, Artin gave high priority to regularly reading German literature aloud to the children. The text was frequently from Goethe's autobiographical \\"Dichtung und Wahrheit,\\" or his poems, \\"Erlk√∂nig,\\" for instance. Occasionally, he would read from an English text. Favorites were Mark Twain's \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" Charles Dickens‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Christmas Carol,‚Äù and Oscar Wilde‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Canterville Ghost.‚Äù For the Artin children, these readings replaced radio entertainment, which was strictly banned from the house. There was a radio, but (with the notable exception of Sunday morning broadcasts by E. Power Biggs from the organ at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, to which Artin and Natascha listened still lounging in bed) it was switched on only to hear news of the war. Similarly, the Artin household would never in years to come harbor a television set. Once the war had ended, the radio was retired to the rear of a dark closet. As German citizens, Artin and Natascha were technically classified as enemy aliens for the duration of the war. On April 12, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe only weeks away, they applied for naturalization as American citizens. American citizenship was granted them on February 7, 1946. On the orders of a Hamburg doctor whom he had consulted about a chronic cough, Artin had given up smoking years before. He had vowed not to smoke so long as Adolf Hitler remained in power. On May 8, 1945, at the news of Germany's surrender and the fall of the Third Reich, Natascha made the mistake of reminding him of this vow, and in lieu of a champagne toast, he indulged in what was intended to be the smoking of a single, celebratory cigarette. Unfortunately, the single cigarette led to a second, and another after that. Artin returned to heavy smoking for the rest of his life. =Princeton years= If G√∂ttingen had been the ‚ÄúMecca‚Äù of mathematics in the 1920s and early ‚Äò30s, Princeton, following the decimation of German mathematics under the Nazis, had become the center of the mathematical world in the 1940s. In April, 1946, Artin was appointed Professor at Princeton, at a yearly salary of $8,000. The family moved there in the fall of 1946. Notable among his graduate students at Princeton are Serge Lang, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, and Timothy O‚ÄôMeara. Emil chose also to teach the honors section of Freshman calculus each year. He was renowned for the elegance of his teaching. Frei and Roquette write that Artin‚Äôs ‚Äúmain medium of communication was teaching and conversation: in groups, seminars and in smaller circles. We have many statements of people near to him describing his unpretentious way of communicating with everybody, demanding quick grasp of the essentials but never tired of explaining the necessary. He was open to all kinds of suggestions, and distributed joyfully what he knew. He liked to teach, also to young students, and his excellent lectures, always well prepared but without written notes, were hailed for their clarity and beauty.‚Äù (Emil Artin and Helmut Hasse: Their Correspondence 1923‚Äì1934, Introduction.) Whenever he was asked whether mathematics was a science, Artin would reply unhesitatingly, ‚ÄúNo. An art.‚Äù His explanation was that: ‚Äú[Mathematicians] all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners. In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements. Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous. We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realizing that we have enabled our listeners to see at a glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.‚Äù During the Princeton years, Artin built a reflecting telescope to plans he found in the magazine Sky and Telescope, which he subscribed to. He spent weeks in the basement attempting to grind the mirror to specifications, without success, and his continued failure to get it right led to increasing frustration. Then, in California to give a talk, he made a side trip to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he discussed his project with the astronomers. Whether it was their technical advice, or Natascha's intuitive suggestion that it might be too cold in the basement, and that he should try the procedure upstairs in the warmth of his study (which he did), he completed the grinding of the mirror in a matter of days. With this telescope, he surveyed the night skies over Princeton. In September 1955, Artin accepted an invitation to visit Japan. From his letters, it is clear he was treated like royalty by the Japanese mathematical community, and was charmed by the country. He was interested in learning about the diverse threads of Buddhism, and visiting its holy sites. In a letter home he describes his visit to the temples at Nara. ‚ÄúThen we were driven to a place nearby, Horiuji [Horyu-ji] where a very beautiful Buddhist temple is. We were received by the abbot, and a priest translated into English. We obtained the first sensible explanation about modern Buddhism. The difficulty of obtaining such an explanation is enormous. To begin with most Japanese do not know and do not understand our questions. All this is made more complicated by the fact that there are numerous sects and each one has another theory. Since you get your information only piece wise, you cannot put it together. This results in an absurd picture. I am talking of the present day, not of its original form.‚Äù His letter goes on to outline at length the general eschatological framework of Buddhist belief. Then he adds, ‚ÄúBy the way, a problem given by the Zens for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?‚Äù Return to Hamburg and personal life The following year, Artin took a leave of absence to return to Germany for the first time since emigration, nearly twenty years earlier. He spent the fall semester at G√∂ttingen, and the next at Hamburg. For the Christmas holidays, he travelled to his birthplace, Vienna, to visit his mother, Vienna being a city he had not seen in decades. In a letter home he described the experience of his return in a single, oddly laconic sentence: ‚ÄúIt is kind of amusing to walk through Vienna again.‚Äù In 1957, an honorary doctorate was conferred on Artin by the University of Freiburg. That fall, he returned to Princeton for what would be his final academic year at that institution. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. Artin's marriage to Natascha had by this time seriously frayed. Though nominally still husband and wife, resident in the same house, they were for all intents and purposes living separate lives. Artin was offered a professorship at Hamburg, and at the conclusion of Princeton's spring semester, 1958, he moved permanently to Germany. His decision to leave Princeton University and the United States was complicated, based on multiple factors, prominent among them Princeton's (then operative) mandatory retirement age of 65. Artin had no wish to retire from teaching and direct involvement with students. Hamburg's offer was open-ended. Artin and Natascha were divorced in 1959. In Hamburg, Artin had taken an apartment, but soon gave it over to his mother whom he had brought from Vienna to live near him in Hamburg. He in turn moved into the apartment of the mathematician Hel Braun in the same neighborhood; though they never married, their relationship was equivalent to marriage. On January 4, 1961, he was granted German citizenship. In June, 1962, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of Blaise Pascal, the University of Clermont-Ferrand conferred an honorary doctorate on him. On December 20 of the same year, Artin died at home in Hamburg, aged 64, of a heart attack. The University of Hamburg honored his memory on April 26, 2005 by naming one of its newly renovated lecture halls The Emil Artin Lecture Hall.Zum Gedenken an Emil Artin (1898‚Äì1962) Influence and work Artin was one of the leading algebraists of the century, with an influence larger than might be guessed from the one volume of his Collected Papers edited by Serge Lang and John Tate. He worked in algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields. The influential treatment of abstract algebra by van der Waerden is said to derive in part from Artin's ideas, as well as those of Emmy Noether. Artin solved Hilbert's seventeenth problem in 1927. He also developed the theory of braids as a branch of algebraic topology. In 1955 Artin was teaching foundations of geometry at New York University. He used his notes to publish Geometric Algebra in 1957, where he extended the material to include symplectic geometry. Artin was also an important expositor of Galois theory, and of the group cohomology approach to class ring theory (with John Tate), to mention two theories where his formulations became standard. Conjectures He left two conjectures, both known as Artin's conjecture. The first concerns Artin L-functions for a linear representation of a Galois group; and the second the frequency with which a given integer a is a primitive root modulo primes p, when a is fixed and p varies. These are unproven; in 1967, Hooley published a conditional proof for the second conjecture, assuming certain cases of the Generalized Riemann hypothesis. Supervision of research Artin advised over thirty doctoral students, including Bernard Dwork, Serge Lang, K. G. Ramanathan, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, Hans Zassenhaus and Max Zorn. A more complete list of his students can be found at the Mathematics Genealogy Project website (see \\"External Links,\\" below). Family In 1932 he married Natascha Jasny, born in Russia to mixed parentage (her mother was Christian, her father, Jewish). Artin was not himself Jewish, but, on account of his wife's racial status in Nazi Germany, was dismissed from his university position in 1937. They had three children, one of whom is Michael Artin, an American algebraist currently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He played Phil Archer in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers from the pilot episodes aired on the BBC Midlands Home Service in summer 1950, after the series went national on the Light Programme on 1 January 1951, until his death in 2009, when he was the longest-serving member of the cast. His last episode, recorded two days before he died, was broadcast on 22 November 2009. The character lived on until Phil was \\"found dead\\" in his armchair in February 2010. According to Guinness World Records, Painting held the world record for an actor playing a continuous role, a total of 59 years, which has now been surpassed by co-actor Lesley Saweard and co-star Patricia Greene. Early life Painting was born in Leamington Spa, the son of a railway signalman. He was educated at Leamington College and King Edward VI School, Nuneaton, but left school aged 15 to work in a library. He was found to be medically unfit for military service in the Second World War, and studied English at the University of Birmingham instead, graduating with a first-class degree. He did post-graduate research at Christ Church, Oxford, and then became a tutor in Anglo-Saxon at Exeter College, Oxford.Gillian Reynolds, 'Painting, Norman George (1924‚Äì2009)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2013 accessed 29 April 2013 Radio career He began to appear on BBC radio while at the University of Birmingham, and continued while also performing as an actor with Oxford University Dramatic Society. He left Oxford University in 1949 to work for the BBC in Birmingham. Painting had worked as a performer, interviewer, writer and producer for the BBC before he first appeared as Philip in The Archers in 1950. He became a script writer for the series in 1966, following in the footsteps of Edward J. Mason, Geoffrey Webb, David Turner and John Keir Cross. He wrote in his memoir of the programme, Forever Ambridge (named after Ambridge, the fictional West Midlands village in which the programme is set), that he believed that Geoffrey Webb, who had died some time before, was guiding his hand as he wrote. He wrote about 1,200 episodes under the pseudonym Bruno Milna. Artistic disagreements with a then editor, plus a general disillusionment with the BBC management, led him to retire from writing scripts in 1982 and to stick to just performing them. The character of Phil Archer developed from the lusty young romantic lead of the early episodes, working on the neighbouring Fairbrother estate, into a father and grandfather, replacing Dan Archer as the patriarch of Brookfield Farm and a senior figure in the series. Perhaps his most famous moment occurred on 22 September 1955, when his wife, Grace Archer (n√©e Fairbrother), was killed while trying to rescue a horse, Midnight, from a burning barn ‚Äì the episode being transmitted on first day of ITV broadcasts. The character survived Painting by four months, dying peacefully in March 2010. Honour  He was appointed OBE in 1976, for services to broadcasting. He published two books on the Archers entitled Forever Ambridge (1975 and 1980, for the programme's 25th and 30th anniversaries), and a personal memoir, Reluctant Archer (1982). He was the subject of a programme in the TV series This Is Your Life in 1991. Later life Painting suffered from poor health in later life, with several heart attacks in 1982 and later pancreatitis, a retinal detachment, and prostate surgery. In 2000, he stated he was suffering from bladder cancer.Voice of Phil Archer dies aged 85 BBC. Retrieved 29 October 2009. He remained a bachelor, and lived alone at Warmington in Warwickshire.

It is on the Lusatian Neisse and surrounded by the Jizera Mountains and Je≈°tƒõd-Koz√°kov Ridge. It is the fifth- largest city in the Czech Republic. Liberec was once home to a thriving textile industry and hence nicknamed the \\"Manchester of Bohemia\\". For many Czechs, Liberec is mostly associated with the city's dominant Je≈°tƒõd Tower. Since the end of the 19th century, the city has been a conurbation with the suburb of Vratislavice and the neighboring town of Jablonec nad Nisou. Therefore, the total area with suburbs encompasses 150,000 inhabitants. Liberec itself has about 105,000 inhabitants. That makes Liberec the third- largest city in Bohemia after Prague and Plze≈à. Liberec Town Hall and Neptune's Fountain Liberec Castle History Probably at the end of the 13th century, a settlement was established on the trade route from Bohemia to Lusatia. Liberec first belonged to the Bieberstein and Redern families and was first mentioned in a document of 1348. When Redern family after the Battle of White Mountain was forced to leave Liberec, it was acquired by Albrecht von Wallenstein. After his death it belonged to the Gallas and Clam Gallas families. The cloth-making industry was introduced in 1579. The prosperous local industry was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War and a great plague in the 1680s. The Battle of Reichenberg between Austria and Prussia occurred nearby in 1757 during the Seven Years' War. Until 1918 the town was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Austrian monarchy (Austrian side after the compromise of 1867), seat of the Reichenberg district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 Gallery - Spa At one time the second city of Bohemia,Di Duca, Marc. Bradt's Czech Republic (2006) the city developed rapidly at the end of the 19th century and as a result has a spectacular collection of late-19th-century buildings; the town hall, the opera house and the North Bohemian Museum are of note. The Opera House has a spectacular main curtain designed by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt. The neighbourhoods on the hills above the town centre display beautiful homes and streets, laid out in a picturesque Romantic style similar to some central European thermal spas. After the end of World War I Austria-Hungary fell apart. The Czechs of Bohemia joined newly established Czechoslovakia on 29 October 1918 whilst the Germans wanted to create independent German Austria on 12 November 1918, both citing Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points and the doctrine of self-determination. Reichenberg was declared the capital of the German-Austrian province of German Bohemia. However, as these lands were historically an integral part of the Duchy and Kingdom of Bohemia, on 16 December 1918 the Czechoslovak Army entered Reichenberg and the whole province and both remained part of Czechoslovakia. In the 1920s and the 1930s, Liberec became the unofficial capital of Germans in Czechoslovakia, a position was underlined by the foundation of important institutions such as B√ºcherei der Deutschen, a central German library in Czechoslovakia, and by failed efforts to relocate the German (Charles) University there from Prague. Bilingual railway station postmark in April 1920 The Great Depression devastated the economy of the area with its textile, carpet, glass and other light industry. The high number of unemployed people, hunger, fear of the future and dissatisfaction with the Prague government led to the flash rise of the populist Sudeten German Party (SdP), founded by Konrad Henlein, born in the suburbs of Liberec. Whilst he declared fidelity to the Republic, he secretly negotiated with Adolf Hitler. In 1937 he radicalized his views and became Hitler's puppet in order to incorporate the Sudetenland into Germany and destabilize Czechoslovakia, which was an ally of France and one of the leading arms producers in Europe. The city became the centre of Pan-German movements and later of the Nazis, especially after the 1935 election, despite its important democratic mayor, Karl Kostka (German Democratic Freedom Party). The final change came in Summer 1938, after the radicalization of the terror of the SdP, whose death threats forced Kostka and his family to flee to Prague. In September 1938, after two unsuccessful attempts by the SdP to stage a pro-Nazi coup in Czechoslovakia, which were stopped by police and the army, the Munich Agreement awarded the city to Nazi Germany and it became the capital of Reichsgau Sudetenland. Until 1945, the city was administered as a part of the Regierungsbezirk Aussig of Reichsgau Sudetenland. Most of the city's Jewish and Czech population fled to the rest of Czechoslovakia or were expelled. The important synagogue was burned down. Henlein himself confiscated a villa in Liberec that had belonged to a Jewish businessman, which remained Henlein's home until 1945. During a rally in December 1938, Hitler laid out the future of the Hitler Youth.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp.164 f After World War II the town again became a part of Czechoslovakia and nearly all of the city's German population was expelled following the Bene≈° decrees. The region was then resettled with Czechs, completely altering the traditional language and culture of the town and its region. The city continues to have an important German minority, consisting of descendants of anti-Nazi Germans who were active in the struggle against Hitler, as well as Germans from Czech-German families and their descendants. Liberec also has a Jewish minority with a newly built synagogue and a Greek minority, originating from Communist refugees who settled there after the Greek Civil War in 1949. Historical names The origin of the city name was the subject of many discussions, often nationally influenced, because it was a bilingual settlement. The oldest known names of the city are German, Reychinberch (1352) and Raichmberg (1369), meaning \\"rich/resourceful mountain\\" (reicher Berg in modern German). It was also named Reichenberg (1385) and Rychmberg (1410). The Czech equivalent originated as a distortion: Rychberk (1545), Lychberk (1592), Libercum (1634), Liberk (1790), and finally Liberec (1845). In Czech, words starting with \\"R\\" were often dissimilated into \\"L\\".The German version of this article Since then, the city was known as Liberec in Czech and as Reichenberg in German. Hablau, the name of the old street near city center, is considered to be a trace of the old village possibly founded by Havel of Lemberk, husband of Saint Zdislava Berka. Science and technology The Research Library and the New Synagogue * Technical University of Liberec (Technick√° Univerzita v Liberci): Founded in 1953 as a Technical College. In 1995 gained the status of a university. It has about 10,000 students in 6 schools (Mechanical Engineering, Textile Engineering, Architecture, Mechatronics, Humanities and Nature and Economics). Applied research in mechatronics, important school of architecture. * Regional Research Library of Liberec (Krajsk√° vƒõdeck√° knihovna): A general public science library, aiming at general education in the region. Founded in 1900, based on the decision of the municipal council to establish a municipal library. It has an exceptional collection of Germano- Slavica and Sudetica (periodicals and books in German language from Bohemia). New building was completed in 2000 on the site of the Old Synagogue, which was burnt down by the Nazis in November 1938. Its building comprises also a modern New Synagogue. * The North Bohemian Museum (Severoƒçesk√© muzeum): Built in 1873. It ranks among the oldest and most significant museums of nature sciences, arts and crafts in the Czech Republic. There is the sculpture of T.G. Masaryk from 2010 standing in front of the Museum. Torn√°do waterslide in Liberec Aquapark Sights Liberec's prominent buildings are the Town Hall (1893), the Liberec Castle (Libereck√Ω z√°mek), built in the 16th century, and the Je≈°tƒõd Tower (1968) upon the Je≈°tƒõd Mountain, build by architect Karel Hub√°ƒçek, which became a symbol of the city. V√°clav Havel held a broadcast from the site of the tower in 1968; a plaque beside the tower marks this event. Contemporary buildings of note are also to be found, primarily the work of the firm SIAL, and include the new Regional Research Library (2000) and the ƒåesk√° Poji≈°≈•ovna office building (1997).

Zoo and botanical garden White tiger in Liberec Zoo * The zoo in Liberec was the first to be opened in Czechoslovakia in 1904. The zoo contains a wide variety of fauna (about 143 species on 13 ha), including large mammals like elephants, giraffes, sea lions and white tigers, which are a genetic anomaly and hence very rare. It participates in breeding activities of endangered species to help preserve the gene pool. * The Botanical Garden in Liberec (completely rebuilt from Kuƒçera 1995 to 2000) comprises nine glasshouses for visitors (with a total area of and 13 exhibition themes), nine plantation glasshouses and a large exterior terrain. It continues the legacy of a botanical garden established in 1876 by the Verein der Naturfreunde (\\"Society of Friends of Nature\\") on a nearby site and it is therefore considered the oldest one in the Czech Republic. Events * Mate≈ôinka, a theatre festival biennially held in June Transport Cable car to Je≈°tƒõd Liberec city transport provides bus and tram lines. The first tram was used in Liberec in 1897. Liberec shares the narrow gauge tramway line which connects it to its neighboring city, Jablonec nad Nisou which is 12 km away. There are also two city lines with standard gauge: The first connects Horn√≠ Hanychov (not far to the cable car to Je≈°tƒõd) and Lidov√© Sady via F√ºgnerova. The second connects Doln√≠ Hanychov and Lidov√© Sady via F√ºgnerova (only during workdays). There also four historical trams. In the city centre there are two tracks as a memorial, in the past trams were used also on the central place in front of town hall.

It has about 34,000 inhabitans. It lies south of the capital Prague, on the river Lu≈ænice. Etymology The town's name translates to \\"camp\\" or \\"encampment\\" in Czech. The town gave its name to the Taborites, a radical wing of the Hussites. History The town was founded in the spring of 1420 by Petr Hrom√°dka of Jistebnice and Jan Bydl√≠nsk√Ω of Bydl√≠n from the most radical wing of the Hussites, who soon became known as the Taborites. In the following years the town flourished as an egalitarian peasant commune. This spirit is celebrated in Smetana's \\"Song of Freedom\\", made famous in the English-speaking world by Paul Robeson's recording in Czech and English. The historical part of the town is situated on the summit of an isolated hill separated from the surrounding country by the Lu≈ænice river and by an extensive lake, to which the Hussites gave the biblical name of Jordan. This lake, founded 1492, is the oldest reservoir of its kind in Central Europe. The historical importance of the town of T√°bor ceased only when it was captured by King George of Podƒõbrady in 1452. Until 1918, the post town \\"Tabor ‚Äì T√°bor\\" was part of the Austrian monarchy (the Austrian side after the compromise of 1867), in the district with the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 A post office was opened in the railway station in 1895. Geography The town is 437 m above sea level, the highest point is the H√Ωlaƒçka observation tower and the lowest is the surface of the river. The area of the town is 62.22 km¬≤. The historical old town is situated on a hill above the river, which was used for the protection of the town. In the middle of the town lies the Jord√°n reservoir, which was created in 1492. It was originally used for storage of water, but nowadays it is mainly used for recreation. It is the oldest reservoir in Central Europe. Geology T√°bor is located in the geomorphological area called the T√°bor Uplands. On the east edge of the town, there is a rock formation called \\"Gran√°tov√° sk√°la\\". The rock is a deposit of red garnets that can be as large as hazelnuts. The majority of the rock was mined and used as construction material. There is also geological exposition along the river called \\"Geologick√° expozice Pod Klokoty\\". Sights Though a large part of the ancient fortifications has been demolished, T√°bor (or Hradi≈°tƒõ Hory T√°bor, the castle of the T√°bor Hill, as it was called in the Hussite period) still preserves many memorials of its past fame. In the centre of the town is ≈Ωi≈æka Square. Only very narrow streets lead to it; this rendered the approach to the square more difficult in times of war. Under the houses and streets is a labyrinth of tunnels. The townspeople dug cellars under their houses and these were subsequently interconnected; an approximately 500 m-long section of the tunnel system is open to the public and is a part of the Hussite museum. In the centre of the square there is a statue of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, the greatest of the Hussite leaders, the Dean Church of the Lord's Conversion on Mount Tabor, built in 1516 in the style of the Bohemian Renaissance, and the town hall, in connection with which a museum has been founded, which contains interesting relics of the Hussite period, such as the Altar Wings of Roudn√≠ky and farm carts which doubled as battle wagons. Major parts of the ancient fortifications and the ancient Kotnov tower and gate of Bechynƒõ near the tower still exist. Other sights: * The first electric railway in Austria-Hungary which led from T√°bor to Bechynƒõ * Mƒõ≈°ice Castle ‚Äì former Renaissance fortress, later rebuilt in Baroque style * Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary ‚Äì 600-year-old Roman Catholic church * Chapel of St. Anna * T√°bor Zoo Parks and nature =Park Pod Kotnovem= This park is placed next to Bechy≈àsk√° gate and Kotnov tower ‚Äì near the Old Town. Originally, it was an old cemetery but in the 19th century, it was converted into a park. Some of the gravestones remained here until present. =Hus≈Øv park= The park started to form in 1871, after the train station was built. It was not reconstructed until 1991, along with some other buildings in the surroundings. The ceremonial opening of the newly reconstructed park was in 1997. At one part of this park, there stands a big monument (headstone) called \\"Mistr Jan Hus\\" by Czech sculptor Franti≈°ek B√≠lek. It was built in 1928. The headstone is built from a granite base with a bronze statue of Jan Hus on it (3 meters tall), and a bronze relief board with Hus's life events and also an imitation of Koz√≠ Hr√°dek (the place where Hus preached). On the other side of the park, nearer to the train station, there is a fountain called Girl with a jug, made in 1920. =Park U Popravi≈°tƒõ= This park is the biggest park in T√°bor. As the name suggests, the park is built around a former gallows, which was used during World War II. In 1942, 156 patriots were executed by the nationalists. For these victims, a monument was built (in 1945‚Äì1950), which includes a bronze board with lions and bronze relief board with figures. The rest of the park rose at the end of 20th century. It contains sculptures, fountains, tree alleys, benches, flower patches and a playground. =Botanical garden= This botanical garden was founded in 1866, which makes it the second oldest in the Czech Republic. After its establishment, it was much bigger ‚Äì about 3600 m2. It belongs to the secondary school of agriculture, which is in front of it. It contains more than 4,000 different flowers and plants. The seeds from there are sent to more than 400 places in the world. Most of the garden is occupied by an arboretum. There is a small lake and a rock garden. The three glasshouses contains cacti, succulents, orchids, carnivorous plants and many other exotic plants. The entrance is for free, only the glasshouses are paid. During the year, special exhibitions of plants are organized. =Holeƒçkovy sady= This park was founded in the 1930s. This green ring around the historic core of T√°bor is named after a famous writer and translator Josef Holeƒçek. The look of the park is atypical. It is on a hill and it has many paths and stairs made from rocks, lined with large trees. Some smaller monuments are also there ‚Äì a memorial to Josef Holeƒçek, a white gazebo, cross and two small chapels. Transport T√°bor is a significant transport hub. It lies on the mainline railway linking Prague with ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice and Linz and local branch lines to Bechynƒõ and Pelh≈ôimov. The town also lies on the European route E55 and it will be connected with Prague, ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice and the Czech‚ÄìAustrian border with a highway after the building of the planned D3 motorway is finished. Sport After the 2019‚Äì20 season, the local football club FC MAS T√°borsko was promoted into the second-level Czech National Football League. T√°bor is also equipped with a winter stadium. The local ice hockey club, HC T√°bor, plays in the third-level ice hockey league. Other sport facilities in T√°bor include a swimming pool and the Komora sports complex.

Members of this order have small heads and long slender bodies. They have either smooth scales or no scales, a long dorsal fin and an anal fin that typically runs into the caudal fin. They mostly come from the tropics and subtropics, and live in both freshwater and marine habitats, including abyssal depths. They have adopted a range of feeding methods and lifestyles, including parasitism. The majority are egg- laying, but some are viviparous. Distribution This order includes a variety of deep-sea species, including the deepest known, Abyssobrotula galatheae, found at in the Puerto Rico Trench. Many other species, however, live in shallow water, especially near coral reefs, while a few inhabit freshwater. Most species live in tropical or subtropical habitats, but some species are known from as far north as the coast of Greenland, and as far south as the Weddell Sea. Characteristics Ophidiiform fish typically have slender bodies with small heads, and either smooth scales, or none at all. They have long dorsal fins, and an anal fin that is typically united with the caudal fin. The group includes pelagic, benthic, and even parasitic species, although all have a similar body form. Some species are viviparous, giving birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. They range in size from Grammanoides opisthodon which measures just in length, to Lamprogrammus shcherbachevi at in length. The families Ranicipitidae (tadpole cods) and Euclichthyidae (eucla cods) were formerly classified in this order, but are now preferred in Gadiformes; Ranicipitidae has been absorbed within the family Gadidae.

Teplice (), Teplice-≈†anov until 1948 (; ), is a statutory city in the √öst√≠ nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic and the capital of the Teplice District. It is the Czech Republic's second largest spa town, after Karlovy Vary. Geography Teplice is in North Bohemia, near the border with the German state of Saxony. It is in the valley of the B√≠lina river between the slopes of the Ore Mountains () in the northwest and the Central Bohemian Uplands (ƒåesk√© st≈ôedoho≈ô√≠) in the southeast, about west of √öst√≠ nad Labem. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Teplice proper, Prosetice, Nov√° Ves, ≈òetenice, Hudcov, Trnovany, and Sobƒõdruhy. History Teplice city Seal ~ 1750 with the head of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the local Benedictine monastery According to the 1541 Annales Bohemorum by chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek, the thermal springs are fabled to have been discovered as early as 762; however, the first authentic mention of the baths occurred in the 16th century. The settlement of Trnovany was first documented in a 1057 deed, while Teplice proper was first mentioned about 1158, when Judith of Thuringia, queen consort of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, founded a Benedictine nunnery ad aquas calidas (\\"at the hot springs\\"), the second in Bohemia. A fortified town arose around the monastery, which was destroyed in the course of the Hussite Wars after the 1426 Battle of Aussig. In the late 15th century, queen consort Joanna of Ro≈æmit√°l, wife of King George of Podƒõbrady, had a castle erected on the ruins. The name \\"Teplice\\" is derived from the Old Czech, meaning \\"hot spring\\". Teplice figures in the history of the Thirty Years' War, when it was a possession of the Protestant Bohemian noble Vil√©m Kinsk√Ω, who was assassinated together with Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein at Cheb in 1634. The Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II thereafter enfeoffed castle and town to his general Johann von Aldringen, who nevertheless was killed in battle in the same year, and Teplice fell to his sister Anna Maria von Clary-Aldringen. Consequently, and until 1945, Teplitz Castle was the primarily seat of the princely House of Clary- Aldringen. After the Thirty Years' War, the devastated town was the destination of many German settlers. After a blaze in 1793, large parts of the town were rebuilt in a Neoclassical style. The health resort was a popular venue for wealthy bourgeois like the poet Johann Gottfried Seume, who died on his stay in 1810, or Ludwig van Beethoven, who met here with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1812; as well as for European monarchs. During the Napoleonic War of the Sixth Coalition, Teplice in August 1813 was the site where Emperor Francis I of Austria, Emperor Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia first signed the triple alliance against Napoleon I of France that led to the coalition victory at the nearby Battle of Kulm. Czech inscriptions smeared by Sudeten German activists, March 1938 In 1895, Teplice merged with neighbouring L√°znƒõ ≈†anov (Sch√∂nau). Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after World War I and the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en- Laye, the predominantly German-speaking population found itself in newly established Czechoslovakia. Right-wing political groups like the German National Socialist Worker's Party referred to themselves as Volksdeutsche and began to urge for a unification with Germany, their efforts laid the foundation for the rise of the Sudeten German Party under Konrad Henlein after 1933. With the Sudetenland, Teplice was annexed by Nazi Germany according to the 1938 Munich Agreement and incorporated into Reichsgau Sudetenland. In 1930, 3,213 Jews lived in Teplice, 10% of the population. Under the Nazi regime they faced the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. Many fled and the Teplice Synagogue was burnt during Kristallnacht. After World War II the Czechoslovak government enacted the Bene≈° decrees, whereafter the German-speaking majority of the population was expelled from Teplice. In 1945, the Princes of Clary- Aldringen, lords of Teplice since 1634, were expropriated. In 1994, Jaroslav Kubera of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) became mayor of Teplice and he held the position until 2018.

His sensual, emotive poetry marks him as one of the precursors of the Romantic movement. His career was brought to an abrupt end when he was guillotined for supposed \\"crimes against the state\\", just three days before the end of the Reign of Terror. Ch√©nier's life has been the subject of Umberto Giordano's opera Andrea Ch√©nier and other works of art. Life Bust of Andr√© Ch√©nier by David d'Angers (1839). Ch√©nier was born in the Galata district of Constantinople. His family home, destroyed in a fire, was located on the site of the present Saint Pierre Han, in today's Karak√∂y neighborhood of Istanbul. His father, Louis Ch√©nier, a native of Languedoc, after twenty years in the Levant as a cloth-merchant, was appointed to a position equivalent to that of French consul at Constantinople. His mother, √âlisabeth Santi-Lomaca, whose sister was grandmother of Adolphe Thiers, was of Greek origins. When Andr√© was three years old, his father returned to France, and from 1768 to 1775 served as consul-general of France in Morocco. The family, of which Andr√© was the third son, and Marie-Joseph (see below) the fourth, remained in France; and after a few years, during which Andr√© was given his youthful freedom while living with an aunt in Carcassonne; a square in Carcassonne is named to commemorate him. He distinguished himself as a verse-translator from the classics at the Coll√®ge de Navarre in Paris. In 1783 Ch√©nier enlisted in a French regiment at Strasbourg, but the novelty soon wore off. He returned to Paris before the end of the year, was well received by his family, and mixed in the cultivated circle which frequented his mother's salon, including Lebrun-Pindare, Antoine Lavoisier, Jean Fran√ßois Lesueur, Claude Joseph Dorat, and, a little later, the painter Jacques-Louis David. Ch√©nier had already decided to become a poet, and worked in the neoclassical style of the time. He was especially inspired by a 1784 visit to Rome, Naples, and Pompeii. For nearly three years, he studied and experimented in verse without any pressure or interruption from his family. He wrote mostly idylls and bucolics, imitated to a large extent from Theocritus, Bion of Smyrna and the Greek anthologists. Among the poems written or at least sketched during this period were L'Oaristys, L'Aveugle, La Jeune Malode, Bacchus, Euphrosine and La Jeune Tarentine. He mixed classical mythology with a sense of individual emotion and spirit. Apart from his idylls and his elegies, Ch√©nier also experimented with didactic and philosophic verse, and when he commenced his Herm√®s in 1783 his ambition was to condense the Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot into a long poem somewhat after the manner of Lucretius. Now extant only in fragments, this poem was to treat of man's place in the universe, first in an isolated state, and then in society. Another fragment called \\"L'Invention\\" sums up Ch√©nier's thoughts on poetry: \\"De nouvelles pens√©es, faisons des vers antiques\\" (\\"From new thoughts, let us make antique verses\\"). Ch√©nier remained unpublished. In November 1787 an opportunity for a fresh career presented itself. The Chevalier de la Luzerne, a friend of the Ch√©nier family, had been appointed ambassador to Britain. When he offered to take Andr√© with him as his secretary, Andr√© knew the offer was too good to refuse, but was unhappy in England. He bitterly ridiculed \\"... ces Anglais. Nation toute √† vendre √† qui peut la payer. De contr√©e en contr√©e allant au monde entier, Offrir sa joie ignoble et son faste grossier.\\" Translation: \\"... these English. A nation for sale to whoever can pay for it. Going from country to country and out to the whole world, offering its ignoble joy and its coarse splendor.\\" Although John Milton and James Thomson seem to have interested him, and a few of his verses show slight inspiration from Shakespeare and Thomas Gray, it would be an exaggeration to say Ch√©nier studied English literature. The events of 1789 and the startling success of his younger brother, Marie- Joseph, as political playwright and pamphleteer, concentrated all his thoughts upon France. In April 1790 he could stand London no longer, and once more joined his parents at Paris in the rue de Cl√©ry. France was on the verge of anarchy. A monarchien believing in a constitutional monarchy for France, Ch√©nier believed that the Revolution was already complete and that all that remained to be done was the inauguration of the reign of law. Though his political viewpoint was moderate, his tactics were dangerously aggressive: he abandoned his gentle idyls to write poetical satires. His prose \\"Avis au peuple fran√ßais\\" (24 August 1790) was followed by the rhetorical \\"Jeu de paume\\", a somewhat declamatory moral ode occasioned by the Tennis court oathThe indoor tennis court at Versailles was the jeu du paume. addressed to the radical painter Jacques-Louis David. In the meantime Ch√©nier orated at the Feuillants Club, and contributed frequently to the Journal de Paris from November 1791 to July 1792, when he wrote his scorching iambs to Jean Marie Collot d'Herbois, Sur les Suisses r√©volt√©s du regiment de Ch√¢teauvieux. The insurrection of 10 August 1792 uprooted his party, his paper and his friends, and he only escaped the September Massacres by staying with relatives in Normandy. In the month following these events his brother, Marie-Joseph, had entered the anti-monarchical National Convention. Andr√© raged against all these events, in such poems as Ode √† Charlotte Corday congratulating France that \\"un sc√©l√©rat de moins rampe dans cette fange\\", \\"one scoundrel less creeps in this mire\\". At the request of Malesherbes, the defense counsel to King Louis XVI, Ch√©nier provided some arguments for the king's defense. Appeal of the last victims of terror in the prison of St. Lazarus.7, 9 Thermidor 1794 by Charles Louis M√ºller, (Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise). After the king's execution Ch√©nier sought a secluded retreat on the Plateau de Satory at Versailles and only went out after nightfall. There he wrote the poems inspired by Fanny (Mme Laurent Lecoulteux), including the exquisite Ode √† Versailles. His solitary life at Versailles lasted nearly a year. On 7 March 1794 he was arrested at the house of Mme Piscatory at Passy. Two obscure agents of the Committee of Public Safety (one of them named Nicolas Gu√©not) were in search of a marquise who had fled, but an unknown stranger was found in the house and arrested on suspicion of being the aristocrat they were searching for. This was Ch√©nier, who had come on a visit of sympathy. Ch√©nier was taken to the Luxembourg Palace and afterwards to the Prison Saint-Lazare. During the 140 days of his imprisonment he wrote a series of iambs (in alternate lines of 12 and 8 syllables) denouncing the Convention, which \\"hiss and stab like poisoned bullets\\", and which were smuggled to his family by a jailer. In prison he also composed his most famous poem, \\"Jeune captive\\", a poem at once of enchantment and of despair, inspired by the misfortunes of his fellow captive the duchesse de Fleury, n√©e Aim√©e de Coigny.Jules Derocquigny, ed., Po√©sies choisies de Andre Chenier, (1907) \\"Introduction\\". Ten days before Ch√©nier's death, the painter Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e completed the well-known portrait of him, shown in the box above. Ch√©nier might have been overlooked but for the well-meant, indignant officiousness of his father. Marie-Joseph tried, but failed, to prevent his brother's execution. Maximilien Robespierre, who was himself in dangerous straits, remembered Ch√©nier as the author of the venomous verses in the Journal de Paris and had him hauled before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which sentenced him to death. Ch√©nier was one of the last people executed by Robespierre.Robespierre himself would be guillotined 3 days later, on 28 July 1794. At sundown, Ch√©nier was taken by tumbrel to the guillotine at what is now the Place de la Nation. He was executed along with Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se de Choiseul-Stainville, Princesse Joseph de Monaco, on a charge of conspiracy. Robespierre was seized and executed only three days later. Ch√©nier, aged 31 at his execution, was buried in the Cimeti√®re de Picpus. Works During Ch√©nier's lifetime only his Jeu de paume (1791) and Hymne sur les Suisses (1792) had been published. For the most part, then, his reputation rests on his posthumously published work, retrieved from oblivion page by page. The Jeune Captive appeared in the D√©cade philosophique, on 9 January 1795; La Jeune Tarentine in the Mercure de France of 22 March 1801. Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand quoted three or four passages in his G√©nie du Christianisme. FayolleM√©langes litt√©raires, compos√©s de morceaux in√©dits de Diderot, Caylus, Thomas, Rivarol,Andr√© Ch√©nier... (Paris 1816), noted by Derocquigny 1907. and Jules Lef√®vre-Deumier also gave a few fragments; but it was not until 1819 that an attempt was made by Henri de Latouche to collect the poems in a substantive volume, from manuscripts retained by Marie-Joseph Ch√©nier. Many more poems and fragments were discovered after Latouche's publication, and were collected in later editions. Latouche also wrote an account of Ch√©nier's last moments. Critical opinions of Ch√©nier have varied wildly. He experimented with classical precedents rendered in French verse to a much greater extent than other 18th-century poets; on the other hand, the ennui and melancholy of his poetry recalls Romanticism. In 1828, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve praised Ch√©nier as a heroic forerunner of the Romantic movement and a precursor of Victor Hugo. Ch√©nier, he said, had \\"inspired and determined\\" Romanticism. Many other critics also wrote about Ch√©nier as modern and proto-Romantic. However, Anatole France contests Sainte-Beuve's theory: he claims that Ch√©nier's poetry is one of the last expressions of 18th-century classicism. His work should not be compared to Hugo and the Parnassien poets, but to philosophes like Andr√© Morellet. Albert Camus in 1951's The Rebel called Chenier \\"the only poet of the times\\". Camus, A. (1956). The rebel: An essay on man in revolt. New York: Knopf. Paul Morillot has argued that judged by the usual test of 1820s Romanticism (love for strange literature of the North, medievalism, novelties and experiments), Ch√©nier would have been excluded from Romantic circles. The poet Jos√© Mar√≠a de Heredia held Ch√©nier in great esteem, saying \\"I do not know in the French language a more exquisite fragment than the three hundred verses of the Bucoliques\\" and agreeing with Sainte-Beuve's judgment that Ch√©nier was a poet ahead of his time. Ch√©nier has been very popular in Russia, where Alexandr Pushkin wrote a poem about his last hours based on Latouche and Ivan Kozlov translated La Jeune Captive, La Jeune Tarentine and other famous pieces. Ch√©nier has also found favor with English-speaking critics; for instance, his love of nature and of political freedom has been compared to Shelley, and his attraction to Greek art and myth recalls Keats. Ch√©nier's fate has become the subject of many plays, pictures and poems, notably in the opera Andrea Ch√©nier by Umberto Giordano, the epilogue by Sully-Prudhomme, the Stello by Alfred de Vigny, the delicate statue by Denys Puech in the Luxembourg, and the well-known portrait in the centre of Muller's Last Days of the Terror.

Ferrone met guitarist Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers when the two played a show with George Harrison as part of his Hara and the Hijack band at Royal Albert Hall. He became the band's full-time drummer after the departure of original drummer Stan Lynch in 1994. Ferrone's first album with the band was Tom Petty's second solo outing Wildflowers, released that same year. His first live performance as a member of the Heartbreakers was in Louisville, Kentucky on February 28, 1995. Ferrone thoroughly enjoyed his time with the Heartbreakers, saying that \\"everyone should have an experience like 'The Heartbreakers' in their musical life: creativity, passion, honesty, integrity and a lot of fun.\\" In November 2002, Ferrone founded Drumroll Studios in Burbank, California, with producer John Jones, who he had worked with since Duran Duran's \\"Ordinary World\\" in 1992. Later, they were joined by guitarist and producer Steve Postell and they recorded and produced albums and tracks for a wide variety of musical acts, as well as film and TV scores.

Page from a 15th-century Byzantine manuscript :For the ancient Phoenician writer, see Mochus. For the 6th century A.D. Syrian writer, see Joannes Moschus. Moschus is also the genus of the musk deer. Moschus (), ancient Greek bucolic poet and student of the Alexandrian grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace, was born at Syracuse and flourished about 150 BC. Aside from his poetry, he was known for his grammatical work, nothing of which survives. His few surviving works consist of an epyllion, the Europa, on the myth of Europa, three bucolic fragments and a whole short bucolic poem Runaway Love, and an epigram in elegiac couplets. His surviving bucolic material (composed in the traditional dactylic hexameters and Doric dialect) is short on pastoral themes and is largely erotic and mythological; although this impression may be distorted by the paucity of evidence, it is also seen in the surviving bucolic of the generations after Moschus, including the work of Bion of Smyrna. Moschus' poetry is typically edited along with other bucolic poets, as in the commonly used Oxford text by A. S. F. Gow (1952), but the Europa has often received separate scholarly editions, as by Winfried B√ºhler (Wiesbaden 1960) and Malcolm Campbell (Hildesheim 1991). The epigram is also normally published with the edition by Maximos Planoudes of the Greek Anthology. The Europa, along with Callimachus' Hecale and such Latin examples as Catullus 64, is a major example of the Hellenistic phenomenon of the epyllion. Although it is hard to tell because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence, Moschus' influence on Greek bucolic poetry is likely to have been significant; the influence of Runaway Love is felt in Bion and other later bucolic poets. In later European literature his work was imitated or translated by such authors as Torquato Tasso and Ben Jonson. Two other poems, attributed to him at one time or another but no longer thought to be his, are also commonly edited with his work. The best known is the Epitaph on Bion (i.e. Bion of Smyrna), which had a long history of influence on the pastoral lament for a poet (compare Milton's Lycidas). The other is a miniature epic on Megara (the wife of Heracles), consisting of an epic dialogue between Heracles' mother and his wife on his absence. References For a recent overview of Moschus see A. Porro in Eikasmos 10 (1999) 125‚Äì25. *There are English translations by J.

It is located in the commune of Agde, in the H√©rault department within the region of Occitanie. Cap d'Agde was planned by architect Jean Le Couteur as part of one of the largest state-run development schemes in French history. In the 1960s, the only buildings at the Cap were small houses that were typically used by locals over the weekends. It is now one of the largest leisure ports on the French Mediterranean. Agde can be reached by TGV SNCF train direct from Paris or Lille whilst the closest airports are B√©ziers-Cap d'Agde en Languedoc, with direct budget airline services to the UK and Scandinavia, or Montpellier-Fr√©jorgues. Public transport (taxi or bus) is available between Agde and Cap d'Agde. The Mus√©e de l'Eph√®be houses the bronze nude statue known as \\"l'Eph√®be d'Agde\\" (\\"the Youth of Agde\\"). The statue was discovered in the River H√©rault and was housed in the Louvre Museum prior to suitable facilities being made available in Cap d'Agde to house it.  Village Naturiste  Village Naturiste without campsite Sign on the beach at Cap d'Agde Cap d'Agde has a large family-style naturist resort. The Village Naturiste () is a large fenced-off part at the north-eastern edge of Cap d'Agde, although it is accessible along the public beach from the east. It is a self-contained town (sometimes referred to as the \\"Naked City\\"), where nudity is legal and common in the whole resort. In the evening, when it gets colder, more people are dressed, sometimes in revealing clothes. A local tourist tax is charged per person, per day. At the far end of naturism ethics, the village is also becoming a hotspot for swingers and libertines. The Naturist Village is a town by itself, with a beach, a large marina, 2,500 campsites, apartment complexes, hotel, shops, restaurants, night clubs, bars, post office, bank and ATMs, launderettes, hairdressers and other facilities.  A history of naturism at Cap d'Agde  The land adjoining the long sandy beach at Cap d'Agde was owned for many years by the Oltra family who farmed the olive groves behind the sand dunes adjoining the beach. After the Second World War the brothers Oltra noticed that people were coming in increasing numbers to camp on their land, and that many of these people liked to bathe and to sunbathe nude. The Oltra brothers began to formalise arrangements for campers on their land, and this subsequently led to the creation of the Oltra Club which is a caravanning and camping resort. The camp grew increasingly popular, especially with young families. German and Dutch tourists were particularly numerous. In the early 1970s the government of Georges Pompidou drew up plans for the development of the Languedoc-Roussillon coastline. Naturism initially had no part in these proposals, but Paul Ren√© Oltra, one of the brothers, persuaded the authorities to include plans for a naturist resort at Cap d'Agde. In 1973 the beach was officially designated as a naturist beach. Regulations for the new resort were also promulgated. The Naturist Village would be a place where voyeurs and exhibitionists would not be welcome. = Early developments = The first developments were at Port Nature and Port Ambonne where flats, shops and pools were constructed. Later, Heliopolis and Port Venus were built and Port Nature was considerably extended. The flats were sold and the owners often let them when they did not require them for their own use. The Naturist Village became a controlled zone during the season with regulated access. Everyone entering was informed of the regulations and required to comply with them. = The 1980s = By the early 1980s, the Naturist Village was reaching the limit of its development. Many shops and commercial premises remained empty, ready for sale or lease. The election of the government of Fran√ßois Mitterrand was to herald a cooling off of the French economy which lasted well into the following decade. During this time the Naturist Village continued to prove a popular resort and it developed an easy and pleasant atmosphere. There were so many German visitors that the Post Office even had a designated postbox for letters and postcards being sent to Germany. = The present position = Naked man in phone booth, Cap d'Agde, 2010 The naturist village is also becoming a hotspot for swingers and libertines, with sex-shops and swinger clubs. The swingers are also active on the naturist beaches, which makes numerous naturist tourists change destination to another truly family naturist resort. The naturist village has rules requiring nudity as the norm, which ban photography, the wearing of provocative clothing and the display of indecent items. Signs on the beach in 2008 warned against lewd behaviour. There are clubs and smaller venues including shops and bars. The nightlife centres on clubs and venues. Many open only at certain times of the year. On 23 November 2008 the British newspaper The Sunday Times suggested fires at three swinger clubs were the work of hardline naturists or 'nudist mullahs' who oppose the echangistes or libertines. In 2009, Ren√© Oltra, the company which bears the name of the original promoter of the resort, required visitors to its campsite and villas and flats which it lets to belong to a naturist organisation. However, because of abuses the Cap d'Agde is no longer agreed or supported by the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Naturisme. In December 2009 the local authority proposed to renovate making the village almost traffic-free constructing tree-lined walkways and promenades, a high-level promenade by the beach, and a hotel. Work was to start in early 2012. Other plans included the renovation of buildings and the construction of new fa√ßades. The naturist village creates employment and revenue in a region of France less affluent than others. It creates income for the local authority through property taxes and admission prices. In September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic it was reported that a testing station outside the village found 30% of 800 naturists tested positive for COVID-19. Under normal circumstances at the time‚Äîmuch reduced during the pandemic‚Äìthe village itself held 10,000 campsite pitches and 15,000 beds, a population density seven times greater than nearby Montpellier.

The memorial is located at the eastern exit of the town and marks the starting point for one of the main roads out of the town that led Allied soldiers to the front line. Designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and built by the Imperial War Graves Commission (since renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Menin Gate Memorial was unveiled on 24 July 1927. Background Menenpoort at the start of World War I In medieval times, the original narrow gateway on the eastern wall of Ypres was called the Hangoartpoort, \\"poort\\" being the Dutch word for gate. During the 17th and 18th centuries, while under the occupation of the Habsburgs and the French, the city was increasingly fortified. Major works were completed at the end of the 17th century by the French military engineer Sebastien Le Prestre, Seigneur de Vauban. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the eastern exit simply cut through the remains of the ramparts and crossed a moat. The gateway was by this time known as the Menenpoort, or Menin Gate in English, because the road leading through the gateway led to the small town of Menen. Ypres occupied a strategic position during the First World War because it stood in the path of Germany's planned sweep across the rest of Belgium, as had been called for in the Schlieffen Plan. By October 1914, the much battered Belgian Army broke the dykes on the Yser River to the north of the City to keep the western tip of Belgium out of German hands. Ypres, being the centre of a road network, anchored one end of this defensive feature and was also essential for the Germans if they wanted to take the Channel Ports through which British support was flooding into France. For the Allies, Ypres was also important because it eventually became the last major Belgian town that was not under German control. The importance of the town is reflected in the five major battles that occurred around it during the war. During the First Battle of Ypres the Allies halted the German Army's advance to the east of the city. The German army eventually surrounded the city on three sides, bombarding it throughout much of the war. The Second Battle of Ypres marked a second German attempt to take the city in April 1915. The third battle is more commonly referred to as Passchendaele, but this 1917 battle was a complex five-month engagement. The fourth and fifth battles occurred during 1918. British and Commonwealth soldiers often passed through the Menenpoort on their way to the front lines with some 300,000 of them being killed in the Ypres Salient. 90,000 of these soldiers have no known graves. From September to November 1915, the British 177th Tunnelling Company built tunnelled dugouts in the city ramparts near the Menin Gate. These were the first British tunnelled dugouts in the Ypres Salient.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 216‚Äì218. The carved limestone lions adorning the original gate were damaged by shellfire, and were donated to the Australian War Memorial by the Mayor of Ypres in 1936. They were restored in 1987, and currently reside at the entrance to that Memorial, so that all visitors to the Memorial pass between them. Replicas of the original Menin gate lions now sit at the entrance of the original gate in Ypres, a gift by the Australian government in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Australians serving in Flanders during the First World War. Memorial Unveiling of the memorial in 1924 by Field Marshal Herbert Plumer Reginald Blomfield's triumphal arch, designed in 1921, is the entry to the barrel-vaulted passage for traffic through the mausoleum that honours the Missing, who have no known graves. The patient lion on the top is the lion of Britain but also the lion of Flanders. It was chosen to be a memorial as it was the closest gate of the town to the fighting, and so Allied Troops would have marched past it on their way to fight. Actually, most troops passed out of the other gates of Ypres, as the Menin Gate was too dangerous due to shellfire. Its large Hall of Memory contains names on stone panels of 54,395 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the Salient but whose bodies have never been identified or found. On completion of the memorial, it was discovered to be too small to contain all the names as originally planned. An arbitrary cut-off point of 15 August 1917 was chosen and the names of 34,984 UK missing after this date were inscribed on the Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing instead. The Menin Gate Memorial does not list the names of the missing of New Zealand and Newfoundland soldiers, who are instead honoured on separate memorials. Interior, Menin Gate The inscription inside the archway is similar to the one at Tyne Cot, with the addition of a prefatory Latin phrase: \\"Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam ‚Äì Here are recorded names of officers and men who fell in Ypres Salient, but to whom the fortune of war denied the known and honoured burial given to their comrades in death\\". The Latin phrase means 'To the greater glory of God'. Both this inscription, and the main overhead inscription on both the east- and west-facing fa√ßades of the arch, were composed by Rudyard Kipling.What does the Menin Gate look like?, Their Past Your Future, Imperial War Museum, November 2005, accessed 07/02/2010 On the opposite side of the archway to that inscription is the shorter dedication: \\"They shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away\\". There are also Latin inscriptions set in circular panels either side of the archway, on both the east and west sides: \\"Pro Patria\\" and \\"Pro Rege\\" ('For Country' and 'For King'). A French inscription mentions the citizens of Ypres: \\"Erig√© par les nations de l'Empire Britannique en l'honneur de leurs morts ce monument est offert aux citoyens d'Ypres pour l'ornement de leur cit√© et en comm√©moration des jours o√π l'Arm√©e Britannique l'a d√©fendue contre l'envahisseur\\", which translated into English means: \\"Erected by the nations of the British Empire in honour of their dead this monument is offered to the citizens of Ypres for the ornament of their city and in commemoration of the days where the British Army defended it against the invader.\\"Menepoort, Belgian World Heritage Sites entry, accessed 07/02/2010Last Post ‚Äì Menenpoort ‚Äì Ieper, Forum Eerste Wereldoorlog, accessed 07/02/2010.

Reaction to the Menin Gate, the first of the Imperial (now Commonwealth) War Graves Commission's Memorials to the Missing, ranged from its condemnation by the war poet Siegfried Sassoon, to praise by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. Sassoon described the Menin Gate in his poem 'On Passing the New Menin Gate', saying that the dead of the Ypres Salient would \\"deride this sepulchre of crime\\". Zweig, in contrast, praised the simplicity of the memorial, and lack of overt triumphalism, and said that it was \\"more impressive than any triumphal arch or monument to victory that I have ever seen\\". Blomfield himself said that this work of his was one of three that he wanted to be remembered by.The Memorial to the Missing of the Somme (Gavin Stamp, 2007), pp. 103‚Äì105 To this day, the remains of missing soldiers are still found in the countryside around the town of Ypres. Typically, such finds are made during building work or road-mending activities. Any human remains discovered receive a proper burial in one of the war cemeteries in the region. If the remains can be identified, the relevant name is removed from the Menin Gate.

Following the Menin Gate Memorial opening in 1927, the citizens of Ypres wanted to express their gratitude towards those who had given their lives for Belgium's freedom. Hence every evening at 20:00, buglers from the Last Post Association close the road which passes under the memorial and sound the \\"Last Post\\". Except for the occupation by the Germans in World War II when the daily ceremony was conducted at Brookwood Military Cemetery, in Surrey, England, this ceremony has been carried on uninterrupted since 2 July 1928. On the evening that Polish forces liberated Ypres in the Second World War, on the 6th of September 1944 the ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate despite the fact that heavy fighting was still taking place in other parts of the town. During an extended version of the ceremony, individuals or groups may lay a wreath to commemorate the fallen. Bands and choirs from around the world may also apply to participate in the ceremonies. This extended version of the ceremony also starts at 20:00, but lasts longer than the normal ceremony, when only the Last Post is played. The Last Post Association is an independent, voluntary, non- profit-making organisation. It was the Association that first founded the Last Post Ceremony back in 1928, and it is the Association that is still responsible for the day-to-day organisation of this unique act of homage. It also administers the Last Post Fund, which provides the financial resources necessary to support the ceremony. It is a tradition that the Buglers of the Association should wear the uniform of the local volunteer Fire Brigade, of which they are all required to become members. The Last Post was a bugle call played in the British Army (and in the armies of many other lands) to mark the end of the day's labours and the onset of the night's rest. In the context of the Last Post ceremony (and in the broader context of remembrance), it has come to represent a final farewell to the fallen at the end of their earthly labours and at the onset of their eternal rest. Similarly, the Reveille was a bugle call played at the beginning of the day, to rouse the troops from slumber and to call them to their duties. In the context of the Last Post ceremony (and in the broader context of remembrance), the Reveille symbolises not only a return to daily life at the end of the act of homage, but also the ultimate resurrection of the fallen on the Day of Judgement. Originally, the Last Post was a bugle call used in the British Army (and others) to signal the end of the day. In the context of the Last Post ceremony, it represents a final farewell to the fallen. In similar manner, the Reveille was traditionally played at the break of day, to waken the soldiers and call them to their duty. In the context of the Last Post ceremony, it not only symbolises the return to daily life at the end of the act of remembrance, but also expresses the resurrection to 'eternal life' of the fallen. Schedules are available on the Last Post website. In art '\\"Menin Gate at Midnight\\" (also known as '\\"Ghosts of Menin Gate'\\") is a 1927 painting by Australian artist Will Longstaff. The painting depicts a host of ghostly soldiers marching across a field in front of the Menin Gate war memorial. The painting is part of the collection of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Other memorials On the city walls near the Menin Gate are further memorials to Allied soldiers who fought and died at Ypres, the most notable being those to the Gurkhas and Indian soldiers.

Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, sneaking, or using disguises. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but rewarding the player for greater use of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism, and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, special agents, spies, thieves, ninjas, or assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and platformers. Elements of \\"stealth\\" gameplay, by way of avoiding confrontation with enemies, can be attributed to a diverse range of games, including Pac Man (1980). Early maze games have been credited with spawning the genre, including Manbiki Shounen (1979), Lupin III (1980), Castle Wolfenstein (1981), 005 (1981) and Metal Gear (1987). The genre became a mainstream success in 1998, with Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Metal Gear Solid, Thief: The Dark Project and later releases, like Hitman and Splinter Cell. Definition Unlike most action games, stealth games challenge the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay elements of the modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize making noise, and strike enemies from the shadows and behind. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, sometimes referred to as \\"ghosting\\" is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may be the only way to successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or in shadows, and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they may be able to hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does trial-and-error. Some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill. Early on in the development of the stealth genre these games were referred to as sneak 'em up games. Game design When hiding in the dark is a gameplay element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players must be able to hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention. In order for a game to include stealth gameplay, the knowledge of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world.Andrew Rollings & Ernest Adams (2006). Fundamentals of Game Design, Prentice Hall. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. History = Early developments: 1979‚Äì1997 = According to Retro Gamers John Szczepaniak, the first stealth game was Manbiki Shounen (Shoplifting Boy), published in November 1979. The PET 2001 personal computer game was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki and involves a boy entering a convenience store and attempting to shoplift by stealing \\"$\\" symbols while avoiding the line-of-sight detection of the owner. If caught, the player is led away by the police. Suzuki presented the game to developer Taito, which used it as inspiration for their similar stealth arcade game, Lupin III (based on the manga and anime of the same name), released in April 1980. In November 1980, Suzuki developed a sequel, Manbiki Shoujo (Shoplifting Girl).MANBIKI SYONEN , FM-7 Museum Castle Wolfenstein, originally available in 1981, employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984,Kat Bailey, Top 5 Overlooked Prequels , 1UP, Retrieved on 2009-06-24 included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and a greater emphasis on disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. As a result of these changes, Wolfenstein would instead pave the way for later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters. In 1981, Sega released an arcade game called 005 in which the player's mission is to take a briefcase of secret documents to a waiting helicopter while avoiding enemy flashlights and use boxes as hiding spots. 005 holds the Guinness World Record for being the first stealth game. In 1985, Durell Software released Saboteur, a game in which the player controls a ninja who has to infiltrate a facility and find a disk while avoiding or defeating security cameras, guards, and dogs. Retro Gamer has called this \\"the original stealth game\\". Mindscape's Infiltrator, released in 1986, combined a flight simulator with a stealth-based \\"ground mission\\". In this ground mission, the protagonist attempts to sneak into enemy territory using false IDs to avoid detection and knock-out gas to incapacitate enemies. The goal of this mission is to photograph secret documents while avoiding alarms. Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, released in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988,Shoemaker, Brad (1998-09-29). The History of Metal Gear , GameSpot, Retrieved 2009-06-23 utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, and was the first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies. The sequel Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was released in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and right to see diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain on the lookout for some time after losing sight of the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics. =Establishing a genre: 1998‚Äì2002= Although stealth gameplay had appeared in previous games, 1998 is seen as a turning point in gaming history because of the release of Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Metal Gear Solid, and Thief: The Dark Project. The ninja-themed Tenchu: Stealth Assassins was the first 3D stealth based-game. Months later, the highly anticipated Metal Gear Solid transformed its modestly successful franchise into a mainstream success. The increased power of the PlayStation console over previous platforms allowed for greater immersion in terms of both story and game environment. Metal Gear Solid has been credited with popularizing the stealth genre. Thief: The Dark Project is also credited as a pioneer of the genre. It was the first stealth game using the first- person perspective, dubbed a \\"first-person sneaker\\", or \\"sneak-em-up\\", and the first to use darkness and shadows as the mode of concealment. Another of Thief's most noteworthy contributions to the genre was the use of sound as a central mechanic. The robust simulation of sound meant players had to be mindful of the sounds they made, including what kind of surface they were traversing, lest they draw attention to them. Conversely, it meant guards could be heard from a distance and the surfaces they moved on could be identified based on the sounds they made. With further releases, many games in the genre drifted towards action by allowing the option of direct confrontations. The Hitman series, the first installment of which was released in 2000, allowed this play style, but rewarded the player for stealthy and elaborate assassination of antagonists. Hitman: Codename 47, the first of the series, was the first 3D game to employ the genre's device of disguises. No One Lives Forever, an espionage themed parody also released in 2000, again allowed the player to combine or choose between stealth and overt violence. In 2000, the first-person action role-playing game Deus Ex also allowed the player the choice of taking a stealth approach. A USA Today reviewer found \\"At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is pureed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth.\\" Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, released 2001 for the PlayStation 2, further evolved the stealth gameplay series. It featured an array of new abilities, including \\"leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers,\\" and sneaking up behind enemies to \\"hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition.\\"Greg Kasavin (2001-11-13), Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Review , GameSpot, Retrieved on 2009-06-29 Metal Gear Solid 2 holds a Guinness World Record for being the first stealth game to feature collective artificial intelligence. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty sold 7 million units in sales, followed by Metal Gear Solid with 6 million units. =Later developments: 2002‚Äìpresent= After the mainstream success of the genre, stealth elements became increasingly incorporated into a wide range of video games, with numerous action games using stealth elements in some way or another. In 2002, the first installment of the Tom Clancy licensed Splinter Cell series was released, which attempted to add more realism to the stealth genre both in terms of graphics and in-game equipment. If the player is discovered in Splinter Cell, the guards will often raise a general alarm which can cause a difficulty spike or even result in automatic mission failure. Clint Hocking, who worked as a level designer for Splinter Cell, noted that this mechanic was in place at this point because the gameplay developers could not easily implement alternative player actions in the case of such detection; for example, on detection, a real agent may react by subduing the agent that found them, but this was not possible to program in at this point in time. Hocking recognized this would be frustrating to the player and would remain an issue with stealth games for about a decade. In addition, Splinter Cell was notable for its state of the art graphics, including dynamic lighting and shadows. Like Thief, Splinter Cell featured a visibility meter which determined how much light was falling on the character. These effects not only contributed to the atmosphere of the game, but dynamically affected in which areas the player could hide. The 2004 sequel, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, added a multiplayer component to the stealth genre. As the genre developed and progressed, stealth gameplay was combined with other genres. Sly Cooper, a cel-shaded game released in 2002, was a \\"stealth platformer\\", while 2003's Siren combined the survival horror genre with the stealth genre. In the same year, Manhunt employed a snuff movie theme and allowed the player to kill antagonists with varying levels of violence, dependent on how much time was spent sneaking behind them. It was the first to show visual executions in the genre.Greg Kasavin (2004-04-20), Manhunt Review , GameSpot, Retrieved on 2009-4-20Evan Griffin (October 10, 2010) , VentureBeat, Retrieved on 2013-09-12 The following year, Konami's Metal Gear Acid combined the stealth gameplay of the Metal Gear series with turn-based strategy and tactical role-playing game elements as well as card battle elements from Konami's own Yu-Gi-Oh! games.Metal Gear Acid (PSP) , 1UP, 03/23/2005 In 2004, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater introduced camouflage to the genre. Set in a jungle, the game emphasized infiltration in a natural environment, along with survival aspects such as food capture, healing and close-quarters combat. The following year, the updated version Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence added an online multiplayer mode to the game with stealth elements. Another 2004 release was The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, based on the Chronicles of Riddick series of movies. The game follows the character of Riddick as he attempts to escape from prison. Action and stealth gaming are combined seamlessly by allowing the character to hide, sneak, or fight his way past most situations. The game was critically acclaimed, and was followed with The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena in 2009. In 2007, Assassin's Creed employed a social element to the stealth game, where the player is able to hide among crowds of civilians by taking care to blend in. Stealth elements were incorporated into Crytek's open world first-person shooter Crysis, multiplayer first-person shooter Team Fortress 2, and first-person role-playing game Fallout 3. In 2008, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (PlayStation 3) Kevin VanOrd (2008-06-13), Metal Gear Solid 4 Review , GameSpot, Retrieved on 2009-06-29 introduced a battlezone element, where the stealth gameplay is incorporated into a battlefield fought between two armies, both of which can be infiltrated by Solid Snake. In 2009, Assassin's Creed II broadened its predecessor's elements of stealth by allowing the player to blend among any group of civilians, rather than specific ones. Assassin's Creed II also allowed the player to distract guards by tossing coins or by hiring thieves and courtesans, and also featured a notoriety level, which made the player more recognizable until they paid off officials or tore down wanted posters. The same year, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Batman: Arkham Asylum incorporated stealth elements in different segments of the games. The multiplayer modes of Aliens vs. Predator in 2010 and Killzone 3 in 2011 also incorporated stealth elements. The 2012 game Dishonored tried to incorporate stealth elements that were influenced by Thief, such as the importance of lighting and shadows. The developers later abandoned that system citing realism as a factor. The game instead relies on a system of \\"occlusion-based\\" stealth, using the vision cones of the enemies, obstacles, and special abilities which determines whether or not the character is visible. Additionally, while other games had implemented such systems, Dishonored was recognized for having a forgiving stealth system compared with Splinter Cell, in that if detected, the player had several options available to either attack those enemies that detected them, distract them, or flee and outrun them by using parkour, rather than immediately reaching a \\"game over\\". Forbes called Dishonored one of the best stealth games of 2012, along with Hitman: Absolution and Mark of the Ninja. Mark of the Ninja puts a twist on the stealth genre in that it is a 2D side-scroller. This posed some unique factors, such as the lack of corners for the character to hide behind, and the visibility presented in a side-scroller; the developers overcame this by adding 'fog' that prevents the player from seeing things that the character can not see, visually representing enemy line-of-sight and even visualizing the noise made by the character, including how far that noise travels. After the completion of the game, the player has access to a harder difficulty called \\"New Game Plus\\", which further decreases visibility by adding fog behind the player and removes noise visualizations and enemy line of sight indicators. In 2014, Creative Assembly released Alien: Isolation, a stealth game which emphasized survival-horror. In this game, the protagonist is trapped on a space station with an alien xenomorph which they must avoid for the majority of the game, being unable to kill it. The game also uses feedback from the player's microphone to enhance gameplay as the alien is able to hear noises made by the player and can use them to detect their location. The 2019 Untitled Goose Game by Australian developer House House, utilised stealth as a major mechanic alongside the otherwise comedic tone of the game, leading to comparisons to Metal Gear Solid.

This group of ray-finned fish is monotypic, containing a single family Ateleopodidae. It has about a dozen species in four genera, but these enigmatic fishes are in need of taxonomic revision. Nelson (2006): pp.212-213 The scientific name means \\"Ateleopus-shaped\\", from Ateleopus (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix \\"-formes\\". It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek atelƒìs (·ºÄœÑŒµŒªŒÆœÇ, \\"imperfect\\") + pous (œÄŒøœçœÇ, \\"foot\\") + Latin forma (\\"external form\\"), the Greek part in reference to the reduced pectoral and ventral fins of the jellynoses.Woodhouse (1910), Glare (1968-1982), FishBase (2006) Description and ecology Jellynoses are deep-water, bottom-dwelling, marine fishes. They are known from the Caribbean Sea, eastern Atlantic, the western and central Indopacific, and the Pacific coast of Central America.Olney (1998), Nelson (2006): p.213 Their skeletons are largely cartilage (hence \\"jellynose\\"), although they are true teleosts and not at all related to Chondrichthyes. The heads are large, with a bulbous nose, and the (usually) elongated body tapers towards the tail. Their caudal fins are very small, and except for Guentherus, it is merged with the long anal fin (which has 70 fin rays or more). The pelvic fins of juveniles have up to 10 rays, but in adults this is reduced to a single elongated ray at the throat. Again, Guentherus is an exception, retaining several fins as adults and having ventral fins that are located behind (not below) the pectoral fins. Dorsal fins tend to be high, with a rather short base (9-13 rays, but in some as few as three); they are placed just behind the head. They have seven branchiostegal rays. The species have a range of sizes, the longest reaching . Most of the species are poorly known, but the highfin tadpole fish (Guentherus altivelis) is of potential interest for commercial fishing.  Systematics  Together with their relatives, the Stomiiformes, the jellynoses are often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii. Whether it is indeed justified to accept such a small group is doubtful; it may well be that the closest living relatives of the \\"Stenopterygii\\" are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the \\"Stenopterygii\\" are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and is probably not ideal due to the profusion of very small taxa it would create. In fact, in some treatments, the jellynose fishes are even placed in yet another monotypic superorder, the Ateleopodomorpha.FishBase (2006), Nelson (2006): pp.212-213, Diogo (2008) The Ateleopodidae have also been placed in the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which otherwise constitute additional superorders. The relationships of these to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii sensu lato or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately advanced Teleostei is in need of further study.Nelson (2006): pp.212-213, Diogo (2008)  References  * Diogo, Rui (2008): On the cephalic and pectoral girdle muscles of the deep sea fish Alepocephalus rostratus, with comments on the functional morphology and phylogenetic relationships of the Alepocephaloidei (Teleostei).

The novel is centered on the efforts of Nick Shay, a waste management executive who grew up in the Bronx, to trace the history of the baseball struck in The Shot Heard 'Round the World, and encompasses numerous subplots drawn from American history in the second half of the twentieth century. Described as both postmodernist and a reaction to postmodernism,Evans, D. (2006). Taking Out the Trash: Don DeLillo's \\"Underworld\\", Liquid Modernity, and the End of Garbage. The Cambridge Quarterly, 35(2), 103-132. Retrieved May 24, 2020. it examines themes of nuclear proliferation, waste, and the contribution of individual lives to the course of history. A best-seller that was nominated for the National Book Award and shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, Underworld is often regarded as DeLillo's supreme achievement. In 2006, a survey of eminent authors and critics conducted by The New York Times named Underworld as the runner-up for the best work of American fiction of the past 25 years, behind only Toni Morrison's Beloved.In Search of the Best ‚Äì New York Times Background Following the publication of the well-regarded novels White Noise (1985), Libra (1988), and Mao II (1991), DeLillo made few public appearances and published little for several years while writing Underworld, besides the folio short story Pafko at the Wall which was incorporated into the prologue of Underworld with minor changes. According to DeLillo, the novel's title came to him as he thought about radioactive waste buried deep underground and about Pluto, the god of death.Bing, Jonathan. The Ascendance of Don DeLillo, Publishers Weekly, August 11, 1997. (retrieved Sept. 7, 2007) Plot summary The prologue is a fictionalized account of The Shot Heard 'Round the World, a home run by Bobby Thomson on October 3, 1951, that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants against their cross-town rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers. In DeLillo's account, the game-winning ball is caught by a young black fan named Cotter Martin, while J. Edgar Hoover, watching in the stands, is informed in the middle of the game of the first Soviet test of the hydrogen bomb. The remainder of the novel, comprising six parts and an epilogue, is a reverse chronological account of the life of Nick Shay, the man who ultimately ends up with the baseball, from his undirected existence as an executive of a waste management company in Arizona in the 1990s back to his childhood in the Bronx in the 1950s, though the non-linear narrative includes a large number of digressions and ancillary subplots. Part 1 takes place in 1992. Nick Shay lives in Arizona with his wife, Marian, who is having an affair with his colleague, Brian Glassic. Nick visits an art installation of painted B-52 aircraft in the desert by Klara Sax, with whom Nick is later revealed to have had an affair forty years earlier. It is revealed that Nick killed a man when he was a teenager, and that Nick's father disappeared when Nick was a child after going out to get a pack of Lucky Strikes. Nick prefers to imagine that he was killed by the Mafia. In a flashback to 1951, Cotter Martin's father takes the baseball from his son with the intention of selling it. In Part 2, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marian begins her affair with Brian, while Nick acquires the baseball from an avid baseball memorabilia collector named Marvin Lundy after Brian meets Lundy on a trip to New York City to see the Fresh Kills Landfill. Elsewhere, in the Bronx, a pessimistic, germophobic nun named Sister Edgar, who was Nick Shay's Catholic school teacher in the 1950s, works among the unbelieving poor and sick. A videotape of a serial killer nicknamed the Texas Highway Killer is described. In Part 3, in the spring of 1978, Nick attends a waste management conference in the Mojave Desert and meets a swinger named Donna, while Marvin Lundy traces the baseball to San Francisco. Part 4, in the summer of 1974, mainly concerns Klara Sax, who is working as an artist in New York City, and Matt Shay, Nick's brother, a former chess prodigy, who is a scientist in the nuclear weapons program in New Mexico. Part 5 encompasses the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with Nick Shay in juvenile detention, following Nick's relationship with a woman named Amy and later with his future wife Marian, and Matt's courtship of his wife Janet. Lenny Bruce's comedy routines on the Cuban Missile Crisis are mentioned several times. In another flashback, Cotter Martin's father sells his baseball to Charles Wainright, a white fan standing in line with his son outside of Yankee Stadium. Part 6, from the fall of 1951 to the summer of 1952, relates how Nick Shay, running loose after his father left his family, accidentally kills his friend George Manza. In the epilogue, Nick and Brian travel to Kazakhstan to watch a demo of a new waste disposal system that incinerates the waste with a nuclear explosion. Nick confronts Brian about his affair with Marian, but decides to stay with Marian. Esmeralda, a feral girl in the Bronx whom the Catholic nuns were trying to save, is raped and murdered. Her image then miraculously appears on a billboard. Sister Edgar dies shortly after witnessing the miracle. Literary significance and reception Underworld received high acclaim from literary critics, particularly for DeLillo's prose and ambition.

Allusions and references The novel has J. Edgar Hoover utterly intrigued by The Triumph of Death, a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Hoover first sees the painting while at the baseball game; the painting was reproduced in Life and pieces of it fall on him when someone in the stands above tears up the magazine and tosses the pieces. Later in the book he obtains a print of the painting. Several segments of the novel are named in homage to other works. Das Kapital is Karl Marx's magnum opus, \\"Long Tall Sally\\" is a song by Little Richard also famous as a cover by The Beatles, and \\"Cocksucker Blues\\" is an infamous unreleased Rolling Stones song and film. \\"Better Things for Better Living Through Chemistry\\" was an advertising slogan for DuPont, while \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\" is an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century.The Cloud of Unknowing The section titled \\"Arrangement in Grey and Black\\" refers to to a James McNeill Whistler painting better known as Whistler's Mother. The novel incorporates a number of historical events. The prologue is about \\"The Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" and the whereabouts of the ball hit by Thomson are a recurrent element of the book. The book also employs Lenny Bruce‚Äôs reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis and Soviet Union's atomic weapons program (including their testing grounds in Kazakhstan). The novel also describes a commercial screening of the Zapruder film. Numerous characters attend Truman Capote's famous Black and White Ball. The main character also finds himself walking through New York during a power outage amid the Northeast blackout of 1965.

Biography Lebrun was born in Paris at the house of the prince de Conti, to whom his father was valet. Among Lebrun's school friends was a son of Louis Racine, whose disciple he became. In 1755 he published an Ode sur les d√©sastres de Lisbonne. In 1759 he married Marie Anne de Surcourt, addressed in his √âl√©gies as Fanny. In the early years of his marriage he produced his poem, Nature. His wife suffered much from his violent temper, and when in 1774 she brought an action against him to obtain a separation, she was supported by Lebrun's own mother and sister. Lebrun had been secr√©taire des commandements to the prince de Conti, and on his patron's death he lost this position. He also lost financially as a result of the bankruptcy of the prince de Guemene. To this period belongs a long poem, the Veill√©es des Muses, which remained unfinished, and his ode to Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, which ranks among his best works. Dependent on government pensions he changed his politics with the times. He praised Calonne, comparing him with the great Sully, and likened Louis XVI to Henry IV of France, but he ended up as the Reign of Terror's official poet. He occupied rooms in the Louvre, and fulfilled his obligations by shameless attacks on the king and queen. His excellent ode on the Vengeur and the Ode nationale contre l'Angleterre on the occasion of the projected invasion of Britain were written in honour of the power of Napoleon. This \\"versatility\\" damaged Lebrun's reputation, making it difficult to appreciate his real merit. He had a genius for epigram, and the quatrains and dizains directed against his many enemies have a verve generally lacking in his odes. The one directed against La Harpe is called by Sainte-Beuve the \\"queen of epigrams.\\" La Harpe has said that the poet, called by his friends, perhaps with a spice of irony, Lebrun-Pindare, had written many fine strophes but not one good ode. The critic exposed mercilessly the obscurities and unlucky images which occur even in the ode to Buffon, and advised the author to imitate the simplicity and energy that adorned Buffon's prose. His works were published by his friend PL Ginguen√© in 1811. The best of them are included in Prosper Poitevin's \\"Petits po√®tes fran√ßais,\\" which forms part of the \\"Panth√©on litt√©raire\\".

The city's economy is based on food-processing technology, photochemical, electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and IT. Traditional industries include musical instrument manufacturing ‚Äì the best known being Petrof pianos. The University of Hradec Kr√°lov√© is located in the city, the University of Defense has its only medical faculty in Hradec Kr√°lov√© and Charles University in Prague also has its Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Pharmacy there. Geography The city lies at the confluence of the Elbe and the Orlice rivers close to Krkono≈°e (Giant Mountains), the highest of the Czech mountains, with its peak, Snƒõ≈æka (Snowhill), at 1,603 m. History The original name of one of the oldest settlements in the Czech Republic was Hradec (the Castle); Kr√°lov√© (of the queen) was affixed when it became one of the dowry towns of Elisabeth Richeza of Poland (1286‚Äì1335), who lived there for thirty years, having been the second wife of two Bohemian Kings, Wenceslaus II and then Rudolph I of Habsburg. In Latin, the Castle of the Queen was called Grecz Reginae, the original German K√∂nigingr√§tz was shortened to K√∂niggr√§tz by 1800. It remained a dowry town until 1620. Hradec Kr√°lov√© was the first town to declare for the national cause during the Hussite Wars in the first half of the 15th century. After the Battle of White Mountain (1620), a large segment of the Protestant population left the area. In 1639 the town was occupied for eight months by the Swedes. Several churches and convents were pulled down to make way for fortifications erected under Joseph II. The Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz, the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War, took place on 3 July 1866 near Hradec Kr√°lov√©. This event is commemorated in the famous \\"K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch\\". Moreover, the battle put an end to the age of fortifications, which were finally destroyed in 1884. The city is situated in the centre of a very fertile region called the Golden Road, at the confluence of the Elbe and the Orlice, and contains many buildings of historical and architectural interest. The Cathedral of the Holy Spirit was founded in 1303 by Elizabeth, and the church of St. John, built in 1710, stands on the ruins of the old castle. During the 1920s and 1930s the city grew rapidly, thanks to decisions made by the heads of the city to develop a modern city, which included razing the fortress and opening the town for expansion. During this era many buildings of modern architecture were built, and Hradec Kr√°lov√© became known as the Salon of the Republic. This nickname was given to the city by its citizens, who were enamored by the architecture of Josef Goƒç√°r and Jan Kotƒõra. Airport Hradec Kr√°lov√© Airport is a public domestic and private international airport located about from the city centre. There are currently no scheduled flights operating to the airport. It is sometimes visited by private jet traffic. Culture Throughout the year, there are a number of festivals and events. These may include a range of Music Festivals during Summer months, or other traditional Czech festivals that are celebrated across the country. =Theatre= Every May, an Air Ambulance Show is held for both the general public and Air Ambulance personnel. Every June the Theatre of European regions, an international theatre festival, takes place. =Music= Since 2004 the city hosts Hip Hop Kemp, one of the biggest European hip hop festivals, in August. Since 2007 the city hosts Rock for People, the biggest rock festival in the Czech Republic, in July. \\"Jazz goes to town\\", an international jazz festival, is held in Hradec Kr√°lov√© every October. The city's museum currently holds one of the oldest surviving collections of Czech Renaissance polyphony, the Codex Speci√°ln√≠k manuscript.

He was the fifteenth member elected for seat 4 of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1894. Biography =Early years= Heredia was born at Fortuna Cafeyere, near Santiago de Cuba, to Domingo de Heredia Mieses Pimentel Guridi native of Santo Domingo and his second wife, French Louise Girard d'Houville. At the age of eight he went from the West Indies to France, returning then to Havana at age seventeen, and finally making France his home not long afterwards. He received his classical education with the priests of Saint Vincent at Senlis, and after his visit to Havana he studied at the Ecole des Chartes at Paris. During the later 1860s, with Fran√ßois Edouard Joachim Copp√©e, Ren√© Fran√ßois Armand Sully-Prudhomme, Paul Verlaine and others less distinguished, he was one of the poets who associated with Charles Leconte de Lisle, and were given the name of \\"Parnassiens\\". =Career= To this new school, form ‚Äì the technical part of their art ‚Äì was of supreme importance, and, as a reaction against the influence of Alfred de Musset, they repressed in their work the expression of personal feeling and emotion. \\"True poetry,\\" said M. de Heredia in his discourse on entering the Academy, \\"dwells in nature and in humanity, which are eternal, and not in the heart of the creature of a day, however great.\\" De Heredia wrote very little, and published even less, but his sonnets were circulated in manuscript form, and gave him a reputation before they were published in 1893, together with a few longer poems, as a volume, with the title Les Troph√©es. In the original work, he called to his great friend, the artist Ernest Jean-Marie Millard de Bois Durand, to illustrate his book of original watercolors.

Terminology often uses either the suffixes -vore, -vory, or -vorous from Latin vorare, meaning \\"to devour\\", or -phage, -phagy, or -phagous from Greek œÜŒ±Œ≥Œµ·øñŒΩ (), meaning \\"to eat\\". Evolutionary history The evolution of feeding is varied with some feeding strategies evolving several times in independent lineages. In terrestrial vertebrates, the earliest forms were large amphibious piscivores 400 million years ago. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types, other tetrapods (carnivory), and later, plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation (in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials). Evolutionary adaptations The specialization of organisms towards specific food sources is one of the major causes of evolution of form and function, such as: * mouth parts and teeth, such as in whales, vampire bats, leeches, mosquitos, predatory animals such as felines and fishes, etc. * distinct forms of beaks in birds, such as in hawks, woodpeckers, pelicans, hummingbirds, parrots, kingfishers, etc. * specialized claws and other appendages, for apprehending or killing (including fingers in primates) * changes in body colour for facilitating camouflage, disguise, setting up traps for preys, etc. * changes in the digestive system, such as the system of stomachs of herbivores, commensalism and symbiosis Classification =By mode of ingestion= There are many modes of feeding that animals exhibit, including: *Filter feeding: obtaining nutrients from particles suspended in water *Deposit feeding: obtaining nutrients from particles suspended in soil *Fluid feeding: obtaining nutrients by consuming other organisms' fluids *Bulk feeding: obtaining nutrients by eating all of an organism. *Ram feeding and suction feeding: ingesting prey via the fluids around it. =By mode of digestion= *Extra-cellular digestion: excreting digesting enzymes and then reabsorbing the products *Myzocytosis: one cell pierces another using a feeding tube, and sucks out cytoplasm *Phagocytosis: engulfing food matter into living cells, where it is digested =By food type= Polyphagy is the ability of an animal to eat a variety of food, whereas monophagy is the intolerance of every food except of one specific type (see generalist and specialist species). Another classification refers to the specific food animals specialize in eating, such as: * Carnivore: the eating of animals ** Araneophagy: eating spiders ** Avivore: eating birds ** Durophagy: eating hard-shelled or exoskeleton bearing organisms ** Egg predation: eating eggs (but also see \\"Intrauterine cannibalism\\" below), also Ovivore ** Haematophagy: eating blood ** Insectivore: eating insects *** Myrmecophagy: eating ants and/or termites ** Invertivore: eating invertebrates ** Keratophagy or Ceratophagy: eating horny material, such as wool by cloths moths, or snakes eating their own skin after ecdysis. ** Lepidophagy: eating fish scales ** Molluscivore: eating molluscs ** Mucophagy: eating mucus ** Ophiophagy: eating snakes ** Piscivore: eating fish ** Anurophagy: eating frogs ** Spongivore: eating sponges ** Teuthophagore: eating mainly squid and other cephalopods ** Vermivore: eating worms ** Zooplanktonivore: eating zooplankton * Herbivore: the eating of plants ** Exudativore: eating plant and/or insect exudates (gum, sap, lerp, etc.) *** Gumivore: eating tree gum ** Folivore: eating leaves ** Florivore: eating flower tissue prior to seed coat formation ** Frugivore: eating fruits ** Graminivore: eating grasses ** Granivore: eating seeds ** Nectarivore: eating nectar ** Palynivore: eating pollen ** Phytoplanktonivore: eating phytoplankton ** Xylophagy: eating wood * Omnivore: the eating of both plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. The term means \\"all-eater\\". * By amount of meat in diet ** Hypercarnivore: more than 70% meat ** Mesocarnivore: 30‚Äì70% meat ** Hypocarnivore: less than 30% meat * Fungivore: the eating of fungus * Bacterivore: the eating of bacteria The eating of non-living or decaying matter: * Coprophagy: eating faeces * Detritivore: eating decomposing material * Geophagy: eating inorganic earth * Osteophagy: eating bones * Saprophagy: eating decaying organic matter * Scavenger: eating carrion There are also several unusual feeding behaviours, either normal, opportunistic, or pathological, such as: * Cannibalism: feeding on members of the same species ** Anthropophagy: the practice of eating human flesh ** Intrauterine cannibalism *** Oophagy or Ovophagy: the embryo/foetus eats sibling eggs *** Embryophagy: the foetus eats sibling embryos ** Filial cannibalism ** Self-cannibalism: feeding on parts of one's own body (see also autophagy) ** Sexual cannibalism: cannibalism after mating * Kleptoparasitism: stealing food from another animal * Lignophagia: eating wood, typically a pathological condition in some domestic animals * Paedophagy: eating young animals * Pica: appetite for largely non-nutritive substances, e.g. clay or hair, sometimes in pregnancy or in pathological states, typically a medical or veterinary concern. * Placentophagy: eating placenta * Trophallaxis: eating food regurgitated by another animal * Zoopharmacognosy: self-medication by eating plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease.

CD32 can be found on the surface of a variety of immune cells. CD32 has a low-affinity for the Fc region of IgG antibodies in monomeric form, but high affinity for IgG immune complexes. CD32 has two major functions: cellular response regulation, and the uptake of immune complexes. Cellular responses regulated by CD32 include phagocytosis, cytokine stimulation, and endocytic transport. Dysregulated CD32 is associated with different forms of autoimmunity, including systemic lupus erythematosus. In humans, there are three major CD32 subtypes: CD32A, CD32B, and CD32C. While CD32A and CD32C are involved in activating cellular responses, CD32B is inhibitory.  Structure and signaling  CD32 is a type I transmembrane protein with a helical transmembrane region. Whereas the extracellular region consists of three immunoglobulin domains (roughly 100 a.a. in length), the cytosolic region varies by subtype. CD32A and CD32C possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), while CD32B has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Both motif types rely upon interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins to transduce signals upon binding to an IgG immune complex. When an ITIM is phosphorylated, it activates effector proteins that dephosphorylate the downstream targets of the ITAM signal cascade, such as MAP kinases. CD32 receptors bind to the lower hinge region of IgG via an extracellular domain. Additionally, all CD32 subtypes readily bind IgG1 and IgG3 immune complexes, but differ in their binding affinities for IgG2 and IgG4. CD32A binds IgG2 immune complexes, but not IgG4. CD32B and CD32C bind IgG4 immune complexes, but not IgG2. The usage of monoclonal antibodies can distinguish between CD32A and CD32B; however, the high degree of homology between the extracellular domains of CD32A and CD32C make differentiation difficult.  Functions and locations  = CD32A = CD32A is an activating subtype of CD32 that can be found on a variety of immune cells - notably, CD32A is found on platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). On platelets, it is known to aid in the internalization of IgG-opsonized Escherichia coli, and it is more generally implicated in mediating bacterial-activated platelet responses. CD32A also plays an important role in platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation in response to injured blood vessels. When bound to an IgG immune complex, the cytosolic ITAM can promote phagocytic activity and cytokine secretion in neutrophils and macrophages. CD32A is known to aid in the activation of clathrin coat-mediated endocytosis on various cell types. On DCs, CD32A plays an important role in maturation and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on the cell surface, strengthening the DC's ability to present antigen to T cells. CD32A activation is necessary and sufficient to produce T cell anti-tumor cellular immunity. CD32A is also linked to autoimmunity; for example, the production of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to CD32A is linked to the development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. CD32A is also found on Langerhans cells, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, megakaryocytes, and a subpopulation of activated CD4+ T cells. CD32A is unique to primates. = CD32B = CD32B is an inhibitory surface receptor that is part of a large population of B cell co- receptors, which act to modulate signaling. Activated CD32B has the ability to cross-link with B cell receptors (BCRs), which increases the threshold for B cell activation and downregulates antibody production in the presence of IgG. This feedback loop lowers the production of IgG by B cells when there is a surplus of IgG in the body. CD32B is also found on the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which utilize CD32B for the retention and recycling of immune complexes that they later present to B cells. Thus, CD32B plays an important role in both antibody and memory immune responses. The balance between CD32B and its activating counterparts is crucial to appropriate cell function. Having too little CD32B has been associated with dysregulated antibody function, as well as increased antibody-dependent inflammatory cell responses. Some individuals inheriting mutated, inactivate CD32B genes have a reduced risk of contracting malaria; this is attributed to an enhancement of FcR-dependent phagocytic functions. CD32B imbalance is also associated with autoimmunity. CD32B-deficient mice have been found to be more susceptible to immune-complex-mediated autoimmunity. Likewise, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans is associated with a decrease in CD32B on the surface of memory B cells. A decrease on dendritic cells is often found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The therapeutic usage of monoclonal antibodies against CD32B can be effective for inducing cytotoxicity against B cell lymphoma cells. CD32B is also found on basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.  Non-immune system locations  CD32B can be found on airway smooth muscle cells, as well as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and salivary gland epithelial cells. = CD32C = CD32C is expressed in ~20% of the human population, and is not well-understood. It can be found on B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. When expressed, CD32C plays an important role in the activation of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Animal studies have linked CD32C to augmentation of pathological inflammatory responses.

The ubiquity of her recordings eventually made her a pop-culture figure,\\"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\\" radio appearance and her death drew national attention.National Public Radio obituary  Career  Barbe was born Millicent Jane Schneider in Winter Haven, Florida, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She studied drama at the University of Georgia. After graduating, Barbe worked as a copywriter, though due to her poor spelling, she opted to read her first commercial out loud to her boss instead of submitting it in writing. He asked her to record the commercial herself. In 1963, she began recording messages for the Audichron Company, announcing time, temperature and weather, as well as recordings for early voice mail systems.ETC biography In the 1970s and 1980s, she regularly recorded the intercept messages used when a number is disconnected or number dial errors, and started sharing recording duties with AT&T; voice Pat Fleet in 1981, who eventually took over Barbe's role. Barbe was selected to be the first voice on the Octel Communications voice mail systems and retained that role for many years. Her voice was used on all the prompts (which numbered in the thousands). People often referred to the voice on Octel systems as \\"Jane\\", and Barbe and her husband John were named honorary life employees of Octel in 1992. Over 150 million people used Octel systems prior to the company being acquired in 1997 by Lucent Technologies. By 2000, Barbe's voice was heard by about 300 million people each week. Through the years, Barbe's voice became well-known through the phone companies' use of her recordings, as well as her messages recorded for customized greetings for various corporations who bought Octel voice mail systems. The time announcements she recorded for NBS (now NIST) are still used on radio station WWVH. Her voice was also heard on hotel wake up calls and commercial elevator messages. Recordings with her voice are also used in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Although her native dialect was Southern, she learned to adopt her trademark \\"General American\\" speech while studying drama. When asked to record 1500 time and temperature messages for Telecom Australia, she perfected an Australian accent by listening to recordings of Australian speakers. Other work Barbe was also a former professional singer, meeting her husband while touring with the Buddy Morrow Orchestra, and gained a bit of notoriety in later years, appearing in commercials and on television shows based on her recognition as the \\"Time Lady\\". As a result of her extensive work, she was an early member and a board member of the Atlanta branch of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Barbe and her husband created several hundred singing commercials (jingles). She performed on many of them. She also did voice-over work on TV and films, including the voice of Southern author Margaret Mitchell in the 1988 documentary The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind. On September 26, 2015, both she and her husband were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Death Barbe died from cancer in Roswell, Georgia, on July 18, 2003. She was 74 years old. She was survived by her husband John Barbe, her daughter Susan Stubin, her son David Barbe, and seven grandchildren.

Life and career He was born in Chantenay-sur-Loire (today part of Nantes). He studied at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure from 1926 to 1929. He received his Ph.D. in 1933. In 1934 Leray published an important paper that founded the study of weak solutions of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. In the same year, he and Juliusz Schauder discovered a topological invariant, now called the Leray‚ÄìSchauder degree, which they applied to prove the existence of solutions for partial differential equations lacking uniqueness. From 1938 to 1939 he was professor at the University of Nancy. He did not join the Bourbaki group, although he was close with its founders. His main work in topology was carried out while he was in a prisoner of war camp in Edelbach, Austria from 1940 to 1945. He concealed his expertise on differential equations, fearing that its connections with applied mathematics could lead him to be asked to do war work. Leray's work of this period proved seminal to the development of spectral sequences and sheaves. These were subsequently developed by many others, each separately becoming an important tool in homological algebra. He returned to work on partial differential equations from about 1950. He was professor at the University of Paris from 1945 to 1947, and then at the Coll√®ge de France until 1978. He was awarded the Malaxa Prize (Romania, 1938), the Grand Prix in mathematical sciences (French Academy of Sciences, 1940), the Feltrinelli Prize (Accademia dei Lincei, 1971), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (Israel, 1979), and the Lomonosov Gold Medal (Moscow, 1988).

A protoplanetary disk is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust surrounding a young newly formed star, a T Tauri star, or Herbig Ae/Be star. The protoplanetary disk may also be considered an accretion disk for the star itself, because gases or other material may be falling from the inner edge of the disk onto the surface of the star. This process should not be confused with the accretion process thought to build up the planets themselves. Externally illuminated photo- evaporating protoplanetary disks are called proplyds. In July 2018, the first confirmed image of such a disk, containing a nascent exoplanet, named PDS 70b, was reported. Formation Fraction of stars that show some evidence of having a protoplanetary disk as a function of stellar age (in millions of years). The samples are nearby young clusters and associations. Figure taken from review of Mamajek (2009). Protostars form from molecular clouds consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen. When a portion of a molecular cloud reaches a critical size, mass, or density, it begins to collapse under its own gravity. As this collapsing cloud, called a solar nebula, becomes denser, random gas motions originally present in the cloud average out in favor of the direction of the nebula's net angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum causes the rotation to increase as the nebula radius decreases. This rotation causes the cloud to flatten out‚Äîmuch like forming a flat pizza out of dough‚Äîand take the form of a disk. This occurs because centripetal acceleration from the orbital motion resists the gravitational pull of the star only in the radial direction, but the cloud remains free to collapse in the vertical direction. The outcome is the formation of a thin disc supported by gas pressure in the vertical direction. The initial collapse takes about 100,000 years. After that time the star reaches a surface temperature similar to that of a main sequence star of the same mass and becomes visible. It is now a T Tauri star. Accretion of gas onto the star continues for another 10 million years, before the disk disappears, perhaps being blown away by the young star's stellar wind, or perhaps simply ceasing to emit radiation after accretion has ended. The oldest protoplanetary disk yet discovered is 25 million years old. Protoplanetary disk. Simulated spiral arm vs observational data. Protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars differ from the disks surrounding the primary components of close binary systems with respect to their size and temperature. Protoplanetary disks have radii up to 1000 AU, and only their innermost parts reach temperatures above 1000 K. They are very often accompanied by jets. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around several young stars in our galaxy. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown proplyds and planetary disks to be forming within the Orion Nebula. Protoplanetary disks are thought to be thin structures, with a typical vertical height much smaller than the radius, and a typical mass much smaller than the central young star. The mass of a typical proto-planetary disk is dominated by its gas, however, the presence of dust grains has a major role in its evolution. Dust grains shield the mid-plane of the disk from energetic radiation from outer space that creates a dead zone in which the magnetorotational instability (MRI) no longer operates. It is believed that these disks consist of a turbulent envelope of plasma, also called the active zone, that encases an extensive region of quiescent gas called the dead zone. The dead zone located at the mid-plane can slow down the flow of matter through the disk which prohibits achieving a steady state. Planetary system Protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27, located some 450 light years away. The nebular hypothesis of solar system formation describes how protoplanetary disks are thought to evolve into planetary systems. Electrostatic and gravitational interactions may cause the dust and ice grains in the disk to accrete into planetesimals. This process competes against the stellar wind, which drives the gas out of the system, and gravity (accretion) and internal stresses (viscosity), which pulls material into the central T Tauri star. Planetesimals constitute the building blocks of both terrestrial and giant planets. Some of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are believed to have formed from smaller, circumplanetary analogs of the protoplanetary disks. The formation of planets and moons in geometrically thin, gas- and dust-rich disks is the reason why the planets are arranged in an ecliptic plane. Tens of millions of years after the formation of the Solar System, the inner few AU of the Solar System likely contained dozens of moon- to Mars-sized bodies that were accreting and consolidating into the terrestrial planets that we now see. The Earth's moon likely formed after a Mars-sized protoplanet obliquely impacted the proto-Earth ~30 million years after the formation of the Solar System. Debris disks Artist's impression of the water snowline around the star V883 Orionis. Gas-poor disks of circumstellar dust have been found around many nearby stars‚Äîmost of which have ages in the range of ~10 million years (e.g. Beta Pictoris, 51 Ophiuchi) to billions of years (e.g. Tau Ceti). These systems are usually referred to as \\"debris disks\\". Given the older ages of these stars, and the short lifetimes of micrometer-sized dust grains around stars due to Poynting Robertson drag, collisions, and radiation pressure (typically hundreds to thousands of years), it is thought that this dust is from the collisions of planetesimals (e.g. asteroids, comets). Hence the debris disks around these examples (e.g. Vega, Alphecca, Fomalhaut, etc.) are probably not truly \\"protoplanetary\\", but represent a later stage of disk evolution where extrasolar analogs of the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt are home to dust-generating collisions between planetesimals. Relation to abiogenesis Based on recent computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. (Also see Extraterrestrial organic molecules).

Nearly 180 proplyds have been discovered in the Orion Nebula. Images of proplyds in other star-forming regions are rare, while Orion is the only region with a large known sample due to its relative proximity to Earth.  History  In 1979 observations with the Lallemand electronic camera at the Pic-du-Midi Observatory showed six unresolved high-ionization sources near the Trapezium Cluster. These sources were not interpreted as proplyds, but as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that these objects are being ionized from the outside by M42. Later observations with the Very Large Array showed solar-system-sized condensations associated with these sources. Here the idea appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by an evaporating protostellar accretion disk. Proplyds were clearly resolved in 1993 using images of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera and the term \\"proplyd\\" was used.  Characteristics  In the Orion Nebula the proplyds observed are usually one of two types. Some proplyds glow around luminous stars, in cases where the disk is found close to the star, glowing from the star's luminosity. Other proplyds are found at a greater distance from the host star and instead show up as dark silhouettes due to the self-obscuration of cooler dust and gases from the disk itself. Some proplyds show signs of movement from solar irradiance shock waves pushing the proplyds. The Orion Nebula is approximately 1,500 light-years from the Sun with very active star formation. The Orion Nebula and the Sun are in the same spiral arm of the Milky way Galaxy.Space Telescope, Born in beauty: proplyds in the Orion Nebula, 14 December 2009Space Telescope, Proplyds A proplyd may form new planets and planetesimal systems. Current models show that the metallicity of the star and proplyd, along with the correct planetary system temperature and distance from the star, are keys to planet and planetesimal formation. To date, the solar system, with 8 planets, 5 dwarf planets and 5 planetesimal systems, is the largest planetary system found.Windows 2 Universe, Solar Systemuniversetoday.com, Solar System, by Matt Williams, 25 June 2016universetoday.com, Inner Planets of Our Solar System, by Matt Williams, 25 June 2016 Most proplyds develop into a system with no planetesimal systems, or into one very large planetesimal system.Caltech, Planet-Metallicity Correlation - The Rich Get Richer, by Ji Wang, Planet-Metallicity CorrelationThe Planet-Metallicity Correlation. 2005, April 200, by Debra A.

NGC 1977 currently represents the star-forming region with the largest number of proplyds outside of the Orion Nebula, with 7 proplyds. It is also the first and currently only instance where a B-type star, 42 Orionis is responsible for the photoevaporation. Another type of photoevaporating proplyd was discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These cometary tails represent dust being pulled away from the disks. Westerhout 5 is a region with many dusty proplyds, especially around HD 17505. These dusty proplyds are depleted of any gas in the outer regions of the disk, but the photoevaporation could leave an inner, more robust, and possibly gas- rich disk component of radius 5-10 astronomical units. The proplyds in the Orion Nebula and other star-forming regions represent proto-planetary disks around low-mass stars being externally photoevaporated. These low-mass proplyds are usually found within 0.3 parsec (60,000 astronomical units) of the massive OB star and the dusty proplyds have tails with a length of 0.1 to 0.2 parsec (20,000 to 40,000 au). There is a proposed type of intermediate massive counterpart, called proplyd-like objects. Objects in NGC 3603 and later in Cygnus OB2 were proposed as intermediate massive versions of the bright proplyds found in the Orion Nebula. The proplyd-like objects in Cygnus OB2 for example are 6 to 14 parsec distant to a large collection of OB stars and have tail lengths of 0.11 to 0.55 parsec (24,000 to 113,000 au). The nature of proplyd-like objects as intermediate massive proplyds is partly supported by a sperctrum for one object, which showed that the mass loss rate is higher than the mass accretion rate. Another object did not show any outflow, but accretion.

There appears to be confusion due to the similarity in names \\"Decius\\" and \\"Daia\\". However, his veneration only appears late in Christian tradition, and did not become widespread in the Western Church until the Late Middle Ages, although churches and monasteries were named after him by the 7th century. His most famous legend tells that he carried a child, who was unknown to him, across a river before the child revealed himself as Christ. Therefore, he is the patron saint of travelers, and small images of him are often worn around the neck, on a bracelet, carried in a pocket, or placed in vehicles by Christians.  Legend  Legends about the life and death of Saint Christopher first appeared in Greece in the 6th century and had spread to France by the 9th century. The 11th-century bishop and poet Walter of Speyer gave one version, but the most popular variations originated from the 13th-century Golden Legend. According to the legendary account of his life Christopher was initially called Reprobus. He was a Canaanite, 5 cubits () tall and with a fearsome face. While serving the king of Canaan, he took it into his head to go and serve \\"the greatest king there was\\". He went to the king who was reputed to be the greatest, but one day he saw the king cross himself at the mention of the devil. On thus learning that the king feared the devil, he departed to look for the devil. He came across a band of marauders, one of whom declared himself to be the devil, so Christopher decided to serve him. But when he saw his new master avoid a wayside cross and found out that the devil feared Christ, he left him and enquired from people where to find Christ. He met a hermit who instructed him in the Christian faith. Christopher asked him how he could serve Christ. When the hermit suggested fasting and prayer, Christopher replied that he was unable to perform that service. The hermit then suggested that because of his size and strength Christopher could serve Christ by assisting people to cross a dangerous river, where they were perishing in the attempt. The hermit promised that this service would be pleasing to Christ. After Christopher had performed this service for some time, a little child asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, he said to the child: \\"You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were.\\" The child replied: \\"You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work.\\" The child then vanished.\\"St. Christopher\\", Lives of Saints, John J. Crawley & Co., Inc. Christopher later visited Lycia and there comforted the Christians who were being martyred. Brought before the local king, he refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods. The king tried to win him by riches and by sending two beautiful women to tempt him. Christopher converted the women to Christianity, as he had already converted thousands in the city. The king ordered him to be killed. Various attempts failed, but finally Christopher was beheaded. Veneration and patronage =Eastern Orthodox liturgy= The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Christopher of Lycea with a Feast Day on May 9. The liturgical reading and hymns refer to his imprisonment by Decius who tempts Christopher with harlots before ordering his beheading. The Kontakion in the Fourth Tone (hymn) reads: > Thou who wast terrifying both in strength and in countenance, for thy > Creator's sake thou didst surrender thyself willingly to them that sought > thee; for thou didst persuade both them and the women that sought to arouse > in thee the fire of lust, and they followed thee in the path of martyrdom. > And in torments thou didst prove to be courageous. Wherefore, we have gained > thee as our great protector, O great Christopher. =Roman Catholic liturgy= The Roman Martyrology remembers him on 25 July.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) The Tridentine Calendar commemorated him on the same day only in private Masses. By 1954 his commemoration had been extended to all Masses, but it was dropped in 1970 as part of the general reorganization of the calendar of the Roman rite as mandated by the motu proprio, Mysterii Paschalis. His commemoration was described to be not of Roman tradition, in view of the relatively late date (about 1550) and limited manner in which it was accepted into the Roman calendar,Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 131 but his feast continues to be observed locally. =Relics= The Museum of Sacred Art at Saint Justine's Church (Sveta Justina) in Rab, Croatia claims a gold- plated reliquary holds the skull of St. Christopher. According to church tradition, a bishop showed the relics from the city wall in 1075 in order to end a siege of the city by an Italo-Norman army.Portal Grada Raba: Povijest 14. ZA≈†TITNIK RABA SV.

A bronze St. Christopher medallion =Medals= Devotional medals with St. Christopher‚Äòs name and image are commonly worn as pendants, especially by travelers, to show devotion and as a request for his blessing. Miniature statues are frequently displayed in automobiles. In French a widespread phrase for such medals is \\"Regarde St Christophe et va-t-en rassur√©\\" (\\"Look at St Christopher and go on reassured\\", sometimes translated as \\"Behold St Christopher and go your way in safety\\"); Saint Christopher medals and holy cards in Spanish have the phrase \\"Si en San Crist√≥bal conf√≠as, de accidente no morir√°s\\" (\\"If you trust St. Christopher, you won't die in an accident\\"). =General patronage= St. Christopher is a widely popular saint, especially revered by athletes, mariners, ferrymen, and travelers.Mershman, F. (1908). St. Christopher. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved September 16, 2008 He is revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.

He is usually depicted as a giant of a man, with a child on his shoulder and a staff in one hand. In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the British Archaeological Association, reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary. In Eastern Orthodox iconography (and sometimes in the Western), Saint Christopher is sometimes represented with the head of a dog. The background to the dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, when a man named Reprebus, Rebrebus or Reprobus was captured in combat against tribes dwelling to the west of Egypt in Cyrenaica. To the unit of soldiers, according to the hagiographic narrative, was assigned the name numerus Marmaritarum or \\"Unit of the Marmaritae\\", which suggests an otherwise- unidentified \\"Marmaritae\\" (perhaps the same as the Marmaricae Berber tribe of Cyrenaica). He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a characteristic of the Marmaritae. This Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed possibly resulted from their misinterpretation of the Latin term Cananeus (Canaanite) to read canineus (canine). According to the medieval Irish Passion of St. Christopher, \\"This Christopher was one of the Dog-heads, a race that had the heads of dogs and ate human flesh.\\" It was commonly accepted at the time that there were several types of races, the Cynocephalus, or dog headed people, being one of many believed to populate the world. The German bishop and poet Walter of Speyer portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an athlete of God, one of the soldier- saints.Walter of Speyer, Vita et passio sancti Christopher martyris, 75.

He was one of three candidates who sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Massachusetts in the 2006 election. Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick won the party's nomination and the general election, defeating Reilly and businessman Chris Gabrieli. Early life Reilly, a native of Springfield, Massachusetts, described himself as a \\"misguided youth\\" the year his father, Mortimer \\"Murty\\" Reilly, was found dead at home from a heart attack when Reilly was 16. Reilly was arrested for public drunkenness when he was 20.Attorney General discloses 1962 arrest for drunkenness.

It is located some 130 miles north of Baghdad, on the main road to Mosul. It is a major industrial centre best known for its oil refinery, the biggest in Iraq, and has a large power plant. With regards to transport in the area, Baiji is a junction of the national railway network.  History  After the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, dozens of British civilians taken captive in Kuwait were held at the Baiji oil refinery, apparently as human shields. The city was bombed during the 1991 Gulf War and about 80% of the oil refinery was destroyed. It was quickly rebuilt and was back in action only a couple of months after the war's end. However, a lack of maintenance and spare parts resulting from the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq caused the deterioration of the city's oil refinery, which by the late 1990s was in a very poor condition and was seriously polluting the surrounding area. = Iraq War (2003‚Äì2008) = Baiji was captured with little or no fighting during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was briefly thought in late April 2003 that barrels of chemicals found in a storage area near the town contained the nerve agent cyclosarin. Soon afterwards, United States troops discovered an underground oil refinery at Baiji which was initially suspected to be a chemical weapons plant. Both leads eventually proved to be false alarms in the search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Following the invasion, Baiji subsequently became the scene of a number of insurgent attacks. The town is at one end of the \\"Sunni Triangle\\" region which provided the bedrock of Saddam Hussein's support. The sprawling oil refinery and pipelines have been particularly difficult to protect against guerrillas. There have been repeated attacks on the oil pipelines and other elements of the oil infrastructure. In October 2003, violent riots broke out in the town in protest against the US-backed police force, which was accused of corruption. US troops restored order, wounding four Iraqis in the process, and sacked the town's police chief, replacing him with a local man elected by tribal elders. A US soldier was killed in the town on October 12. US troops subsequently conducted a number of raids in the town to root out guerrillas, who were publicly supported by some of Baiji's clergy. It was also thought that Saddam Hussein might be hiding in Baiji, prompting raids to find him, before he was eventually captured in December 2003 in the nearby village of ad-Dawr. In May 2007, a Joint Security Station (JSS) was established in Baiji named \\"JSS Arvanitis-Sigua\\" after two US Paratroopers who lost their lives in combat in Bayji.Bayji a safer place with new station. In April 2009, the Joint Coordination Center (JCC) opened within the JSS. The function of the JCC is to enable the coordination of Iraqi municipal agencies thereby building the Government's capacity to provide essential services to the approximately 250,000 residents of the greater Baiji area. = 2014 ISIS offensive = On 11 June 2014, ISIL insurgents advanced into Baiji, seizing the main court house and police station and setting them on fire. The militants, who were travelling in a group of around 60 vehicles, also took control of the Baiji prison and freed all the inmates within. Local residents told members of the media that ISIS sent a group of local tribal chiefs ahead of them to convince the 250 guards at the oil plant to withdraw, while soldiers and police had been warned to leave as well. Later in the day, militants reportedly retreated from Baiji either due to persuasion from local tribal leaders or due to reinforcements from the Iraqi Army's Fourth Armored Division arriving in the city. However, the next day it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of the town, except the refinery which was surrounded. On 18 June, ISIL attacked the refinery with mortars and machine guns. An official from inside the refinery stated the militants had captured 75 percent of the facility, while a military spokesman claimed the attack had been repelled with 40 insurgents being killed. On 19 June, Iraqi government forces claimed to have regained full control of the Baiji oil refinery, after heavy fighting with that left 100 militants dead. An Iraqi witness who drove past the Baiji refinery told the Associated Press that ISIL had hung their banners from the watch towers and created checkpoints surrounding the facility, despite government claims of control. On 20 June, the town was still under complete control of the militants while the oil refinery was surrounded by ISIL forces and had once again come under attack. = 2014 Army counteroffensive = On 7 November 2014, Iraqi forces retook control of most of the strategic city Baiji from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. So now government troops hold more than 70 percent of the city‚Äîincluding neighborhoods in the south, east and north‚Äîand are battling to capture the rest. On 14 November 2014, Iraqi officials say their forces have driven out ISIL fighters from the oil refinery town of Baiji, 200km (130 miles) north of Baghdad. Gen Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi told Iraqi state TV that the town \\"had been completely liberated\\". There were still reports of heavy fighting around the oil refinery, which is Iraq's largest.

The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an open set is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the rings of continuous or smooth real-valued functions defined on each open set. Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of sets or sheaves of rings, depending on the type of data assigned to open sets. There are also maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a specific type, such as sheaves of abelian groups) with their morphisms on a fixed topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each continuous map there is associated both a direct image functor, taking sheaves and their morphisms on the domain to sheaves and morphisms on the codomain, and an inverse image functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory. Due to their general nature and versatility, sheaves have several applications in topology and especially in algebraic and differential geometry. First, geometric structures such as that of a differentiable manifold or a scheme can be expressed in terms of a sheaf of rings on the space. In such contexts several geometric constructions such as vector bundles or divisors are naturally specified in terms of sheaves. Second, sheaves provide the framework for a very general cohomology theory, which encompasses also the \\"usual\\" topological cohomology theories such as singular cohomology. Especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, sheaf cohomology provides a powerful link between topological and geometric properties of spaces. Sheaves also provide the basis for the theory of D-modules, which provide applications to the theory of differential equations. In addition, generalisations of sheaves to more general settings than topological spaces, such as Grothendieck topology, have provided applications to mathematical logic and number theory.  Definitions and examples  In many mathematical branches, several structures defined on a topological space X (e.g., a differentiable manifold) can be naturally localised or restricted to open subsets U \\\\subset X: typical examples include continuous real-valued or complex-valued functions, n times differentiable (real-valued or complex- valued) functions, bounded real-valued functions, vector fields, and sections of any vector bundle on the space. The ability to restrict data to smaller open subsets gives rise to the concept of presheaves. Roughly speaking, sheaves are then those presheaves, where local data can be glued to global data. = Presheaves = Let X be a topological space. A presheaf of sets F on X consists of the following data: *For each open set U of X, a set F(U). This set is sometimes also denoted \\\\Gamma(U, F). The elements in this set are called the sections of F over U. *For each inclusion of open sets V \\\\subseteq U, a function \\\\operatorname{res}_{V, U} \\\\colon F(U) \\\\rightarrow F(V). In view of many of the examples below, the morphisms \\\\text{res}_{V,U} are called restriction morphisms. If s \\\\in F(U), then its restriction \\\\text{res}_{V,U}(s) is often denoted s_V by analogy with restriction of functions. The restriction morphisms are required to satisfy two additional (functorial) properties: *For every open set U of X, the restriction morphism \\\\operatorname{res}_{U, U} \\\\colon F(U) \\\\rightarrow F(U) is the identity morphism on F(U). *If we have three open sets W \\\\subseteq V \\\\subseteq U, then the composite \\\\text{res}_{W,V}\\\\circ\\\\text{res}_{V,U}=\\\\text{res}_{W,U} Informally, the second axiom says it doesn't matter whether we restrict to W in one step or restrict first to V, then to W. A concise functorial reformulation of this definition is given further below. Many examples of presheaves come from different classes of functions: to any U, one can assign the set C^0(U) of continuous real-valued functions on U. The restriction maps are then just given by restricting a continuous function on U to a smaller open subset V, which again is a continuous function. The two presheaf axioms are immediately checked, thereby giving an example of a presheaf. This can be extended to a sheaf of holomorphic functions \\\\mathcal{H}(-) and a sheaf of smooth functions C^\\\\infty(-). Another common class of examples is assigning to U the set of constant real-valued functions on U. This presheaf is called the constant presheaf associated to \\\\mathbb{R} and is denoted \\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{R}}^{psh}. = Sheaves = Given a presheaf, a natural question to ask is to what extent its sections over an open set U are specified by their restrictions to smaller open sets \\\\mathcal{U} = \\\\\\\\{U_i\\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in I} of an open cover of U. A sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the following two additional axioms: # (Locality) If \\\\mathcal{U} is an open covering of an open set U, and if s,t \\\\in F(U) have the property s_{U_i} = t_{U_i} for each set U_i of the covering, then s = t; and # (Gluing) If \\\\mathcal{U} is an open covering of an open set U, and if for each i \\\\in I a section s_i \\\\in F(U_i) is given such that for each pair U_i,U_j of the covering sets the restrictions of s_i and s_j agree on the overlaps, so s_i_{U_i\\\\cap U_j} = s_j_{U_i \\\\cap U_j}, then there is a section s \\\\in F(U) such that s_{U_i} = s_i for each i \\\\in I. The section s whose existence is guaranteed by axiom 2 is called the gluing, concatenation, or collation of the sections si. By axiom 1 it is unique. Sections s_i satisfying the condition of axiom 2 are often called compatible; thus axioms 1 and 2 together state that compatible sections can be uniquely glued together. A separated presheaf, or monopresheaf, is a presheaf satisfying axiom 1. The presheaf consisting of continuous functions mentioned above is a sheaf. This assertion reduces to checking that, given continuous functions f_i : U_i \\\\to \\\\mathbf R which agree on the intersections U_i \\\\cap U_j, there is a unique continuous function f: U \\\\to \\\\mathbf R whose restriction equals the f_i. By contrast, the constant presheaf is usually not a sheaf: if U=U_1 \\\\sqcup U_2 is a disjoint union of two open subsets, and f_1, f_2 take different values, then there is no constant function on U whose restriction would equal these two (different) constant functions. Presheaves and sheaves are typically denoted by capital letters, F being particularly common, presumably for the French word for sheaf, faisceau. Use of calligraphic letters such as \\\\mathcal{F} is also common. It can be shown that to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a basis for the topology of the underlying space. Moreover, it can also be shown that it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms above relative to the open sets of a covering. This observation is used to construct another example which is crucial in algebraic geometry, namely quasi-coherent sheaves. Here the topological space in question is the spectrum of a commutative ring R, whose points are the prime ideals p in R. The open sets D_f := \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\subset R, f otin p\\\\\\\\} form a basis for the Zariski topology on this space. Given an R-module M, there is a sheaf, denoted by \\\\tilde M on the Spec R, that satisfies :\\\\tilde M(D_f) := M[1/f], the localization of M at f. = Further examples =  Sheaf of sections of a continuous map  Any continuous map f:X\\\\to Y of topological spaces determines a sheaf \\\\Gamma(Y/X) on X by setting :\\\\Gamma(Y/X)(U) = \\\\\\\\{s: U \\\\to Y, f \\\\circ s = \\\\operatorname{id}_U\\\\\\\\}. Any such s is commonly called a section of s, and this example is the reason why the elements in F(U) are generally called sections. This construction is especially important when f is the projection of a fiber bundle onto its base space. For example, the sheaves of smooth functions are the sections of the trivial bundle. Another example: the sheaf of sections of :\\\\mathbf C \\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\stackrel{\\\\exp} \\\\to \\\\mathbf C is the sheaf which assigns to any U the set of branches of the complex logarithm on U. Given a point x and an abelian group S, the skyscraper sheaf Sx defined as follows: If U is an open set containing x, then Sx(U) = S. If U does not contain x, then Sx(U) = 0, the trivial group. The restriction maps are either the identity on S, if both open sets contain x, or the zero map otherwise.  Sheaves on manifolds  On an n-dimensional Ck-manifold M, there is a number of important sheaves, such as the sheaf of j-times continuously differentiable functions \\\\mathcal{O}^j_M (with j ‚â§ k). Its sections on some open U are the Cj-functions U ‚Üí R. For j = k, this sheaf is called the structure sheaf and is denoted \\\\mathcal{O}_M. The nonzero Ck functions also form a sheaf, denoted \\\\mathcal{O}_X^\\\\times. Differential forms (of degree p) also form a sheaf Œ©pM. In all these examples, the restriction morphisms are given by restricting functions or forms. The assignment sending U to the compactly supported functions on U is not a sheaf, since there is in general no way to preserve this property by passing to a smaller open subset. Instead, this forms a cosheaf, a dual concept where the restriction maps go in the opposite direction than with sheaves. However, taking the dual of these vector spaces does give a sheaf, the sheaf of distributions.  Presheaves that are not sheaves  In addition to the constant presheaf mentioned above, which is usually not a sheaf, there are further examples of presheaves that are not sheaves: * Let X be the two-point topological space \\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\} with the discrete topology. Define a presheaf F as follows: F(‚àÖ) = {‚àÖ}, F({x}) = R, F({y}) = R, F({x, y}) = R √ó R √ó R. The restriction map F({x, y}) ‚Üí F({x}) is the projection of R √ó R √ó R onto its first coordinate, and the restriction map F({x, y}) ‚Üí F({y}) is the projection of R √ó R √ó R onto its second coordinate. F is a presheaf that is not separated: A global section is determined by three numbers, but the values of that section over {x} and {y} determine only two of those numbers. So while we can glue any two sections over {x} and {y}, we cannot glue them uniquely. * Let X = \\\\mathbb{R} be the real line, and let F(U) be the set of bounded continuous functions on U. This is not a sheaf because it is not always possible to glue. For example, let Ui be the set of all x such that x < i. The identity function f(x) = x is bounded on each Ui. Consequently we get a section si on Ui. However, these sections do not glue, because the function f is not bounded on the real line. Consequently F is a presheaf, but not a sheaf. In fact, F is separated because it is a sub-presheaf of the sheaf of continuous functions. = Motivating sheaves from complex analytic spaces and algebraic geometry = One of the historical motivations for sheaves have come from studying complex manifolds, complex analytic geometry, and scheme theory from algebraic geometry. This is because in all of the previous cases, we consider a topological space X together with a structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O} giving it the structure of a complex manifold, complex analytic space, or scheme. This perspective of equipping a topological space with a sheaf is essential to the theory of locally ringed spaces (see below).  Technical challenges with complex manifolds  One of the main historical motivations for introducing sheaves was constructing a device which keeps track of holomorphic functions on complex manifolds. For example, on a compact complex manifold X (like complex projective space or the vanishing locus of a homogeneous polynomial), the only holomorphic functions > f:X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} are the constants functions. This means there could exist two compact complex manifolds X,X' which are not isomorphic, but nevertheless their ring of global holomorphic functions, denoted \\\\mathcal{H}(X), \\\\mathcal{H}(X'), are isomorphic. Contrast this with smooth manifolds where every manifold M can be embedded inside some \\\\mathbb{R}^N, hence it's ring of smooth functions C^\\\\infty(M) comes from restricting the smooth functions from C^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^N). Another complexity when considering the ring of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold X is given a small enough open set U \\\\subset X, the holomorphic functions will be isomorphic to \\\\mathcal{H}(U) \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\mathbb{C}^n). Sheaves are a direct tool for dealing with this complexity since they make it possible to keep track of the holomorphic structure on the underlying topological space of X on arbitrary open subsets U \\\\subset X. This means as U becomes more complex topologically, the ring \\\\mathcal{H}(U) can be expressed from gluing the \\\\mathcal{H}(U_i). Note that sometimes this sheaf is denoted \\\\mathcal{O}(-) or just \\\\mathcal{O}, or even \\\\mathcal{O}_X when we want to emphasize the space the structure sheaf is associated to.  Tracking submanifolds with sheaves  Another common example of sheaves can be constructed by considering a complex submanifold Y \\\\hookrightarrow X. There is an associated sheaf \\\\mathcal{O}_Y which takes an open subset U \\\\subset X and gives the ring of holomorphic functions on U \\\\cap Y. This kind of formalism was found to be extremely powerful and motivates a lot of homological algebra such as sheaf cohomology since an intersection theory can be built using these kinds of sheaves from the Serre intersection formula.  Operations with sheaves  = Morphisms = Morphisms of sheaves are, roughly speaking, analogous to functions between them. In contrast to a function between sets, which have no additional structure, morphisms of sheaves are those functions which preserve the structure inherent in the sheaves. This idea is made precise in the following definition. Let F and G be two sheaves on X. A morphism \\\\varphi:G\\\\to F consists of a morphism \\\\varphi_U:G(U)\\\\to F(U) for each open set of , subject to the condition that this morphism is compatible with restrictions. In other words, for every open subset V of an open set U, the following diagram is commutative. :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} G(U) & \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\quad\\\\varphi_U\\\\quad} & F(U)\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{V,U}\\\\Biggl\\\\downarrow & & \\\\Biggl\\\\downarrow r_{V,U}\\\\\\\\\\\\ G(V) & \\\\xrightarrow[{\\\\quad\\\\varphi_V\\\\quad}]{} & F(V) \\\\end{array} For example, taking the derivative gives a morphism of sheaves on R: \\\\mathcal O^n_{\\\\mathbf R} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O^{n-1}_{\\\\mathbf R}. Indeed, given an (n-times continuously differentiable) function f : U \\\\to \\\\mathbf R (with U in R open), the restriction (to a smaller open subset V) of its derivative equals the derivative of f_V. With this notion of morphism, sheaves on a fixed topological space X form a category. The general categorical notions of mono-, epi- and isomorphisms can therefore be applied to sheaves. A sheaf morphism \\\\varphi is an isomorphism (resp. monomorphism) if and only if each \\\\varphi_U is a bijection (resp. injective map). Moreover, a morphism of sheaves \\\\varphi is an isomorphism if and only if there exists an open cover \\\\\\\\{U_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} such that \\\\varphi_{U_\\\\alpha} are isomorphisms of sheaves for all \\\\alpha. This statement, which also holds for monomorphisms, but does not hold for presheaves, is another instance of the idea that sheaves are of a local nature. The corresponding statements do not hold for epimorphisms (of sheaves), and their failure is measured by sheaf cohomology. = Stalks of a sheaf = The stalk \\\\mathcal{F}_x of a sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} captures the properties of a sheaf \\"around\\" a point x ‚àà X, generalizing the germs of functions. Here, \\"around\\" means that, conceptually speaking, one looks at smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the point. Of course, no single neighborhood will be small enough, which requires considering a limit of some sort. More precisely, the stalk is defined by :\\\\mathcal{F}_x = \\\\varinjlim_{U i x} \\\\mathcal{F}(U), the direct limit being over all open subsets of X containing the given point x. In other words, an element of the stalk is given by a section over some open neighborhood of x, and two such sections are considered equivalent if their restrictions agree on a smaller neighborhood. The natural morphism F(U) ‚Üí Fx takes a section s in F(U) to its germ at x. This generalises the usual definition of a germ. In many situations, knowing the stalks of a sheaf is enough to control the sheaf itself. For example, whether or not a morphism of sheaves is a monomorphism, epimorphism, or isomorphism can be tested on the stalks. In this sense, a sheaf is determined by its stalks, which are a local data. By contrast, the global information present in a sheaf, i.e., the global sections, i.e., the sections \\\\mathcal F(X) on the whole space X, typically carry less information. For example, for a compact complex manifold X, the global sections of the sheaf of holomorphic functions are just C, since any holomorphic function :X \\\\to \\\\mathbf C is constant by Liouville's theorem.. = Turning a presheaf into a sheaf = It is frequently useful to take the data contained in a presheaf and to express it as a sheaf. It turns out that there is a best possible way to do this. It takes a presheaf F and produces a new sheaf aF called the sheafification or sheaf associated to the presheaf F. For example, the sheafification of the constant presheaf (see above) is called the constant sheaf. Despite its name, its sections are locally constant functions. The sheaf aF can be constructed using the √©tal√© space of F, namely as the sheaf of sections of the map :\\\\mathrm{Spe}(F) \\\\to X. Another construction of the sheaf aF proceeds by means of a functor L from presheaves to presheaves that gradually improves the properties of a presheaf: for any presheaf F, LF is a separated presheaf, and for any separated presheaf F, LF is a sheaf. The associated sheaf aF is given by LLF.SGA 4 II 3.0.5 The idea that the sheaf aF is the best possible approximation to F by a sheaf is made precise using the following universal property: there is a natural morphism of presheaves i\\\\colon F\\\\to aF so that for any sheaf G and any morphism of presheaves f\\\\colon F\\\\to G, there is a unique morphism of sheaves \\\\tilde f \\\\colon aF \\\\rightarrow G such that f = \\\\tilde f i. In fact a is the left adjoint functor to the inclusion functor (or forgetful functor) from the category of sheaves to the category of presheaves, and i is the unit of the adjunction. In this way, the category of sheaves turns into a Giraud subcategory of presheaves. This categorical situation is the reason why the sheafification functor appears in constructing cokernels of sheaf morphisms or tensor products of sheaves, but not for kernels, say. = Subsheaves, quotient sheaves = If K is a subsheaf of a sheaf F of abelian groups, then the quotient sheaf Q is the sheaf associated to the presheaf U \\\\mapsto F(U)/K(U); in other words, the quotient sheaf fits into an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups; :0 \\\\to K \\\\to F \\\\to Q \\\\to 0. (this is also called a sheaf extension.) Let F, G be sheaves of abelian groups. The set U \\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Hom}(F, G) of morphisms of sheaves from F to G forms an abelian group (by the abelian group structure of G). The sheaf hom of F and G, denoted by, :\\\\mathcal{Hom}(F, G) is the sheaf of abelian groups U \\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Hom}(F_U, G_U) where F_U is the sheaf on U given by (F_U)(V) = F(V) (Note sheafification is not needed here). The direct sum of F and G is the sheaf given by U \\\\mapsto F(U) \\\\oplus G(U) , and the tensor product of F and G is the sheaf associated to the presheaf U \\\\mapsto F(U) \\\\otimes G(U). All of these operations extend to sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings A; the above is the special case when A is the constant sheaf \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{Z}}. = Basic functoriality = Since the data of a (pre-)sheaf depends on the open subsets of the base space, sheaves on different topological spaces are unrelated to each other in the sense that there are no morphisms between them. However, given a continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y between two topological spaces, pushforward and pullback relate sheaves on X to those on Y and vice versa. Direct image The pushforward (also known as direct image) of a sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} on X is the sheaf defined by :(f_* \\\\mathcal F)(V) = \\\\mathcal F(f^{-1}(V)). Here V is an open subset of Y, so that its preimage is open in X by the continuity of f. This construction recovers the skyscraper sheaf S_x mentioned above: :S_x = i_* (S) where i: \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} \\\\to X is the inclusion, and S is regarded as a sheaf on the singleton (by S(\\\\\\\\{*\\\\\\\\})=S, S(\\\\emptyset) = \\\\emptyset. For a map between locally compact spaces, the direct image with compact support is a subsheaf of the direct image. By definition, (f_! \\\\mathcal F)(V) consists of those f \\\\in \\\\mathcal F(f^{-1}(V)) whose support is proper map over V. If f is proper itself, then f_! \\\\mathcal F = f_* \\\\mathcal F, but in general they disagree. Inverse image The pullback or inverse image goes the other way: it produces a sheaf on X, denoted f^{-1} \\\\mathcal G out of a sheaf \\\\mathcal G on Y. If f is the inclusion of an open subset, then the inverse image is just a restriction, i.e., it is given by (f^{-1} \\\\mathcal G)(U) = \\\\mathcal G(U) for an open U in X. A sheaf F (on some space X) is called locally constant if X= \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in I} U_i by some open subsets U_i such that the restriction of F to all these open subsets is constant. One a wide range of topological spaces X, such sheaves are equivalent to representations of the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X). For general maps f, the definition of f^{-1} \\\\mathcal G is more involved; it is detailed at inverse image functor. The stalk is an essential special case of the pullback in view of a natural identification, where i is as above: :\\\\mathcal G_x = i^{-1}\\\\mathcal{G}(\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}). More generally, stalks satisfy (f^{-1} \\\\mathcal G)_x = \\\\mathcal G_{f(x)}. Extension by zero For the inclusion j : U \\\\to X of an open subset, the extension by zero of a sheaf of abelian groups on U is defined as :(j_! \\\\mathcal F)(V) = \\\\mathcal F(V) if V \\\\subset U and (j_! \\\\mathcal F)(V) = 0 otherwise. For a sheaf \\\\mathcal G on X, this construction is in a sense complementary to i_*, where i is the inclusion of the complement of U: :(j_! j^* \\\\mathcal G)_x = \\\\mathcal G_x for x in U, and the stalk is zero otherwise, while :(i_* i^* \\\\mathcal G)_x = 0 for x in U, and equals \\\\mathcal G_x otherwise. These functors are therefore useful in reducing sheaf-theoretic questions on X to ones on the strata of a stratification, i.e., a decomposition of X into smaller, locally closed subsets.  Complements  =Sheaves in more general categories= In addition to (pre-)sheaves as introduced above, where \\\\mathcal F(U) is merely a set, it is in many cases important to keep track of additional structure on these sections. For example, the sections of the sheaf of continuous functions naturally form a real vector space, and restriction is a linear map between these vector spaces. Presheaves with values in an arbitrary category C are defined by first considering the category of open sets on X to be the posetal category O(X) whose objects are the open sets of X and whose morphisms are inclusions. Then a C-valued presheaf on X is the same as a contravariant functor from O(X) to C. Morphisms in this category of functors, also known as natural transformations, are the same as the morphisms defined above, as can be seen by unraveling the definitions. If the target category C admits all limits, a C-valued presheaf is a sheaf if the following diagram is an equalizer: :F(U) \\\\rightarrow \\\\prod_{i} F(U_i) \\\\prod_{i, j} F(U_i \\\\cap U_j). Here the first map is the product of the restriction maps :\\\\operatorname{res}_{U_i, U} \\\\colon F(U) \\\\rightarrow F(U_i) and the pair of arrows the products of the two sets of restrictions :\\\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\\\cap U_j, U_i} \\\\colon F(U_i) \\\\rightarrow F(U_i \\\\cap U_j) and :\\\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\\\cap U_j, U_j} \\\\colon F(U_j) \\\\rightarrow F(U_i \\\\cap U_j). If C is an abelian category, this condition can also be rephrased by requiring that there is an exact sequence :0 \\\\to F(U) \\\\to \\\\prod_i F(U_i) \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\\\cap U_j, U_i} - \\\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\\\cap U_j, U_j}} \\\\prod_{i,j} F(U_i \\\\cap U_j). A particular case of this sheaf condition occurs for U being the empty set, and the index set I also being empty. In this case, the sheaf condition requires \\\\mathcal F(\\\\emptyset) to be the terminal object in C. = Ringed spaces and sheaves of modules = In several geometrical disciplines, including algebraic geometry and differential geometry, the spaces come along with a natural sheaf of rings, often called the structure sheaf and denoted by \\\\mathcal{O}_X). Such a pair (X, \\\\mathcal O_X) is called a ringed space. Many types of spaces can be defined as certain types of ringed spaces. Commonly, all the stalks \\\\mathcal O_{X, x} of the structure sheaf are local rings, in which case the pair is called a locally ringed space. For example, an n-dimensional Ck manifold M is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf consists of C^k-functions on the open subsets of M. The property of being a locally ringed space translates into the fact that such a function, which is nonzero at a point x, is also non-zero on a sufficiently small open neighborhood of x. Some authors actually define real (or complex) manifolds to be locally ringed spaces that are locally isomorphic to the pair consisting of an open subset of \\\\mathbf R^n (resp. \\\\mathbf C^n) together with the sheaf of Ck (resp. holomorphic) functions.. Similarly, Schemes, the foundational notion of spaces in algebraic geometry, are locally ringed spaces that are locally isomorphic to the spectrum of a ring. Given a ringed space, a sheaf of modules is a sheaf \\\\mathcal{M} such that on every open set U of X, \\\\mathcal{M}(U) is an \\\\mathcal{O}_X(U)-module and for every inclusion of open sets V ‚äÜ U, the restriction map \\\\mathcal{M}(U) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{M}(V) is compatible with the restriction map O(U) ‚Üí O(V): the restriction of fs is the restriction of f times that of s for any f in O(U) and s in F(U). Most important geometric objects are sheaves of modules. For example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vector bundles and locally free sheaves of \\\\mathcal{O}_X-modules. This paradigm applies to real vector bundles, complex vector bundles, or vector bundles in algebraic geometry (where \\\\mathcal O consists of smooth functions, holomorphic functions, or regular functions, respectively). Sheaves of solutions to differential equations are D-modules, that is, modules over the sheaf of differential operators. On any topological space, modules over the constant sheaf \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{Z}} are the same as sheaves of abelian groups in the sense above. There is a different inverse image functor for sheaves of modules over sheaves of rings. This functor is usually denoted f^* and it is distinct from f^{-1}. See inverse image functor.  Finiteness conditions for sheaves of modules  The condition that a module is finitely generated or finitely presented can also be formulated for a sheaf of modules. \\\\mathcal{M} is finitely generated if, for every point x of X, there exists an open neighborhood U of x, a natural number n (possibly depending on U), and a surjective morphism of sheaves \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal{M}_U. Similarly, \\\\mathcal{M} is finitely presented if in addition there exists a natural number m (again possibly depending on U) and a morphism of sheaves \\\\mathcal{O}_X^m_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_U such that the sequence of morphisms \\\\mathcal{O}_X^m_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal{M} is exact. Equivalently, the kernel of the morphism \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal{M} is itself a finitely generated sheaf. These, however, are not the only possible finiteness conditions on a sheaf. The most important finiteness condition for a sheaf is coherence. \\\\mathcal{M} is coherent if it is of finite type and if, for every open set U and every morphism of sheaves \\\\phi : \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n \\\\to \\\\mathcal{M} (not necessarily surjective), the kernel of œÜ is of finite type. \\\\mathcal{O}_X is coherent if it is coherent as a module over itself. Note that coherence is a strictly stronger condition than finite presentation: \\\\mathcal{O}_X is always finitely presented as a module over itself, but it is not always coherent. For example, let X be a point, let \\\\mathcal{O}_X be the ring R = C[x1, x2, ...] of complex polynomials in countably many indeterminates. Choose n = 1, and for the morphism œÜ, take the map that sends every variable to zero. The kernel of this map is not finitely generated, so \\\\mathcal{O}_X is not coherent. = The √©tal√© space of a sheaf = In the examples above it was noted that some sheaves occur naturally as sheaves of sections. In fact, all sheaves of sets can be represented as sheaves of sections of a topological space called the √©tal√© space, from the French word √©tal√© , meaning roughly \\"spread out\\". If F \\\\in \\\\text{Sh}(X) is a sheaf over X, then the √©tal√© space of F is a topological space E together with a local homeomorphism \\\\pi: E \\\\to X such that the sheaf of sections \\\\Gamma(\\\\pi, -) of \\\\pi is F. The space E is usually very strange, and even if the sheaf F arises from a natural topological situation, E may not have any clear topological interpretation. For example, if F is the sheaf of sections of a continuous function f: Y \\\\to X, then E=Y if and only if f is a local homeomorphism. The √©tal√© space E is constructed from the stalks of F over X. As a set, it is their disjoint union and \\\\pi is the obvious map that takes the value x on the stalk of F over x \\\\in X. The topology of E is defined as follows. For each element s \\\\in F(U) and each x \\\\in U, we get a germ of s at x, denoted [s]_x or s_x. These germs determine points of E. For any U and s \\\\in F(U), the union of these points (for all x \\\\in U) is declared to be open in E. Notice that each stalk has the discrete topology as subspace topology. Two morphisms between sheaves determine a continuous map of the corresponding √©tal√© spaces that is compatible with the projection maps (in the sense that every germ is mapped to a germ over the same point). This makes the construction into a functor. The construction above determines an equivalence of categories between the category of sheaves of sets on X and the category of √©tal√© spaces over X. The construction of an √©tal√© space can also be applied to a presheaf, in which case the sheaf of sections of the √©tal√© space recovers the sheaf associated to the given presheaf. This construction makes all sheaves into representable functors on certain categories of topological spaces. As above, let F be a sheaf on X, let E be its √©tal√© space, and let \\\\pi:E \\\\to X be the natural projection. Consider the overcategory \\\\text{Top}/X of topological spaces over X, that is, the category of topological spaces together with fixed continuous maps to X. Every object of this category is a continuous map f:Y\\\\to X, and a morphism from Y\\\\to X to Z\\\\to X is a continuous map Y\\\\to X that commutes with the two maps to X. There is a functor > \\\\Gamma:\\\\text{Top}/X \\\\to \\\\text{Sets} sending an object f:Y\\\\to X to f^{-1} F(Y). For example, if i: U \\\\hookrightarrow X is the inclusion of an open subset, then > \\\\Gamma(i) = f^{-1} F(U) = F(U) = \\\\Gamma(F, U) and for the inclusion of a point i : \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}\\\\hookrightarrow X, then > \\\\Gamma(i) = f^{-1} F(\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}) = F_x is the stalk of F at x. There is a natural isomorphism > (f^{-1}F)(Y) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathbf{Top}/X}(f, \\\\pi), which shows that \\\\pi: E \\\\to X (for the √©tal√© space) represents the functor \\\\Gamma. E is constructed so that the projection map \\\\pi is a covering map. In algebraic geometry, the natural analog of a covering map is called an √©tale morphism. Despite its similarity to \\"√©tal√©\\", the word √©tale has a different meaning in French. It is possible to turn E into a scheme and \\\\pi into a morphism of schemes in such a way that \\\\pi retains the same universal property, but \\\\pi is not in general an √©tale morphism because it is not quasi- finite. It is, however, formally √©tale. The definition of sheaves by √©tal√© spaces is older than the definition given earlier in the article. It is still common in some areas of mathematics such as mathematical analysis.  Sheaf cohomology  In contexts, where the open set U is fixed, and the sheaf is regarded as a variable, the set F(U) is also often denoted \\\\Gamma(U, F). As was noted above, this functor does not preserve epimorphisms. Instead, an epimorphism of sheaves \\\\mathcal F \\\\to \\\\mathcal G is a map with the following property: for any section g \\\\in \\\\mathcal G(U) there is a covering \\\\mathcal{U} = \\\\\\\\{U_i\\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in I} where > U = \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in I} U_i of open subsets, such that the restriction g_{U_i} are in the image of \\\\mathcal F(U_i). However, g itself need not be in the image of \\\\mathcal F(U). A concrete example of this phenomenon is the exponential map :\\\\mathcal O \\\\stackrel{\\\\exp} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O^\\\\times between the sheaf of holomorphic functions and non-zero holomorphic functions. This map is an epimorphism, which amounts to saying that any non-zero holomorphic function g (on some open subset in C, say), admits a complex logarithm locally, i.e., after restricting g to appropriate open subsets. However, g need not have a logarithm globally. Sheaf cohomology captures this phenomenon. More precisely, for an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal F_1 \\\\to \\\\mathcal F_2 \\\\to \\\\mathcal F_3 \\\\to 0, (i.e., an epimorphism \\\\mathcal F_2 \\\\to \\\\mathcal F_3 whose kernel is \\\\mathcal F_1), there is a long exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\Gamma(U, \\\\mathcal F_1) \\\\to \\\\Gamma(U, \\\\mathcal F_2) \\\\to \\\\Gamma(U, \\\\mathcal F_3) \\\\to H^1(U, \\\\mathcal F_1) \\\\to H^1(U, \\\\mathcal F_2) \\\\to H^1(U, \\\\mathcal F_3) \\\\to H^2(U, \\\\mathcal F_1) \\\\to \\\\dots By means of this sequence, the first cohomology group H^1(U, \\\\mathcal F_1) is a measure for the non-surjectivity of the map between sections of \\\\mathcal F_2 and \\\\mathcal F_3. There are several different ways of constructing sheaf cohomology. introduced them by defining sheaf cohomology as the derived functor of \\\\Gamma. This method is theoretically satisfactory, but, being based on injective resolutions, of little use in concrete computations. Godement resolutions are another general, but practically inaccessible approach. Especially in the context of sheaves on manifolds, sheaf cohomology can often be computed using resolutions by soft sheaves, fine sheaves, and flabby sheaves (also known as flasque sheaves from the French flasque meaning flabby). For example, a partition of unity argument shows that the sheaf of smooth functions on a manifold is soft. The higher cohomology groups H^i(U, \\\\mathcal F) for i>0 vanish for soft sheaves, which gives a way of computing cohomology of other sheaves. For example, the de Rham complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{R}} on any smooth manifold, so the sheaf cohomology of \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{R}} is equal to its de Rham cohomology. A different approach is by ƒåech cohomology. ƒåech cohomology was the first cohomology theory developed for sheaves and it is well-suited to concrete calculations. It relates sections on open subsets of the space to cohomology classes on the space. In most cases, ƒåech cohomology computes the same cohomology groups as the derived functor cohomology. However, for some pathological spaces, ƒåech cohomology will give the correct H^1 but incorrect higher cohomology groups. To get around this, Jean-Louis Verdier developed hypercoverings. Hypercoverings not only give the correct higher cohomology groups but also allow the open subsets mentioned above to be replaced by certain morphisms from another space. This flexibility is necessary in some applications, such as the construction of Pierre Deligne's mixed Hodge structures. A much cleaner approach to the computation of some cohomology groups is the Borel‚ÄìBott‚ÄìWeil theorem, which identifies the cohomology groups of some line bundles on flag manifolds with irreducible representations of Lie groups. This theorem can be used, for example, to easily compute the cohomology groups of all line bundles on projective space. In many cases there is a duality theory for sheaves that generalizes Poincar√© duality. See Grothendieck duality and Verdier duality. = Derived categories of sheaves = The derived category of the category of sheaves of, say, abelian groups on some space X, denoted here as D(X), is the conceptual haven for sheaf cohomology, by virtue of the following relation: :H^n(X, \\\\mathcal F) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(X)}(\\\\mathbf Z, \\\\mathcal F[n]). The adjunction between f^{-1}, which is the left adjoint of f_* (already on the level of sheaves of abelian groups) gives rise to an adjunction :f^{-1} : D(Y) \\\\rightleftarrows D(X) : R f_* (for f: X \\\\to Y), where Rf_* is the derived functor. This latter functor encompasses the notion of sheaf cohomology since H^n(X, \\\\mathcal F) = R^n f_* \\\\mathcal F for f: X \\\\to \\\\\\\\{*\\\\\\\\}. Like f_*, the direct image with compact support f_! can also be derived. By virtue of the following isomorphism R f_! F parametrizes the cohomology with compact support of the fibers of f: :(R^i f_! F)_y = H^i_c(f^{-1}(y), F).. This isomorphism is an example of a base change theorem. There is another adjunction :Rf_! : D(X) \\\\rightleftarrows D(Y) : f^!. Unlike all the functors considered above, the twisted (or exceptional) inverse image functor f^! is in general only defined on the level of derived categories, i.e., the functor is not obtained as the derived functor of some functor between abelian categories. If f: X \\\\to \\\\\\\\{*\\\\\\\\} and X is a smooth orientable manifold of dimension n, then :f^! \\\\underline \\\\mathbf R \\\\cong \\\\underline \\\\mathbf R [n]. This computation, and the compatibility of the functors with duality (see Verdier duality) can be used to obtain a high-brow explanation of Poincar√© duality. In the context of quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes, there is a similar duality known as coherent duality. Perverse sheaves are certain objects in D(X), i.e., complexes of sheaves (but not in general sheaves proper). They are an important tool to study the geometry of singularities.  Derived categories of coherent sheaves and the Grothendieck group  Another important application of derived categories of sheaves is with the derived category of coherent sheaves on a scheme X denoted D_{Coh}(X). This was used by Grothendieck in his development of intersection theory using derived categories and K-theory, that the intersection product of subschemes Y_1, Y_2 is represented in K-theory as > [Y_1]\\\\cdot[Y_2] = > [\\\\mathcal{O}_{Y_1}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal{O}_X}^{\\\\mathbf{L}}\\\\mathcal{O}_{Y_2}] \\\\in > K(\\\\text{Coh(X)}) where \\\\mathcal{O}_{Y_i} are coherent sheaves defined by the \\\\mathcal{O}_X- modules given by their structure sheaves.  Sites and topoi  Andr√© Weil's Weil conjectures stated that there was a cohomology theory for algebraic varieties over finite fields that would give an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. The cohomology of a complex manifold can be defined as the sheaf cohomology of the locally constant sheaf \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{C}} in the Euclidean topology, which suggests defining a Weil cohomology theory in positive characteristic as the sheaf cohomology of a constant sheaf. But the only classical topology on such a variety is the Zariski topology, and the Zariski topology has very few open sets, so few that the cohomology of any Zariski-constant sheaf on an irreducible variety vanishes (except in degree zero). Alexandre Grothendieck solved this problem by introducing Grothendieck topologies, which axiomatize the notion of covering. Grothendieck's insight was that the definition of a sheaf depends only on the open sets of a topological space, not on the individual points. Once he had axiomatized the notion of covering, open sets could be replaced by other objects. A presheaf takes each one of these objects to data, just as before, and a sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the gluing axiom with respect to our new notion of covering. This allowed Grothendieck to define √©tale cohomology and ‚Ñì-adic cohomology, which eventually were used to prove the Weil conjectures. A category with a Grothendieck topology is called a site. A category of sheaves on a site is called a topos or a Grothendieck topos. The notion of a topos was later abstracted by William Lawvere and Miles Tierney to define an elementary topos, which has connections to mathematical logic.  History  The first origins of sheaf theory are hard to pin down ‚Äì they may be co-extensive with the idea of analytic continuation. It took about 15 years for a recognisable, free-standing theory of sheaves to emerge from the foundational work on cohomology. * 1936 Eduard ƒåech introduces the nerve construction, for associating a simplicial complex to an open covering. * 1938 Hassler Whitney gives a 'modern' definition of cohomology, summarizing the work since J. W. Alexander and Kolmogorov first defined cochains. * 1943 Norman Steenrod publishes on homology with local coefficients. * 1945 Jean Leray publishes work carried out as a prisoner of war, motivated by proving fixed-point theorems for application to PDE theory; it is the start of sheaf theory and spectral sequences. * 1947 Henri Cartan reproves the de Rham theorem by sheaf methods, in correspondence with Andr√© Weil (see De Rham‚ÄìWeil theorem). Leray gives a sheaf definition in his courses via closed sets (the later carapaces). * 1948 The Cartan seminar writes up sheaf theory for the first time. * 1950 The \\"second edition\\" sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar: the sheaf space (espace √©tal√©) definition is used, with stalkwise structure. Supports are introduced, and cohomology with supports. Continuous mappings give rise to spectral sequences. At the same time Kiyoshi Oka introduces an idea (adjacent to that) of a sheaf of ideals, in several complex variables. * 1951 The Cartan seminar proves theorems A and B, based on Oka's work. * 1953 The finiteness theorem for coherent sheaves in the analytic theory is proved by Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, as is Serre duality. * 1954 Serre's paper Faisceaux alg√©briques coh√©rents (published in 1955) introduces sheaves into algebraic geometry. These ideas are immediately exploited by Friedrich Hirzebruch, who writes a major 1956 book on topological methods. * 1955 Alexander Grothendieck in lectures in Kansas defines abelian category and presheaf, and by using injective resolutions allows direct use of sheaf cohomology on all topological spaces, as derived functors. * 1956 Oscar Zariski's report Algebraic sheaf theory * 1957 Grothendieck's Tohoku paper rewrites homological algebra; he proves Grothendieck duality (i.e., Serre duality for possibly singular algebraic varieties). * 1957 onwards: Grothendieck extends sheaf theory in line with the needs of algebraic geometry, introducing: schemes and general sheaves on them, local cohomology, derived categories (with Verdier), and Grothendieck topologies. There emerges also his influential schematic idea of 'six operations' in homological algebra. * 1958 Roger Godement's book on sheaf theory is published. At around this time Mikio Sato proposes his hyperfunctions, which will turn out to have sheaf-theoretic nature. At this point sheaves had become a mainstream part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to algebraic topology. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is intuitionistic logic (this observation is now often referred to as Kripke‚ÄìJoyal semantics, but probably should be attributed to a number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as Leibniz.

A child prodigy is defined in psychology research literature as a person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert. The term wunderkind (from , literally \\"wonder child\\") is sometimes used as a synonym for child prodigy, particularly in media accounts. Wunderkind also is used to recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers. Examples Memory capacity of prodigies PET scans performed on several mathematics prodigies have suggested that they think in terms of long-term working memory (LTWM). This memory, specific to a field of expertise, is capable of holding relevant information for extended periods, usually hours. For example, experienced waiters have been found to hold the orders of up to twenty customers in their heads while they serve them, but perform only as well as an average person in number-sequence recognition. The PET scans also answer questions about which specific areas of the brain associate themselves with manipulating numbers. One subject never excelled as a child in mathematics, but he taught himself algorithms and tricks for calculatory speed, becoming capable of extremely complex mental math. His brain, compared to six other controls, was studied using the PET scan, revealing separate areas of his brain that he manipulated to solve the complex problems. Some of the areas that he and presumably prodigies use are brain sectors dealing in visual and spatial memory, as well as visual mental imagery. Other areas of the brain showed use by the subject, including a sector of the brain generally related to childlike \\"finger counting\\", probably used in his mind to relate numbers to the visual cortex. Working memory/cerebellum theory Noting that the cerebellum acts to streamline the speed and efficiency of all thought processes, VandervertVandervert 2007, 2009a, 2009b explained the abilities of prodigies in terms of the collaboration of working memory and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. Citing extensive imaging evidence, Vandervert first proposed this approach in two publications which appeared in 2003. In addition to imaging evidence, Vandervert's approach is supported by the substantial award-winning studies of the cerebellum by Masao Ito.Ito 2005, 2007 VandervertVandervert 2009a provided extensive argument that, in the prodigy, the transition from visual-spatial working memory to other forms of thought (language, art, mathematics) is accelerated by the unique emotional disposition of the prodigy and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. According to Vandervert, in the emotion-driven prodigy (commonly observed as a \\"rage to master\\") the cerebellum accelerates the streamlining of the efficiencies of working memory in its manipulation and decomposition/re- composition of visual-spatial content into language acquisition and into linguistic, mathematical, and artistic precocity.Vandervert 2009a, 2009b, in press-a, in press-b Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a child is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related and other notational system-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation.Vandervert, in press-a, in press-b. In child prodigies, Vandervert believes this blending process is accelerated due to their unique emotional sensitivities which result in high levels of repetitious focus on, in most cases, particular rule-governed knowledge domains. He has also argued that child prodigies first began to appear about 10,000 years ago when rule- governed knowledge had accumulated to a significant point, perhaps at the agricultural-religious settlements of G√∂bekli Tepe or Cyprus.Vandervert, 2009a, 2009b, in press-c Development Daniel Barenboim, age 11, with Conductor Moshe Lustig and the Gadna Symphonic orchestra 1953 Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. For example, L√°szl√≥ Polg√°r set out to raise his children to be chess players, and all three of his daughters went on to become world-class players (two of whom are grandmasters), emphasizing the potency a child's environment can have in determining the pursuits toward which a child's energy will be directed, and showing that an incredible amount of skill can be developed through suitable training.Queen takes all - Telegraph.co.uk, January 2002 But on the other hand George Frideric Handel was an example of the natural talent ... \\"he had discovered such a strong propensity to music, that his father who always intended him for the study of the Civil Law, had reason to be alarmed. He strictly forbade him to meddle with any musical instrument but Handel found means to get a little clavichord privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\\". Despite his father's opposition, Handel became a skillful performer on the harpsichord and pipe organ. Prodigiousness in childhood is not always maintained into adulthood. Some researchers have found that gifted children fall behind due to lack of effort. Jim Taylor, professor at the University of San Francisco, theorizes that this is because gifted children experience success at an early age with little to no effort and may not develop a sense of ownership of success. Therefore, these children might not develop a connection between effort and outcome. Some children might also believe that they can succeed without effort in the future as well. Dr. Anders Ericcson, professor at Florida State University, researches expert performance in sports, music, mathematics, and other activities. His findings demonstrate that prodigiousness in childhood is not a strong indicator of later success. Rather, the number of hours devoted to the activity was a better indicator. Taylor, Jim. ‚ÄúThe Problem of Giftedness.‚Äù Psychology Today, Sussex Publishers, 19 Nov. 2009, www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/200911/the-problem-giftedness. Rosemary Callard-Szulgit and other educators have written extensively about the problem of perfectionism in bright children, calling it their \\"number one social-emotional trait\\". Gifted children often associate even slight imperfection with failure, so that they become fearful of effort, even in their personal lives, and in extreme cases end up virtually immobilized.Rosemary Callard-Szulgit, Perfectionism and Gifted Children. 2nd edition, R&L; Education. July 31, 2012. =Special needs of gifted children= Gifted children will sometimes have their own unique set of needs and can often struggle in nonacademic areas. Since these children are usually viewed as natural achievers it can be even more difficult for them to receive the special assistance they need in areas not directly related to academic performance.‚ÄúAccommodations and Modifications.‚Äù National Association of Special Education Teachers, 2001, www.naset.org/giftedandtalented2.0.html. In most cases there are five specific special needs common to children who are identified as gifted: Gifted children often struggle with interpersonal relationships with peers. They may find it difficult to relate to others and may recognize that they are different from most children and might view themselves as needing to be separate. Gifted children often have trouble paying attention in class which can result with a mixed diagnosis of ADD or ADHD. Although it is possible for a gifted child to have these disorders, careful diagnostic measures must be taken. Gifted children often lack motivation to complete certain tasks if they feel that they are not being challenged enough. When gifted children are not provided with engaging material, their lack of focus may be perceived as an attention deficit disorder. Children who equate their performance with their self-worth often become perfectionists and struggle to perform to their own ideal standard, often setting bars for themselves that are too high and becoming angry, upset, or even depressed when they fail to meet their own expectations. Specialists theorize that the spoken word can be difficult for some gifted children because they have the added task of translating the complex ideas in their heads into language that others of similar age can understand. This process can lead to abnormal hesitation when speaking, stuttering, and frustration on the part of the child.
