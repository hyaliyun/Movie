Formerly a village in its own right, it lies to the southwest of the city and is bounded to the south by the White Cart Water. The area was part of Renfrewshire until 1926 when the villages of Cardonald, Crookston, Halfway and their surrounding farmland were annexed to Glasgow.Glasgow's growing pains, Evening Times, 26 November 2012No Mean City: 1914 to 1950s  Neighbourhoods  Boundary Extensions, The Glasgow Story History In the 15th century the lands of Cardonald in Renfrewshire were the property of Johannes Norwald or Normanville, Dominus of Cardownalde. His granddaughter and heiress, Marion Stewart (daughter of Isabella Norwald of Cardonald and Sir William Stewart of Castlemilk), married Allan Stewart, establishing the line of Stewarts of Cardonald.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.6. The Cardonald Stewarts were a junior branch of the House of Stewart. Allan Stewart of Cardonald, the first Stewart of Cardonald, was the younger son of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox. The Cardonald Stewarts had their seat at the Place of Cardonald (also known as Cardonald Castle or Cardonald House), built in 1565. It was demolished and replaced by a farmhouse - Cardonald Place Farm - in 1848. A corn mill existed in Cardonald from around 1789 until it was demolished in 1958. The site of Cardonald Mill is now occupied by the houses on Lade Terrace. The line of the Stewarts of Cardonald ended with Allan's great-grandson, James Stewart of Cardonald (1512‚Äì1584). He had served as a captain in the Scottish Guards of the Kings of France, and is buried in Paisley Abbey.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.7. As he had no issue, the lands of Cardonald passed to his sister's son, Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre. His family resided at the Place of Cardonald for generations, and retained lands in Cardonald until the 20th century.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.9. With the death of the 12th Lord Blantyre in 1900, his estates passed to his grandson, William Arthur Baird. Highrise flats in Cardonald The transformation of Cardonald from a rural to an urban community was largely brought about by the coming of the railway and the tram in the 19th century. The first railway to reach Cardonald was the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, with a station (then known as Moss Road station) opening on Berryknowes Road in 1843.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.11. However, due to poor traffic returns, this station was closed in 1845. In 1879, the present day Cardonald railway station opened on the same site.Butt, R.V.J. (1995). The Directory of Railway Stations. Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford. p.164.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.35. The siting of this station influenced the building of the terrace of houses at Hillington Park Circus and the large country houses of Dalveon and Turnberry on Berryknowes Road, along with the terraced houses in Kingsland and Queensland Drive.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.11. There was also the lodge house on Berryknowes road next to Dalveon house which was part of the estate (now Craigton cemetery) that contained Cruickston Hall (now the site of the new Lourdes Primary School) and Craigton House. Muirdrum Avenue, South Cardonald With the arrival of the electric tram in 1903, the growth of Cardonald began in earnest along the stretch of Paisley Road West between the little villages of Cardonald and Halfway, with the building of Cardonald Police station (1905) and Nazareth House (1906). In 1926, Glasgow Corporation bought the Cardonald estates from William Arthur Baird. The final upsurge in house building in the area took place from 1931, when most of the existing farm land disappeared, with the building of the North Cardonald and South Cardonald houses by the Western Heritable Investment Company after 1935. North Cardonald was mostly made up of owner-occupied houses and council homes owned by Glasgow Corporation (the predecessor to Glasgow City Council), while South Cardonald was mostly composed of owner-occupied and privately rented cottage flats. The 1930s also saw the building of two cinemas in the area, The Westway (1934-1960) and the Aldwych/Vogue (1938-1964). The Westway later became the Flamingo ballroom, and was then a bingo hall until its demolition in 2003. The Vogue was demolished in 1964 and replaced by a supermarket. In the 1950s, the Corporation erected the UK's first high-rise flats in the area. Although only 10 storeys high, the Moss Heights flats were the first of many high-rise blocks to be built in Glasgow. They were revolutionary in the fact that their heating system was supplied from a central coal-fired boiler house. They have been renovated and survive well into the 21st century, unlike other developments constructed in later decades. Education Lourdes Secondary School Cardonald Campus of Glasgow Clyde College The first school in the vicinity of Cardonald was established at Halfway in 1790, by a local blacksmith who taught the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic. In 1860, Cardonald School was established when a school building and teacher's house were built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Lammermoor Avenue. The two-roomed, single-storey school building was extended in 1899 with the addition of a second storey, and was further extended in 1911. Cardonald School remained the only school in the area until the 1930s when Lourdes Primary School and Angus Oval Primary School were built.Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.23. Cardonald School transferred to the new building (built on the site of the former Angus Oval Primary School) in 1965. NB Angus Oval had acted as an annexe for Cardonald Primary for some years - handling Primaries 1 and 2 until around 1963. The old Cardonald School building on Paisley Rd. West was used as a careers office and for a number of other uses, before being demolished in 2003. In the heart of north Cardonald was Belses Primary school. Sited on Belses Drive at the junction of Kingsland Drive. This was an annexe for the larger Hillington Primary school. After this wooden school was demolished a new school was built on the existing playing field at Hallrule drive. The Roman Catholic Lourdes Secondary School was opened in 1956. Cardonald College, one of Scotland's largest further education colleges, opened in 1972. It merged with Anniesland College and Langside College in August 2013 to form Glasgow Clyde College, and was renamed Cardonald Campus. Religion The oldest church in the area is Cardonald Parish Church (Church of Scotland), which was built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Cardonald Place Road on a plot of ground which was donated by Lord Blantyre. The red sandstone church, designed by Peter Macgregor Chalmers, was built 1887-1889 and was dedicated in February 1889. The west wing was added in 1899 and the east wing in 1925, while the church halls were built in 1940. Innes, John. (1993). Old Cardonald Had A Farm. Glasgow City Libraries & Archives. p.21. Cardonald Parish Church Hillington Park Parish Church (Church of Scotland) was originally called ‚ÄúCardonald United Free Church‚Äù, with the current church hall on Berryknowes Road being built as a parish church of the United Free Church of Scotland in 1908. The harled red sandstone church was built 1924-1925. With the union of the United Free Church and the Church of Scotland in 1929, the church was renamed as Hillington Park Parish Church.

The local Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Lourdes, was designed by Stellmacs Ltd and built 1937-1939. This church, which opened in May 1939, replaced an earlier small chapel which had been built on the site in 1922.

The steam forms when superheated water boils as its pressure drops when it emerges from the ground. A fumarole that emits sulfurous gases can be referred to as a solfatara (from old Italian solfo, \\"sulfur\\", although the modern Italian spelling is zolfo). Fumaroles may occur along tiny cracks, along long fissure, or in chaotic clusters or fields. They also occur on the surface of lava or pyroclastic flows. A fumarole field is an area of thermal springs and gas vents where shallow magma or hot igneous rocks release gases or interact with groundwater. When they occur in freezing environments, fumaroles may cause fumarolic ice towers. Fumaroles may persist for decades or centuries if located above a persistent heat source; or they may disappear within weeks to months if they occur atop a fresh volcanic deposit that quickly cools. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, for example, was formed during the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska. Initially, thousands of fumaroles occurred in the cooling ash from the eruption, but over time most of them have become extinct. An estimated four thousand fumaroles exist within the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. In April 2006 fumarole emissions killed three ski-patrol workers east of Chair 3 at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in California. The workers were overpowered by toxic fumes (a mazuku) that had accumulated in a crevasse they had fallen into.

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children's supplement , it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Herg√© intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, in particular the annexation of Austria in March 1938 (the Anschluss). The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of Syldavia, where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of King Muskar XII. King Ottokar's Sceptre was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Herg√© continued The Adventures of Tintin with Land of Black Gold until forced closure in 1940, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco- Belgian comics tradition. In 1947, Herg√© coloured and redrew King Ottokar's Sceptre in his distinctive style with the aid of Edgar P. Jacobs for Casterman's republication. The story introduces the recurring character Bianca Castafiore, and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and Borduria, both of which reappear in later stories. The first volume of the series to be translated into English, King Ottokar's Sceptre was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision Studios animation Herg√©'s Adventures of Tintin and for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Synopsis Having discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on the professor and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious and appears to have amnesia. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate. Forcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow by foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King's aide-de- camp, Colonel Boris Jorgen, and warns him of the plot. However, Jorgen is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin. Tintin succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot. Concerned, Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, to find that the imposter pretending to be Alembick has succeeded in smuggling it out of the building to his accomplices. With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, first by car and then by foot. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by M√ºsstler, a political agitator who runs the Syldavian Iron Guard, or Zyldav Zentral Revolutzion√§r Komitz√§t (ZZRK), and who intends to stir up unrest in Syldavia, thereby allowing Borduria to invade and annex the country. Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. Parachuting, he continues to Klow by foot, returning the sceptre to the King on St. Vladimir's Day and securing the monarchy. In thanks, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Tintin later learns that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother while police arrest M√ºsstler and rescue Professor Alembick. History Background The Anschluss: cheering crowds greet the Nazis in Vienna King Ottokar's Sceptre was not the first Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events; Herg√© had for instance previously made use of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria as a political backdrop for the setting in The Blue Lotus. This time, Herg√© had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany. In producing this story, he was particularly influenced by the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. The Munich Agreement and the subsequent Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland followed in October 1938. Three weeks after King Ottokar's Sceptre finished serialisation, Germany invaded Poland. By this point, the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear. By 1939, the events surrounding the Italian annexation of Albania made Herg√© insist his editor publish the work to take advantage of current events as he felt \\"Syldavia is Albania\\". Later Herg√© denied that he had just one country in mind. Herg√© claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend; biographer Beno√Æt Peeters suggested that the most likely candidate was school and scouting friend Philippe G√©rard, who had warned of a second war with Germany for years. Tintin scholars have claimed Herg√© did not develop the names Syldavia and Borduria himself; instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the British Journal of Psychology, in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power. Reportedly, the paper, by Lewis Fry Richardson and entitled \\"General Foreign Policy\\", explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a mathematical way. Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that \\"no researcher has confirmed this source\\". Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled \\"Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology\\" was published in The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements in 1939, but did not mention Syldavia or Borduria. In any case, given the publication date, it is unlikely that it was an influence on King Ottokar's Sceptre. Herg√© designed Borduria as a satirical depiction of Nazi Germany. Herg√© named the pro-Bordurian agitator \\"M√ºsstler\\" from the surnames of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Italy's National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. The name also had similarities with the British Union of Fascists' leader Oswald Mosley and the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands' leader Anton Mussert. M√ºsstler's group was named after the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group that sought to oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this is replaced by a Messerschmitt Bf 109. Herg√© adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte's Tecnica del Colpo di Stato (\\"The Technique of a Coup d'Etat\\"). Syldavia's depiction was influenced by the costumes and cultures of Romania and the neighboring Balkan region. The mosques that appear in Herg√©'s Syldavia are based on those found throughout the Balkans, while the appearance of the Syldavian village, featuring red-tiled roofs and minarets, may have been specifically inspired by the Bosnian town of Mostar. Syldavia's mineral rich subsoil could be taken as a reference to the uranium deposits found under Romania's Carpathian Mountains - later to be mentioned directly in the eventual Destination Moon. Tintin scholars have noted that the black pelican of Syldavia's flag resembles the black eagle of Albania's flag, and that Romania is the only European country to which pelicans are native. The Bosnian town of Mostar (pictured 1890-1900) has been suggested as a likely influence on Herg√©'s depiction of the Syldavian village. The name Syldavia may be a composite of Transylvania and Moldavia, two regions with historical ties to Romania. Czech, Slovak, and Bohemian history influenced the Syldavian names, while several medieval Bohemian kings were the inspiration for the name \\"Ottokar\\". The Polish language influenced Herg√©'s inclusion of ‚Äìow endings to the names of Syldavian places, while Polish history parallels Herg√©'s description of Syldavian history. The Syldavian language used in the book had French syntax but with Marollien vocabulary, a joke understood by the original Brussels-based readership. However, despite its Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for Belgium - Syldavian King Muskar XII physically resembles King Leopold III of Belgium. Herg√©'s decision to create a fictional Eastern European kingdom might have been influenced by Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894), which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites: the Diplodocus in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia - a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII's carriage is based on the British Royal Family's Gold State Coach. Original publication King Ottokar's Sceptre was first serialised in Le Petit Vingti√®me from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 under the title Tintin En Syldavie (\\"Tintin in Syldavia\\"). It would prove to be the last Tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in Le Petit Vingti√®me. From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, C≈ìurs Vaillants. In 1939, √âditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume; Herg√© insisted to his contact at Casterman, Charles Lesne, that they hurry up the process due to the changing political situation in Europe. The Nazi‚ÄìSoviet Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was signed the day Herg√© delivered the book's remaining drawings; finishing touches included the book's original front cover, the royal coat of arms for the title page, and the tapestry depicting the Syldavian's 1127 victory over the Turks in \\"The Battle of Zileheroum\\" on page 20. Herg√© suggested that for this publication, the story's title be changed to The Scepter of Ottokar IV; Casterman changed this to King Ottokar's Sceptre. King Ottokar's Sceptre introduced the recurring character of Bianca Castafiore to the series, who appears alongside her pianist Igor Wagner. It also witnessed the introduction of antagonist Colonel Jorgen, who reappears in the later Tintin adventures Destination Moon and its sequel Explorers on the Moon. The Alembick brothers' inclusion echoes the Balthazar brothers' inclusion in The Broken Ear. After the conclusion of King Ottokar's Sceptre, Herg√© continued The Adventures of Tintin with Land of Black Gold until Germany placed Belgium under occupation in 1940 and forced the closure of . The adventure Land of Black Gold had to be abandoned. Second version, 1947 The story was redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Herg√© was assisted by Edgar P. Jacobs, an artist who worked as part of Studios Herg√©. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform similar to the National Guards Unit of Bulgaria. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Herg√©, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friends - √âdouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Herg√© and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Herg√© had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn. Editions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947. Subsequent publications and legacy King Ottokar's Sceptre became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when Eagle serialised the comic in 1951. Here, the names of Tintin and Milou were retained, although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner when they translated the series into English for Methuen Publishing in 1958. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their collection. In 1988, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition. Critical analysis Herg√© biographer Beno√Æt Peeters (pictured, 2010) felt that King Ottokar's Sceptre showed \\"a political maturity\\". Harry Thompson described King Ottokar's Sceptre as a \\"biting political satire\\" and asserted that it was \\"courageous\\" of Herg√© to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent. Describing it as a \\"classic locked room mystery\\", he praised its \\"tightly constructed plot\\". Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside The Blue Lotus and The Black Island. He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague. Herg√© biographer Pierre Assouline believed that the story had the atmosphere of Franz Leh√°r's The Merry Widow, with \\"added touches\\" from the films of Erich von Stroheim and Ernst Lubitsch. Fellow biographer Beno√Æt Peeters thought that it exhibited \\"a political maturity\\" and \\"originality\\". Further, he felt that Herg√© was able to break free from the \\"narrative limits [of] ... too much realism\\" by the use of Syldavia as a setting. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier called King Ottokar's Sceptre \\"a Hitchcockian thriller\\" which \\"recaptures the paranoid ambience\\" of Cigars of the Pharaoh. They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones films before noting that despite the \\"horrors of the real world\\" that are present with Borduria's inclusion, they do not interfere in \\"the pure escapist nature of the adventure\\". Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five. Michael Farr opined that the adventure has \\"a convincingly authentic feel\\" due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with \\"sufficient scope for invention\\" with the creation of Syldavia. He compared it to Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes. Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs' aid, however. Deeming it \\"particularly successful\\", he thought that it was \\"one of the most polished and accomplished\\" adventures in the series, with a \\"perfectly paced and balanced\\" narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid√®s of Stanford University asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel Fran√ßois de La Rocque's Croix-de-Feu. Noting that the figure of M√ºsstler was \\"the Evil One without a face\\", he expressed disbelief regarding Herg√©'s depiction of Syldavia, as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why M√ºsstler's anti-monarchist conspiracy was so strong; thus, \\"mass revolution remains schematic\\". Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and- guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws. Adaptations King Ottokar's Sceptre was the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be adapted for the animated series Herg√©'s Adventures of Tintin. The series was created by Belgium's Belvision Studios in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg. The studio divided King Ottokar's Sceptre into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverged from Herg√©'s original plot in many ways. It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. The episode was directed by St√©phane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin. Tintin fans adopted the Syldavian language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of Star Trek's Klingon and J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish.

The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium's Tintin magazine from October 1956 to January 1958 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1958. The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock as they travel to the fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed with the intention of aiding the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab in regaining control after a coup d'√©tat by his enemies, who are financed by slave traders, whose leader is Tintin's old nemesis Rastapopoulos. Following on from the previous volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, The Red Sea Sharks was created with the aid of Herg√©'s team of artists at Studios Herg√©. Influenced by Honor√© de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Herg√© used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier instalments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world. However, in the 1960s the story generated controversy as Herg√© was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Herg√© continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Red Sea Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it as one of the best Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin and the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the Adventures. Synopsis In Brussels, Tintin and Captain Haddock bump into an old acquaintance, General Alcazar. Returning to Marlinspike Hall, they find that another acquaintance, the Emir of Khemed, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, has been overthrown by his nemesis Sheikh Bab El Ehr, and that the Emir has accordingly sent his son, the disobedient Abdullah, to stay at Marlinspike for his own protection. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson visit, informing Tintin that Alcazar is seeking to purchase military aircraft from J. M. Dawson. After further investigation , Tintin discovers that Dawson has also sold military aircraft to Bab El Ehr. Realising that the only way to be rid of Abdullah is to restore the Emir's control of Khemed, Tintin, Haddock, and their dog Snowy travel to the Middle Eastern country. However, the trio narrowly survive a bomb planted aboard the plane to kill them as a result of Dawson discovering that Tintin spied on him, and are able to slip into the city of Wadeshah unobserved. There they meet an old friend, the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who helps them to escape the city and ride on horseback to the Emir's hideout. During the journey, they evade armoured cars and fighter planes ordered to intercept them by \\"Mull Pasha\\", who is actually Tintin's old nemesis, Dr. M√ºller. The Emir welcomes Tintin and Haddock. It then transpires, from his explanation, that there is an ongoing slave trade through Khemed that is operated by the international businessman called \\"the Marquis di Gorgonzola\\", who falsely offers transport to African Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca, but then sells them into slavery somewhere along the journey. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy leave for the Red Sea coast and board a sambuk for Mecca, but are attacked by fighter planes. Tintin shoots one down and rescues its mercenary Estonian pilot, Piotr Skut. The four are picked up by di Gorgonzola's yacht, the Scheherazade, but are soon offloaded onto the SS Ramona, a tramp steamer. Di Gorgonzola, it turns out, is another of Tintin's previous adversaries, Roberto Rastapopoulos. The Ramona is one of Rastapopoulos' slave trading ships, and when a fire breaks out aboard it during the night, the ship's commander Allan and his crew cowardly flee, leaving Tintin, Haddock, Snowy and Skut aboard along with a consignment of African slaves. With Haddock taking on the ship's captaincy, they are successfully able to put out the fire. However, Rastapopoulos orders a U-boat to destroy the Ramona, with the ship taking evasive manoeuvres to survive, ultimately being rescued by a fighter from the cruiser USS Los Angeles after Tintin dispatches numerous distress calls. The Los Angeles chases down the Scheherazade and attempts to capture di Gorgonzola, but he fakes his own death and escapes via a mini-submarine. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy return to Belgium and learn that the Emir has recaptured Khemed and that Abdullah can return home. Their relaxation is cut short by Jolyon Wagg, who has arranged to use Marlinspike for an auto rally. History Background and publication Herg√© was inspired to develop the plot for The Red Sea Sharks after reading a magazine article detailing the continued existence of the slave trade within the Arab world, in which it was claimed that African pilgrims headed to Mecca were being enslaved during the journey. Herg√© included a reference to this slave trade in the story's original French title, Coke en Stock (\\"Coke on Board\\"), which referred to the slave smuggler's use of \\"coke\\" as a codeword for the enslaved people. The Treasury (Al Khazneh) in Petra depicted in the book Prior to writing the story, Herg√© had read Balzac et son monde (\\"Balzac and His World\\"), a 1955 book written by his friend F√©licien Marceau. Intrigued by the work of Honor√© de Balzac, Herg√© was inspired by the way in which Balzac kept reusing characters from his previous stories and he subsequently adopted this trait for The Red Sea Sharks, in which a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin make a reappearance. Herg√© also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in Flight 714 to Sydney. To produce accurate illustrations for the Ramona, Herg√© and his assistant Bob de Moor traveled aboard a Swedish cargo vessel, the MS Reine Astrid, from Antwerp to Gothenburg and back, during which they took photographs and drew sketches. Herg√© had also collected press clippings depicting the Christina, a motor yacht owned by the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, and used them as the basis for his depiction of Rastapopoulos' ship, the Sheherezade. The aircraft, cars, and machinery that appear in the story were drawn by Roger Leloup, one of the members of the Studios Herg√©. In one scene in the latter part of the story, Herg√© included a frogman, whose depiction was drawn from a press clipping of Lionel Crabb. His depiction of the Emir's hideaway palace cut from the rock was based on the Al Khazneh in Petra, Jordan, which he had seen in an issue of National Geographic. Herg√©'s growing interest in art was reflected in the story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir√≥ aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Herg√© included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs. The story began serialisation in Belgium's Tintin magazine in October 1956, before being serialised in the French edition of the magazine from December 1956. It was then published in book form by Casterman in 1958. Upon the story's British publication in 1960, Coke en Stock was renamed The Red Sea Sharks. Racism allegations and alterations Herg√© had been accused of exhibiting a racist attitude toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde (\\"Africa and the World\\"); they translated some of the passages that Herg√© wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Herg√© for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo. :African: \\"You speak well, Effendi. Wicked Arab, very wicked. Poor black men not want to be slaves. Poor black men want to go to Mecca.\\" :Haddock: \\"Naturally, I realise that. But I repeat if you go there, you'll be sold as slaves. Is that what you want?\\" :African: \\"We not slaves, Effendi. We good Muslims. We want to go to Mecca.\\" Herg√© biographer Beno√Æt Peeters expressed the view that \\"for the most part these attacks were extremely unfair\\". Herg√© was emotionally affected by the accusations, and made changes to the book for its 1967 reprint accordingly; here he changed the Africans' speech patterns, giving them improved grammar. However, he left Haddock speaking pidgin in response to the Africans. For this version he also made changes to the Emir's letter to Tintin; the former version had been formal in its prose, stating \\"Most esteemed and well-beloved friend, I entrust to you my son Abdullah, to improve his English. Here the situation is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah\\". In Herg√©'s revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: \\"This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah.\\" Herg√© also expressed regret that he depicted the death of a shark in the story, later stating that \\"I still believed that sharks were big evil beasts\\" when writing The Red Sea Sharks. Critical analysis Commenting on the inclusion of a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin, Harry Thompson referred to the story as \\"a Tintin family reunion\\", commenting that it was \\"a story unusually full of the type of people Captain Haddock liked to avoid\\". Michael Farr believed that in reviving so many older characters, Herg√© had given The Red Sea Sharks \\"a marked retrospective quality\\". Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier felt that the \\"crowded\\" nature of the story left little room for series regulars Professor Calculus or Thomson and Thompson, and resulted in the new character of Skut serving only as \\"a nice supporting character, but nothing more\\". The Lofficiers stated that \\"Herg√© was doing some house-cleaning of his past works and characters before embarking on something more serious and with more personal resonance\\", Tintin in Tibet. Herg√© biographer Beno√Æt Peeters described The Red Sea Sharks as a \\"complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine\\" story which was \\"undoubtedly the book in which Herg√© ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe.\\" He thought that \\"Herg√© enters a new phase\\" with The Red Sea Sharks, as its author \\"seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his readers.\\" Peeters noted that the book was \\"in some respects a continuation\\" of Land of Black Gold, an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom described it as a partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that The Red Sea Sharks \\"atoned for the relative failure\\" of Land of Black Gold, believing that although it had a \\"rather hasty finish\\", it was \\"a first-rate thriller\\". The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was \\"very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than The Calculus Affair\\". They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West's relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because he is a good leader, but for their own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests. Thompson felt that the inclusion of slavery as a key theme led to this book being \\"one of Herg√©'s more adult-oriented adventures\\". Nevertheless, Farr noted that the story contained \\"a good measure of humour\\" to balance out these darker elements. Farr drew comparisons with Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, a series of novels that was contemporary to The Red Sea Sharks and which was similarly inspired by Balzac's The Human Comedy. Herg√© biographer Pierre Assouline believed that The Red Sea Sharks represented \\"the culmination of his golden age\\", which had begun with The Blue Lotus. He also commented that \\"it almost seemed as if Herg√© had regained the pace and rhythm of his most creative period\\" with this story. In his psychoanalytical study of The Adventures of Tintin, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid√®s expressed the view that The Red Sea Sharks reflected a world in which traditional values have been degraded and everything - including human life - has become a commodity. He added that Rastapopoulos becomes \\"the embodiment of the global market\\" in this story, tying together all of the other characters and therefore replacing Tintin as the figure \\"at the centre of the universe\\". Apostolid√®s opined that The Red Sea Sharks amplifies \\"the theme of the general equivalence of everything\\" that is present in the series, serving as \\"a kind of retrospective\\" by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them. He believed that the theme of the mirage pervaded the story, appearing repeatedly in such forms as Abdullah's cuckoo clock which concealed a water squirter and the pseudonyms employed by the various characters throughout the narrative. The literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that The Red Sea Sharks exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout The Adventures of Tintin. He believed that a scene in which one of Bab El Ehr's men spies on the Emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout the series. McCarthy also highlighted Tintin's actions in returning Abdullah to Khemed, expressing the view that it is part of a wider running theme throughout the series in which the hero takes an abandoned children to their home; other instances included Tintin's discovery of an adoptive family for the orphan Chang Chong-Chen in The Blue Lotus and the delivery of the lost gypsy child Miarka to her family in The Castafiore Emerald.  Adaptations  In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories - among them The Red Sea Sharks - into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. Directed by St√©phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \\"generally faithful\\", with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries around Europe. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus (\\"Saint Nick\\") through Sinterklaas. Very little is known about the historical Saint Nicholas. The earliest accounts of his life were written centuries after his death and contain many legendary elaborations. He is said to have been born in the Greek seaport of Patara, Lycia in Asia Minor to wealthy Christian parents. In one of the earliest attested and most famous incidents from his life, he is said to have rescued three girls from being forced into prostitution by dropping a sack of gold coins through the window of their house each night for three nights so their father could pay a dowry for each of them. Other early stories tell of him calming a storm at sea, saving three innocent soldiers from wrongful execution, and chopping down a tree possessed by a demon. In his youth, he is said to have made a pilgrimage to Egypt and Israel. Shortly after his return, he became Bishop of Myra. He was later cast into prison during the persecution of Diocletian, but was released after the accession of Constantine. An early list makes him an attendee at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, but he is never mentioned in any writings by people who were actually at the council. Late, unsubstantiated legends claim that he was temporarily defrocked and imprisoned during the Council for slapping the heretic Arius. Another famous late legend tells how he resurrected three children, who had been murdered and pickled in brine by a butcher planning to sell them as pork during a famine. Fewer than 200 years after Nicholas's death, the St. Nicholas Church was built in Myra under the orders of Theodosius II over the site of the church where he had served as bishop and Nicholas's remains were moved to a sarcophagus in that church. In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of the region were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuk Turks, and soon after their church was declared to be in schism by the Catholic church, a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the major bones of Nicholas's skeleton from his sarcophagus in the church without authorization and brought them to their hometown, where they are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola. The remaining bone fragments from the sarcophagus were later removed by Venetian sailors and taken to Venice during the First Crusade. His relics in Bari are said to exude a miraculous watery substance known as \\"manna\\" or \\"myrrh\\", which some members of the faithful regard as possessing supernatural powers.  Biographical sources  Very little at all is known about Saint Nicholas's historical life. Any writings Nicholas himself may have produced have been lost and he is not mentioned by any contemporary chroniclers. This is not surprising, since Nicholas lived during a turbulent time in Roman history. Furthermore, all written records were kept on papyrus or parchment, which were less durable than modern paper, and texts needed to be periodically recopied by hand onto new material in order to be preserved. The earliest mentions of Saint Nicholas indicate that, by the sixth century, his cult was already well-established. Less than two hundred years after Saint Nicholas's probable death, the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II (ruled 401‚Äì450) ordered the building of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Myra, which thereby preserves an early mention of his name. The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions that the Emperor Justinian I (ruled 527‚Äì565) renovated churches in Constantinople dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Priscus, which may have originally been built as early as 490. Nicholas's name also occurs as \\"Nicholas of Myra of Lycia\\" on the tenth line of a list of attendees at the Council of Nicaea recorded by the historian Theodoret in the Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome, written sometime between 510 and 515. A single, offhand mention of Nicholas of Myra also occurs in the biography of another saint, Saint Nicholas of Sion, who apparently took the name \\"Nicholas\\" to honor him. The Life of Saint Nicholas of Sion, written around 250 years after Nicholas of Myra's death, briefly mentions Nicholas of Sion visiting Nicholas's tomb to pay homage to him. According to Jeremy Seal, the fact that Nicholas had a tomb that could be visited serves as the almost solitary definitive proof that he was a real historical figure. In his treatise De statu animarum post mortem (written 583), the theologian Eustratius of Constantinople cites Saint Nicholas of Myra's miracle of the three counts as evidence that souls may work independent from the body. Eustratius credits a lost Life of Saint Nicholas as his source. Nearly all the sources Eustratius references date from the late fourth century to early fifth century, indicating the Life of Saint Nicholas to which he refers was probably written during this time period, shortly after Nicholas's death. The earliest complete account of Nicholas's life that has survived to the present is a Life of Saint Nicholas, written in the early ninth century by Michael the Archimandrite (814‚Äì842), nearly 500 years after Nicholas's probable death. Despite its extremely late date, Michael the Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas is believed to heavily rely on older written sources and oral traditions.Introduction to Michael the Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas The identity and reliability of these sources, however, remains uncertain. Catholic historian D. L. Cann and medievalist Charles W. Jones both consider Michael the Archimandrite's Life the only account of Saint Nicholas that is likely to contain any historical truth. Jona Lendering, a Dutch historian of classical antiquity, notes that Michael the Archimandrite's Life does not contain a \\"conversion narrative\\", which was unusual for saints' lives of the period when it was written. He therefore argues that it is possible Michael the Archimandrite may have been relying on a source written before conversion narratives became popular, which would be a positive indication of that source's reliability. He also notes, however, that many of the stories recounted by Michael the Archimandrite closely resemble stories told about the first-century AD Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, an eight-volume biography of him written in the early third century by the Greek writer Philostratus. Christian storytellers were known to adapt older pagan legends and attribute them to Christian saints. Because Apollonius's hometown of Tyana was not far from Myra, Lendering contends that many popular stories about Apollonius may have become attached to Saint Nicholas.  Life and legends   Family and background  Accounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians. According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius (, ) and Johanna (, ), but, according to others, they were named Theophanes (, ) and Nonna (, ). In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest.  Generosity and travels  The dowry for the three virgins (Gentile da Fabriano, 1425, Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) After his parents died, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor. In his most famous exploit, which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas, Nicholas heard of a devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the \\"plotting and envy of Satan.\\"Michael the Archimandrite, Life of Saint Nicholas Chapters 10‚Äì11 The man could not afford proper dowries for his three daughters. This meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, be forced to become prostitutes. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house. The father immediately arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after her wedding, Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at night.Michael the Archimandrite, Life of Saint Nicholas Chapters 12‚Äì18 According to Michael the Archimandrite's account, after the second daughter was married, the father stayed awake for at least two \\"nights\\" and caught Saint Nicholas in the same act of charity toward the third daughter.Michael the Archimandrite, Life of Saint Nicholas Chapters 16‚Äì18 The father fell on his knees, thanking him, and Nicholas ordered him not to tell anyone about the gifts. The scene of Nicholas's secret gift-giving is one of the most popular scenes in Christian devotional art, appearing in icons and frescoes from across Europe. Although depictions vary depending on time and place, Nicholas is often shown wearing a cowl while the daughters are typically shown in bed, dressed in their nightclothes. Many renderings contain a cypress tree or a cross-shaped cupola. The historicity of this incident is disputed. Adam C. English argues for a historical kernel to the legend, noting the story's early attestation as well as the fact that no similar stories were told about any other Christian saints. Jona Lendering, who also argues for the story's authenticity, notes that a similar story is told in Philostratus's Life of Apollonius of Tyana, in which Apollonius gives money to an impoverished father, but states that Michael the Archimandrite's account is markedly different. Philostratus never mentions the fate of the daughters and, in his story, Apollonius's generosity is purely motivated out of sympathy for the father; in Michael the Archimandrite's account, however, Saint Nicholas is instead expressly stated to be motivated by a desire to save the daughters from being sold into prostitution. He argues that this desire to help women is most characteristic of fourth-century Christianity, due to the prominent role women played in the early Christian movement, rather than Greco-Roman paganism or the Christianity of Michael the Archimandrite's time in the ninth century, by which point the position of women had drastically declined. In another story, Nicholas is said to have visited the Holy Land. The ship he was on was nearly destroyed by a terrible storm, but he rebuked the waves, causing the storm to subside. Because of this miracle, Nicholas became venerated as the patron saint of sailors and travelers Bishop of Myra Saint Nicholas Saves Three Innocents from Death (1888) by Ilya Repin After visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's uncle, had recently died and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop. He is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284‚Äì305), but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306‚Äì337). This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore unlikely to be historical. One of the earliest attested stories of Saint Nicholas is one in which he saves three innocent men from execution.Michael the Archimandrite, Life of Saint Nicholas Chapter 31 According to Michael the Archimandrite, three innocent men were condemned to death by the governor Eustathius. As they were about to be executed, Nicholas appeared, pushed the executioner's sword to the ground, released them from their chains, and angrily chastised a juror who had accepted a bribe. According to Jona Lendering, this story directly parallels an earlier story in Philostratus's Life of Apollonius of Tyana, in which Apollonius prevents the execution of a man falsely condemned of banditry. Michael the Archimandrite also tells another story in which the consul Ablabius accepted a bribe to put three famous generals to death, in spite of their actual innocence.Michael the Archimandrite, Life of Saint Nicholas Chapter 33 Saint Nicholas appeared to Constantine and Ablabius in dreams, informing Constantine of the truth and frightening Ablabius into releasing the generals, for fear of Hell. Later versions of the story are more elaborate, interweaving the two stories together. According to one version, Emperor Constantine sent three of his most trusted generals, named Ursos, Nepotianos, and Herpylion, to put down a rebellion in Phrygia, but a storm forced them to take refuge in Myra. Unbeknownst to the generals, who were in the harbor, their soldiers further inland were fighting with local merchants and engaging in looting and destruction. Nicholas confronted the generals for allowing their soldiers to misbehave and the generals brought an end to the looting. Immediately after the soldiers had returned to their ships, Nicholas heard word of the three innocent men about to be executed and the three generals aided him in stopping the execution. Eustathius attempted to flee on his horse, but Nicholas stopped his horse and chastised him for his corruption. Eustathius, under the threat of being reported directly to the Emperor, repented of his corrupt ways. Afterward, the generals succeeded in ending the rebellion and were promoted by Constantine to even higher status. The generals' enemies, however, slandered them to the consul Ablabius, telling him that they had not really put down the revolt, but instead encouraged their own soldiers to join it. The generals' enemies also bribed Ablabius and he had the three generals imprisoned. Nicholas then made his dream appearances and the three generals were set free.  Council of Nicaea  Russian Orthodox fresco showing Saint Nicholas slapping Arius at the First Council of Nicaea, a famous incident whose historicity is disputed In 325, Nicholas is said to have attended the First Council of Nicaea,Wheeler & Rosenthal, \\"St Nicholas: A Closer Look at Christmas\\", (Chapter 1), Nelson Reference & Electronic, 2005 where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed. Nicholas's attendance at the Council of Nicaea is attested early by Theodore the Lector's list of attendees, which records him as the 151st attendee. However, he is conspicuously never mentioned by Athanasius of Alexandria, the foremost defender of Trinitarianism at the Council, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, nor is he mentioned by the historian Eusebius, who was also present at the council. Adam C. English notes that lists of the attendees at Nicaea vary considerably, with shorter lists only including roughly 200 names, but longer lists including around 300. Saint Nicholas's name only appears on the longer lists, not the shorter ones. Nicholas's name appears on a total of three early lists, one of which, Theodore the Lector's, is generally considered to be the most accurate. According to Jona Lendering, there are two main possibilities: # Nicholas did not attend the Council of Nicaea, but someone at an early date was baffled that his name was not listed and so added him to the list. Many scholars tend to favor this explanation. # Nicholas did attend the Council of Nicaea, but, at an early date, someone decided to remove his name from the list, apparently deciding that it was better if no one remembered he had been there. A later legend, first attested in the fourteenth century, over 1,000 years after Nicholas's death, holds that, during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas lost his temper and slapped \\"a certain Arian\\" across the face. On account of this, Constantine revoked Nicholas's miter and pallium. Stephen D. Greydanus concludes that, because of the story's late attestation, it \\"has no historical value.\\" Jona Lendering defends the historicity of the incident, arguing that, because it was embarrassing and reflects poorly on Nicholas's reputation, it is inexplicable why later hagiographers would have made it up. Later versions of the legend embellish it, making the heretic Arius himself and having Nicholas punch him rather than merely slapping him with his open hand. In these versions of the story, Nicholas is also imprisoned, but Christ and the Virgin Mary appear to him in his cell. He tells them he is imprisoned \\"for loving you\\" and they free him from his chains and restore his vestments. The scene of Nicholas slapping Arius is celebrated in Eastern Orthodox icons and episodes of Saint Nichola at Nicaea are shown in a series of paintings from the 1660s in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari.  Other reputed miracles  Grandes Heures d'Anne de Bretagne (created between 1503 and 1508) One story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure, planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, visiting the region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and resurrected the pickled children by making the Sign of the Cross. Adam C. English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to the legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest Lives. Jona Lendering states that the story is \\"without any historical value.\\" Though this story seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously popular throughout the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted in stained glass windows, wood panel paintings, tapestries, and frescoes. Eventually, the scene became so widely reproduced that, rather than showing the whole scene, artists began to merely depict Saint Nicholas with three naked children and a wooden barrel at his feet. According to English, eventually, people who had forgotten or never learned the story began misinterpreting representations of it. The fact that Saint Nicholas was shown with children led people to conclude he was the patron saint of children; meanwhile, the fact that he was shown with a barrel led people to conclude that he was the patron saint of brewers. According to another story, during a great famine that Myra experienced in 311‚Äì312, a ship was in the port at anchor, loaded with wheat for the Emperor in Constantinople. Nicholas invited the sailors to unload a part of the wheat to help in the time of need. The sailors at first disliked the request, because the wheat had to be weighed accurately and delivered to the Emperor. Only when Nicholas promised them that they would not suffer any loss for their consideration, the sailors agreed. When they arrived later in the capital, they made a surprising find: the weight of the load had not changed, although the wheat removed in Myra was enough for two full years and could even be used for sowing.  Relics   Gemile  Gemile where some scholars believe Saint Nicholas was originally entombed It has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept, but some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas's name is painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the island was known as \\"Saint Nicholas Island\\" and today it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning \\"Island of Boats\\", in reference to Saint Nicholas's traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers. The church was built in the fourth century, around the time of Nicholas's death, and is typical of saints' shrines from that time period. Nicholas was the only major saint associated with that part of Turkey. The church where historians believe he was originally entombed is at the western end of the great processional way.  Myra  Photograph of the desecrated sarcophagus in the St. Nicholas Church, Demre, where Saint Nicholas's bones were kept before they were removed and taken to Bari in 1087 In the mid-600s, Gemile was vulnerable to attack by Arab fleets, so Nicholas's remains appear to have been moved from the island to the city of Myra, where Nicholas had served as bishop for most of his life. Myra is located roughly forty kilometers, or twenty-five miles, east of Gemile and its location further inland made it safer from seafaring Arab forces. It is said that, in Myra, the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smelled like rose water, called manna, or myrrh, which was believed by the faithful to possess miraculous powers.de Ceglia, Francesco Paolo: \\"The science of Santa Claus : discussions on the Manna of Nicholas of Myra in the modern age\\". In Nuncius ‚Äì 27 (2012) 2, pp. 241‚Äì269 Because it was widely known that all Nicholas's relics were at Myra in their sealed sarcophagus, it was rare during this period for forgers of relics to claim to possess those belonging to Saint Nicholas. A solemn bronze statue of the saint by Russian sculptor Gregory Pototsky was donated by the Russian government in 2000, and was given a prominent place in the square fronting the medieval Church of St. Nicholas. In 2005, mayor S√ºleyman Top√ßu had the statue replaced by a red-suited plastic Santa Claus statue, because he wanted an image more recognisable to foreign visitors. Protests from the Russian government against this were successful, and the bronze statue was returned (albeit without its original high pedestal) to a corner nearer the church. On 28 December 2009, the Turkish government announced that it would be formally requesting the return of Saint Nicholas's skeletal remains to Turkey from the Italian government. Turkish authorities have asserted that Saint Nicholas himself desired to be buried at his episcopal town, and that his remains were illegally removed from his homeland. In 2017, an archaeological survey at St. Nicholas Church, Demre was reported to have found a temple below the modern church, with excavation work to be done that will allow researchers to determine whether it still holds Nicholas's body.  Bari  Basilica di San Nicola in Bari, Italy where most of the relics of Saint Nicholas are kept today After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks, and so Greek Christians of Myra became subjects of the Turks. At the same time the Catholic Church in the West had declared (in 1054 AD) that the Greek church, the official church of the Byzantine Empire, was in schism. Because of the many wars in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult. Taking advantage of the confusion and the loss by the Greek Christian community of Myra of its Byzantine imperial protection, in the spring of 1087, Italian sailors from Bari in Apulia seized part of the remains of the saint from his burial church in Myra, over the objections of the Greek Orthodox monks in the church. Procession of St. Nicholas, Bari Adam C. English describes the removal of the relics from Myra as \\"essentially a holy robbery\\" and notes that the thieves were not only afraid of being caught or chased after by the locals, but also the power of Saint Nicholas himself. Returning to Bari, they brought the remains with them and cared for them. The remains arrived on 9 May 1087. Two years later, Pope Urban II inaugurated a new church, the Basilica di San Nicola, to Saint Nicholas in Bari. The Pope himself personally placed Nicholas's relics into the tomb beneath the altar of the new church. The removal of Saint Nicholas's relics from Myra and their arrival in Bari is reliably recorded by multiple chroniclers, including Orderic Vitalis and 9 May continued to be celebrated every year by western Christians as the day of Nicholas's \\"translation\\". Eastern Orthodox Christians and the Turks have both long regarded the unauthorized removal of the relics from Myra as a blatant theft, but the people of Bari have instead maintained that it was a rescue mission to save the bones from the Turkish invaders. A legend, shown on the ceiling of the Basilica di San Nicola, holds that Nicholas once visited Bari while he was alive and predicted that his bones would one day rest there. Prior to the translation of Nicholas's relics to Bari, his cult had been known in western Europe, but it had not been extremely popular. In autumn of 1096, Norman and Frankish soldiers mustered in Bari in preparation for the First Crusade. Although the Crusaders generally favored warrior saints, which Saint Nicholas was not, the presence of his relics in Bari made him materially accessible. Nicholas's associations with aiding travelers and seafarers also made him a popular choice for veneration. Nicholas's veneration by Crusaders helped promote his cult throughout western Europe. After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to produce \\"myrrh\\", much to the joy of their new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action. In 1966, a vault in the crypt underneath the Basilica di San Nicola was dedicated as an Orthodox chapel with an iconostasis in commemoration of the recent lifting of the anathemas the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches had issued against each other during the Great Schism in 1054. In May 2017, following talks between Pope Francis and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, a portion of the relics of St. Nicholas in Bari were sent on loan to Moscow. The relic was on display for veneration at Christ the Savior Cathedral before being taken to St. Petersburg in mid-June prior to returning to Bari. More than a million people lined up in Moscow for a momentary glimpse of the gilded ark holding one of the saint's ribs.  Venice  The church of San Nicol√≤ al Lido in Venice claims to hold roughly 500 bone fragments from Nicholas's skeleton, which scientific examinations have confirmed are anatomically compatible with the bones in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari. The sailors from Bari only took the main bones of Nicholas's skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the grave. The city of Venice had interest in obtaining the remaining fragments of his skeleton and, in 1044, they dedicated the San Nicol√≤ al Lido monastery basilica to him on the north end of the Lido di Venezia. According to a single chronicle written by an anonymous monk at this monastery, in 1100, a fleet of Venetian ships accompanied by Bishop Henri sailed past Myra on their way to Palestine for the First Crusade. Bishop Henri insisted for the fleet to turn back and set anchor in Myra. The Venetians took the remaining bones of Saint Nicholas, as well as those of several other bishops of Myra, from the church there, which was only guarded by four Orthodox monks, and brought them to Venice, where they deposited them in the San Nicol√≤ al Lido. This tradition was lent credence in two scientific investigations of the relics in Bari and Venice, which confirmed that the relics in the two cities are anatomically compatible and may belong to the same person. It is said that someone dies every time the bones of Saint Nicholas in Venice are disturbed. The last time the bones were examined was in July 1992.  Other locations  Tomb of Saint Nicholas near Thomastown, Ireland Because of Nicholas's skeleton's long confinement in Myra, after it was brought to Bari, the demand for pieces of it rose. Small bones quickly began to disperse across western Europe. The sailors who had transported the bones gave one tooth and two fragments chipped from Nicholas's sarcophagus to the Norman knight William Pantulf. Pantulf took these relics to his hometown of Noron in Normandy, where they were placed in the local Church of St. Peter in June 1092. In 1096, the duke of Apulia gave several bones of Saint Nicholas to the count of Flanders, which he then enshrined in the Abbey of Watten. According to legend, in 1101, Saint Nicholas appeared in a vision to a French clerk visiting the shrine at Bari and told him to take one of his bones with him to his hometown of Port, near Nancy. The clerk took a finger bone back with him to Port, where a chapel was built to Saint Nicholas. Port became an important center of devotion in the Nicholas cult and, in the fifteenth century, a church known as the Basilique Saint-Nicolas was built there dedicated to him. The town itself is now known as \\"Saint Nicolas de Port\\" in honor of Nicholas. The clergy at Bari strategically gave away samples of Nicholas's bones to promote the cult and enhance its prestige. Many of these bones were initially kept in Constantinople, but, after the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, these fragments were scattered across western Europe. A hand claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in the San Nicola in Carcere in Rome. This church, whose name means \\"Saint Nicholas in Chains\\", was built on the site of a former municipal prison. Stories quickly developed about Nicholas himself having been held in that prison. Mothers would come to the church to pray to Saint Nicholas for their jailed sons to be released and repentant criminals would place votive offerings in the church. As a result of this, Nicholas became the patron saint of prisoners and those falsely accused of crimes. An index finger claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in a chapel along the Ostian Way in Rome. Another finger was held in Ventimiglia in Liguria. Today, many churches in Europe, Russia, and the United States claim to possess small relics, such as a tooth or a finger bone. An Irish tradition states that the relics of Saint Nicholas are also reputed to have been stolen from Myra by local Norman crusading knights in the twelfth century and buried near Thomastown, County Kilkenny, where a stone slab marks the site locally believed to be his grave. According to the Irish antiquarian John Hunt, the tomb probably actually belongs to a local priest from Jerpoint Abbey.  Scientific analysis  Saint Nicholas, Russian icon from first quarter of the 18th century (Kizhi monastery, Karelia) Whereas the devotional importance of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused the remains of most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in that most of his bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones. In the late 1950s, while the crypt was undergoing much-needed restoration, the bones were removed from it for the first time since their interment in 1089. A special Pontiffical Commission permitted Luigi Martino, a professor of human anatomy at the University of Bari, to examine the bones under the Commission's supervision. Martino took thousands of measurements, detailed scientific drawings, photographs, and x-rays. These examinations revealed the saint to have died at over seventy years of age and to have been of average height and slender-to-average build. He also suffered from severe chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis. In 2004, at the University of Manchester, researchers Caroline Wilkinson and Fraco Introna reconstructed the saint's face based on Martino's examination. The review of the data revealed that the historical Saint Nicholas was 5'6\\" in height and had a broken nose, which had partially healed, revealing that the injury had been suffered ante mortem. (navigate to 4th of 4 pictures) The broken nose appeared to conform with hagiographical reports that Saint Nicholas had been beaten and tortured during the Diocletianic Persecution. The facial reconstruction was produced by Dr. Caroline Wilkinson at the University of Manchester and was shown on a BBC2 TV program The Real Face of Santa. In 2014, the Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University produced an updated reconstruction of Saint Nicholas's face. In 2017, two researchers from Oxford University, Professor Tom Higham and Doctor Georges Kazan, radiocarbon dated a fragment of a pelvis claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas. The fragment originally came from a church in Lyons, France and, at the time of testing, was in the possession of Father Dennis O'Neill, a priest from St Martha of Bethany Church in Illinois. The results of the radiocarbon dating confirmed that the pelvis dates to the fourth century AD, around the same time that Saint Nicholas would have died, and is not a medieval forgery. The bone was one of the oldest the Oxford team had ever examined. According to Professor Higham, most of the relics the team has examined turn out to be too recent to have actually belonged to the saint to whom they are attributed, but he states, \\"This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself.\\" Doctor Kazan believes the pelvis fragment may come from the same individual as the skeleton divided between the churches in Bari and Venice, since the bone they tested comes from the left pubis, and the only pelvis bone in the collection at Bari is the left ilium. In the absence of DNA testing, however, it is not yet possible to know for certain whether the pelvis is from the same man.  Veneration and celebrations  Saint Nicholas (Uro≈° Prediƒá 1903) Among the Greeks and Italians he is a favorite of sailors, fishermen, ships and sailing. As a result and over time, he has become the patron saint of several cities which maintain harbours. In centuries of Greek folklore, Nicholas was seen as \\"The Lord of the Sea\\", often described by modern Greek scholars as a kind of Christianized version of Poseidon. In modern Greece, he is still easily among the most recognizable saints and 6 December finds many cities celebrating their patron saint. He is also the patron saint of all of Greece and particularly of the Hellenic Navy. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas's memory is celebrated on almost every Thursday of the year (together with the Apostles) with special hymns to him which are found in the liturgical book known as the Octoechos. Soon after the transfer of Saint Nicholas's relics from Myra to Bari, a Russian version of his Life and an account of the transfer of his relics were written by a contemporary to this event. Devotional akathists and canons have been composed in his honour, and are frequently chanted by the faithful as they ask for his intercession. He is mentioned in the Liturgy of Preparation during the Divine Liturgy (Eastern Orthodox Eucharist) and during the All-Night Vigil. Many Orthodox churches will have his icon, even if they are not named after him. In Oriental Orthodoxy, the Coptic Church observes the Departure of St. Nicholas on 10 Kiahk, or 10 Ta·∏´≈õa≈õ in Ethiopia, which corresponds to the Julian Calendar's 6 December and Gregorian Calendar's 19 December. Saint Nicholas depicted in a 14th-century English book of hours Nicholas had a reputation for secret gift- giving, such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him, a practice celebrated on his feast day, 6 December. For those who still observe the Julian calendar the celebration currently takes place thirteen days later than it happens in the Gregorian calendar and Revised Julian calendar. In Monaco, the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate was built from 1874 on the site of St Nicholas's church, founded in 1252. A children's Mass is still held on 6 December in the cathedral. In late medieval England, on Saint Nicholas Day parishes held Yuletide \\"boy bishop\\" celebrations. As part of this celebration, youths performed the functions of priests and bishops, and exercised rule over their elders. Today, Saint Nicholas is still celebrated as a great gift-giver in several Western European and Central European countries. According to one source, in medieval times nuns used the night of 6 December to deposit baskets of food and clothes anonymously at the doorsteps of the needy. According to another source, on 6 December every sailor or ex-sailor of the Low Countries (which at that time was virtually all of the male population) would descend to the harbour towns to participate in a church celebration for their patron saint. On the way back they would stop at one of the various Nicholas fairs to buy some hard-to-come-by goods, gifts for their loved ones and invariably some little presents for their children. While the real gifts would only be presented at Christmas, the little presents for the children were given right away, courtesy of Saint Nicholas. This and his miracle of him resurrecting the three butchered children made Saint Nicholas a patron saint of children and later students as well. Santa Claus evolved from Dutch traditions regarding Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas). When the Dutch established the colony of New Amsterdam, they brought the legend and traditions of Sinterklaas with them.Joe Wheeler & Jim Rosenthal, \\"St. Nicholas A Closer Look at Christmas\\", (Chapter 8), Nelson Reference & Electronic, 2005. Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlements of the Hudson Valley, although by the early nineteenth century had fallen by the way.Hageman, Howard G., 1979. \\"Review of Saint Nicholas of Myra, Bari, and Manhattan: Biography of a Legend\\", Theology Today, Princeton. Princeton Theological Seminary. vol. 36, issue 3 St. Nicholas Park, located at the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue and 127th Street, in an area originally settled by Dutch farmers, is named for St. Nicholas of Myra.  Iconography  Russian Orthodox statue of Saint Nicolas, now in a corner near the church in Demre Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of Russian merchants. Fresco by Dionisius from the Ferapontov Monastery. Saint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on countless Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image on the cover of the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410.Wheeler, Rosenthal, \\"St Nicholas: A Closer Look at Christmas\\", p. 96, Nelson Reference & Electronic, 2005. \\"Icon of Saint Nikola the Wonderworker\\", Moscow Governorate In depictions of Saint Nicholas from Bari, he is usually shown as dark-skinned, probably to emphasize his foreign origin. The emphasis on his foreignness may have been intended to enhance Bari's reputation by displaying that it had attracted the patronage of a saint from a far-off country. In Roman Catholic iconography, Saint Nicholas is depicted as a bishop, wearing the insignia of this dignity: a bishop's vestments, a mitre and a crozier. The episode with the three dowries is commemorated by showing him holding in his hand either three purses, three coins or three balls of gold. Depending on whether he is depicted as patron saint of children or sailors, his images will be completed by a background showing ships, children or three figures climbing out of a wooden barrel (the three slaughtered children he resurrected). In a strange twist, the three gold balls referring to the dowry affair are sometimes metaphorically interpreted as being oranges or other fruits. As in the Low Countries in medieval times oranges most frequently came from Spain, this led to the belief that the Saint lives in Spain and comes to visit every winter bringing them oranges, other 'wintry' fruits and tales of magical creatures.  Music  In 1948, Benjamin Britten completed a cantata, Saint Nicolas on a text by Eric Crozier which covers the saint's legendary life in a dramatic sequence of events. A tenor soloist appears as Saint Nicolas, with a mixed choir, boys singers, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion.

Production now takes place in Germany. The most prominent characteristic of the drink is small flakes of 23 karat gold suspended in it. The beverage also includes herbs and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, lavender, thyme, coriander and juniper, and has a syrupy texture. Alcoholic solutions were used by artists for gilding, which is believed to be the inspiration for the drink. Alchemy, which was at its high point in the late 16th century when Goldwasser appeared, held gold to have many desirable medical properties; while modern medicine disputes this, native gold is known to be non-toxic to humans and to pass through the digestive tract unchanged, unlike most other heavy metals. Since the flakes are extremely small and thin, the price is not prohibitive. When used as a food additive, Gold is labelled as E175; see List of food additives, Codex Alimentarius. The drink was invented by a Dutchman from De Lier, Ambrosius Vermeulen who became a citizen of Danzig on 6 July 1598. In 1704 Ambrosius' grandson Salomon Verm√∂llen and his brother-in-law Isaac Wed-Ling moved production to new premises located in the Breitgasse. At that time it was common for houses to use animal symbols instead of numbers, and the new factory featured a salmon () on the fa√ßade; hence the naming of the brand \\"Der Lachs zu Danzig\\". During his trip to Western Europe ‚Äî the so-called Grand Embassy ‚Äî Russian Tsar Peter I the Great visited the city of Danzig. He founded the official Russian consulate in Danzig and became a great lover of Danziger Goldwasser. He ordered permanent delivery of Goldwasser to Russia for himself. As the Free City of Danzig and East Prussia were separated from Germany after World War I by the Polish corridor, the Der Lachs company opened in 1922 an additional factory in Berlin to supply the main part of Germany and international markets with their products Danziger Goldwasser and Krambambuli from there. After 1945, when the city became part of Poland, only the Berlin factory continued to produce genuine Danziger Goldwasser. In 1971 Der Lachs was taken over by the Hardenberg-Wilthen distillery and production was moved to the town of N√∂rten-Hardenberg in West Germany. Original \\"Danziger Goldwasser Liqueur\\" by \\"Der Lachs Co.\\" containing gold leaf It is possible to buy the original brand of Danziger Goldwasser in the old town of Gdansk; however, it is not produced there but rather imported from N√∂rten-Hardenberg. The original Goldwasser distillery building, though not operational, has been rebuilt as it was before the war, and is now home to the exclusive restaurant \\"Pod ≈Åososiem\\" (The Salmon). Various Polish brands from Gda≈Ñsk sell similar drinks called Gda≈Ñska Z≈Çot√≥wka (Gda≈Ñsk gold) or Z≈Çota Woda (Gold water). Legend has it that when King Sigismund II Augustus visited Gda≈Ñsk in 1549 after his coronation, part of the city's homage to the monarch was a gift of Goldwasser, and he is said to have sung the praises of the golden drink often along the rest of his tour. Another brand of Goldwasser, Schwabacher Goldwasser, and other sorts of food embellished with gold, are produced in the city of Schwabach near Nuremberg. Goldschl√§ger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps which also contains small flakes of 22 karat gold. Goldwasser is used to flavour a traditional Souffl√© Rothschild.

It was established as axiomatic in anthropological research by Franz Boas in the first few decades of the 20th century and later popularized by his students. Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: \\"civilization is not something absolute, but...is relative, and...our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.\\"Boas, Franz. 1887. \\"Museums of Ethnology and their classification.\\" Science 9:589. However, Boas did not coin the term. The first use of the term recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary was by philosopher and social theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Robert Lowie's \\"extreme cultural relativism,\\" found in the latter's 1917 book Culture and Ethnology.Lowerie, Robert. 1917. Culture and Ethnology. New York: Douglas C. McMurtrie. The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any subspecies, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and race. Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims. Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific ethical stance is a matter of debate. In antiquity Herodotus (Histories 3.38) observes on the relativity of mores (ŒΩœåŒºŒøŒπ): He mentions an anecdote of Darius the Great who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the funeral customs of the Greeks and the Callatiae, peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced cremation and funerary cannibalism, respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribes' practices. The works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detail ancient Greek arguments for cultural relativism as part of the tenth of the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhnism I.xiv 145‚Äì63 As a methodological and heuristic device According to George E. Marcus and Michael M. J. Fischer:Marcus, George, and Michael M.J. Fischer. 1986. Anthropology as Cultural Critique: The Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 1. Cultural relativism was, in part, a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful. Franz Boas, originally trained in physics and geography, and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways. Boas understood \\"culture\\" to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion; he assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as:Boas, Franz. [1911] 1963. The Mind of Primitive Man. New York: Collier Books. p. 149. This view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture. The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies. As a methodological tool Between World War I and II, cultural relativism was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality, and salvage of non-Western cultures. It functioned to transform Boas' epistemology into methodological lessons. This is most obvious in the case of language. Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of Linguistic relativity). Thus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways. Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word green. When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for blue, others identify it using their word for yellow. Thus, Boas's student Melville Herskovits summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: \\"Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.\\" Boas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article, \\"On Alternating Sounds\\"Boas, Franz. 1889. \\"On Alternating Sounds.\\" American Anthropologist 2:47-53 A number of linguists at Boas' time had observed that speakers of some Native-American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas however noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single sound, but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas's student, the linguist Edward Sapir later noted that also English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound, for example few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter in the words tick and stick are phonetically different, the first being generally affricated and the other aspirated‚Äîa speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme. Boas's students drew not only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as Karl Pearson, Ernst Mach, Henri Poincar√©, William James and John Dewey in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas's student Robert Lowie, from \\"a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage\\" as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology. Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism. One such method is that of ethnography: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture. In this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities. Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, \\"Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole. The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.\\"Heyer, Virginia 1948 \\"In Reply to Elgin Williams\\" in American Anthropologist 50(1) 163-166 As a heuristic tool Another method was ethnology: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner. In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together‚Äîregardless of provenance. Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species. Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms. In an article in the journal Science, Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of Charles Darwin's main contributions to evolutionary theory: Boas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects.Boas, Franz 1887 \\"Museums of Ethnology and their Classification\\", in Science 9: 587-589. Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded: Boas's student Alfred Kroeber described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:Kroeber, Alfred. 1948. \\"Anthropology.\\" New York: Harcourt Brace. p. 11. This conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as sociology and psychology. Ruth Benedict, another of Boas's students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method. Her book, Patterns of Culture, did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that: Benedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal. In this context, cultural relativism is a heuristic device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity. As a critical device Marcus and Fischer's attention to anthropology's refusal to accept Western culture's claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique. This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment: The critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that \\"It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may seem to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence seem to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion.\\"Cook, John. 1978. \\"Cultural Relativism as an Ethnocentric Notion.\\" In The Philosophy of Society. Although Cook is misconstruing cultural relativism to be identical to moral relativism, his point still applies to the broader understanding of the term. Relativism does not mean that one's views are false, but it does mean that it is false to claim that one's views are self-evident. The critical function was indeed one of the ends to which Benedict hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is Margaret Mead's research of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable. As Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries. Comparison to moral relativism According to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood \\"more as a doctrine, or position, than as a method.\\" As a consequence, people misinterpreted cultural relativism to mean that all cultures are both separate and equal, and that all value systems, however different, are equally valid. Thus, people came to use the phrase \\"cultural relativism\\" erroneously to signify \\"moral relativism\\". People generally understand moral relativism to mean that there are no absolute or universal moral standards. The nature of anthropological research lends itself to the search for universal standards (standards found in all societies), but not necessarily absolute standards; nevertheless, people often confuse the two. In 1944 Clyde Kluckhohn (who studied at Harvard, but who admired and worked with Boas and his students) attempted to address this issue: Although Kluckholn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. \\"savage tribe\\") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful. There is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another. Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.  Vertical and horizontal relativism  It was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat, of the theoretical underpinnings of cultural relativism by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture. Vertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history (vertical‚Äîi.e., passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures' belief systems or societal practices must be firmly grounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future. Horizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present (horizontal in time‚Äîi.e., the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture's belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful. Statement on human rights The transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations in preparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Melville J. Herskovits prepared a draft \\"Statement on Human Rights\\" which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published. The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:Herskovits, Melville J. 1947. \\"Statement on Human Rights.\\" American Anthropologist 49(4):539‚Äì43. Although this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims: # Even where political systems exist that deny citizens the right of participation in their government, or seek to conquer weaker peoples, underlying cultural values may be called on to bring the peoples of such states to a realization of the consequences of the acts of their governments, and thus enforce a brake upon discrimination and conquest. # Worldwide standards of freedom and justice, based on the principle that man is free only when he lives as his society defines freedom, that his rights are those he recognizes as a member of his society, must be basic. These claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists. Julian Steward (who, as a student of Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, and as a professor at Columbia University, was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim \\"may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance\\", but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism:Steward, Julian. 1948. \\"Comments on the Statement of Human Rights.\\" American Anthropologist 50(2):351‚Äì52. > Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance > and conquest‚Äîpolitical and economic as well as military‚Äîin all their forms.\\" > Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that > anthropologists \\"approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste > system of the United States, or many other varieties of social > discrimination in the world. Steward and others argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance.Barnett, H. G. \\"On Science and Human Rights\\" in American Anthropologist 50(2) 352‚Äì355. June 1948. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals. Current debates The debates over the \\"Statement on Human Rights\\", then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal. It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non- anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non- anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations. Political scientist Alison Dundes Renteln has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism.Renteln, Alison 1988 \\"Relativism and the Search for Human Rights\\" in American Anthropologist 90(1) 56‚Äì72 Most philosophers understand the Benedictine‚ÄìHerskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean: Although this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: \\"there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures.\\"Schmidt, Paul. 1955. \\"Some Criticisms of Cultural Relativism.\\" Journal of Philosophy 52:780‚Äì91. Renteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: \\"the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture.\\" This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views: Renteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual's own culture. Post-colonial politics Boas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture. For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons. Political critique On the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, Stanley Diamond argued that when the term \\"cultural relativism\\" entered popular culture, popular culture co-opted anthropology in a way that voided the principle of any critical function: George Stocking summarized this view with the observation that \\"Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno- economic status of once colonized peoples.\\"Stocking, George W. Jr., 1982. \\"Afterward: A View from the Center\\" in Ethnos 47: 172‚Äì286 Defense by Clifford Geertz By the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, Clifford Geertz pointed out that the conservative critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn.Geertz, Clifford. 1984. \\"Anti-Anti-Relativism.\\" American Anthropologist 86(2):263‚Äì78. Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were talking past one another. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life. Geertz concludes this discussion by commenting, \\"As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world.\\" Geertz' defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment Alfred Kroeber made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:Kroeber, Alfred. 1949. \\"An Authoritarian Panacea.\\" American Anthropologist 51(2):318‚Äì20.  Governmental usage  Several countries have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite the World Conference on Human Rights rejecting it as a refugee of human rights violations. A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the Universal Periodic Reviews, distinguishes several different groups of nations:Blackburn, Roger Lloret.

Mere statements which are contrary to one's beliefs do not constitute intolerance. Religious intolerance, rather, occurs when a group (e.g., a society, a religious group, a non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate one's practices, persons or beliefs on religious grounds. Historical perspectives The intolerance, and even the active persecution of religious minorities (sometimes religious majorities as in modern Bahrain or the Pre-Dutch Indonesian kingdoms), has a long history. Not one region of Earth has been spared from having a past which was filled with religious intolerance. The modern concept of religious tolerance developed out of the European wars of religion, more specifically out of the Peace of Westphalia which ended the 30 Years War (1618 - 1648), during the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in the 17th and 18th centuries. The doctrine of 'religious toleration' was established as a result of the 30 Years War between the Catholic Hapsburgs and newly Protestant nations like Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus. At this time, rulers sought to eradicate religious sentiments and dogmas from their political demesnes. The 1648 Treaty gave nations the right of sovereignty and it also allowed minority Christian denominations to exist within the Holy Roman Empire. According to the early 20th century British historian Arnold Toynbee, for a religious establishment to persecute another religion for being \\"wrong\\" ironically puts the persecuting religion in the wrong, undermining its own legitimacy. Contemporary attitude and practice A statue of the Buddha at Bamiyan before and after its March 2001 destruction by Taliban forces The constitutions of some countries contain provisions which expressly forbid the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance and these same provisions also forbid the state from showing a preference for a particular religion within its own borders, examples of such provisions include the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Article 4 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Article 44.2.1 of the Constitution of Ireland, Article 40 of the Estonian Constitution,\\"Estonia ‚Äì Constitution\\", ICL Document 28 June 1992, retrieved 25 May 2007.

These constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country. Mughal Emperor Babur demolished Gopalchal rock cut Jain Monuments Other countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more state religions, but not for religious intolerance. Finland, for example, has the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and Finnish Orthodox Church as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its constitution. Some countries retain laws which forbid the defamation of religious beliefs. Some constitutions retain laws which forbid all forms of blasphemy (e.g., Germany where, in 2006, Manfred van H. was convicted of blasphemy against Islam). This is seen by some as official endorsement of religious intolerance, amounting to the criminalization of religious views. The connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws is closest when the laws apply to only one religion. In Pakistan blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the Qur'an or the Prophet Mohammed is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. Apostasy, the rejection of one's old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably Afghanistan with Abdul Rahman being the first to face the death penalty for converting to Christianity. The United Nations upholds the right to freely express one‚Äôs religious beliefs, as listed in the UN‚Äôs charter, and additionally in articles 2 and 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 2 forbids discrimination based on religious grounds. Article 18 protects the freedom to change one‚Äôs religion. As a treaty, not a declaration, is legally binding, the signing of the human rights declaration is a public pledge of commitment. Out of a desire to avoid subservience to an international court, the United States chose in 1998 to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the Commission on International Religious Freedom, and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\"International Religious Freedom Act of 1998\\" , 27 January 1998, retrieved 25 May 2007. Human Rights Council in 2011 adopted Resolution 16/18 on \\"Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief\\" which was hailed by stakeholders from all regions and faiths as a turning point in international efforts to confront religious intolerance. The European Convention on Human Rights, which is legally binding on all European Union states (following the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the United Kingdom), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14. In its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. State Department cited China, Myanmar, Iran, Iraq and Sudan for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices. The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the U.S. State Department.\\"United States Commission on International Freedom of Religion\\" , Press Releases 2000, retrieved 25 May 2007. The advocacy group Freedom House produced a report entitled \\"Religious Freedom in the World\\" in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were Turkmenistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea. China was given a score of 6 overall, however Tibet was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States. Within those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of cannabis by members of the Rastafari movement, the religious use of eagle feathers by non-Native Americans (contrary to the eagle feather law, 50 CFR 22), or the practice of polygamy amongst the LDS Church in the 19th century.\\"Official Declaration\\", Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 October 1890, retrieved 25 May 2007.  In Australia  Religious freedom has developed partly due to the agreeable relationship between religious groups in its society. Several non- governmental organizations promoted tolerance and better understanding among religions in the country, both indigenous and non-indigenous. These groups included the Columbian Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations, the National Council of Churches in Australia and its affiliated Aboriginal and Islander Commission, and the Australian Council of Christians and Jews. In Victoria, Australia the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 makes illegal \\"conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons\\" on the grounds of religious belief. In 2003, in response to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiment, the HREOC undertook a project involving national consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim citizens. As part of the consultations, the commission considered whether Muslim citizens shared an ethnic origin or race, as well as a religion, which would entitle them to comprehensive protection under the Federal Race Discrimination Act. The commission's report, made public in June 2004, contained no findings on the racial status of Arab and Muslim citizens. In January 2005 the leader of the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement was connected to incidents in 2004 in which several Asian-owned businesses and a synagogue in Perth were firebombed or sprayed with racist graffiti. On December 11, 2005, there was a riot in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, that erupted because a group of Lebanese-Australian youths had assaulted two lifeguards. Demonstrators against the assault displayed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. When the gathering turned violent, bystanders perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin or Muslim were attacked. The following day, retaliatory vandalism and other assaults were reported around Sydney.

It is typically created by women for women and is distinct from homoerotic media marketed to gay and bisexual male audiences, such as bara, but it can also attract male readers and male creators can also produce it. It spans a wide range of media, including manga, anime, drama CDs, novels, games, films, and fan production. Boys' love and its abbreviation, BL, are the generic terms for this kind of media in Japan and have, in recent years, become more commonly used in English as well. However, yaoi remains more generally prevalent in English. A defining characteristic of yaoi is the practice of pairing characters in relationships according to the roles of seme, the sexual top or active pursuer, and uke, the sexual bottom or passive pursued. Common themes in yaoi include forbidden relationships, depictions of rape, tragedy, and humor. Yaoi and BL stories cover a diverse range of genres such as high school love comedy, period drama, science fiction and fantasy, and detective fiction, and include sub-genres such as omegaverse and shotacon. Yaoi finds its origins in both fan culture and commercial publishing. As James Welker has summarized, the term yaoi dates back to d≈çjinshi culture of the late 1970s to early 1980s where, as a portmanteau of yamanashi ochinashi iminashi (\\"no climax, no point, no meaning\\"), it was a self-deprecating way to refer to amateur fan works that parodied mainstream manga and anime by depicting the male characters from popular series in vaguely or explicitly sexual situations and in the manga they are often explicitly shown. The use of yaoi to refer to parody d≈çjinshi is still predominant in Japan. In commercial publishing, the genre can be traced back to sh≈çnen-ai, a genre of beautiful boy manga that began to appear in sh≈çjo manga magazines in the early 1970s. From the 1970s to 1980s, other terms such as tanbi and jun√© emerged to refer to specific developments in the genre. In the early 1990s, however, these terms were largely eclipsed with the commercialization of male-male homoerotic media under the label of boys' love. Yaoi has a robust global presence. Yaoi works are available across the continents in various languages both through international licensing and distribution and through circulation by fans. Yaoi works, culture, and fandom have also been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide. History and general terminology The genre currently known as boys' love, BL, or yaoi derives from two sources. Female authors writing for sh≈çjo (girl's) manga magazines in the early 1970s published stories featuring platonic relationships between young boys, which were known as or . In the late 1970s going into the 1980s, women and girls in the d≈çjinshi (fan fiction) markets of Japan started to produce sexualized parodies of popular sh≈çnen (boy's) manga and anime stories in which the male characters were recast as gay lovers. By the end of the 1970s, magazines devoted to the nascent genre started to appear, and in the 1990s the term \\"boys' love\\" or \\"BL\\" would be invented and would become the dominant term used for the genre in Japan. Although yaoi derives from girl's and women's manga and still targets the sh≈çjo and josei demographics, it is currently considered a separate category.Thorn, Rachel Matt What Sh√¥jo Manga Are and Are Not ‚Äì A Quick Guide for the Confused Keiko Takemiya's manga serial Kaze to Ki no Uta, first published in 1976, was groundbreaking in its depictions of \\"openly sexual relationships\\" between men, spurring the development of the boys' love genre in sh≈çjo manga,Toku, Masami (2007) \\"Shojo Manga!

Turku: International Institute Prior to the popularization of the term yaoi, material in the nascent genre was called , a name derived from June, a magazine that published male-male tanbi romances which took its name from the homoerotic stories of the French writer Jean Genet. In China, the term danmei is used, which is derived from tanbi. The term \\"bish≈çnen manga\\" was used in the 1970s, but fell from favor in the 1990s when manga in this genre began to feature a broader range of protagonists beyond the traditional adolescent boys. In Japan, the term jun√© would die out in favor of \\"boys' love\\", which remains the most common name in Japan. Mizoguchi suggests that publishers wishing to get a foothold in the jun√© market coined \\"boys' love\\" to disassociate the genre from the publisher of June. While yaoi has become an umbrella term in the West for women's manga or Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships, and it is the term preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind, Japan uses the term yaoi to denote d≈çjinshi and works that focus on sex scenes. In both usages, yaoi / boys' love excludes gei comi (bara), a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships, but is written for and mostly by gay men. In the West, the term hentai yaoi is sometimes used to denote the most explicit titles. The use of yaoi to denote those works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western writers or between Western fans who insist on proper usage of the Japanese terms and those who use the Westernized versions. Yaoi can also be used by Western fans as a label for anime or manga-based slash fiction.Aquila, Meredith (2007) \\"Ranma 1/2 Fan Fiction Writers: New Narrative Themes or the Same Old Story? \\" Mechademia 2 p.39 In Japan, the term yaoi is occasionally written as \\"801\\", which can be read as yaoi through Japanese wordplay: the short reading of the number eight is \\"ya\\", zero can be read as \\"o\\" (a Western influence), while the short reading for one is \\"i\\". Concepts Sh≈çnen-ai The term sh≈çnen-ai (\\"boy love\\") originally connoted ephebophilia or pederasty in Japan, but from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, was used to describe a new genre of sh≈çjo manga, primarily produced by the Year 24 Group of women authors, about beautiful boys in love. Characteristics of sh≈çnen-ai include exoticism, often taking place in Europe, and idealism.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p.250 , . Jeffrey Angles particularly notes Moto Hagio's The Heart of Thomas (1974) and Keiko Takemiya's Kaze to Ki no Uta (1976‚Äì1984) as being groundbreaking, noting their portrayal of intense friendship between males, including jealousy and desire. The origin of sh≈çnen-ai is thought to come through two pathways. Mizoguchi traces the tales back to the tanbi romances of Mori Mari. The term tanbi was used for stories written for and about the worship of beauty, and romance between older men and beautiful youths using particularly flowery language and unusual kanji (Chinese characters appropriated into Japanese script). Mori Mari in , considered \\"the first work of [yaoi]\\",Pagliassotti, Dru (November 2008) 'Reading Boys' Love in the West' Particip@tions Volume 5, Issue 2 Special Edition used such unusual kanji for her characters' names that she converted to spelling their names in katakana, a script used to transcribe foreign words.Vincent, Keith (2007) \\"A Japanese Electra and Her Queer Progeny \\" Mechademia 2 pp. 64‚Äì79 The word was originally used to describe an author's distinctive style, for example, the styles of Yukio Mishima and Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki. Akiko Mizoguchi describes its application to male-male stories as \\"misleading\\", but notes \\"it was the most commonly used term in the early 1990s.\\" According to James Welker, Minori Ishida shows that \\"early boys' love narratives\\" were inspired by European fiction about \\"beautiful boys\\", and the writing of the male author Taruho Inagaki. Carola Bauer cites the bildungsroman genre as having influenced sh≈çnen-ai. Kazuko Suzuki describes sh≈çnen-ai as being \\"pedantic\\" and \\"difficult to understand\\", saying that they required \\"knowledge of classic literature, history and science\\" and were replete with \\"philosophical and abstract musings\\". Sh≈çnen-ai challenged young readers, who were often only able to understand the references and deeper themes as they grew older and instead were initially drawn to the figure of the male protagonist.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p.251 , . Galbraith defines sh≈çnen-ai as \\"original content that can approach serious literature in tone and theme\\", as opposed to a more light-hearted yaoi. By the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published sh≈çnen-ai was declining, and d≈çjinshi (self-published) yaoi was becoming more popular. The terms yaoi and sh≈çnen-ai are sometimes used by Western fans to differentiate between two variants of the genre. In this case, yaoi is used to describe titles that primarily feature sexually explicit themes and sex scenes, while sh≈çnen-ai is used to describe titles that focus primarily on romance and omit explicit sexual content, although sexual acts may be implied. According to this use of the terms, Gravitation would be considered sh≈çnen-ai due to its focus on the characters' careers rather than their love life. Seme and uke Artwork depicting a seme (left) and uke (right) couple The two participants in a yaoi relationship (and to a lesser extent in yuri)Aoki, Deb (3 March 2007) Interview: Erica Friedman ‚Äì Page 2 \\"Because the dynamic of the seme/uke is so well known, it's bound to show up in yuri. ... In general, I'm going to say no. There is much less obsession with pursued/pursuer in yuri manga than there is in yaoi.\\" are often referred to as and . These terms originated in martial arts: seme derives from the ichidan verb \\"to attack\\", while uke is taken from the verb \\"to receive\\" and is used in Japanese gay slang to mean the receptive partner (\\"bottom\\") in anal sex. Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes same-sex love between samurai and their companions. The seme and uke are often drawn in the bish≈çnen style and are \\"highly idealised\\", blending both masculine and feminine qualities. Zanghellini suggests that the samurai archetype is responsible for \\"the 'hierarchical' structure and age difference\\" of some relationships portrayed in yaoi and boys' love. The seme is often depicted as the stereotypical male of anime and manga culture: restrained, physically powerful, and protective. The seme is generally older and taller,Camper, Cathy (2006) Yaoi 101: Girls Love \\"Boys' Love\\". with a stronger chin, shorter hair, smaller eyes, and a more stereotypically masculine, and \\"macho\\"Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p. 253 , . demeanour than the uke. The seme usually pursues the uke, who often has softer, androgynous, feminine features with bigger eyes and a smaller build, and is often physically weaker than the seme.Jones, V. E. \\"He Loves Him, She Loves Them: Japanese comics about gay men are increasingly popular among women\\" . Boston.com. April 2005. Another way the seme and uke characters are shown is through who is dominant in the relationship; a character can take the uke role even if he is not presented as feminine, simply by being juxtaposed against and pursued by a more dominant, more masculine, character.Sihombing, Febriani (2011). \\"On The Iconic Difference between Couple Characters in Boys Love Manga \\". Image & Narrative 12 (1) Although not the same, a yaoi construct similar to \\"seme and uke\\" is the concept of \\"tachi and neko\\". This archetypal pairing is referenced more often in older yaoi volumes; in modern yaoi, this pairing is often seen as already encompassed by seme and uke or simply unnecessary to address. The partner is conceptualized as the member of the relationship who pursues the more passive partner, the latter of whom is referred to as the . Seme and uke is similar but not identical to tachi and neko because the former refers primarily to sexual roles, whereas the latter describes personality. Although seme and uke roles are already used in some manga to describe which member of the relationship is more dominant and which member is more passive, there are just as many manga novels which subtly or overtly differentiate between the two. Anal sex is a prevalent theme in yaoi, as nearly all stories feature it in some way. The storyline where an uke is reluctant to have anal sex with a seme is considered to be similar to the reader's reluctance to have sexual contact with someone for the first time.Avila, K. \\"Boy's Love and Yaoi Revisited\\" . Sequential Tart. January 2005. Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than \\"doggy style\\". Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely fellates the seme, but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the seme. Though these tropes are common in yaoi, not all works adhere to them. Carola Bauer states that the \\"butch-femme\\" couple dynamic discussed above became essential in the commercially published fiction of the 1990s. McLelland says that authors are \\"interested in exploring, not repudiating\\" the dynamics between the seme and uke.McLelland, Mark. The World of Yaoi: The Internet, Censorship and the Global \\"Boys' Love\\" Fandom The Australian Feminist Law Journal, 2005. The possibility of switching roles is often a source of playful teasing and sexual excitement for the characters, indicating an interest among many genre authors in exploring the \\"performative nature\\" of the roles. Sometimes the bottom character will be the aggressor in the relationship, or the pair will switch their sexual roles.Manry, Gia. (16 April 2008) It's A Yaoi Thing: Boys Who Love Boys and the Women Who Love Them The Escapist , a contraction of the English word \\"reversible\\", is used to describe a couple that yaoi fans think is still plausible when the partners switch their seme and uke roles. In another common mode of characters, the author will forgo the stylisations of the seme and uke, and will portray both lovers as \\"equally attractive handsome men\\". In this case, whichever of the two who is ordinarily in charge will take the passive role during sex. Bara Although sometimes conflated with yaoi by Western commentators, gay men's manga or gei comi, also called \\"men's love\\" (\\"ML\\") in English and bara in Japan, caters to a gay male audience rather than a female one and tends to be produced primarily by gay and bisexual male artists (such as Gengoroh Tagame) and serialized in gay men's magazines. Bara is a smaller niche genre in Japan than yaoi manga. Considered a subgenre of seijin (men's erotica) for gay males, bara more closely resembles comics for men (seinen) rather than comics written for female readers (sh≈çjo/josei). Few titles have been licensed or scanlated for English-language markets. Bara does not aim to recreate the heteronormative gender roles between the masculine seme and feminine uke types prominent in yaoi that is generally for a female audience. Gay men's manga is unlikely to contain scenes of \\"uncontrollable weeping or long introspective pauses\\", and is less likely than yaoi to \\"build up a strong sense of character\\" before sex scenes occur. The men in bara comics are more likely to be stereotypically masculine in behaviour and are illustrated as \\"hairy, very muscular, or [having] a few excess pounds\\" akin to beefcakes or bears in gay culture. While bara usually features gay romanticism and adult content, sometimes of a violent or exploitative nature, it often explores real-world or autobiographical themes and acknowledges the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. The gachi muchi (\\"muscley-chubby\\") subgenre of boys' love, also termed bara among English-speaking fans, represents a crossover between bara and yaoi, with considerable overlap of writers, artists and art styles. This emergent boys' love subgenre, while still marketed primarily to women, depicts more masculine body types and is more likely to be written by gay male authors and artists; it is also thought to attract a large crossover gay male audience. Prior to the development of gachi muchi, the greatest overlap between yaoi and bara authors was in BDSM-themed publications such as Zettai Reido, a yaoi anthology magazine which had a number of openly male contributors. Several female yaoi authors who have done BDSM-themed yaoi have been recruited to contribute stories to BDSM-themed bara anthologies or special issues. Thematic elements Diminished female characters Female characters often have very minor roles in yaoi, or are absent altogether. Suzuki notes that mothers in particular are portrayed in a negative light, for instance in Zetsuai 1989 in which the main character as a child witnesses his mother murdering his father. Suzuki suggests this is because the character and reader alike are seeking to substitute the absence of unconditional maternal love with the \\"forbidden\\" all-consuming love presented in yaoi.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, pp. 259‚Äì260 , .

Guys on Guys for Girls ‚Äì Yaoi and Shounen Ai . Sequential Tart. Yukari Fujimoto states of sh≈çnen manga series used as inspiration for yaoi that \\"it seems that yaoi readings and likeable female characters are mutually exclusive.\\" Early sh≈çnen- ai and yaoi have been regarded as misogynistic, but Lunsing notes a decrease in misogynistic comments from characters and regards the development of the yuri genre as reflecting a reduction of internal misogyny. Alternatively, yaoi fandom is also viewed as a \\"refuge\\" from mainstream culture, which in this paradigm is viewed as inherently misogynistic. In recent years, it has become more popular to have a female character supporting the couple. Yaoi author Fumi Yoshinaga usually includes at least one sympathetic female character in her works. There are many female characters in yaoi who are fujoshi themselves. Gay equality Yaoi stories are often strongly homosocial, which gives the men freedom to bond with each other and to pursue shared goals together, as in dojinshi representations of Captain Tsubasa, or to rival each other, as in Haru wo Daiteita. This spiritual bond and equal partnership overcomes the male-female power hierarchy. To be together, many couples depicted in conventional yaoi stories must overcome obstacles that are often emotional or psychological rather than physical. The theme of the protagonists' victory in yaoi has been compared favourably to Western fairy tales, as the latter intends to enforce the status quo, but yaoi is \\"about desire\\" and seeks \\"to explore, not circumscribe, possibilities\\".McHarry, Mark. (2006) \\"Yaoi\\" in Ga√´tan Brulotte and John Phillips (eds.). Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature. New York: Routledge, pp. 1445‚Äì1447. Akiko Mizoguchi noted that while homosexuality is sometimes still depicted as \\"shameful\\" to heighten dramatic tension, yaoi has increasingly featured stories of coming out and the characters' gradual acceptance within the wider community, such as Brilliant Blue. Mizoguchi remarked that yaoi presents a far more gay-friendly depiction of Japanese society, which she contends is a form of activism among yaoi authors. Some longer-form stories, such as FAKE and Kizuna, depict the couple moving in together and adopting.Salek, Rebecca (June 2005) More Than Just Mommy and Daddy: \\"Nontraditional\\" Families in Comics Sequential Tart Although gay male characters are empowered in yaoi manga, the manga rarely explicitly addresses the reality of homophobia in Japanese society. According to Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for Libre Publishing, while earlier yaoi focused \\"more on the homosexual way of life from a realistic perspective\\", over time the genre has become less realistic and more comedic, and the stories are \\"simply for entertainment\\". Yaoi manga often have fantastical, historical or futuristic settings, and many fans consider the genre to be an \\"escapist fantasy\\".Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) \\"Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women\\" in Linda Williams ed. Porn Studies. Duke University Press p. 86 Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all,Masaki, Lyle. (6 January 2008) \\"Yowie!\\": The Stateside appeal of boy-meets-boy YAOI comics AfterElton.com is used as a plot device to \\"heighten the drama\\", or to show the purity of the leads' love. Rachel Thorn has suggested that readers of the yaoi genre, which primarily features romantic narratives, may be turned off by strong political themes such as homophobia. Makoto Tateno stated her scepticism that a focus on real gay issues will \\"[become] a trend, because girls like fiction more than realism\\". Alan Williams argues that the lack of a gay identity in yaoi is due to yaoi being postmodernist. Rape Rape fantasy is a theme commonly found in yaoi manga. Anal intercourse is understood as a means of expressing commitment to a partner, and in yaoi, the \\"apparent violence\\" of rape is transformed into a \\"measure of passion\\". While Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the yaoi genre depicts men who are raped as still \\"imbued with innocence\\" and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with Kaze to Ki no Uta.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, pp. 257‚Äì258 , . Rape scenes in yaoi are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a seme rapes an uke are not depicted as symptomatic of the \\"disruptive sexual/violent desires\\" of the seme, but instead are a signifier of the \\"uncontrollable love\\" felt by a seme for an uke. Such scenes are often a plot device used to make the uke see the seme as more than just a good friend and typically result in the uke falling in love with the seme. Rape fantasy themes explore the protagonist's lack of responsibility in sex, leading to the narrative climax of the story, where \\"the protagonist takes responsibility for his own sexuality\\". The 2003‚Äì2005 manga series Under Grand Hotel, set in a men's prison, has been praised for showing a more realistic depiction of rape.Under Grand Hotel Vol. #01 - Mania.com Authors such as Fusanosuke Inariya (of Maiden Rose fame) utilize rape not as the traditional romantic catalyst, but as a tragic dramatic plot element, rendering her stories a subversion of contemporary tropes that reinforce and reflect older tropes such as the prevalence of romantic tragedy themes. Other yaoi tend to depict a relationship that begins as non-consensual and evolves into a consensual relationship. However, Fusanosuke's stories are ones where the characters' relationship begins as consensual and devolves into non-consensual, often due to external societal pressures that label the character's gay relationship as deviant. Her stories are still characterized by fantasy, yet they do brutally and realistically illustrate scenes of sexual assault between characters.Frennea, Melissa.

By the mid-1990s the fashion was for happy endings. When tragic endings are shown, the cause is not infidelity, but \\"the cruel and intrusive demands of an uncompromising outside world\\".McLelland, Mark (2000) \\"The love between 'beautiful boys' in women's comics\\" p. 69 Male Homosexuality in Modern Japan: Cultural Myths and Social Realities Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press Publishing Books on display at a San Francisco Kinokuniya bookstore Japan As of 1990, seven Japanese publishers included BL content in their offerings, which kickstarted the commercial publishing market of the genre. By 2003, 3.8% of weekly manga magazines were dedicated to BL. A 2008 assessment estimated that the Japanese commercial yaoi market grossed approximately 12 billion yen annually, with novel sales generating 250 million yen per month, manga generating 400 million yen per month, CDs generating 180 million yen per month, and video games generating 160 million yen per month. As of this time, magazines for BL included BE-BOY, GUSH, CHARA and CIEL. A 2010 report estimated that the yaoi market was worth approximately 21.3 billion yen in both 2009 and 2010. Besides manga and anime, there are also boys' love (BL) games (also known as yaoi games), usually consisting of visual novels or H games oriented around male homosexual couples for the female market. The defining factor is that both the playable character(s) and possible objects of affection are male. As with yaoi manga, the major market is assumed to be female. Games aimed at a homosexual male audience may be referred to as bara. A 2006 breakdown of the Japanese commercial BL market estimated it grosses approximately 12 billion yen annually, with video games generating 160 million yen per month. English-speaking countries Yaoi manga are sold to English-speaking countries by companies that translate and print them in English. Companies such as Digital Manga Publishing with their imprints 801 Media (for explicit yaoi) and Jun√© (for \\"romantic and sweet\\" yaoi),Strickland, Elizabeth. \\"Drawn Together.\\" The Village Voice. 2 November 2006. as well as Kitty Media, and Viz Media under their imprint SuBLime. Companies that formerly published yaoi manga but are now defunct include DramaQueen, Central Park Media's Be Beautiful, Tokyopop under their BLU imprint, Broccoli under their Boysenberry imprint, and Aurora Publishing under their Deux Press imprint. Yaoi Press, based in Las Vegas and specializing in yaoi that is not of Japanese origin, remains active. According to McLelland, the earliest officially translated English-language yaoi manga was printed in 2003, and as of 2006 there were about 130 English-translated works commercially available. In March 2007, Media Blasters stopped selling sh≈çnen manga and increased their yaoi lines in anticipation of publishing one or two titles per month that year.Cha, Kai-Ming (13 March 2007) Media Blasters Drops Shonen; Adds Yaoi Publishers Weekly Among the 135 yaoi manga published in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up. Although American booksellers were increasingly stocking yaoi titles in 2008, their restrictions led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in shrinkwrap. Diamond Comic Distributors valued the sales of yaoi manga in the United States at approximately $US six million in 2007.Cha, Kai-Ming (10 August 2008) Brokeback comics craze San Francisco Chronicle By December 2007, there were over 10 publishers in North America offering yaoi materials.Butcher, Christopher (11 December 2007). \\"Queer love manga style\\" . Xtra!. Only a select few yaoi games have been officially translated into English. In 2006, JAST USA announced they would be releasing Enzai as Enzai: Falsely Accused, the first license of a yaoi game in English translation. Some fan communities have criticized the choice of such a dark and unromantic game as the US market's first exposure to the genre. JAST USA subsequently licensed Zettai Fukujuu Meirei under the title Absolute Obedience, while Hirameki International licensed Animamundi; the later game, although already nonexplicit, was censored for US release to achieve a \\"mature\\" rather than \\"adults only\\" rating, removing some of both the sexual and the violent content. The lack of interest by publishers in licensing further titles has been attributed to widespread copyright infringement of both licensed and unlicensed games. Marketing was significant in the transnational travel of yaoi from Japan to United States. Due to earlier marketing efforts by distributors, yaoi has attracted a following of gay male fans in the United States. Kizuna (1994) was described by Phoenix-based distributor Ariztical Entertainment that specializes in LGBT films as \\"the first gay male anime to be released on DVD in the US\\" to market it to the gay male audience. Furthermore, a review of Kizuna was ran in an issue of the prominent American LGBT magazine The Advocate, released on 4 February 1997. The review, written by Cathay Che, noted that Kizuna was \\"the first sh≈çnen-ai animated series ... distributed by mail order through the gay-owned company Phoenix Distributors.\\"Che, Cathay. \\"Catoon Comes Out: Kizuna Volume 1 and 2.\\" The Advocate 726. 4 February 1997: p. 66. Che also described the two-episode OVA series to be \\"as accessible as the usual gay art house film is eccentric and experimental\\", tying the animated series to the larger gay media library. Fan fiction  The Japanese fan fiction (d≈çjinshi) subculture emerged contemporaneously with its English equivalent in the 1970s. Characteristic similarities of fan fiction in both countries include non-adherence to a standard \\"narrative structure\\" and a particular popularity of science fiction themes. The early yaoi d≈çjinshi were amateur publications not controlled by media restrictions. The stories were written by teenagers for an adolescent audience and were generally based on manga or anime characters who were likewise in their teens or early twenties. Most d≈çjinshi are created by amateurs who often work in \\"circles\\".Ishikawa, Yu (2008) Yaoi: Fan Art in Japan (PDF) in Compilation of papers and seminar proceedings - Comparative Studies on Urban Cultures, 17‚Äì19 September 2008, Osaka City University, pp.37-42 The International School Office, Graduate School of Literature and Human Sciences, Osaka City University. Accessed 9 December 2014. The group CLAMP began as an amateur d≈çjinshi circle who worked together to create Saint Seiya parodies. Certain professional artists such as Kodaka Kazuma also create d≈çjinshi. Some publishing companies reviewed d≈çjinshi manga published in the 1980s to identify talented amateurs, leading to the discovery of Youka Nitta and numerous other artists.O'Connell, M. \\"Embracing Yaoi Manga: Youka Nitta\\" . Sequential Tart. April 2006. This practice lessened in the 1990s, but was still used to find Shungiku Nakamura. Typical yaoi d≈çjinshi features male-male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of the material derives from male-oriented sh≈çnen and seinen works which contain close male-male friendships and are perceived by fans to imply elements of homoeroticism, such as with Captain Tsubasa and Saint Seiya, two titles which popularized yaoi in the 1980s. Weekly Shonen Jump is known to have a large female readership who engage in yaoi readings. Publishers of sh≈çnen manga may create \\"homoerotic- themed\\" merchandise as fan service to their BL fans.McHarry, Mark (2011). (Un)gendering the homoerotic body: Imagining subjects in boys' love and yaoi Transformative Works and Cultures Comiket's co-founder Yoshihiro Yonezawa described d≈çjinshi as akin to \\"girls playing with dolls\\"; yaoi fans may ship any male-male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or creating a story about two original male characters and incorporating established characters into the story. Any male character may become the subject of a yaoi d≈çjinshi, including characters from non-manga titles such as Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings,Granick, Jennifer (16 August 2006) Harry Potter Loves Malfoy Wired.com video games such as Kingdom Hearts Overwatch and Final Fantasy,Kingdom Hearts aestheticism.com or real people such as politicians. Amateur authors may also create characters out of personifications of abstract concepts (such as the personification of countries in Hetalia: Axis Powers) or complementary objects like salt and pepper.Galbraith, Patrick W. (31 October 2009) Moe: Exploring Virtual Potential in Post-Millennial Japan In Japan, the labelling of yaoi d≈çjinshi is typically composed of the two lead characters' names, separated by a multiplication sign, with the seme being first and the uke being second.Toku, Masami (6 June 2002) Interview with Mr. Sagawa While Gundam Wing does not have explicit gay romance content, its first airing in North America via Cartoon Network in 2000, five years after its initial broadcast in Japan, was crucial to Western fan creation of yaoi fiction, as noted by McHarry in his article that performs a reading of \\"Western yaoi story\\" with ideas of gender theorists such as Judith Butler and Eve Sedgewick.McHarry, Mark. \\"Identity Unmoored: Yaoi in the West.\\" Queer Popular Culture: Literature, Media, Film and Television, ed. Thomas Peele. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, p. 193. As yaoi fanfiction has so often been compared to the Western fan practice of slash, it is important to understand the subtle differences between them. Levi notes that \\"the youthful teen look that so easily translates into androgyny in boys' love manga, and allows for so many layered interpretations of sex and gender, is much harder for slash writers to achieve.\\"Levi, Antonia. \\"Introduction.\\" Boy‚Äôs Love Manga: Essays on the Sexual Ambiguity and Cross- Cultural Fandom of the Genre, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc. Publishers, 2008, p. 3. Regardless, the similarities and connections between yaoi and slash fan fictions should not be overlooked given the profound intersections between the two fan subcultures, as revealed by the multitude of Harry Potter-inspired slash fictions and dojinshi. Yaoi-inspired works outside Japan As yaoi gained popularity in the United States, a few American artists began creating original English-language manga for female readers featuring male-male couples referred to as \\"American yaoi\\". The first known original English-language yaoi comic is Sexual Espionage #1 by Daria McGrain, published in May 2002.Pagliassotti, Dru (2 June 2008) Yaoi Timeline: Spread Through U.S. Since approximately 2004, what started as a small subculture in North America has become a burgeoning market, as new publishers began producing female-oriented male-male erotic comics and manga from creators outside Japan. Because creators from all parts of the globe are published in these works, the term \\"American yaoi\\" fell out of use and were replaced by terms like \\"original English language yaoi\\" and \\"Global Yaoi\\". The term \\"Global Yaoi\\" or \\"Global BL\\" was coined by creators and newsgroups that wanted to distinguish the Asian specific content known as yaoi, from the original English content. Global BL was shortened by comics author Tina Anderson in interviews and on her blog to the acronym \\"GloBL\\". High-Volume North American publishers of Global BL are Yaoi Press, which continues to release illustrated fiction written by the companies CEO, Yamila Abraham under the imprint Yaoi Prose. Prior publishers include DramaQueen, which debuted its Global BL quarterly anthology RUSH in 2006, and Iris Print, both ceased publishing due to financial issues. In 2015, \\"Tweek x Craig\\", a season 19 episode of the American animation series South Park, centered upon the eponymous characters objecting to being depicted by their female schoolmates in yaoi-themed illustrations. In 2009, Germany saw a period of GloBL releases, with a handful of original German titles gaining popularity for being set in Asia. Some publishers of German GloBL were traditional manga publishers like Carlsen Manga, and small press publishers specializing in GloBL like The Wild Side and Fireangels Verlag. Other successful series in GloBL include web comics Teahouse, Starfighter, Purpurea Noxa, and In These Words from artist Jo Chen's studio Guilt Pleasure, all three of which were also promoted by Digital Manga Publishing. Yaoi is known as danmei (), which is the Mandarin reading of the Japanese term tanbi, in Sinophone contexts. The first appearance of danmei in China could be traced back to 1998 under the influence of yaoi culture.Xu, Yanrui, and Ling Yang. \\"Forbidden love: incest, generational conflict, and the erotics of power in Chinese BL fiction.\\" Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics 4 no. 1, 2013. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21504857.2013.771378 However, state regulations in China make it difficult for danmei writers to publish their works online. In January 2009, the National Publishing Administration of China updated its third list of banned online fiction, most of which was danmei fiction.Liu, Ting. \\"Conflicting Discourses on Boys' Love and Subcultural Tactics in Mainland China and Hong Kong.\\" Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific 20, April 2009. http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/liu.htm In 2014, Anhui TV reported that at least 20 young female authors writing danmei novels on an online novel website were arrested. In 2018, a female author received a ten-year and six- month prison sentence for breaking obscenity laws in China by selling her danmei novel Gongzhan () on Taobao, China's largest online shopping website.  Television adaptations outside Japan  In 2016, China implemented the censorship of LGBT+ representation in films and television series, although adaptations of yaoi novels are still present. The Untamed is a 2019 Chinese fantasy live-action drama based on the popular BL novel Mo Dao Zu Shi or Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu, a well-known author of several BL works. Due to the ban of Yaoi series in China, the homoerotic romance between the two main characters of the series were toned down to subtexts. Despite this, many critics and viewers have considered the series as BL, and praised the writers and directors for \\"circumventing Chinese censorships.\\" The drama, which is a critical and commercial success, became an international hit and garnered a large fan following, especially in Thailand where BL adaptations are prominent in the media. In 2020, Thai BL dramas gained international recognition after the release of 2gether: The Series (2020), a hit Thai BL romantic-comedy series based on the novel of the same name by JittiRain. Due to its family-friendly theme and lighthearted plot, the series was praised for its positive LGBT+ representation. The series is produced by GMMTV, a subsidiary of GMM Grammy that focuses on TV production and produces several BL dramas including SOTUS: The Series (2016-2017), Dark Blue Kiss (2019), and Theory of Love (2019), all of which are also based on yaoi novels. Demographics Most yaoi fans are either teenage girls or young women. In Thailand, female readership of yaoi works is estimated at 80%,Keenapan, Nattha Japanese \\"boy-love\\" comics a hit among Thais Japan Today 2001 and the membership of Yaoi-Con, a yaoi convention in San Francisco, is 85% female. It is usually assumed that all female fans are heterosexual, but in Japan there is a presence of lesbian manga authors and lesbian, bisexual or questioning female readers. Recent online surveys of English-speaking readers of yaoi indicate that 50-60% of female readers self-identify as heterosexual. Although the genre is marketed to girls and women, there is a gay,McLelland, Mark. Why are Japanese Girls' Comics full of Boys Bonking? Refractory: A Journal of Entertainment Media Vol.10, 2006/2007 bisexual,Yoo, Seunghyun (2002) Online discussions on Yaoi: Gay relationships, sexual violence, and female fantasy and heterosexual male readership as well. A survey of yaoi readers among patrons of a United States library found about one quarter of respondents were male; two online surveys found approximately ten percent of the broader English-speaking yaoi readership were male. Lunsing suggests that younger Japanese gay men who are offended by \\"pornographic\\" content in gay men's magazines may prefer to read yaoi instead. Some gay men, however, are put off by the feminine art style or unrealistic depictions of LGBT culture in Japan and instead prefer gei comi, which some perceive to be more realistic. Lunsing notes that some of the yaoi narrative elements criticized by homosexual men, such as rape fantasies, misogyny, and characters' non- identification as gay, are also present in gei comi. In the mid-1990s, estimates of the size of the Japanese yaoi fandom ranged from 100,000 to 500,000 people. At around that time, June magazine had a circulation of between 80,000 and 100,000, twice the circulation of the best selling gay lifestyle magazine Badi. As of April 2005, a search for non-Japanese websites resulted in 785,000 English, 49,000 Spanish, 22,400 Korean, 11,900 Italian, and 6,900 Chinese sites. In January 2007, there were approximately five million hits for yaoi. A large portion of Western fans choose to pirate yaoi material because they are unable or unwilling to obtain it through sanctioned methods. For example, fans may lack a credit card for payment, or they may want to keep their yaoi private because of the dual stigma of seeking sexually explicit material which is also gay. Scanlations and other fan translation efforts are common. In addition to commercially published Japanese works, amateur dojinshi may be scanlated into English.Glasspool, Lucy Hannah. (2013). \\"Simulation and database society in Japanese roleplaying-game fandoms: Reading boys‚Äô love dojinshi online. \\" Transformative Works and Cultures, 12. Critical reception General Boys' love manga has received considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. Different critics and commentators have had very different views of BL. In 1983, Frederik L. Schodt, an American writer and translator, observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in manga to appeal to their female audience.Schodt, Frederik L. (1983) Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics. pages 100‚Äì101 Tokyo and New York: Kodansha International. Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies,Ueno, Chizuko (1989) \\"Jendaaresu waarudo no \\"ai\\" no jikken\\" (\\"Experimenting with \\"love\\" in a Genderless World\\"). In Kikan Toshi II (\\"Quarterly City II\\"), Tokyo: Kawade Shob≈ç Shinsha, . Cited and translated in Thorn, 2004. as well as to create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects \\"socially mandated\\" gender roles as a \\"first step toward feminism\\".Takemiya, Keiko. (1993) \\"Josei wa gei ga suki!?\\" (Women Like Gays!?) Bungei shunj≈´, June, pp. 82‚Äì83. Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine heterosexism is something which has consciously emerged as a result of the genre's popularity.Suzuki, Kazuko. (1999) \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, p.246 , . Mizoguchi, writing in 2003, feels that BL is a \\"female-gendered space\\", as the writers, readers, artists and most of the editors of BL are female. BL has been compared to romance novels by English-speaking librarians. Parallels have also been noted in the popularity of lesbianism in pornography, and yaoi has been called a form of \\"female fetishism\\".Hashimoto, Miyuki Visual Kei Otaku Identity‚ÄîAn Intercultural Analysis Intercultural Communication Studies XVI: 1 2007 pp. 87‚Äì99 Mariko ≈åhara, a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote yaoi Kirk/Spock fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy \\"conventional pornography, which had been made for men\\", and that she had found a \\"limitless freedom\\" in yaoi, much like in science fiction.McCaffery, Larry; Gregory, Sinda; Kotani, Mari; Takayuki, Tatsumi (n.d.) The Twister of Imagination: An Interview with Mariko Ohara Other commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. In 1998, Shihomi Sakakibara argued that yaoi fans, including himself, were gay female-to-male transsexuals.Sakakibara, Shihomi (1998) Yaoi genron: yaoi kara mieta mono (An Elusive Theory of Yaoi: The view from Yaoi). Tokyo: Natsume Shobo, . Sandra Buckley believes that bish≈çnen narratives champion \\"the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations\\",Buckley, Sandra (1991) \\"'Penguin in Bondage': A Graphic Tale of Japanese Comic Books\\", pp. 163‚Äì196, In Technoculture. C. Penley and A. Ross, eds. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota while James Welker described the bish≈çnen character as \\"queer\\", commenting that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw sh≈çnen-ai as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian. Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the yaoi rons≈ç as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim. Welker has also written that boys' love titles liberate the female audience \\"not just from patriarchy, but from gender dualism and heteronormativity\\". Criticism Some gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the yaoi rons≈ç or \\"yaoi debate\\" of 1992‚Äì1997. A trope of yaoi that has attracted criticism is male protagonists who do not identify as gay, but are rather simply in love with each other. This is said to heighten the theme of all-conquering love,Lees, Sharon (June 2006). \\"Yaoi and Boys' Love\\" . Akiba Angels. but is also condemned for avoiding the need to address prejudices against people who state that they were born gay, lesbian or bisexual. Yaoi stories (such as 1987's Tomoi and 1996‚Äì1998's ) have increasingly featured characters that identify as gay. Criticism of the stereotypically \\"girly\\" behaviour of the uke has also been prominent.Keller, Katherine Seme and Uke? Make Me Puke Sequential Tart February 2008 Japanese gay activist Masaki Satou criticized yaoi fans and artists in an open letter to the feminist zine Choisir in May 1992, writing that the genre was lacking in any accurate information about gay men and conveniently avoided the very real prejudice and discrimination that gay men faced as a part of society. More significantly, its portrayal of gay men as wealthy, handsome, and well-educated was simply a vehicle for heterosexual female masturbation fantasies. An extensive debate ensued, with yaoi fans and artists arguing that yaoi is entertainment for women, not education for gay men, and that yaoi characters are not meant to represent \\"real gay men\\". As Internet resources for gay men developed in the 1990s, the yaoi debate wanedBlackarmor (19 February 2008) \\"A Follow-Up To the Yaoi Debate\\" http://blackarmor.exblog.jp/7508722/ (In Japanese.) Accessed 14 August 2008. but occasionally resurfaced; for example, when Mizoguchi in 2003 characterized stereotypes in modern BL as being \\"unrealistic and homophobic\\".Mizoguchi, Akiko. (2003) \\"Homophobic Homos, Rapes of Love, and Queer Lesbians: Yaoi as a Conflicting Site of Homo/ Hetero-Sexual Female Sexual Fantasy\\".

There has been similar criticism to the Japanese yaoi debate in the English-speaking fandom.Butcher, Christopher (18 August 2006).

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. . pp. 187‚Äì188. In 1993 and 2004, Rachel Thorn pointed to the complexity of these phenomena, and suggested that yaoi and slash fiction fans are discontented with \\"the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a social environment that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent\\".Thorn, Rachel Matt. (1993) \\"Unlikely Explorers: Alternative Narratives of Love, Sex, Gender, and Friendship in Japanese Girls' Comics.\\" New York Conference on Asian Studies, New Paltz, New York, 16 October 1993. In China, BL became very popular in the late 1990s, attracting media attention, which became negative, focusing on the challenge it posed to \\"heterosexual hegemony\\". Publishing and distributing BL is illegal in mainland China. Zanghellini notes that due to the \\"characteristics of the yaoi/BL genre\\" of showing characters who are often underage engaging in romantic and sexual situations, child pornography laws in Australia and Canada \\"may lend themselves to targeting yaoi/BL work\\". He notes that in the UK, cartoons are exempt from child pornography laws unless they are used for child grooming. In 2001, a controversy erupted in Thailand regarding gay male comics. Television reports labelled the comics as negative influences, while a newspaper falsely stated that most of the comics were not copyrighted as the publishers feared arrest for posting the content; in reality most of the titles were likely illegally published without permission from the original Japanese publishers. The sh≈çnen-ai comics provided profits for the comic shops, which sold between 30 and 50 such comics per day. The moral panic regarding the gay male comics subsided. The Thai girls felt too embarrassed to read heterosexual stories, so they read gay male-themed josei and sh≈çjo stories, which they saw as \\"unthreatening\\".Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. The Essential Guide to World Comics. Collins & Brown. 2005. 124‚Äì125. Youka Nitta has said that \\"even in Japan, reading boys' love isn't something that parents encourage\\" and encouraged any parents who had concerns about her works to read them.Cha, Kai-Ming. \\"Embracing Youka Nitta\\" (Archive). Publishers Weekly. 5/9/2006. Although in Japan, concern about manga has been mostly directed to sh≈çnen manga, in 2006, an email campaign was launched against the availability of BL manga in Sakai City's public library. In August 2008, the library decided to stop buying more BL, and to keep its existing BL in a collection restricted to adult readers. That November, the library was contacted by people who protested against the removal, regarding it as \\"a form of sexual discrimination\\". The Japanese media ran stories on how much BL was in public libraries, and emphasised that this sexual material had been loaned out to minors. Debate ensued on Mixi, a Japanese social networking site, and the library would return its BL to the public collection. Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become \\"a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of 'gender free' policies in employment, education and elsewhere\\". In 2010, the Osaka Prefectural Government included boys' love manga among with other books deemed potentially \\"harmful to minors\\" due to its sexual content, which resulted in several magazines prohibited from being sold to people under 18 years of age. Boys' love content was initially not included in the raid due to the officials claiming that the books only interested a small, niche demographic.

He most likely was never a \\"Captain\\" but rather appropriated the name for himself. The Captain uses bravado and excessive shows of manliness to hide his true cowardly nature. Engraving by Abraham Bosse. He is often a braggart and a swaggerer who can maintain his claims only by benefit of the fact that none of the locals know him. He is usually a Spaniard, given the fact that for most of the late Renaissance to well into 17th century, parts of Italy were under Spanish domination. He was most likely inspired by the boisterous Iberic caudillos who told tall tales of their exploits either in the conquest of the Americas or in the wars with Germany. Il Capitano often talks at length about made up conquests of both the militaristic and carnal nature in attempts to impress others, but often only ends up impressing himself. He gets easily carried away in his tales and doesn't realise when those around him don't buy his act. He would be the first to run away from any and all battles, and he has trouble talking to and being around men. He is also extremely opportunistic and greedy. If hired by Pantalone to protect his daughter from her many suitors, Capitano would set up a bidding war for his services or aid between the suitors and Pantalone while wooing her himself. If he is hired to fight the Turks, he will bluster about fighting them to his last drop of blood, but when the Turks seem to be winning, he will join them. When they are driven off, he will change sides again and boast about his loyalty and bravery. Role \\"I think of him as a peacock who has moulted all but one of his tail feathers, but does not know it,\\" notes author John Rudlin. In this case, his cowardice is usually overcome by the fury of his passion, which he makes every effort to demonstrate. Typically, however, his cowardice is such that when one of the characters orders him to do something, he often steps down out of fear, but is able to make up an excuse that ensures the other characters still see him as a brave and fierce individual. Columbina sometimes uses him to make Arlecchino jealous, much to Capitano's bewilderment and fright.  Origin  The origin of Capitano comes from 2 sources literary sources: Plautus's Miles Gloriosus and Terence's Eunuchus. The first famous Captain, Capitano Spavento, appeared in Francesco Andreini's Bravure di Capitan Spaventa (The Boast of the Terrifying Captain).  Lazzi  # Whenever Capitano sees the audience, he stops to be admired. # Capitano gloats to Arlecchino (Harlequin) about his expertise with the ladies and then proceeds to demonstrate on Arlecchino how he would make love to a woman. # He wakes up to find he is not the only one in the room. There is someone crouching in the corner. He shakes his fist at the person, the person shakes their fist back at the same time. It turns out the person in the room is just Capitano's reflection in a full length mirror. # When frightened, he often screams in a high and womanly falsetto, or else faints.  Stance  He stands in a high posture, occupying as much space as possible, with a straight back and his chest pushed forward.  Plot Function  To be exposed or 'de-masked'. He exists to be stripped of his excessive confidence and shown in a moment of panic and humility.  Famous Actors of Capitano  Francesco Andreini Antonio Fava Description of the character 184x184px  Mask  II Capitano mask being made at the University of Mississippi His mask is described as having \\"a long nose, often unambiguously phallic\\" The nose for Captain Spavento's mask is fairly large, but it lengthens with Matamoros, and becomes absolutely gargantuan for Coccodrillo. Originally, the color of the mask was probably flesh tone, now it can be many flamboyant colors such as bright pink, yellow and light blue. The mask often has a strong mustache and brow lines that can be black or have a purple/blue tone. UNmasked Capitano: II Cavaliere (The Lover Capitano).  Costume  Military-esque uniform (a satire on the period). 1500s: feathered helmet or hat (mom panache), exaggerated garters, extraordinarily long sword and a plethora of ruffles. 1600s: coat, breeches, and he would mostly have a musket instead of a sword. In one famous scenario, the Captain makes up a lie regarding the reason for his lack of an undershirt by claiming that it got that way because \\"I used to be an exceedingly fierce and violent man, and when I was made angry the hair which covers my body in goodly quantity stood on end and so riddled my shirt with holes that you would have taken it for a sieve.\\" The real reason is that he has been too poor to afford one. Sometimes he wears it with a helmet or a bicorne or tricorne hat with a huge plume. Spanish characters often wear an exaggerated large neck-ruff. He is usually always wearing his trademarked sword. If he were to ever work up enough nerve to draw it, it is usually too long to draw easily or too heavy or wobbly to wield properly. Even if he cut somebody with it, he would faint at the very sight of the blood. Noms de guerre Il Capitano usually has a properly showy name for himself, preferably several lines long and followed by many made-up titles and lists of relations. Some names are fierce-sounding, like \\"Escobombardon\\" (\\"Fired out of a cannon\\"), \\"Rodomonte\\" (\\"Mountain-crumbler\\"), \\"Sangre y Fuego\\" (Spanish: \\"Blood and Fire\\"), \\"Spaccamonti\\" (\\"Mountain splitter\\"), \\"Spezzaferro\\" (\\"Iron-breaker\\"), or \\"Terremoto\\" (\\"Earthquake\\"). Some names are ironic, like: \\"Bellavista\\" (\\"Beautiful view\\", a vain but ugly man) or \\"Fracasso\\"/\\"Fracassa\\" (the correct masculine version and an invented feminine version for \\"Fracas\\", \\"Skirmish\\" or \\"Big noise\\"). Some are dismissive, like \\"Cerimonia\\" (\\"Ceremony\\", all proper manners and rigid, slavish devotion to pointless details), \\"Coccodrillo\\" (\\"Crocodile\\", because he preys on others), \\"Fanfarone\\" (\\"Trumpeter\\" or \\"Loudmouth\\"), \\"Giangurgulo\\" (\\"John the Glutton\\"), \\"Grillo\\" (\\"Grasshopper\\", because he is small and 'hops' sides), \\"Malagamba\\" (\\"Lame leg\\"), \\"Squaquara\\" (\\"Little Shi*\\"), \\"Papirotonda\\" (\\"Round letter\\", a complaint signed by mutinous soldiers or sailors in a circle around the main text so the ringleaders or originators cannot be discerned), \\"Tagliacantoni\\" (\\"Small-sized\\"), and \\"Zerbino\\" (\\"Doormat\\"). He is also prone to awarding himself ridiculous titles like \\"Capitan Spavento della Vall'Inferna\\" (\\"Captain Fear, (Lord) of Hell's Valley\\"; the name of Vall'Inferna also sounds similar to \\"Va' all'Inferno!\\", \\"[When you die] Go to Hell!\\", an Italian-language imprecation), \\"Salvador de los V√≠rgenes Borrachos\\" (Spanish: \\"Savior of Drunken Virgins\\"), or \\"Sieur de Fracasse et Brise-tout\\" (French: \\"Lord of 'Knock it down' and 'Break everything'\\"). Variants The French coined characters like Boudoufle (Norman French: \\"Puffed up with hurt pride\\"), Taille-bras (either \\"Limb-Cutter\\" or \\"Arm's Length\\"), and Engoulevent (either \\"Night-bird\\" or \\"Big-mouth\\"). England has the Irish dramatist George Farquhar's play The Recruiting Officer. Major Bloodnok of the Goon Show bears some resemblance to Il Capitano and shares many of his traits, such as lust, greed and cowardice. In modern theater, the character Miles Gloriosus (Latin: \\"Famous or Boastful Soldier\\") from A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is an obvious form of the character, though modeled from the earlier Roman plays.  Types  1\\\\. Captain Spaventa (\\"fear\\") 2\\\\. Rinoceronte (\\"rhino\\") 3\\\\. Fracassa (\\"uproar\\") 4\\\\. Spezzafer (\\"iron splitter\\") 5\\\\. Cocodrillo (\\"crocodile\\")  \\"A crocodile who never bites, he is all fanfare easily deflated,\\" according to Rudlin. 6\\\\. Matamoros (Spanish: \\"Killer of Moors\\") ‚Äì the original Spanish mercenary ‚Äì was created by Francesco Andreini. He is powerfully built and very lavishly dressed. The clothes of his servants were supposedly made from the turbans of his victims. Has a hedgehog on his coat of arms, the result of his exploits at the battle of Trebizonde, where he claims to have fought his way into the tent of the Sultan himself. He then dragged him through the camp with one hand while fighting off the entire enemy army with the other hand. Afterwards, there were so many arrows stuck in him by the time he fought free that he resembled a hedgehog. 7\\\\. Scaramouche- Scaramuccia (Italian), or Scaramouche (French) (\\"skirmish\\") was a reinvention of the character by Tiberio Fiorilli. He is more of a man of action than he is a braggart and is clever, brave, and quick-witted rather than ignorant, cowardly and foolish. He is also a good singer and musician, and is usually depicted with a lute or guitar. Although quite a heartbreaker, he is usually indirectly or unobtrusively helpful to the innamorati. *In the Punch and Judy shows, Scaramouche is depicted by a puppet with a detachable head or an extendable neck. The former is for the Capitano incarnation, who seeks to fight all the other characters and the latter is for a singing puppet. *Cyrano de Bergerac, a play by Edmond Rostand, is the most popular variant on Scaramouche. It portrays the historical figure as a violent, easily angered braggart who is sensitive about slurs on his considerable courage, his rural Gascon heritage, or his ugly face (which is identical to the features of the Scaramouche mask). He nobly helps his friend, a handsome but na√Øve and foolish youth, woo Roxane whom they both love. *An unnamed soldier in a short play by Miguel de Cervantes called The Vigilant Sentinel matched this character to the letter. In the play he waits, bespectacled and wearing ragged clothes, desperately trying to frighten away any rival suitors from the house of the girl he wishes to marry. *Baron Munchausen is another take on Scaramouche. He is usually depicted as an elderly man in an anachronistic 18th century uniform, powdered wig with queue, a beak-like and prominent nose, curling moustaches and goatee beard, and glasses. He uses his wits, his amazing luck and superhuman skills, and his gift of blather and blarney to defeat his enemies. He is also unusual in that he is handicapped by infirmities but is superhuman when he compensates for them. Without his glasses, he is blind as a bat; with them, he can see clearer and farther than a man with perfect vision. He has a lame leg, but when he carries his cane, he is capable of running faster and jumping higher and farther than an athlete. 8\\\\.

Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128. The need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning. A drafter, draftsperson, or draughtsman is a person who makes a drawing (technical or expressive). A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a drafting technician. Methods Sketching Sketch for a government building A sketch is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work. In general, sketching is a quick way to record an idea for later use. Architect's sketches primarily serve as a way to try out different ideas and establish a composition before a more finished work, especially when the finished work is expensive and time-consuming. Architectural sketches, for example, are a kind of diagrams.Richard Boland and Fred Collopy (2004). Managing as designing. Stanford University Press, 2004. , p.69. These sketches, like metaphors, are used by architects as a means of communication in aiding design collaboration. This tool helps architects to abstract attributes of hypothetical provisional design solutions and summarize their complex patterns, hereby enhancing the design process. Manual or by instrument A drafting table Old-fashioned technical drawing instruments Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards The basic drafting procedure is to place a piece of paper (or other material) on a smooth surface with right-angle corners and straight sides‚Äîtypically a drawing board. A sliding straightedge known as a T-square is then placed on one of the sides, allowing it to be slid across the side of the table, and over the surface of the paper. \\"Parallel lines\\" can be drawn simply by moving the T-square and running a pencil or technical pen along the T-square's edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as set squares or triangles. In this case, the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square‚Äîwhich is itself at right angles to the edge of the table‚Äîand can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables come equipped with a drafting machine that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel. In addition, the drafter uses several technical drawing tools to draw curves and circles. Primary among these are the compasses, used for drawing simple arcs and circles, and the French curve, for drawing curves. A spline is a rubber coated articulated metal that can be manually bent to most curves. Drafting templates assist the drafter with creating recurring objects in a drawing without having to reproduce the object from scratch every time. This is especially useful when using common symbols; i.e. in the context of stagecraft, a lighting designer will draw from the USITT standard library of lighting fixture symbols to indicate the position of a common fixture across multiple positions. Templates are sold commercially by a number of vendors, usually customized to a specific task, but it is also not uncommon for a drafter to create his own templates. This basic drafting system requires an accurate table and constant attention to the positioning of the tools. A common error is to allow the triangles to push the top of the T-square down slightly, thereby throwing off all angles. Even tasks as simple as drawing two angled lines meeting at a point require a number of moves of the T-square and triangles, and in general, drafting can be a time-consuming process. A solution to these problems was the introduction of the mechanical \\"drafting machine\\", an application of the pantograph (sometimes referred to incorrectly as a \\"pentagraph\\" in these situations) which allowed the drafter to have an accurate right angle at any point on the page quite quickly. These machines often included the ability to change the angle, thereby removing the need for the triangles as well. In addition to the mastery of the mechanics of drawing lines, arcs and circles (and text) onto a piece of paper‚Äîwith respect to the detailing of physical objects‚Äîthe drafting effort requires a thorough understanding of geometry, trigonometry and spatial comprehension, and in all cases demands precision and accuracy, and attention to detail of high order. Although drafting is sometimes accomplished by a project engineer, architect, or shop personnel (such as a machinist), skilled drafters (and/or designers) usually accomplish the task, and are always in demand to some degree. Computer aided design Today, the mechanics of the drafting task have largely been automated and accelerated through the use of computer-aided design systems (CAD). There are two types of computer-aided design systems used for the production of technical drawings: two dimensions (\\"2D\\") and three dimensions (\\"3D\\"). An example of a drawing drafted in AutoCAD 2D CAD systems such as AutoCAD or MicroStation replace the paper drawing discipline. The lines, circles, arcs, and curves are created within the software. It is down to the technical drawing skill of the user to produce the drawing. There is still much scope for error in the drawing when producing first and third angle orthographic projections, auxiliary projections and cross-section views. A 2D CAD system is merely an electronic drawing board. Its greatest strength over direct to paper technical drawing is in the making of revisions. Whereas in a conventional hand drawn technical drawing, if a mistake is found, or a modification is required, a new drawing must be made from scratch, the 2D CAD system allows a copy of the original to be modified, saving considerable time. 2D CAD systems can be used to create plans for large projects such as buildings and aircraft but provide no way to check the various components will fit together. cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons A 3D CAD system (such as KeyCreator, Autodesk Inventor, or SolidWorks) first produces the geometry of the part; the technical drawing comes from user defined views of that geometry. Any orthographic, projected or sectioned view is created by the software. There is no scope for error in the production of these views. The main scope for error comes in setting the parameter of first or third angle projection and displaying the relevant symbol on the technical drawing. 3D CAD allows individual parts to be assembled together to represent the final product. Buildings, aircraft, ships, and cars are modeled, assembled, and checked in 3D before technical drawings are released for manufacture. Both 2D and 3D CAD systems can be used to produce technical drawings for any discipline. The various disciplines (electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.) have industry recognized symbols to represent common components. BS and ISO produce standards to show recommended practices but it is up to individuals to produce the drawings to a standard. There is no definitive standard for layout or style. The only standard across engineering workshop drawings is in the creation of orthographic projections and cross- section views. In representing complex, three-dimensional objects in two- dimensional drawings, the objects can be described by at least one view plus material thickness note, 2, 3 or as many views and sections that are required to show all features of object. Applications Architecture To plan a renovation, this architect takes measurements, which he later enters into his computer-aided design software. The art and design that goes into making buildings is known as architecture. To communicate all aspects of the shape or design, detail drawings are used. In this field, the term plan is often used when referring to the full section view of these drawings as viewed from three feet above finished floor to show the locations of doorways, windows, stairwells, etc.Jefferis, Alan; Madsen, David (2005), Architectural Drafting and Design (5th ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, Architectural drawings describe and document an architect's design.Goetsch et al. (2000) p. 792 Engineering Engineering can be a very broad term. It stems from the Latin ingenerare, meaning \\"to create\\".Lieu, Dennis K; Sorby, Sheryl (2009), Visualization, Modeling, and Graphics for Engineering Design (1st ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, , p. 1-2 Because this could apply to everything that humans create, it is given a narrower definition in the context of technical drawing. Engineering drawings generally deal with mechanical engineered items, such as manufactured parts and equipment. Engineering drawing of a machine tool part Engineering drawings are usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as typefaces and line styles), size, etc. Its purpose is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a product or a component. The end goal of an engineering drawing is to convey all the required information that will allow a manufacturer to produce that component. Related fields Technical illustration Illustration of a drum set Technical illustration is the use of illustration to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be component technical drawings or diagrams. The aim of technical illustration is \\"to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer\\".Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gr√∂ller (2005). \\"Smart Visibility in Visualization\\". In: Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.) The main purpose of technical illustration is to describe or explain these items to a more or less nontechnical audience.

Accessed 15 February 2009. According to Viola (2005), \\"illustrative techniques are often designed in a way that even a person with no technical understanding clearly understands the piece of art. The use of varying line widths to emphasize mass, proximity, and scale helped to make a simple line drawing more understandable to the lay person. Cross hatching, stippling, and other low abstraction techniques gave greater depth and dimension to the subject matter\\". =Cutaway drawing= Cutaway drawing of the Nash 600, an American car of the 1940s A cutaway drawing is a technical illustration, in which part of the surface of a three-dimensional model is removed in order to show some of the model's interior in relation to its exterior. The purpose of a cutaway drawing is to \\"allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering\\".J. Diepstraten, D. Weiskopf & T. Ertl (2003). \\"Interactive Cutaway Illustrations\\". in: Eurographics 2003. P. Brunet and D. Fellner (ed). Vol 22 (2003), Nr 3. Technical drawings Types The two types of technical drawings are based on graphical projection. This is used to create an image of a three- dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface. =Two-dimensional representation= Two-dimensional representation uses orthographic projection to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen. =Three-dimensional representation= In a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible. Views =Multiview= Multiview is a type of orthographic projection. There are two conventions for using multiview, first- angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side. =Section= While multiview relates to external surfaces of an object, section views show an imaginary plane cut through an object. This is often useful to show voids in an object. =Auxiliary= Auxiliary views utilize an additional projection plane other than the common planes in a multiview. Since the features of an object need to show the true shape and size of the object, the projection plane must be parallel to the object surface. Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the three major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly. =Pattern= Patterns, sometimes called developments, show the size and shape of a flat piece of material needed for later bending or folding into a three-dimensional shape.Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 341 =Exploded= Exploded-view drawing of a gear pump An exploded-view drawing is a technical drawing of an object that shows the relationship or order of assembly of the various parts.United States Patent and Trademark Office (2005), General Information Concerning Patents ¬ß 1.84 Standards for drawings (Revised January 2005). Accessed 13 February 2009. It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-dimensional exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled explosion emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations. An exploded view drawing (EVD) can show the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. In mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center is assembled first or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled. This drawing can also help to represent disassembly of parts, where the parts on the outside normally get removed first.Michael E. Brumbach, Jeffrey A. Clade (2003). Industrial Maintenance. Cengage Learning, 2003 , p.65 Standards and conventions =Basic drafting paper sizes= There have been many standard sizes of paper at different times and in different countries, but today most of the world uses the international standard (A4 and its siblings). North America uses its own sizes. Image:A size illustration2 with letter and legal.svgISO \\"A series\\" papers sizes used in most countries of the world Image:ANSI size illustration.svgANSI paper sizes used in North America Patent drawing The Wright brothers' patent drawings for their aeroplane (1908) The applicant for a patent will be required by law to furnish a drawing of the invention if or when the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention with the job. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except compositions of matter or processes, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes. The drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims and is required by the patent office rules to be in a particular form. The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions. Sets of technical drawings =Working drawings for production= Working drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product.Ralph W. Liebing (1999). Architectural working drawings. John Wiley and Sons, 1999. . In architecture, these include civil drawings, architectural drawings, structural drawings, mechanical systems drawings, electrical drawings, and plumbing drawings. =Assembly drawings= Assembly drawings show how different parts go together, identify those parts by number, and have a parts list, often referred to as a bill of materials.Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 613 In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an exploded view drawing or diagram. These parts may be used in engineering. =As-fitted drawings= Also called As-Built drawings or As- made drawings. As-fitted drawings represent a record of the completed works, literally 'as fitted'. These are based upon the working drawings and updated to reflect any changes or alterations undertaken during construction or manufacture.

(died 22 October or 2 November 472) was Western Roman emperor from April or May 472 until his death later that same year; his rule was not recognised as legitimate by the Eastern Roman Empire. He was in reality a puppet ruler put on the throne by Ricimer, a Roman general of Germanic descent, and was mainly interested in religion, while the actual power was held by Ricimer and his nephew Gundobad. Biography Family and early career Olybrius was born in Rome, in the ancient and powerful gens Anicia,His relationship with such a prominent family was so noteworthy, that on his coins he spelled his family name in full (Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, , p. 262). of Italian descent. According to the consensus of historians, he was related to the Consul Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, whose wife and cousin, Anicia Juliana, had the same name that Olybrius gave to his own daughter. Other historians consider this questionable, as \\"Juliana\\" was a common name in the gens Anicia, and because Hermogenianus seems to have begotten only one daughter, who took chastity vows. Other possible fathers have therefore been proposed: either Flavius Anicius Probus (suggested by Settipani) or, according to some clues, Petronius Maximus.T.S. Mommaerts and D.H. Kelley, \\"The Anicii of Gaul and Rome\\", in Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, Fifth-Century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity?, pp. 119‚Äî120. Olybrius married Placidia, younger daughter of Western Emperor Valentinian III and his wife Licinia Eudoxia, thus creating a bond between a member of the senatorial aristocracy and the House of Theodosius. The year of their wedding is not recorded, although the historian Priscus implies it took place before the Vandal sack of Rome (June 2‚Äì16, 455).Priscus, fragment 29; translated by C.D Gordon, The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 118 Oost has pointed out that in his chronicle Hydatius wrote Placidia was unmarried as of 455.Oost, \\"A√´tius and Majorian\\", Classical Philology, 59 (1964), p. 28 Steven Muhlberger points out that many of the events in the chronicle of Hydatius are based on hearsay, that problems with his chronology \\"resulted from delays and distortions in the best information to which he had access,\\" and thus the evidence from Hydatius is not as decisive as Oost believed.Muhlberger, The Fifth-century chroniclers: Prosper, Hydatius, and the Gallic Chronicler of 452 (Leeds: Francis Cairns, 1990), p. 211 Regardless, the powerful Magister militum Aetius had forced Valentinian to betroth Placidia to his own son Gaudentius, so Olybrius could not have married her before Aetius' death. Gaiseric sacks Rome, by Karl Briullov. After the sack of Rome (455), the Vandals took Licinia Eudoxia and her two daughters, among which also Olybrius' wife Placidia, to Africa; at that time Olybrius was in Constantinople. Aetius' death came 21 September 454, when the Emperor Valentinian provoked a quarrel with him that ended with the Emperor killing Aetius with his own sword.John of Antioch, fragment 201.2; translated by C.D Gordon, The Age of Attila, p. 52 The following year, Valentinian was killed by some soldiers who had served under Aetius, probably instigated by the Patricius Petronius Maximus, who succeeded to the throne. Petronius, who was a high-ranking imperial officer and a member of a family belonging to the senatorial aristocracy, married Empress Licinia Eudoxia, widow of Valentinian. He also elevated his own son Palladius to the rank of Caesar and had him marry Eudocia, elder daughter of Valentinian. According to those historians who believe that Olybrius was Petronius' son, it was in 455 that Olybrius married Placidia, between April 17, when Petronius was acclaimed Emperor, and May 31, when he died; this would explain the marriage between Olybrius and Valentinian's younger daughter as a move to secure Petronius' legitimacy as emperor. Another possibility is that Olybrius and Placidia were engaged in 455, and only after Gaiseric freed her from his possession in the early 460s were they at last married. Oost mentions this possibility in his book Galla Placidia Augusta.Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta: (Chicago: University Press, 1968), p. 306 The surviving evidence is not sufficient to allow us to decide between these alternatives. Twice candidate for the throne The Vandals, led by King Gaiseric, took advantage of the confusion and weakness of the Western Empire in the wake of Valentinian's turbulent succession, moving into Italy and sacking Rome. Before returning to Africa, the Vandals took Licinia Eudoxia and her two daughters as hostages. According to the 6th-century historian John Malalas, Olybrius was in Constantinople at the time.Chronicle, 366; translated by Ralph W. Mathisen. On the other hand, the chronicler Evagrius Scholasticus writes that Olybrius had fled Rome on the approach of Gaiseric's army.Historia Ecclesiastica 2.7; cited in Oost, \\"A√´tius and Majorian\\", p. 28. During his residence in the Eastern capital, Olybrius expressed his interest in religious matters. He met Daniel the Stylite, who, according to Christian tradition, prophesied the liberation of Licinia Eudoxia. In the meantime, the Western Empire went through a rapid succession of Emperors. After Petronius, the Gallic-Roman senator Avitus was proclaimed Emperor by the Visigoth king Theodoric II and ruled for two years; he was deposed by Majorian, who ruled for four years before being killed by his general Ricimer in 461. Gaiseric supported Olybrius to assume the vacant Western throne because Gaiseric's son Huneric and Olybrius had married the two daughters of Valentinian III, and with Olybrius on the throne, Gaiseric could exert great influence on the Western Empire. Therefore, Gaiseric freed Licinia Eudoxia (fulfilling Daniel's prophesy) and her daughter Placidia (Olybrius' wife), but he did not cease his raids on Italy's coasts. His project failed, however, as Ricimer, who had become the Magister militum of the West, chose Libius Severus as new Emperor (461‚Äì465). Placidia was now free, however, joining her husband at Constantinople, where she bore him a daughter, Anicia Juliana, in 462. Olybrius was nearly chosen for the Western throne again in 465, after Libius Severus died. Gaiseric was again his major supporter, but the Eastern Emperor Leo I the Thracian chose the noble Procopius Anthemius. Olybrius' association with Gaiseric did not harm his career, however, as the Eastern court chose him for the high honour of the consulate in 464. Rise to the throne, rule, and death Sources agree that Olybrius rose to the Western throne thanks to the Western Magister militum Ricimer. They differ over the timing and order of the events leading to his ascent. In the version provided by John Malalas, and championed by J.B. Bury, Olybrius was sent to Italy in 472 by Leo I, ostensibly to mediate between Ricimer and Anthemius, who was besieged by Ricimer in Rome. Once he had accomplished this, Olybrius would then continue to Carthage and offer a peace treaty to Gaiseric. Leo suspected that Olybrius favored the Vandal king, however, and would secretly take his side and betray the suspicious Emperor. Leo had Olybrius followed by another envoy bearing a letter for Anthemius stating: : I have removed Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, so that no one who might oppose me would survive. But you also must kill your son-in-law Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others. Ricimer had placed a guard at Ostia who found the secret letter. Ricimer showed the document to Olybrius, which convinced Olybrius to accept the purple. From Ricimer's point of view, Olybrius was a good candidate, as a member of the Roman senatorial aristocracy and because of his marriage to Placidia; his marriage to her makes him the last Emperor of the House of Theodosius. Ricimer had Anthemius killed and Olybrius acclaimed Emperor (July 11, 472).John Malalas, Chronicon, 373‚Äì375. The competing version of events does not mention the secret letter. Instead, after arriving in Rome, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor several months before Anthemius' death, in April or May 472. Ricimer then besieged the part of Rome where Anthemius was for several months until the lawful Emperor was abandoned by his partisans, captured in a church, and put to death by Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew.John of Antioch, fragment 209.1‚Äì2, translated by C.D. Gordon, The Age of Attila, pp. 122f; Fasti vindobonenses priores, n. 606, sub anno 472; Cassiodorus, sub anno 472. This version implies that Olybrius was secretly supported by the Emperor Leo, which explains why Leo sent him there. Three of our sources -- Theophanes, the Paschal Chronicle, and Paullus Diaconus‚Äîsupport this version. Edward Gibbon accepts this implication as fact, although none of the three sources explicitly state that Leo supported Olybrius. What other reason could there be, Bury asks, then answers his own rhetorical question: \\"the facts that Anthemius was Leo's chosen candidate, his filius, and that Olybrius was the friend of his foe Genseric, are a strong counter-argument.\\"Bury, \\"A note on the Emperor Olybrius\\", English Historical Review 1 (1886), pp. 507‚Äë509 The reign of Olybrius was short and uneventful. Soon after the death of Anthemius, Ricimer also died, on August 9 or 19; his nephew Gundobad was elevated to Magister militum in his place. Very little is known of Olybrius' policy; in his Vita Epifanius, Ennodius describes him as a pious man who acted accordingly. As evidence, he had minted a new series of gold coins bearing a cross and the new legend SALVS MVNDI (\\"Welfare of the World\\") instead of the usual SALVS REIPVBLICAE (\\"Welfare of the State\\").Grieson and Mays, Chronology. It is possible that this theme was chosen to mark an opposition to Anthemius, who had studied in a Neo-platonic school and was suspected to restore the Pagan cults. It is also noteworthy that Olybrius is depicted on his coins without helm and spear, common symbols on his predecessors' coinage, suggesting he had little interest in military matters.Grieson and Mays, Chronology Olybrius died of dropsy after only seven months of rule. The sources do not agree on the day of his death, reporting either October 22Fasti vindobonenses priores, n.609: \\"et defunctus est imp. Olybrius Romae X kl. Novemb.\\" or November 2.Paschale campanum: et Olybrius moritur IIII non. Novemb. Olybrius in culture Olybrius had a palace in the Tenth region of Constantinople at one end of the Mese, the main street, along the Constantinianae. Olybrius also restored, at his own expense, the nearby church of Saint Euphemia in Chalcedon, a famous church that had been chosen by Pulcheria, sister of Theodosius II, for the Council of Chalcedon in 451. This choice was a sign of the bond between Olybrius, a Roman senator, with the imperial House of Theodosius.Necipoƒülu, Nevra, Byzantine Constantinople: monuments, topography and everyday life, Brill Academic Publishers, , pp. 58‚Äì60. In 1707, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati wrote a libretto entitled Flavio Anicio Olibrio. The story told in the opera is quite different from the real one, despite the fact that Zeno claimed to use several historical sources (Evagrius Scholasticus l.2.c.7, Procopius of Caesarea, Historia Vandalorum, l.1, Paul the Deacon, vi): Ricimer captures Rome, frees his sister Teodolinda and enslaves Placidia, daughter of Valentinian III; a little later, Olybrius frees Rome and Placidia, and marries her.Apostolo Zeno, Poesie drammatiche, Volume 10, Giambattista Pasquali, 1744, Venezia, p. 385. The libretto was written for a dramma per musica in three acts by Francesco Gasparini, performed that same year in the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice, but the same libretto was put to music also by Nicola Porpora (1711, in Naples, as Il trionfo di Flavio Anicio Olibrio),Performed in Rome in 1722, it was the d√©but in that city of the then seventeen-years-old Farinelli (Philip H.

Radio drama includes plays specifically written for radio, docudrama, dramatized works of fiction, as well as plays originally written for the theatre, including musical theatre and opera. Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s radio drama began losing its audience. However, it remains popular in much of the world. Recordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors, libraries and museums, as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive. By the 21st century, radio drama had a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States, with much American radio drama being restricted to rebroadcasts of programmes from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Like the US, Australia ABC has abandoned broadcasting drama but in New Zealand RNZ continues to promote and broadcast a variety of drama over its airwaves. Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama experienced a revival around 2010. Podcasting offered the means of inexpensively creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs. The terms \\"audio drama\\"Compare the entry to H√∂rspiel e.g. in: dict.cc ‚Äì Deutsch-Englisch- W√∂rterbuch or \\"audio theatre\\" are sometimes used synonymously with \\"radio drama\\"; however, audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama can also be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts as well as broadcast radio.  History  The Roman playwright \\"Seneca has been claimed as a forerunner of radio drama because his plays were performed by readers as sound plays, not by actors as stage plays; but in this respect Seneca had no significant successors until 20th-century technology made possible the widespread dissemination of sound plays.\\"Martin Banham (ed.).

Unsung pioneers of the art include: WLW's Fred Smith; Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (who popularized the dramatic serial); The Eveready Hour creative team (which began with one-act plays but was soon experimenting with hour-long combinations of drama and music on its weekly variety program); the various acting troupes at stations like WLW, WGY, KGO and a number of others, frequently run by women like Helen Schuster Martin and Wilda Wilson Church; early network continuity writers like Henry Fisk Carlton, William Ford Manley and Don Clark; producers and directors like Clarence Menser and Gerald Stopp; and a long list of others who were credited at the time with any number of innovations but who are largely forgotten or undiscussed today.

Hand, Terror on the Air!: Horror Radio in America, 1931‚Äì1952 McFarland, 2006. Another notable early radio drama, one of the first specially written for the medium in the UK, was A Comedy of Danger by Richard Hughes, broadcast by the BBC on January 15, 1924, about a group of people trapped in a Welsh coal mine.Richard Hughes, 'A Comedy of Danger' in 'The Invisible Play': B.B.C. Radio Drama 1922‚Äì1928 by Alan Beck. One of the earliest and most influential French radio plays was the prize-winning \\"Mar√©moto\\" (\\"Seaquake\\"), by Gabriel Germinet and Pierre Cusy, which presents a realistic account of a sinking ship before revealing that the characters are actually actors rehearsing for a broadcast. Translated and broadcast in Germany and England by 1925, the play was originally scheduled by Radio-Paris to air on October 23, 1924, but was instead banned from French radio until 1937 because the government feared that the dramatic SOS messages would be mistaken for genuine distress signals.\\"Maremoto, a radio play (1924),\\" R√©seaux, 1994, Volume 2, Num√©ro 2 p. 251 ‚Äì 265 In 1951, American writer and producer Arch Oboler suggested that Wyllis Cooper's Lights Out (1934‚Äì47) was the first true radio drama to make use of the unique qualities of radio: Though the series is often remembered solely for its gruesome stories and sound effects, Cooper's scripts for Lights Out were well written and offered innovations seldom heard in early radio dramas, including multiple first- person narrators, stream of consciousness monologues and scripts that contrasted a duplicitious character's internal monologue and his spoken words. The question of who was the first to write stream-of-consciousness drama for radio is a difficult one to answer. By 1930, Tyrone Guthrie had written plays for the BBC like Matrimonial News (which consists entirely of the thoughts of a shopgirl awaiting a blind date) and The Flowers Are Not for You to Pick (which takes place inside the mind of a drowning man). After they were published in 1931, Guthrie's plays aired on the American networks. Around the same time, Guthrie himself also worked for the Canadian National Railway radio network, producing plays written by Merrill Denison that used similar techniques. A 1940 article in Variety credited a 1932 NBC play, Drink Deep by Don Johnson, as the first stream-of-consciousness play written for American radio. The climax of Lawrence Holcomb's 1931 NBC play Skyscraper also uses a variation of the technique (so that the listener can hear the final thoughts and relived memories of a man falling to his death from the title building). There were probably earlier examples of stream-of-consciousness drama on the radio. For example, in December 1924, actor Paul Robeson, then appearing in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, performed a scene from the play over New York's WGBS to critical acclaim. Some of the many storytellers and monologists on early 1920s American radio might be able to claim even earlier dates.  1930‚Äì1960s: Widespread popularity  Perhaps America's most famous radio drama broadcast is Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds (a 1938 version of H. G. Wells' novel), which convinced large numbers of listeners that an actual invasion from Mars was taking place.Koch, Howard, The Panic Broadcast: The Whole Story of Orson Welles' Legendary Radio Show Invasion From Mars, Avon Books, 1971. By the late 1930s, radio drama was widely popular in the United States (and also in other parts of the world). There were dozens of programs in many different genres, from mysteries and thrillers, to soap operas and comedies. Among American playwrights, screenwriters and novelists who got their start in radio drama are Rod Serling and Irwin Shaw. Radio program written and performed in Phoenix, Arizona by children of Junior Artists Club (Federal Arts Program, 1935). In Britain, however, during the 1930s BBC programming, tended to be more high brow, including the works of Shakespeare, Classical Greek drama, as well as the works of major modern playwrights, such as Chekhov, Ibsen, Strindberg, and so forth. Novels and short stories were also frequently dramatised.See reviews in The Listener In addition the plays of contemporary writers and original plays were produced, with, for example, a broadcast of T. S. Eliot's famous verse play Murder in the Cathedral in 1936.\\"The Poetic Quality\\", Grace Wyndham Goldie. The Listener (London, England), Wednesday, January 8, 1936; pg. 78; Issue 365. By 1930, the BBC was producing \\"twice as many plays as London's West End\\" and were producing over 400 plays a year by the mid-1940s. Producers of radio drama soon became aware that adapting stage plays for radio did not always work, and that there was a need for plays specifically written for radio, which recognized its potential as a distinct and different medium from the theatre. George Bernard Shaw's plays, for example, were seen as readily adaptable.See, for example, \\"A Listener's Commentary\\", R. D. Charques. The Listener (London, England), Wednesday, October 23, 1929; pg. 553; Issue 41. However, in a lead article in the BBC literary journal The Listener, of 14 August 1929, which discussed the broadcasting of 12 great plays, it was suggested that while the theatrical literature of the past should not be neglected the future lay mainly with plays written specifically for the microphone. In 1939‚Äì40, the BBC founded its own Drama Repertory Company which made a stock of actors readily available. After the war, the number was around 50. They performed in the great number of plays broadcast in the heyday of BBC radio drama of the 40s‚Äì60s. Initially the BBC resisted American-style 'soap opera', but eventually highly popular serials, like Dick Barton, Special Agent (1946‚Äì51), Mrs Dale's Diary (1948‚Äì69) and The Archers (1950‚Äì ), were produced. The Archers is still running (October 2017) and is the world's longest-running soap opera with a total of over 18,400 episodes.The Archers airs 15,000th episode, BBC News, 2006-11-07 There had been some earlier serialized drama including, the six episode The Shadow of the Swastika (1939), Dorothy L. Sayers's The Man Born To Be King, in twelve episodes (1941), and Front Line Family (1941‚Äì48), which was broadcast to America as part of the effort to encourage the US to enter the war. The show's storylines depicted the trials and tribulations of a British family, the Robinsons, living through the war. This featured plots about rationing, family members missing in action and the Blitz. After the war in 1946 it was moved to the BBC Light Programme. \\"British Radio Drama ‚Äì A Cultural Case History\\" by Tim Crook. The BBC continued producing various kinds of drama, including docu- drama, throughout World War II; amongst the writers they employed were the novelist James HanleyLinnea Gibbs, James Hanley: A Bibliography. (Vancouver: William Hoffer, 1980), p.165. and poet Louis MacNeice, who in 1941 became an employee of the BBC's. MacNeice's work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US, and later Russia, through cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over 60 scripts for the BBC, including Christopher Columbus (1942), which starred Laurence Olivier, The Dark Tower (1946), and a six-part radio adaptation of Goethe's Faust (1949).Poets.org Following World War II the BBC reorganized its radio provision, introducing two new channels to supplement the BBC Home Service (itself the result of the fusion in September 1939 of the pre-war National and regional Programmes). These were the BBC Light Programme (dating from 29 July 1945 and a direct successor to the wartime General Forces Programme) and the BBC Third Programme (launched on 29 September 1946). The BBC Light Programme, while principally devoted to light entertainment and music, carried a fair share of drama, both single plays (generally, as the name of the station indicated, of a lighter nature) and serials. In contrast, the BBC Third Programme, destined to become one of the leading cultural and intellectual forces in post-war Britain, specialized in heavier drama (as well as the serious music, talks, and other features which made up its content): long-form productions of both classical and modern/experimental dramatic works sometimes occupied the major part of its output on any given evening. The Home Service, meanwhile, continued to broadcast more \\"middle-brow\\" drama (one-off plays and serializations) daily. The high-water mark for BBC radio drama was the 1950s and 1960s, and during this period many major British playwrights either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill's early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with The Ants, she wrote nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973, when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton's dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play The Ruffian on the Stair, which was broadcast on 31 August 1964. Tom Stoppard's \\"first professional production was in the 15-minute Just Before Midnight programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists\\". John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. However, he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief, starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for Rumpole of the Bailey, a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.\\"John Mortimer Radio Plays\\": ; filmreference.com/film/69/John-Mortimer.html John Mortimer Biography (1923‚Äì2009) Giles Cooper was a pioneer in writing for radio, becoming prolific in both radio and television drama.

He was also successful in the theatre.

Bill Naughton's radio play Alfie Elkins and his Little Life (1962) was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 7 January 1962. In it Alfie, \\"[w]ith sublime amorality... swaggers and philosophises his way through\\" life. The action spans about two decades, from the beginning of World War II to the late 1950s. In 1964, Bill Naughton turned it into a stage play which was put on at London's Mermaid Theatre. Later, he wrote the screenplay for a film version, \\"Alfie\\" (1966), starring Michael Caine. Other notable radio dramatists included Henry Reed, Brendan Behan, Rhys Adrian, Alan Plater; Anthony Minghella, Alan Bleasdale, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC Radio, from the early 1970s. Henry Reed was especially successful with the Hilda Tablet plays. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of The Quare Fellow (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play The Big House (1956); prior to this he had written two plays for Irish radio: Moving Out and A Garden Party.The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, by Gabrielle H.

Many Australian serials and \\"soapies\\" were copies of American originals (e.g., the popular soap Portia Faces Life or the adventure series Superman, which featured future Australian TV star Leonard Teale in the title role), although these were typically locally produced and performed live to air, since the technology of the time did not permit high-quality pre-recording or duplication of programs for import or export. In this period radio drama, serials and soap operas provided a fertile training ground and a steady source of employment for many actors, and this was particularly important because at this time the Australian theatre scene was in its infancy and opportunities were very limited. Many who trained in this medium (such as Peter Finch) subsequently became prominent both in Australia and overseas. It has been noted that the producers of the popular 1960s Gerry Anderson TV series Thunderbirds were greatly impressed by the versatility of UK-based Australian actor Ray Barrett, who voiced many roles in Anderson's TV productions. Thanks to his early experience on Australian live radio (where he often played English and American roles), Barrett was considered better than his English counterparts at providing a convincing Mid-Atlantic English (\\"transatlantic\\") accent, and he could perform a wide range of character voices; he also impressed the Anderson team with his ability to quickly and easily switch from one voice/accent to another without the sound engineers' having to stop the recording. The effect of the introduction of television there in the late 1950s had the same devastating effect as it did in the US and many other markets, and by the early 1960s Australian commercial radio had totally abandoned radio drama and related programming (including comedy, soapies, and variety) in favour of music-based formats (such as Top 40) or talk radio (\\"talkback\\"), and the once-flourishing Australia radio production industry vanished within a few years. One of the few companies to survive was the Melbourne-based Crawford Productions, which was able to make the successful transition into TV production. Despite the complete abandonment of drama and related programming by the commercial radio sector, the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) maintained a long history of producing radio drama. One of its most famous and popular series was the daily 15-minute afternoon soap opera Blue Hills, which was written for its entire production history by dramatist Gwen Meredith. It featured many well-known Australian actresses and actors, ran continuously for 27 years, from 28 February 1949 to 30 September 1976, with a total of 5,795 episodes broadcast, and was at one time the world's longest-running radio serial. It was preceded by an earlier Meredith serial The Lawsons, which featured many of the same themes and characters and itself ran for 1299 episodes. In the 1960s and later, the ABC continued to produce many original Australian radio dramas as well as works adapted from other media. In recent years original radio dramas and adapted works were commissioned from local dramatists and produced for the ABC's Radio National network program Airplay, which ran from the late 1990s until early 2013. In late 2012 ABC management imposed budget cuts and axed a number of long-running arts programs, thereby ending the national broadcaster's decades-long history of producing radio drama (as well as its equally long history of providing daily serialised book readings).  1960‚Äì2000: Decline in the United States  After the advent of television, radio drama never recovered its popularity in the United States. Most remaining CBS and NBC radio dramas were cancelled in 1960.Jim Cox, Say Goodnight, Gracie: The Last Years of Network Radio, p. 145‚Äì148. The last network radio dramas to originate during American radio's \\"Golden Age\\", Suspense and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, ended on September 30, 1962.John Dunning, On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 742. . There have been some efforts at radio drama since then. In the 1960s, Dick Orkin created the popular syndicated comic adventure series Chicken Man. ABC Radio aired a daily dramatic anthology program, Theater Five, in 1964‚Äì65. Inspired by The Goon Show, \\"the four or five crazy guys\\" of the Firesign Theatre built a large following with their satirical plays on recordings exploring the dramatic possibilities inherent in stereo. A brief resurgence of production beginning in the early 1970s yielded Rod Serling's The Zero Hour for Mutual, National Public Radio's Earplay, and veteran Himan Brown's CBS Radio Mystery Theater and General Mills Radio Adventure Theater. These productions were later followed by the Sears/Mutual Radio Theater, The National Radio Theater of Chicago, NPR Playhouse, and a newly produced episode of the former 1950s series X Minus One. Works by a new generation of dramatists also emerged at this time, notably Yuri Rasovsky, Thomas Lopez of ZBS and the dramatic sketches heard on humorist Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion. Brian Daley's 1981 adaptation of the blockbuster space opera film Star Wars for NPR Playhouse was a notable success. Production costs on this serial were mitigated by the support of Lucasfilm, who sold the rights to NPR for a nominal $1 fee, and by the participation of the BBC in an international co-production deal. Star Wars was credited with generating a 40% rise in NPR's ratings and quadrupling the network's youth audience overnight. Radio adaptations of the sequels followed with The Empire Strikes Back in 1983 and Return of the Jedi in 1996. Thanks in large part to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, public radio continued to air a smattering of audio drama until the mid-1980s. From 1986 to 2002, NPR's most consistent producer of radio drama was the idiosyncratic Joe Frank, working out of KCRW in Santa Monica. The Sci Fi Channel presented an audio drama series, Seeing Ear Theatre, on its website from 1997 to 2001. Also, the dramatic serial It's Your World aired twice daily on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show from 1994 to 2008, continuing online through 2010.  2000‚Äìpresent: Radio drama's \\"New Media\\" revival  Radio drama remains popular in much of the world, though most material is now available through internet download rather than heard over terrestrial or satellite radio. Stations producing radio drama often commission a large number of scripts. The relatively low cost of producing a radio play enables them to take chances with works by unknown writers. Radio can be a good training ground for beginning drama writers as the words written form a much greater part of the finished product; bad lines cannot be obscured with stage business. The BBC's sole surviving radio soap is The Archers on BBC Radio 4: it is, with over 18,700 episodes to date, the world's longest-running such programme. Other radio soaps (\\"ongoing serials\\") produced by the BBC but no longer on air include: * Mrs Dale's Diary (1948‚Äì69) * Westway on the World Service (1997‚Äì2005) * Silver Street (2004‚Äì10) on the Asian Network In September, 2010 Radio New Zealand began airing its first ongoing soap opera, You Me Now, which won the Best New Drama Award in the 2011 New Zealand Radio Awards. On KDVS radio in Davis, California there are two radio theater shows, Evening Shadows, a horror/fantasy show paying tribute to classic old-time radio horror, and KDVS Radio Theater which commonly features dramas about social and political themes. The audio drama format exists side-by-side with books presented on radio, read by actors or by the author. In Britain and other countries there is also a quite a bit of radio comedy (both stand-up and sitcom). Together, these programs provide entertainment where television is either not wanted or would be distracting (such as while driving or operating machinery). Selected Shorts, a long-running NPR program broadcast in front of a live audience at Symphony Space in New York, originated the driveway moment for over 300,000 people listeners each week during readings of contemporary and classic short stories by well-known professional actors. The lack of visuals also enable fantastical settings and effects to be used in radio plays where the cost would be prohibitive for movies or television. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was first produced as radio drama, and was not adapted for television until much later, when its popularity would ensure an appropriate return for the high cost of the futuristic setting. On occasion television series can be revived as radio series. For example, a long-running but no longer popular television series can be continued as a radio series because the reduced production costs make it cost-effective with a much smaller audience. When an organization owns both television and radio channels, such as the BBC, the fact that no royalties have to be paid makes this even more attractive. Radio revivals can also use actors reprising their television roles even after decades as they still sound roughly the same. Series that have had this treatment include Doctor Who, Dad's Army, Thunderbirds and The Tomorrow People. In 2013 BBC Radio 4 released a radio adaptation of Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, featuring a cast of well known television and film actors. Neil Gaiman has said he was excited about the radio drama adaptation as it allowed the work to be presented with a greater deal of special effects than was possible on television. In the United States, an adaptation of The Twilight Zone aired to modest success in the 2000s (decade) as a syndicated program. Regular broadcasts of radio drama in English can be heard on the BBC's Radio 3, Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra (formerly Radio 7), on RT√â Radio 1 in Ireland, and RNZ National in New Zealand. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced notable radio plays in Calgary and Toronto in the postwar decades, from which many actors and directors proceeded to international careers, but abolished its radio drama department in the 1970s (and in 2012 amalgamated its TV drama and comedy departments into the \\"scripted prime time department.\\")https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2012/07/25/cbc_consolidates_tv_drama_and_comedy_departments.html BBC Radio 4 in today noted for its radio drama, broadcasting hundreds of new, one-off plays each year in such strands as The Afternoon Play, as well as serials and soap operas. Radio 4 Extra broadcasts a variety of radio plays from the BBC's vast archives and a few extended versions of Radio 4 programmes. The British commercial station Oneword, though broadcasting mostly book readings, also transmitted a number of radio plays in instalments before it closed in 2008. In the United States, contemporary radio drama can be found on broadcasters including ACB radio, produced by the American Council of the Blind; on the Sirius XM Book Radio channel from Sirius XM Satellite Radio (previously Sonic Theater on XM); and occasionally in syndication, as with Jim French's production Imagination Theater. Several community radio stations carry weekly radio drama programs including KBOO, KFAI, WMPG, WLPP and WFHB. A growing number of religious radio stations air daily or weekly programs usually geared to younger audiences, such as Focus on the Family's Adventures in Odyssey (1,700+ syndicated stations), or Pacific Garden Mission's Unshackled! (1,800 syndicated stations ‚Äì a long-running radio drama), which is geared to adults. The networks sometime sell transcripts of their shows on cassette tapes or CDs or make the shows available for listening or downloading over the Internet. Transcription recordings of many pre-television shows have been preserved. They are collected, re-recorded onto audio CDs and/or MP3 files and traded by hobbyists today as old-time radio programs. Meanwhile, veterans such as the late Yuri Rasovsky (The National Radio Theater of Chicago) and Thomas Lopez (ZBS Foundation) have gained new listeners on cassettes, CDs and downloads. In the mid-1980s, the nonprofit L.A. Theatre Works launched its radio series recorded before live audiences. Productions have been broadcast via public radio, while also being marketed on compact discs and via download. Carl Amari's nationally syndicated radio series \\"Hollywood 360\\" features 4 old-time radio shows during his 4-hour weekly broadcasts. Amari also broadcasts old-time radio shows on \\"The WGN Radio Theatre\\" heard every Saturday night beginning at 10 pm on 720-WGN in Chicago. In addition to traditional radio broadcasters, modern radio drama (also known as audio theater, or audio drama), has experienced a revival, with a growing number of independent producers who are able to build an audience through internet distribution. While there are few academic programs in the United States that offer training in radio drama production, organizations such as the National Audio Theatre Festival teach the craft to new producers. The digital age has also resulted in recording styles that differ from the studio recordings of radio drama's Golden Age. Not from Space (2003) on XM Satellite Radio was the first national radio play recorded exclusively through the Internet in which the voice actors were all in separate locations. Other producers use portable recording equipment to record actors on location rather than in studios. Podcasts are a growing distribution format for independent radio drama producers. Podcasts provides an alternative to mainstream television and radio which does not necessarily require a pitching process to be made and distributed (as these aspects of production can be learned by the creator) and which have no restrictions regarding programme length or content.  Radio drama around the world   Cyprus  Since around the early sixties the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (RIK) features radio plays in the Cypriot Greek dialect. They are called Cypriot (radio drama) sketches and they are mainly about Cyprus's rural life, traditions and customs, its history and its culture. The works are written by established writers, but also from new writers through the Writing Contest of Cypriot Sketches issued annually by CyBC (RIK)  Germany  The first German radio drama was produced in 1923. Because of the external circumstances in postwar Germany in which most of the theaters were destroyed, radio drama boomed. Between 1945 and 1960 there were more than 500 radio plays every year. The German word for radio drama or audio play is 'H√∂rspiel'. Today Germany is a major market for radio plays worldwide.Torsten Wissmann, Geographies of Urban Sound, 2016, Routledge (publisher; in the year 2014 published by Ashgate Publishing), page 204. Cite: \\"Germany is the most important market for audio plays\\" In particular, audio plays on CD are very popular. A popular audio play serial of Germany and of the world is \\"Die drei ???\\" (Three Investigators). Berlin's Prix Europa includes a Radio Fiction category.  India  Vividh Bharati, a service of All India Radio, has a long running Hindi radio-drama program: Hawa Mahal.  Republic of Ireland  RT√â Radio Drama is one of the oldest audio theatre departments in the radio world.https://www.rte.ie/drama/radio/static/about-us- drama-on-one-sundays-8pm/  Japan  Audio dramas are popular in Japan, where they are also available as drama CDs or CD dramas. They began as radio dramas with the first radio broadcasts in 1925, and continue to be relevant as a medium in which storylines from TV series such as anime series, comics such as manga, novels such as light novels or video games are continued, expanded or, more rarely, based upon. Before the advent of videocassette recorders, drama recordings were the only way to revisit an animated television series. Recordings often featured recapitulations of plotlines along with theme songs from anime series. Audio dramas are often used to expand or detail the plotlines of videogames. Before the advent of disc-based and mass-media games and the internet, the \\"universes\\" in certain video games were fully developed and explained within such CD audio dramas, especially during the era of arcade games. One notable example is TwinBee Paradise, a radio drama spinoff of Detana!! TwinBee that lasted for three seasons and established the names of the game's protagonists.  Norway  Radioteatret (Radio drama in Norway) has existed since 1926.  See also   References   Further reading  * Tim Crook, Radio Drama: Theory and Practice.

Accessed September 8, 2008. \\"Nonetheless, Pantone's choice of blue iris, or No. 18-3943, got some news media attention last week, which seemed to be partly the objective of the company, which is based in Carlstadt, NJ.\\" The company is best known for its Pantone Matching System (PMS), a proprietary color space used in a variety of industries, notably graphic design, fashion design, product design, printing and manufacturing and supporting the management of color from design to production, in physical and digital formats, among coated and uncoated materials, cotton, polyester, nylon and plastics. X-Rite, a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone for US$180 million in October 2007,. and was itself acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2012. Overview Pantone began in New Jersey in the 1950s as the commercial printing company of brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine, M & J Levine Advertising. In 1956, its founders, both advertising executives, hired recent Hofstra University graduate Lawrence Herbert as a part-time employee. Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company's stock of pigments and production of colored inks; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was US$50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company's technological assets from the Levine Brothers for US$50,000 () and renamed them \\"Pantone\\".. The company's primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6√ó2 inches or 15√ó5 cm) thin cardboard sheets, printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small \\"fan deck\\". For instance, a particular \\"page\\" might contain a number of yellows of varying tints. The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to \\"color match\\" specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time.. Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.. Pantone Color Matching System The Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system. By standardizing the colors, different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another. One such use is standardizing colors in the CMYK process. The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks‚Äîcyan, magenta, yellow, and black. A majority of the world's printed material is produced using the CMYK process, and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK. Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company's guides. However, most of the Pantone system's 1,114 spot colors cannot be simulated with CMYK but with 13 base pigments (14 including black) mixed in specified amounts. The Pantone system also allows for many special colors to be produced, such as metallics and fluorescents. While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut, it was only in 2001 that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen-based colors. Screen-based colors use the RGB color model‚Äîred, green, blue‚Äîsystem to create various colors.. The (discontinued) Goe system has RGB and LAB values with each color. Pantone colors are described by their allocated number (typically referred to as, for example, \\"PMS 130\\"). PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards (to describe the colors of flags and seals).. In January 2003, the Scottish Parliament debated a petition (reference PE512) to refer to the blue in the Scottish flag as \\"Pantone 300\\". Countries such as Canada and South Korea and organizations such as the FIA have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags. US states including Texas have set legislated PMS colors of their flags.. Pantone Goe System On September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System.. Goe consisted of over 2,000 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, interactive software, tools, and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information. The Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors (ten, plus clear coating for reflections) and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press.. The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013. Other products A logo commissioned by the Government of Singapore to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the nation's independence. The usage instructions for the logo described it as being in Pantone Red 032 and White.. In mid-2006 Pantone, partnering with Vermont-based Fine Paints of Europe, introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints. The color palette uses Pantone's color research and trending and has more than 3,000 colors. In November 2015, Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone's authority on color. Pantone also produced Hexachrome, a patented six-color printing system... In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut, for better color reproduction. It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process. Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software. Pantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of L*a*b* numbers as well as CMYK and RGB representations of all the various palettes. L*a*b* numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device-independent manner. Color of the Year Since 2000, the Pantone Color Institute has declared a particular color \\"Color of the Year\\". Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a secret meeting of representatives from various nations' color standards groups. After two days of presentations and debate, they choose a color for the following year; for example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in London in the spring of 2012. The color purportedly connects with the zeitgeist; for example, the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of 2011 said \\"In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going ‚Äì perfect to ward off the blues.\\" The results of the meeting are published in Pantone View, which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products. 2016 has been the only year so far with more than one color. In 2012, the color of the year, Tangerine Tango, was used to create a makeup line, in partnership with Sephora. The product line, named Sephora + Pantone Universe collection, features Tangerine Tango‚Äìembellished false lashes, nail lacquers, cream, glitters, and high-pigment lip glosses. The person behind Pantone's Color of the Year, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute Leatrice Eiseman, explained in an interview how 2014's Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen: Pantone has said that color \\"has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times.\\" Intellectual property Pantone asserts that their lists of color numbers and pigment values are the intellectual property of Pantone and free use of the list is not allowed.. This is frequently held as a reason Pantone colors cannot be supported in open-source software and are not often found in low-cost proprietary software. Pantone has been accused of \\"being intentionally unclear\\" about its exact legal claims, but it is acknowledged that \\"the simplest claim would be trademark misappropriation or dilution towards someone who produced a color palette marketed as compatible with Pantone's\\". Pantone palettes supplied by printer manufacturers can be obtained freely, and usually do not come with usage restrictions beyond a sales ban on hard copies of the palette.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 18 January 1689 ‚Äì 10 February 1755), generally referred to as simply Montesquieu, was a French judge, man of letters, and political philosopher. He is the principal source of the theory of separation of powers, which is implemented in many constitutions throughout the world. He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word \\"despotism\\" in the political lexicon.. His anonymously-published The Spirit of Law in 1748, which was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies, influenced the Founding Fathers in drafting the United States Constitution. Biography Ch√¢teau de la Br√®de Montesquieu was born at the Ch√¢teau de la Br√®de in southwest France, south of Bordeaux. His father, Jacques de Secondat, was a soldier with a long noble ancestry. His mother, Marie Fran√ßoise de Pesnel, who died when Charles was seven, was an heiress who brought the title of Barony of La Br√®de to the Secondat family.Sorel, A. Montesquieu. London, George Routledge & Sons, 1887 (Ulan Press reprint, 2011), p. 10. After the death of his mother he was sent to the Catholic College of Juilly, a prominent school for the children of French nobility, where he remained from 1700 to 1711.Sorel (1887), p. 11. His father died in 1713 and he became a ward of his uncle, the Baron de Montesquieu.Sorel (1887), p. 12. He became a counselor of the Bordeaux Parliament in 1714. The next year, he married the Protestant Jeanne de Lartigue, who eventually bore him three children.Sorel (1887), pp. 11‚Äì12. The Baron died in 1716, leaving him his fortune as well as his title, and the office of pr√©sident √† mortier in the Bordeaux Parliament.Sorel (1887), pp. 12‚Äì13. Montesquieu's early life occurred at a time of significant governmental change. England had declared itself a constitutional monarchy in the wake of its Glorious Revolution (1688‚Äì89), and had joined with Scotland in the Union of 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In France, the long-reigning Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by the five-year-old Louis XV. These national transformations had a great impact on Montesquieu; he would refer to them repeatedly in his work. De l'Esprit des loix Montesquieu withdrew from the practice of law to devote himself to study and writing. He achieved literary success with the publication of his 1721 Persian Letters, a satire representing society as seen through the eyes of two imaginary Persian visitors to Paris and Europe, cleverly criticizing the absurdities of contemporary French society. Montesquieu embarked on a grand tour of Europe, especially Italy and England, during which he kept a journal. His reflections on geography, laws and customs during his travels became the primary sources for his major works on political philosophy upon his return to France. He next published Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline (1734), among his three best known books. It is considered by some scholars as a transition from The Persian Letters to his master work L'Esprit des lois, which was originally published anonymously in 1748 and translated in 1750 by Thomas Nugent as The Spirit of Laws. It quickly rose to influence political thought profoundly in Europe and America. In France, the book met with an unfriendly reception from both supporters and opponents of the regime. The Catholic Church banned The Spirit ‚Äì along with many of Montesquieu's other works ‚Äì in 1751 and included it on the Index of Prohibited Books. It received the highest praise from the rest of Europe, especially Britain. Lettres famili√®res √† divers amis d'Italie, 1767 Montesquieu was also highly regarded in the British colonies in North America as a champion of liberty (though not of American independence). According to one political scientist, he was the most frequently quoted authority on government and politics in colonial pre-revolutionary British America, cited more by the American founders than any source except for the Bible.. Following the American Revolution, Montesquieu's work remained a powerful influence on many of the American founders, most notably James Madison of Virginia, the \\"Father of the Constitution\\". Montesquieu's philosophy that \\"government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another\\"Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, Book 11, Chapter 6, \\"Of the Constitution of England.\\" Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library, Retrieved 1 August 2012 reminded Madison and others that a free and stable foundation for their new national government required a clearly defined and balanced separation of powers. Besides composing additional works on society and politics, Montesquieu traveled for a number of years through Europe including Austria and Hungary, spending a year in Italy and 18 months in England, where he became a freemason, admitted to the Horn Tavern Lodge in Westminster,. before resettling in France. He was troubled by poor eyesight, and was completely blind by the time he died from a high fever in 1755. He was buried in the √âglise Saint-Sulpice, Paris. Philosophy of history Montesquieu's philosophy of history minimized the role of individual persons and events. He expounded the view in Consid√©rations sur les causes de la grandeur des Romains et de leur d√©cadence that each historical event was driven by a principal movement: In discussing the transition from the Republic to the Empire, he suggested that if Caesar and Pompey had not worked to usurp the government of the Republic, other men would have risen in their place. The cause was not the ambition of Caesar or Pompey, but the ambition of man.  Political views  Montesquieu is credited as being among the progenitors, which include Herodotus and Tacitus, of anthropology ‚Äì as being among the first to extend comparative methods of classification to the political forms in human societies. Indeed, the French political anthropologist Georges Balandier considered Montesquieu to be \\"the initiator of a scientific enterprise that for a time performed the role of cultural and social anthropology\\".. According to social anthropologist D. F. Pocock, Montesquieu's The Spirit of Law was \\"the first consistent attempt to survey the varieties of human society, to classify and compare them and, within society, to study the inter-functioning of institutions.\\". , similarly describes it as \\"among the most intellectually challenging and inspired contributions to political theory in the eighteenth century. [... It] set the tone and form of modern social and political thought.\\" Montesquieu's political anthropology gave rise to his theories on government. When Catherine the Great wrote her Nakaz (Instruction) for the Legislative Assembly she had created to clarify the existing Russian law code, she avowed borrowing heavily from Montesquieu's Spirit of Law, although she discarded or altered portions that did not support Russia's absolutist bureaucratic monarchy.. Montesquieu's most influential work divided French society into three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it completely eliminated the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure. The theory of the separation of powers largely derives from The Spirit of Law: Montesquieu argues that each Power should only exercise its own functions, it was quite explicit here: If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke. Likewise, there were three main forms of government, each supported by a social \\"principle\\": monarchies (free governments headed by a hereditary figure, e.g. king, queen, emperor), which rely on the principle of honor; republics (free governments headed by popularly elected leaders), which rely on the principle of virtue; and despotisms (enslaved governments headed by dictators), which rely on fear. The free governments are dependent on fragile constitutional arrangements. Montesquieu devotes four chapters of The Spirit of the Laws to a discussion of England, a contemporary free government, where liberty was sustained by a balance of powers. Montesquieu worried that in France the intermediate powers (i.e., the nobility) which moderated the power of the prince were being eroded. These ideas of the control of power were often used in the thinking of Maximilien Robespierre. Montesquieu advocated reform of slavery in The Spirit of Law. As part of his advocacy he presented a satirical hypothetical list of arguments for slavery. While addressing French readers of his General Theory, John Maynard Keynes described Montesquieu as \\"the real French equivalent of Adam Smith, the greatest of your economists, head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration, clear-headedness and good sense (which are the qualities an economist should have).\\"See the preface to the French edition of Keynes' General Theory. See also .  Meteorological climate theory  Another example of Montesquieu's anthropological thinking, outlined in The Spirit of Law and hinted at in Persian Letters, is his meteorological climate theory, which holds that climate may substantially influence the nature of man and his society. By placing an emphasis on environmental influences as a material condition of life, Montesquieu prefigured modern anthropology's concern with the impact of material conditions, such as available energy sources, organized production systems, and technologies, on the growth of complex socio-cultural systems. He goes so far as to assert that certain climates are superior to others, the temperate climate of France being ideal. His view is that people living in very warm countries are \\"too hot-tempered\\", while those in northern countries are \\"icy\\" or \\"stiff\\". The climate of middle Europe is therefore optimal. On this point, Montesquieu may well have been influenced by a similar pronouncement in The Histories of Herodotus, where he makes a distinction between the \\"ideal\\" temperate climate of Greece as opposed to the overly cold climate of Scythia and the overly warm climate of Egypt. This was a common belief at the time, and can also be found within the medical writings of Herodotus' times, including the \\"On Airs, Waters, Places\\" of the Hippocratic corpus. One can find a similar statement in Germania by Tacitus, one of Montesquieu's favorite authors. Philip M. Parker in his book Physioeconomics endorses Montesquieu's theory and argues that much of the economic variation between countries is explained by the physiological effect of different climates. From a sociological perspective Louis Althusser, in his analysis of Montesquieu's revolution in method,. alluded to the seminal character of anthropology's inclusion of material factors, such as climate, in the explanation of social dynamics and political forms. Examples of certain climatic and geographical factors giving rise to increasingly complex social systems include those that were conducive to the rise of agriculture and the domestication of wild plants and animals.

Slave rebellions have occurred in nearly all societies that practice slavery or have practiced slavery in the past. A desire for freedom and the dream of successful rebellion are often the greatest objects of song, art, and culture amongst the enslaved population. Many of the events, however, are often violently opposed and suppressed by slaveholders. The most successful slave rebellion in history was the 18th-century Haitian Revolution, led by Toussaint Louverture and later Jean-Jacques Dessalines who won the war against their French colonial rulers, which established the modern independent state of Haiti from the former French colony of Saint-Domingue. Other famous historic slave rebellions have been led by the Roman slave Spartacus (c. 73‚Äì71 BC), as well as the thrall (Scandinavian slave) Tunni, who rebelled against the Swedish monarch Ongentheow, a rebellion that needed Danish assistance to be quelled. In the ninth century, the poet-prophet Ali bin Muhammad led imported East African slaves in Iraq during the Zanj Rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate; Nanny of the Maroons was an 18th-century leader who rebelled against the British in Jamaica; and the Quilombo dos Palmares of Brazil flourished under Ganazumba (Ganga Zumba). The 1811 German Coast Uprising in the Territory of Orleans was the largest rebellion in the continental United States; Denmark Vesey rebelled in South Carolina, and Madison Washington during the Creole case in the 19th century United States. Ancient Sparta had a special type of serf called helots who were often treated harshly, leading them to rebel. According to Herodotus (IX, 28‚Äì29), helots were seven times as numerous as Spartans. Every autumn, according to Plutarch (Life of Lycurgus, 28, 3‚Äì7), the Spartan ephors would pro forma declare war on the helot population so that any Spartan citizen could kill a helot without fear of blood or guilt in order to keep them in line (crypteia). In the Roman Empire, though the heterogeneous nature of the slave population worked against a strong sense of solidarity, slave revolts did occur and were severely punished. The most famous slave rebellion in Europe was led by Spartacus in Roman Italy, the Third Servile War. This war resulted in the 6000 surviving rebel slaves being crucified along the main roads leading into Rome. This was the third in a series of unrelated Servile Wars fought by slaves against the Romans. The English peasants' revolt of 1381 led to calls for the reform of feudalism in England and an increase in rights for serfs. The Peasants' Revolt was one of a number of popular revolts in late medieval Europe. Richard II agreed to reforms including fair rents and the abolition of serfdom. Following the collapse of the revolt, the king's concessions were quickly revoked, but the rebellion is significant because it marked the beginning of the end of serfdom in medieval England. In Russia, the slaves were usually classified as kholops. A kholop's master had unlimited power over his life. Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs. Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679. During the 16th and 17th centuries, runaway serfs and kholops known as Cossacks, (\\"outlaws\\") formed autonomous communities in the southern steppes. There were numerous rebellions against slavery and serfdom, most often in conjunction with Cossack uprisings, such as the uprisings of Ivan Bolotnikov (1606‚Äì1607), Stenka Razin (1667‚Äì1671), Kondraty Bulavin (1707‚Äì1709), and Yemelyan Pugachev (1773‚Äì1775), often involving hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions. Between the end of the Pugachev rebellion and the beginning of the 19th century, there were hundreds of outbreaks across Russia. Numerous African slave rebellions and insurrections took place in North America during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. There is documented evidence of more than 250 uprisings or attempted uprisings involving 10 or more slaves. Three of the best known in the United States during the 19th century are the revolts by Gabriel Prosser in the Richmond, Virginia area in 1800, Denmark Vesey in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822, and Nat Turner in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831. Slave resistance in the antebellum South did not gain the attention of academic historians until the 1940s, when historian Herbert Aptheker started publishing the first serious scholarly work on the subject. Aptheker stressed how rebellions were rooted in the exploitative conditions of the southern slave system. He traversed libraries and archives throughout the South, managing to uncover roughly 250 similar instances. Middle East The Zanj Rebellion was the culmination of a series of small revolts. It took place near the city of Basra, in southern Iraq over fifteen years (869‚àí883 AD). It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves, who were imported from across the Muslim empire. Europe and the Mediterranean In the 3rd century BCE, Drimakos (or Drimachus) led a slave revolt on the slave entrepot of Chios, took to the hills and directed a band of runaways in operations against their ex-masters. The Servile Wars (135 to 71 BCE) were a series of slave revolts within the Roman Republic. * The First and Second Servile War occurred in Sicily. * The Third Servile War (73 to 71 BCE) occurred in mainland Italy. Spartacus, an escaped gladiator supposedly from Thrace, became the most prominent of the rebel leaders; Marcus Licinius Crassus suppressed the insurgents. Many modern rebels (such as the Spartacus League have since regarded Spartacus as a heroic figure. Other slave revolts occurred elsewhere. * Eumenes III, king of Pergamon from 133 to 129 BCE, promised freedom to slaves to draw support against the Roman Republic. A number of slave revolts occurred in the Mediterranean area during the early modern period: * 1748: Hungarian, Georgian and Maltese slaves on board the Ottoman ship Lupa revolted and sailed the ship to Malta. * 1749: Conspiracy of the Slaves ‚Äì Muslim slaves in Malta planned to rebel and take over the island, but plans leaked out beforehand and the would-be rebels were arrested and many were executed. * 1760: Christian slaves on board the Ottoman ship Corona Ottomana revolted and sailed the ship to Malta. S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe On 9 July 1595, Rei Amador, and his people, the Angolars, allied with other enslaved Africans of its plantations, marched into the interior woods and battled against the Portuguese. It is said that day, Rei Amador and his followers raised a flag in front of the settlers and proclaimed Rei Amador as king of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, making himself as \\"Rei Amador, liberator of all the black people\\". Between 1595 and 1596, the island of S√£o Tom√© was ruled by the Angolars, under the command of Rei Amador. On 4 January 1596, he was captured, sent to prison and was later executed by the Portuguese. Still today, they remember him fondly and consider him a national hero of the islands. In the first decades of the 17th century, there were frequent slave revolts in the Portuguese colony of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, off the African shore, which damaged the sugar crop cultivation there.

St. John, 1733, in what was then the Danish West Indies. The St. John's Slave Rebellion is one of the earliest and longest lasting slave rebellions in the Americas. It ended with defeat, however, and many rebels, including one of the leaders Breffu, committed suicide rather than being recaptured. The most successful slave uprising was the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791 and was eventually led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, culminating in the independent black republic of Haiti. Panama also has an extensive history of slave rebellions going back to the 16th century. Slaves were brought to the isthmus from many regions in Africa, including the modern day countries of the Congo, Senegal, Guinea, and Mozambique. Immediately before their arrival on shore, or very soon after, many enslaved Africans revolted against their captors or participated in mass maroonage or desertion. The freed Africans founded communities in the forests and mountains, organized guerrilla bands known as Cimarrones. They began a long guerrilla war against the Spanish Conquistadores, sometimes in conjunction with nearby indigenous communities like the Kuna and the Guaym√≠. Despite massacres by the Spanish, the rebels fought until the Spanish crown was forced to concede to treaties that granted the Africans a life without Spanish violence and incursions. The leaders of the guerrilla revolts included Felipillo, Bayano, Juan de Dioso, Domingo Congo, Ant√≥n Mandinga, and Luis de Mozambique. In the 1730s, the militias of the Colony of Jamaica fought the Jamaican Maroons for a decade, before agreeing to sign peace treaties in 1739 and 1740, which recognised their freedom in five separate Maroon Towns. Tacky's War (1760) was a slave uprising in Jamaica, which ran from May to July before it was put down by the British colonial government. The Suriname slave rebellion was marked by constant guerrilla warfare by Maroons and in 1765-1793 by the Aluku. This rebellion was led by Boni. The Berbice slave revolt in Guyana in 1763 was led by Cuffy. Cuba had slave revolts in 1795, 1798, 1802, 1805, 1812 (the Aponte revolt), 1825, 1827, 1829, 1833, 1834, 1835, 1838, 1839‚Äì43 and 1844 (the La Escalera conspiracy and revolt). Revolts on the Caribbean Islands Demerara rebellion of 1823 Vincent Brown, a professor of History and of African and African-American Studies at Harvard, has made a study of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. In 2013, Brown teamed up with Axis Maps to create an interactive map of Jamaican slave uprisings in the 18th century called, ‚ÄúSlave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761, A Cartographic Narrative.‚ÄùAxismaps.com Brown's efforts have shown that the slave insurrection in Jamaica in 1760-61 was a carefully planned affair and not a spontaneous, chaotic eruption, as was often argued (due in large part to the lack of written records produced by the insurgents).Colorlines.com Later, in 1795, several slave rebellions broke out across the Caribbean, influenced by the Haitian Revolution: *In Jamaica, the descendants of Africans who fought and escaped from slavery and established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica (Maroons), fought to preserve their freedom from British colonialists, in what came to be known as the Second Maroon War.

Bar alt; Publisher Markus Wiener Publishers; , Brazil Many slave rebellions occurred in Brazil, most famously the Bahia Rebellion of 1822-1830 and the Mal√™ Revolt of 1835 by the predominantly Muslim West African slaves at the time. The term mal√™ was commonly used to refer to Muslims at the time from the Yoruba word imale.  North America  Numerous black slave rebellions and insurrections took place in North America during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. There is documentary evidence of more than 250 uprisings or attempted uprisings involving ten or more slaves. Three of the best known in the United States during the 19th century are the revolts by Gabriel Prosser in Virginia in 1800, Denmark Vesey in Charleston, South Carolina in 1822, and Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831. Drapetomania was a supposed mental illness invented by American physician Samuel A. Cartwright in 1851 that allegedly caused black slaves to run away. Today, drapetomania is considered an example of pseudoscience, and part of the edifice of scientific racism. Slave resistance in the antebellum South did not gain the attention of academic historians until the 1940s, when historian Herbert Aptheker started publishing the first serious scholarly work on the subject. Aptheker stressed how rebellions were rooted in the exploitative conditions of the Southern slave system. He traversed libraries and archives throughout the South, managing to uncover roughly 250 similar instances. The 1811 German Coast Uprising, which took place in rural southeast Louisiana, at that time the Territory of Orleans, early in 1811, involved up to 500 insurgent slaves. It was suppressed by white militias and a detachment of the United States Army. In retaliation for the deaths of two white men and the destruction of property, the authorities killed at least 40 black men in a violent confrontation (the numbers cited are inconsistent); at least 29 more were executed (combined figures from two jurisdictions, St. Charles Parish and Orleans Parish). There was a third jurisdiction for a tribunal and what amounted to summary judgments against the accused, St. John the Baptist Parish. Fewer than 20 men are said to have escaped; some of those were later caught and killed, on their way to freedom. Although only involving about seventy slaves and free Blacks, Turner's 1831 rebellion is considered to be a significant event in American history. The rebellion caused the slave-holding South to go into a panic. Fifty-five men, women, and children were killed, and enslaved Blacks freed on multiple plantations in Southampton County, Virginia, as Turner and his fellow rebels attacked the White institution of plantation slavery. Turner and the other rebels were eventually stopped by state White militias (Aptheker, 1993). The rebellion resulted in the hanging of about 56 slaves, including Nat Turner himself. Up to 200 other blacks were killed during the hysteria which followed, few of whom likely had anything to do with the uprising. Fears afterwards led to new legislation passed by Southern states prohibiting the movement, assembly, and education of slaves, and reducing the rights of free people of color. In addition, the Virginia legislature considered abolishing slavery to prevent further rebellions. In a close vote, however, the state decided to keep slaves. The abolitionist John Brown had already fought against pro-slavery forces in Bleeding Kansas for several years when he decided to lead a raid on a Federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. This raid was a joint attack by former slaves, freed blacks, and white men who had corresponded with slaves on plantations in order to create a general uprising among slaves. Brown carried hundreds of copies of the constitution for a new republic of former slaves in the Appalachians. But they were never distributed, and the slave uprisings that were to have helped Brown did not happen. Some believe that he knew the raid was doomed but went ahead anyway, because of the support for abolition it would (and did) generate. The U.S. military, led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, easily overwhelmed Brown's forces. But directly following this, slave disobedience and the number of runaways increased markedly in Virginia.Louis A. DeCaro Jr., John Brown ‚Äì The Cost of Freedom: Selections from His Life & Letters (New York: International Publishers, 2007), p. 16. The historian Steven Hahn proposes that the self- organized involvement of slaves in the Union Army during the American Civil War composed a slave rebellion that dwarfed all others. Similarly, tens of thousands of slaves joined British forces or escaped to British lines during the American Revolution, sometimes using the disruption of war to gain freedom. For instance, when the British evacuated from Charleston and Savannah, they took 10,000 slaves with them. They also evacuated slaves from New York, taking more than 3,000 for resettlement to Nova Scotia, where they were recorded as Black Loyalists and given land grants.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 73‚Äì77 North American slave revolts *San Miguel de Gualdape (1526) *Bayano's War (1548) *Gaspar Yanga's Revolt (c. 1570) near the Mexican city of Veracruz; the group escaped to the highlands and built a free colony *Gloucester County, Virginia Revolt (1663)Joseph Cephas Carroll, Slave Insurrections in the United States, 1800‚Äì1865, p. 13 *New York Slave Revolt of 1712 *Samba Rebellion (1731) *Stono Rebellion (1739) *New York Slave Insurrection of 1741 *1791 Mina conspiracy *Pointe Coup√©e conspiracy (1794) *Gabriel's conspiracy (1800) *Rebellions in a dozen North Carolina counties (May and June, 1802) *Igbo Landing slave escape (1803) *Chatham Manor Rebellion (1805) * Slaves in three North Carolina counties conspire to poison their owners, in some cases successfully.

Although the slave trade was officially abolished in the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act of 1807, and slavery itself a generation later with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, it took until 1850 to be halted in the territories which were to become South Africa. Giliomee, Hermann (2003). \\"The Afrikaners\\", Chapter 4 - Masters, Slaves and Servants, the fear of gelykstelling, Page 93,94 Slave ship revolts There are 485 recorded instances of slaves revolting on board slave ships. A few of these ships endured more than one uprising during their career. Most accounts of revolts aboard slave ships are given by Europeans. There are few examples of accounts by slaves themselves. William Snelgrave reported that the slaves that revolted on the British ship Henry in 1721 claimed that those who had captured them were \\"Rogues to buy them\\" and that they were bent on regaining their liberty. Another example that Richardson gives is that of James Towne who gives the account of slaves stating that Europeans did not have the right to enslave and take them away from their homeland and \\"wives and children.\\" Richardson compares several factors that contributed to slave revolts on board ships: conditions on the ships, geographical location, and proximity to the shore. He suggests that revolts were more likely to occur when a ship was still in sight of the shore. The threat of attack from the shore by other Africans was also a concern. If the ship was hit by disease and a large portion of the crew had been killed, the chances of insurrection were higher. Where the slaves were captured also had an effect on the amount of insurrections. In many places, such as the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra, the percentage of revolts and the percentage of the slave trade match up. Yet ships taking slaves from Senegambia experienced 22 percent of shipboard revolts while only contributing to four and a half percent of the slave trade. Slaves coming from West Central Africa accounted for 44 percent of the trade while only experiencing 11 percent of total revolts. Lorenzo J. Greene gives many accounts of slave revolts on ships coming out of New England. These ships belonged to Puritans who controlled much of the slave trade in New England. Most revolts on board ships were unsuccessful. The crews of these ships, while outnumbered, were disciplined, well fed, and armed with muskets, swords, and sometimes cannons, and they were always on guard for resistance. The slaves on the other hand were the opposite, armed only with bits of wood and the chains that bound them. However, some captives were able to take over the ships that were their prisons and regain their freedom. On October 5, 1764 the New Hampshire ship Adventure captained by John Millar was successfully taken by its cargo. The slaves on board revolted while the ship was anchored off the coast and all but two of the crew, including Captain Millar, had succumbed to disease. Another successful slave revolt occurred six days after the ship Little George had left the Guinea coast. The ship carried ninety-six slaves, thirty-five of which were male. The slaves attacked in the early hours of the morning, easily overpowering the two men on guard. The slaves were able to get one of the cannons on board loaded and fired it at the crew. After taking control of the ship they sailed it up the Sierra Leone River and escaped. After having defended themselves for several days below decks with muskets the crew lowered a small boat into the river to escape. After nine days of living off of raw rice they were rescued. There is one factor that is not addressed by either Richardson or Greene. That is of enslaved sailors on slave ships. While Mariana P. Candido doesn't write explicitly on revolts, she does discuss there being enslaved Africans working on the ships that transported other Africans into slavery. These men, 230 in all, were used onboard of slave ships for their ability to communicate with the slaves being brought on board and to translate between Captain and Slaver. Enslaved sailors were able to alleviate some of the fears that newly boarded slaves had, such as being eaten. This was a double-edged sword. The enslaved sailors sometimes joined other slaves in the revolts against the captain they served. In 1812 enslaved sailors joined a revolt on board the Portuguese ship Feliz Eugenia just off the coast of Benguela. The revolt took place below decks. The sailors, along with many of the children that were on board, were able to escape using small boats.

Baker and his son C. Graham Baker. It is a variant of rummy. It has enjoyed widespread popularity as both a social and a gambling game, especially during the mid twentieth century, and remains today one of the most widely-played two-player card games. History Magician and writer John Scarne believes gin rummy to have evolved from 19th-century whiskey poker (a game similar to Commerce, with players forming poker combinations) and to have been created with the intention of being faster than standard rummy but less spontaneous than knock rummy. David Parlett finds Scarne's theory to be \\"highly implausible\\", and considers the game of Conquian to be gin rummy's forerunner. Deck Gin rummy is played with a standard 52-card pack of cards. The ranking from high to low is King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace. Objective The objective in gin rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more, usually more than 100, before the opponent does. The basic game strategy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. ; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit, such as or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low‚Äîthey can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs ( is a legal run but is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand; all sets, all runs, or some sets and some runs. The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards‚Äîaces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set and a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood. For example; within the five cards , the seven of diamonds can be included in the set () or included in the run (), but it cannot be included in both. Dealing Dealership alternates from round to round, with the first dealer chosen by any agreed upon method. The dealer deals 10 cards to each player one at a time starting with their opponent, and then places the next card in the deck face up. This begins the discard pile. The face down pile is known as the stock pile.  Playing  On the first turn of the round, the non-dealing player has first option of taking the upcard on the discard pile or passing. If the non-dealing player takes the upcard, they must then discard a different card to the discard pile. The player acting second can take the top card from the pile of their choice. However, if the non-dealing player passes the upcard, the dealer is given the opportunity to take the upcard or pass. If the dealer also passes, the non- dealing player must draw from the stock pile, then the next turn and after, players can draw from the pile of their choice. On each subsequent turn, a player must draw either the (face-up) top card of the discard pile, or the (face-down) top card from the stock pile, and discard one card from their hand onto the discard pile. Players alternate taking turns until one player ends the round by knocking, going Gin, or until only two cards remain in the stock pile, in which case the round ends in a draw and no points are awarded. The game ends when a player reaches 100 or more points (or another established amount). In tournament rules the game is played in best of five with 250 points per game. Knocking In standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down. To knock, the knocking player discards as usual, announces knocking (generally by simply placing a discard face down), and the hand is laid out with the melds clearly indicated and deadwood separated. The other (\\"defending\\") player is then entitled to lay out any melds in their hand and can then lay off any of their remaining deadwood cards that fit into the knocking player's melds, provided that the knocking player does not have a gin hand. For example, the knocking player has a meld of three Kings. The defending player's deadwood has a king. The player can lay off that king, reducing the deadwood count by ten. The knocking player can never lay off their deadwood into the defending player's melds. Once a player knocks or declares gin the round is over and scores are tallied, players cannot draw. The knocking player then subtracts their deadwood points from the defending player's deadwood points. The result is the number of points the knocking player receives. An undercut occurs if a player knocks and the defending player's deadwood points are less than or equal to the knocking player's. In this case the defending player receives an undercut bonus (usually 25 points) plus the difference in deadwood points. If the defending player has less or equal deadwood to the knocking player's deadwood after laying off any of their deadwood, then it is still a valid undercut. Gin Cards played from a Gin hand If all 10 cards in a player's hand fit into melds and thereby the player has no deadwood, they can choose to go Gin in which case the round ends and the player going Gin receives a Gin bonus of 25 points (or another established amount) plus any deadwood points in the opponent's hand. The defending opponent can only lay out their melds and cannot lay off any deadwood into the melds of an opponent that has declared Gin. A player can go Gin with a hand of three or fewer melds as long as all cards fit into a meld. Players can also have an 11 card gin, see Big Gin Variant below. Big Gin Gin hands normally consist of 10 cards. However, if a player chooses to draw so that 11 cards fit into melds, they can declare Big Gin in which case the player receives a Big Gin bonus of 31 points (or another established amount, commonly 50 points instead of the standard 31 points, depending on rule set) plus any deadwood in the opponent's hand. Scoring Aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and all other cards are scored at their numerical values. The number of points awarded for bonuses may vary from region to region. No matter what the bonus amounts are, points are scored in Gin for the following: ; Knock points :After a player knocks, and the layoffs are made, the knocking player receives a score equal to the difference between the two hands. For example, if a player knocks with 8, and the defender has 10 deadwood points in their hand after laying off, the knocking player receives 2 points for the hand. If a player is able to knock before any cards are accepted, it is considered a misdeal. ; Gin bonus : After going gin, a player receives a bonus of 25 points plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent's hand. There is no chance to lay off when a player goes gin. ; Undercut (or underknocking) : Occurs when the defending player has a deadwood count lower than or equal to that of the knocking player (this can occur either naturally or by laying off after a knock). In this case, the defender scores an undercut bonus of 25 points plus the difference in deadwood in the knocking player's hand. (In some rule sets, the bonus is only 10 or 20 points, or is not awarded in case of a tie.) ; Game bonus :Once a player has acquired 500 points (or some other agreed-upon number) the game is over, and that player receives a game bonus of 100 points (or another agreed-upon number). ; Line bonus or box bonus :Added at the end of the game. For every hand a player won during the game, 25 points is added to their score. ; Big gin : Prior to knocking, if all 11 cards in a player's hand form a legal gin, the player can retain the extra card as part of their hand, and is awarded 31 points plus entire count of deadwood in their opponent's hand. (In some rule sets players may be awarded 50 points or another established amount plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent's hand) ; Shutout bonus : If a game is completed with the winner having won every hand, the points for each hand are doubled before adding the line bonus. In some variations, if the winning player beats the losing player by exactly 50 points, the winning player must forfeit the match. Variations Straight gin In straight gin, players are required to play until one of them can go gin. Knocking is not allowed. Scoring and rules remain the same as standard gin rummy. Mahjong gin Similar to straight gin, knocking is not allowed. However, more than one card may be taken, in order, from the top of the discard pile. If more than one card is taken, the lowest position card taken must be used in a hand: e.g. is the lowest position card and must be used in a hand; continue with one discard). Cards are shown to the table, with opponents being able to add on to straights of the same suit or finish a three of a kind with the fourth card for points. After a player has gin, points are added, with cards on the table being added up and cards in hand being subtracted. The player who gins receives 25 additional points, 2 through 9 = 5 points, 10 through K = 10 points, A = 15 points. Oklahoma gin In this version of gin rummy, the value of the first upcard is used to determine the maximum count at which players can knock. If the upcard is a spade, the hand will count double. So if the first upcard was a 4, you can knock and go out with only 4 or fewer points in your hand; and if the card was , you would get double points that hand. Another version in this variation (mostly in match play) and in Hollywood gin (see below), a second deck of cards will be used to determine the knock value of a hand. The knock value card will be dealt from the bottom and turned over on top. Above rules apply but both players are dealt ten cards with the last hand winner picking first from the deck. Hollywood gin This is a scoring style, not a rules change to the game of gin. In Hollywood gin, scoring is kept for three different games at the same time. A player's first win will be recorded in their column in Game One. A player's second win will be recorded in their columns for both Game One and Game Two. Their third win will be recorded in their column for all three games. Hands are played until all three games are finished. Tedesco gin Similar to Oklahoma gin, except aces can be used high or low, and runs can be formed \\"around the corner\\" (such as ). If you are caught with an unmelded ace, it counts as 15 points against you. Hollywood scoring of three games to 200 when playing head-to-head or with two-person teams. Three-person teams play to 300, 25 points extra if all three teammates win. 50 points for four-person team, etc. This is a more complex gin game for all levels of player. Single match When a single match is to be played, the players will continue to play rounds until one player has 100 points or more. This player wins the match. Multi-match In multi-match games, match scores are reset to zero with the start of each match, while game scores accumulate until a predetermined winning score is reached, perhaps 500 or higher. Each individual match ends when one player scores 100 match points. At the end of the match, players' match scores are credited toward their game scores, as well as: *25 game points for each individual round won, *100 game points to the winner of the match, and *100 bonus game points to the match winner if the loser won no rounds. Notable players *Stu Ungar, widely regarded as the greatest gin rummy player of all time, was described by many as having a near clairvoyant ability to see his opponents' hands. Ungar's almost total dominance of the game during the 1970s and 1980s is thought to have been a factor in the decline of gin rummy as a tournament game in Las Vegas and other gambling venues. (Ungar eventually switched to poker.) *Oswald Jacoby, best known as a contract bridge and backgammon champion, also played high-stakes gin rummy and wrote several books on the game. *Ernie Kovacs, the comedian and television pioneer, published a book in 1962 called How to Talk at Gin. ;Fictional characters *The villain Auric Goldfinger cheats at gin rummy in the key introduction scene of the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964), with the help of an accomplice looking at the opponent's cards through binoculars.

Geophysics () is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. The term geophysics sometimes refers only to geological applications: Earth's shape; its gravitational and magnetic fields; its internal structure and composition; its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of magmas, volcanism and rock formation. However, modern geophysics organizations and pure scientists use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and other planets. Gutenberg, B., 1929, Lehrbuch der Geophysik. Leipzig. Berlin (Gebruder Borntraeger). Runcorn, S.K, (editor-in-chief), 1967, International dictionary of geophysics:. Pergamon, Oxford, 2 volumes, 1,728 pp., 730 fig Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from lodestones, while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics. Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as mineral resources, mitigation of natural hazards and environmental protection. In Exploration geophysics, geophysical survey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.  Physical phenomena  Geophysics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, and geophysicists contribute to every area of the Earth sciences. To provide a clearer idea of what constitutes geophysics, this section describes phenomena that are studied in physics and how they relate to the Earth and its surroundings. In Geophysics, principles of Physics are applied to study the \\"Interior\\" of the Earth. Depending on the problem under study, one has to decide which method should be applied. e.g. for ground water surveys, Electrical method is helpful. For mineral deposits, one can adopt Gravity and/or Magnetic surveys. For Oil & Natural Gas, one has to carry out Gravity, Magnetic surveys to get rough idea about structure of rock formations. If the desired structure is existing, for detailed study of rock formations, one has to carry out Seismic and/or Magneto-telluric surveys.  Gravity  alt=Image of globe combining color with topography. The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun give rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day, or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide and between every low tide. Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth increases. Measurements of gravitational acceleration and gravitational potential at the Earth's surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see gravity anomaly and gravimetry). The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of tectonic plates. The geopotential surface called the geoid is one definition of the shape of the Earth. The geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals).  Heat flow  A model of alt=Pseudocolor image in vertical profile. The Earth is cooling, and the resulting heat flow generates the Earth's magnetic field through the geodynamo and plate tectonics through mantle convection. The main sources of heat are the primordial heat and radioactivity, although there are also contributions from phase transitions. Heat is mostly carried to the surface by thermal convection, although there are two thermal boundary layers ‚Äì the core-mantle boundary and the lithosphere ‚Äì in which heat is transported by conduction. Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the mantle by mantle plumes. The heat flow at the Earth's surface is about , and it is a potential source of geothermal energy.  Vibrations  Illustration of the deformations of a block by body waves and surface waves (see alt=Deformed blocks with grids on surface. Seismic waves are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior or along its surface. The entire Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called normal modes or free oscillations of the Earth. Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using seismographs. If the waves come from a localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection. Recording of seismic waves from controlled sources provide information on the region that the waves travel through. If the density or composition of the rock changes, waves are reflected. Reflections recorded using Reflection Seismology can provide a wealth of information on the structure of the earth up to several kilometers deep and are used to increase our understanding of the geology as well as to explore for oil and gas. Changes in the travel direction, called refraction, can be used to infer the deep structure of the Earth. Earthquakes pose a risk to humans. Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake (e.g., intraplate or deep focus), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in earthquake engineering.  Electricity  Although we mainly notice electricity during thunderstorms, there is always a downward electric field near the surface that averages 120 volts per meter. Relative to the solid Earth, the atmosphere has a net positive charge due to bombardment by cosmic rays. A current of about 1800 amperes flows in the global circuit. It flows downward from the ionosphere over most of the Earth and back upwards through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and sprites above. A variety of electric methods are used in geophysical survey. Some measure spontaneous potential, a potential that arises in the ground because of man-made or natural disturbances. Telluric currents flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: electromagnetic induction by the time-varying, external-origin geomagnetic field and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic field. The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in electrical resistivity of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see induced polarization and electrical resistivity tomography).  Electromagnetic waves  Electromagnetic waves occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as in Earth's outer core. Dawn chorus is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the Van Allen radiation belt. Whistlers are produced by lightning strikes. Hiss may be generated by both. Electromagnetic waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see seismo- electromagnetics). In the highly conductive liquid iron of the outer core, magnetic fields are generated by electric currents through electromagnetic induction. Alfv√©n waves are magnetohydrodynamic waves in the magnetosphere or the Earth's core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the Earth's magnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic Rossby waves may be one source of geomagnetic secular variation. Electromagnetic methods that are used for geophysical survey include transient electromagnetics, magnetotellurics, surface nuclear magnetic resonance and electromagnetic seabed logging.  Magnetism  The Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly solar wind and has long been used for navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the outer core. The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the auroras. alt=Diagram with field lines, axes and magnet lines. The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted dipole, but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the geomagnetic pole stays near the geographic pole, but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These geomagnetic reversals, analyzed within a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the Laschamp event occurring 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. Geologists observed geomagnetic reversal recorded in volcanic rocks, through magnetostratigraphy correlation (see natural remanent magnetization) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on seafloor spreading, a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of magnetostratigraphy, which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales. In addition, the magnetization in rocks can be used to measure the motion of continents.  Radioactivity  Example of a radioactive decay chain (see alt=Diagram with compound balls representing nuclei and arrows. Radioactive decay accounts for about 80% of the Earth's internal heat, powering the geodynamo and plate tectonics. The main heat-producing isotopes are potassium-40, uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232. Radioactive elements are used for radiometric dating, the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in geochronology. Unstable isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different isotopes cover several orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past geologic eras. Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne gamma spectrometry can be used to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth's surface, which is useful for mapping lithology and alteration.  Fluid dynamics  Fluid motions occur in the magnetosphere, atmosphere, ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an enormous viscosity, flows like a fluid over long time intervals. This flow is reflected in phenomena such as isostasy, post-glacial rebound and mantle plumes. The mantle flow drives plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the geodynamo. Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in physical oceanography and meteorology. The rotation of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth's fluid dynamics, often due to the Coriolis effect. In the atmosphere it gives rise to large-scale patterns like Rossby waves and determines the basic circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as Kelvin waves and Ekman spirals at the ocean surface. In the Earth's core, the circulation of the molten iron is structured by Taylor columns. Waves and other phenomena in the magnetosphere can be modeled using magnetohydrodynamics.  Mineral physics  The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth's interior from seismology, the geothermal gradient and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the elastic properties of minerals; their high-pressure phase diagrams, melting points and equations of state at high pressure; and the rheological properties of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation of rocks by creep make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The viscosity of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn determines the rates at which tectonic plates move. Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life. Its physical properties shape the hydrosphere and are an essential part of the water cycle and climate. Its thermodynamic properties determine evaporation and the thermal gradient in the atmosphere. The many types of precipitation involve a complex mixture of processes such as coalescence, supercooling and supersaturation. Some precipitated water becomes groundwater, and groundwater flow includes phenomena such as percolation, while the conductivity of water makes electrical and electromagnetic methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as salinity have a large effect on its motion in the oceans. The many phases of ice form the cryosphere and come in forms like ice sheets, glaciers, sea ice, freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or permafrost).  Regions of the Earth   Size and form of the Earth  The Earth is roughly spherical, but it bulges towards the Equator, so it is roughly in the shape of an ellipsoid (see Earth ellipsoid). This bulge is due to its rotation and is nearly consistent with an Earth in hydrostatic equilibrium. The detailed shape of the Earth, however, is also affected by the distribution of continents and ocean basins, and to some extent by the dynamics of the plates.  Structure of the interior  alt=Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths. Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior ‚Äì its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity () is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia (, compared to for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams‚ÄìWilliamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals. Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure. Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity. The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature- dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see post- perovskite) and supplemented by seismic tomography. The mantle is mainly composed of silicates, and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions. The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes plate tectonics possible.  Magnetosphere  alt=Diagram with colored surfaces and lines. If a planet's magnetic field is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early space probes mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.  Methods  Geodesy Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of geodesy. While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the American Geophysical Union, the Canadian Geophysical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics encompass both. Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the global positioning system (GPS). A three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to the 1980 Geodetic Reference System. An alternative, optical astronomy, combines astronomical coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth such as nutation and Chandler wobble. Relative positions of two or more points can be determined using very-long-baseline interferometry. Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using gravimeters deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth's gravity field has been measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using radar altimetry, contributing to a more accurate geoid. In 2002, NASA launched the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), wherein two twin satellites map variations in Earth's gravity field by making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system. Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers. Satellites and space probes Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics. Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the gravity fields of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above lunar maria were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, mascons, beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.  History  Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of physical geography, geology, astronomy, meteorology, and physics. However, many geophysical phenomena ‚Äì such as the Earth's magnetic field and earthquakes ‚Äì have been investigated since the ancient era.  Ancient and classical eras  Replica of alt=Picture of ornate urn-like device with spouts in the shape of dragons The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for feng shui as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD. In circa 240 BC, Eratosthenes of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the circumference of Earth with great precision. He developed a system of latitude and longitude. Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a seismoscope by the prolific inventor Zhang Heng in 132 AD. This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in Europe, by Jean de la Hautefeuille. It was never built.  Beginnings of modern science  One of the publications that marked the beginning of modern science was William Gilbert's De Magnete (1600), a report of a series of meticulous experiments in magnetism. Gilbert deduced that compasses point north because the Earth itself is magnetic. In 1687 Isaac Newton published his Principia, which not only laid the foundations for classical mechanics and gravitation but also explained a variety of geophysical phenomena such as the tides and the precession of the equinox. Section 3 The first seismometer, an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built by James Forbes in 1844.

terms, a shelled gastropod. The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs. Snails have considerable human relevance, including as food items, as pests, and as vectors of disease, and their shells are used as decorative objects and are incorporated into jewelry. The snail has also had some cultural significance, tending to be associated with patience. The snail has also been used as a metaphor: someone who is not moving fast enough is \\"slow as a snail.\\" The snail is the same or similar shape as the Cochlea. Overview Video of snails (most likely Natica chemnitzi and Cerithium stercusmuscaram) feeding on the sea floor in the Gulf of California, Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico, 50 sec Video of snail after rain, 31 sec Snails that respire using a lung belong to the group Pulmonata. As traditionally defined, the Pulmonata were found to be polyphyletic in a molecular study per J√∂rger et al., dating from 2010. But snails with gills also form a polyphyletic group; in other words, snails with lungs and snails with gills form a number of taxonomic groups that are not necessarily more closely related to each other than they are related to some other groups. Both snails that have lungs and snails that have gills have diversified so widely over geological time that a few species with gills can be found on land and numerous species with lungs can be found in freshwater. Even a few marine species have lungs. Snails can be found in a very wide range of environments, including ditches, deserts, and the abyssal depths of the sea. Although land snails may be more familiar to laymen, marine snails constitute the majority of snail species, and have much greater diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water. Most snails have thousands of microscopic tooth-like structures located on a banded ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The radula works like a file, ripping food into small pieces. Many snails are herbivorous, eating plants or rasping algae from surfaces with their radulae, though a few land species and many marine species are omnivores or predatory carnivores. Snails cannot absorb colored pigments when eating paper or cardboard so their feces are also colored. Several species of the genus Achatina and related genera are known as giant African land snails; some grow to from snout to tail, and weigh . The largest living species of sea snail is Syrinx aruanus; its shell can measure up to in length, and the whole animal with the shell can weigh up to . Recently, the smallest land snails, Angustopila dominikae, have been discovered in China, and measure 0.86mm long. Snail moving on a wet ground Snail moving across leaves. The snail Lymnaea makes decisions by using only two types of neurons: one deciding whether the snail is hungry, and the other deciding whether there is food in the vicinity. The largest known land gastropod is the African giant snail Achatina achatina, the largest recorded specimen of which measured from snout to tail when fully extended, with a shell length of in December 1978. It weighed exactly 900 g (2 lb). Named Gee Geronimo, this snail was owned by Christopher Hudson (1955‚Äì79) of Hove, East Sussex, UK, and was collected in Sierra Leone in June 1976. Diet Snails feed at night. They feed primarily on decaying organic matter. Their diet also includes fungi, lichens, green foliage, worms, centipedes, insects, animal feces, carrion, and other slugs. Some snails feed on other snails too. Types of snails by habitat Slugs Slug Gastropods that lack a conspicuous shell are commonly called slugs rather than snails. Some species of slug have a maroon-brown shell, some have only an internal vestige that serves mainly as a calcium lactate repository, and others have some to no shell at all. Other than that there is little morphological difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior. A shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs. Slugs as a group are far from monophyletic; scientifically speaking \\"slug\\" is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another. Human relevance Cornu aspersum ‚Äì garden snail Land snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household pets. In addition, their mucus can also be used for skin care products. In agriculture There are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated garlic or wormwood solutions. Copper metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as diatomaceous earth can also deter snails.Sanders, April. \\"Do Egg Shells Help Stop Snails From Eating Plants?\\" Home Guides  SF Gate. Accessed 01 July 2019. The decollate snail (Rumina decollata) will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a biological pest control agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region. As food French cooked snails In French cuisine, edible snails are served for instance in Escargot √† la Bourguignonne. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as heliciculture. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. Coppiced wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of hibernation and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender. As well as being relished as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of protein to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in banana plantations. In some countries, giant African land snails are produced commercially for food. Land snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many countries. In certain parts of the world, snails are fried as for example, in Indonesia, they are fried as satay, a dish known as sate kakul. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way caviar is eaten. In Bulgaria, snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are Helix lucorum and Helix pomatia. =Famine food= Snails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as famine food in historical times. A history of Scotland written in the 1800s recounts a description of various snails and their use as food items in times of plague. (Also quoted here. Cosmetic Skin creams derived from Cornu aspersum snails are sold for use on wrinkles, scars, dry skin, and acne. A research study suggested that secretions produced under stress by Cornu aspersa might facilitate regeneration of wounded tissue. Parasitic diseases Snails can also be associated with parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, angiostrongyliasis, fasciolopsiasis, opisthorchiasis, fascioliasis, paragonimiasis and clonorchiasis, which can be transmitted to humans. Cultural depictions Land snails (Scutalus sp.) on a Moche pot, 200 AD, Larco Museum Collection, Lima, Peru  Symbolism  Because of its slowness, the snail has traditionally been seen as a symbol of laziness. In Christian culture, it has been used as a symbol of the deadly sin of sloth. Psalms uses snail slime as a metaphorical punishment. In Mayan mythology, the snail is associated with sexual desire, being personified by the god Uayeb.Susan Milbrath, Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars, University of Texas Press, 01/01/2010  Divination and other religious uses  Snails were widely noted and used in divination. The Greek poet Hesiod wrote that snails signified the time to harvest by climbing the stalks, while the Aztec moon god Tecciztecatl bore a snail shell on his back. This symbolised rebirth; the snail's penchant for appearing and disappearing was analogised with the moon.  Love darts and Cupid  The use of love darts by the land snail Monachoides vicinus is a form of sexual selection Professor Ronald Chase of McGill University in Montreal has suggested the ancient myth of Cupid's arrows might be based on early observations of the love dart behavior of the land snail species Cornu aspersum.  Metaphor  In contemporary speech, the expression \\"a snail's pace\\" is often used to describe a slow, inefficient process. The phrase \\"snail mail\\" is used to mean regular postal service delivery of paper messages as opposed to the delivery of email, which can be virtually instantaneous.  In Indonesian mythology  Dewi Sekartaji as Keong Emas Keong Emas (Javanese and Indonesian for Golden Snail) is a popular Javanese folklore about a princess magically transformed and contained in a golden snail shell. The folklore is a part of popular Javanese Panji cycle telling the stories about the prince Panji Asmoro Bangun (also known as Raden Inu Kertapati) and his consort, princess Dewi Sekartaji (also known as Dewi Chandra Kirana). Textiles Certain varieties of snails, notably the family Muricidae, produce a secretion that is a color-fast natural dye. The ancient Tyrian purple was made in this way as were other purple and blue dyes. The extreme expense of extracting this secretion is sufficient quantities limited its use to the very wealthy. It is such dyes as these that led to certain shades of purple and blue being associated with royalty and wealth.  As pets  Throughout history, snails have been kept as pets. There are many famous snails such as Lefty (Born Jeremy) and within fiction, Gary and Brian the snail .

It was the first of what the Chinese later called the unequal treaties.Hoe, Susanna; Roebuck, Derek (1999). The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters. Routledge. p. 203. . In the wake of China's military defeat, with British warships poised to attack Nanking, British and Chinese officials negotiated on board HMS Cornwallis anchored at the city. On 29 August, British representative Sir Henry Pottinger and Qing representatives Qiying, Yilibu, and Niu Jian signed the treaty, which consisted of thirteen articles. The treaty was ratified by the Daoguang Emperor on 27 October and Queen Victoria on 28 December. Ratification was exchanged in Hong Kong on 26 June 1843. A copy of the treaty is kept by the British government while another copy is kept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of China at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan. Background Britain was importing and selling large quantities of opium to China because it was very profitable and helped balance Britain's trade deficit resulting from its importation of Chinese goods, such as tea. Britain forced peasants in its colony, India, to grow opium poppies so it could sell the opium in China, although the importation and sale of opium were illegal under Chinese law. When a Chinese government official seized British opium cargo in 1841, Britain declared what became known as the first Opium War. Britain won the war and was in a position to impose on the vanquished Chinese a one-sided treaty with onerous treaty obligations.Ha-Joon Chang, \\"Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism,\\" (New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008), p. 24 The first working draft for articles of a treaty was prepared at the Foreign Office in London in February 1840. The Foreign Office was aware that preparing a treaty containing Chinese and English characters would need special consideration. Given the distance separating the countries, it was realised that some flexibility and a departure from established procedure in preparing treaties might be required.Wood, R. Derek (May 1996). \\"The Treaty of Nanking: Form and the Foreign Office, 1842‚Äì43\\". The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 24 (2): 181‚Äì196. Terms Replica of the treaty at the Hong Kong Museum of History Foreign trade The fundamental purpose of the treaty was to change the framework of foreign trade imposed by the Canton System, which had been in force since 1760. Under Article V, the treaty abolished the former monopoly of the Cohong and their Thirteen Factories in Canton. Four additional \\"treaty ports\\" opened for foreign trade alongside Canton (Shameen Island from 1859 until 1943): Amoy (Xiamen until 1930), Foochowfoo (Fuzhou), Ningpo (Ningbo) and Shanghai (until 1943),John Darwin, After Tamerlane: The Global History of Empire, p. 271. (London: Allen Lane, 2007) \\"Under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, five 'treaty ports' were opened to Western trade, Hong Kong island was ceded to the British, the Europeans were allowed to station consuls in the open ports, and the old Canton system was replaced by the freedom to trade and the promise that no more than 5 per cent duty would be charged on foreign imports.\\"John Darwin, After Tamerlane: The Global History of Empire, p. 431. (London: Allen Lane, 2007) \\"In 1943 the remnants of China's unequal treaties were at last swept away when the British abandoned their surviving privileges there as so much useless lumber.\\" where foreign merchants were to be allowed to trade with anyone they wished. Britain also gained the right to send consuls to the treaty ports, which were given the right to communicate directly with local Chinese officials (Article II). The treaty stipulated that trade in the treaty ports should be subject to fixed tariffs, which were to be agreed upon between the British and the Qing governments (Article X).Treaty of Nanking Reparations and demobilisation The Qing government was obliged to pay the British government six million silver dollars for the opium that had been confiscated by Lin Zexu in 1839 (Article IV), 3 million dollars in compensation for debts that the Hong merchants in Canton owed British merchants (Article V), and a further 12 million dollars in war reparations for the cost of the war (Article VI). The total sum of 21 million dollars was to be paid in instalments over three years and the Qing government would be charged an annual interest rate of 5 percent for the money that was not paid in a timely manner (Article VII). The Qing government undertook to release all British prisoners of war (Article VIII), and to give a general amnesty to all Chinese subjects who had cooperated with the British during the war (Article IX). The British on their part, undertook to withdraw all of their troops from Nanking, the Grand Canal and the military post at Zhenhai, as well as not to interfere with China trade generally, after the emperor had given his assent to the treaty and the first instalment of money had been received (Article XII). British troops would remain in Gulangyu and Zhaobaoshan until the Qing government had paid reparations in full (Article XII). Cession of Hong Kong In 1841, a rough outline for a treaty was sent for the guidance of Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot. It had a blank after the words \\"the cession of the islands of\\". Pottinger sent this old draft treaty on shore, with the letter s struck out of islands and the words Hong Kong placed after it.Martin, Robert Montgomery (1847). China: Political, Commercial, and Social; In an Official Report to Her Majesty's Government. Volume 2. London: James Madden. p. 84. Robert Montgomery Martin, treasurer of Hong Kong, wrote in an official report: > The terms of peace having been read, Elepoo the senior commissioner paused, > expecting something more, and at length said \\"is that all?\\" Mr. Morrison > enquired of Lieutenant-colonel Malcolm [Pottinger's secretary] if there was > anything else, and being answered in the negative, Elepoo immediately and > with great tact closed the negotiation by saying, \\"all shall be granted‚Äîit > is settled‚Äîit is finished.\\" The Qing government agreed to make Hong Kong Island a crown colony, ceding it to the British Queen, Queen Victoria, \\"in perpetuity\\" (, Ch√°ng yu«én, in the Chinese version of the treaty), to provide British traders with a harbour where they could \\"careen and refit their ships and keep stores for that purpose\\" (Article III). Pottinger was later appointed the first governor of Hong Kong. In 1860, the colony was extended with the addition of the Kowloon peninsula and in 1898, the Second Convention of Peking further expanded the colony with the 99-year lease of the New Territories. In 1984, the governments of the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China (PRC) concluded the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, under which the sovereignty of the leased territories, together with Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (south of Boundary Street) ceded under the Convention of Peking (1860), was transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997.Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the HKSAR. \\"The Joint Declaration\\" and following pages, 1 July 2007. Aftermath HMS Cornwallis and the British squadron in Nanking, saluting the conclusion of the treaty The treaty was sealed by interpreter John Robert Morrison for the British and Wang Tajin for the Chinese.

The Life of > Sir Harry Parkes. Volume 1. London: Macmillan and Co. pp. 47‚Äì48. The Daoguang Emperor gave his assent for the treaty on 8 September. After his assent arrived in Nanking on 15 September, Pottinger's secretary George Alexander Malcolm was dispatched on board the steamer Auckland the next morning to the Court of St James's with a copy for ratification by Queen Victoria.The Chinese Repository. Volume 11. Canton. 1842. p. 680. The emperor ratified the treaty on 27 October and Queen Victoria added her written assent on 28 December. Ratification was exchanged in Hong Kong on 26 June 1843. Pottinger wrote in a letter to the Earl of Aberdeen the following year that at a feast with Qiying celebrating the ratification, Qiying insisted they ceremonially exchange miniature portraits of each member of each other's families. Upon receiving a miniature portrait of Pottinger's wife, Pottinger wrote that Qiying \\"placed [the miniature] on his head‚Äîwhich I am told is the highest token of respect and friendship‚Äîfilled a glass of wine, held the picture in front of his face, muttered some words in a low voice, drank the wine, again placed the picture on his head and then sat down\\" to complete the ceremony of long-term amity between the two families and the two peoples. This extravagant display has been analysed as showing an \\"erotically charged ... reciprocity [in] this symbolic gesture of swapping images of wives. Because of the brevity of the Treaty of Nanking and its terms being phrased only as general stipulations, the British and Chinese representatives agreed that a supplementary treaty should be concluded to establish more detailed regulations for relations. On 3October 1843, the parties concluded the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue at the Bocca Tigris outside Canton. Nevertheless, the treaties of 1842‚Äì43 left several unsettled issues. In particular they did not resolve the status of the opium traffic in favour of the British Empire. Although the Treaty of Wanghia with the Americans in 1844 explicitly banned Americans from selling opium, the trade continued as both the British and American merchants were only subject to the legal control of their permissive consuls. The opium traffic was later legalised in the Treaties of Tianjin, which China concluded after the Second Opium War resulted in another defeat for the Qing dynasty. The Nanking Treaty ended the old Canton System and created a new disadvantageous framework for China's foreign relations and overseas trade, which would last for almost a hundred years and marked the start of China's century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers. From the Chinese perspective, the most injurious terms were the fixed trade tariff, extraterritoriality, the most favoured nation provisions and the forced importation of British opium which continued to have devastating social and economic consequences for the Chinese people. These exploitative terms were imposed by the British from a position of power after her military victories and were conceded by the ruling Qing dynasty in order to avert continued military defeats. The tariff fixed at 5% was higher than before while the concept of extraterritoriality seemed to put the burden on foreigners to police themselves. In addition, the most favoured nation treatment appeared to set the foreigners one against the others. Although China regained tariff autonomy in the 1920s, extraterritoriality was not formally abolished until the 1943 Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China.Hsu, The Rise of Modern China: 190‚Äì92. Not until the retrocession of Hong Kong in 1997 did China revert the last of the onerous impositions of the Western powers.

Geffen Records was started in 1980. In 1999, it was merged into Interscope Records and the Geffen Records name was practically dissolved. On March 23, 2017, Billboard magazine stated that Geffen Records was relaunching with longtime A&R; person Neil Jacobson as President, who reports to John Janick, CEO and chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M.; History Geffen Records began operations in 1980, having been started by music industry businessman David GeffenTom King, The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood, pp. 303‚Äì307, Broadway Books (New York 2001). who, in the early 1970s, had founded Asylum Records. Geffen stepped down from Asylum in 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named a vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures. He was fired from Warner circa 1978, but still remained locked in a five-year contract, which prevented him from working elsewhere. When that deal expired, he returned to work in 1980 and struck a deal with, ironically, Warner Bros. Records, the sister company to Warner Bros. Pictures, to create Geffen Records. Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label's start-up and operations and Warner distributed its releases in North America, while Epic Records handled distribution in the rest of the world until 1985. In that year, Warner Bros. took over distribution for the rest of the world. Profits were split 50/50 between Geffen Records and its respective distributors. Geffen Records' first artist signing was superstar Donna Summer, whose gold-selling album The Wanderer became the label's first release in 1980. The label then released Double Fantasy by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Two weeks after it entered the charts, Lennon was murdered in New York City. Subsequently, the album went on to sell millions and gave Geffen its first number-one album and single; the rights to the album would later be taken over by EMI, which eventually was absorbed by Geffen's parent Universal Music. As the 1980s progressed, Geffen would go on to have success with such acts as Berlin, Kylie Minogue, Quarterflash, Wang Chung, and Sammy Hagar. The label also signed several established acts such as Elton John, Irene Cara, Cher, Debbie Harry, Don Henley, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, and Jennifer Holliday. Toward the end of the decade, the company also began making a name for itself as an emerging rock label, thanks to the success of Whitesnake (U.S. and Canada only), The Stone Roses, Guns N' Roses, Tesla, Sonic Youth and the comeback of 1970s-era rockers Aerosmith. This prompted Geffen to create a subsidiary label, DGC Records in 1990; which focused on more progressive rock and would later embrace the emergence of alternative rock‚ÄîNirvana being an example. Geffen also briefly distributed the first incarnation of Def American Recordings through Warner Bros. from 1988 to 1990. Acquisition by MCA After a decade of operating through Warner, when its contract with the company expired, the label was sold to MCA Music Entertainment (later renamed Universal Music Group) in 1990. The deal ultimately earned David Geffen an estimated US$800 million in stock (until the Japanese conglomerate, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.'s cash acquisition of MCA in 1991, made Geffen a billionaire) and an employment contract that ran until 1995. Following the sale, Geffen Records operated as one of MCA's leading independently managed labels. Geffen stepped down as head of the label in 1995 to collaborate with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg to form DreamWorks SKG, an ambitious multimedia empire dealing in film, television, books and music. Geffen Records would distribute releases on the new operation's DreamWorks Records subsidiary. Interscope- Geffen-A&M; Universal Music Group acquired PolyGram in 1999, resulting in a corporate reorganization of labels. Geffen Records, along with A&M; Records, was subsequently merged into Interscope Records. Although Geffen would continue to exist as a brand, it was downsized to fit into the greater expansion of Interscope. At the same time, international distribution of Interscope and Geffen releases switched to ex-PolyGram label Polydor Records, which had already been distributing A&M; releases overseas (in return for A&M; handling Polydor releases in the U.S.). By 2000, despite Geffen Records no longer being independently operated within UMG and taking a more submissive position behind Interscope, it continued to do steady business‚Äîso much so that in 2003, UMG folded MCA Records into Geffen. Though Geffen had been substantially a pop-rock label, its absorption of MCA (and its back catalogs) led to a more diverse roster; with former MCA artists such as Mary J. Blige, The Roots, Blink-182, Rise Against and Common now featured on the label. Meanwhile, DreamWorks Records also folded, with artists such as Nelly Furtado, Lifehouse and Rufus Wainwright being absorbed by Geffen as well. During this time, DGC Records was also folded into Geffen, with retained artists now recording for Geffen directly (DGC was reactivated in 2007, however it would now operate through Interscope Records instead). As the 2000s progressed, Geffen's absorption of the MCA and DreamWorks labels, along with its continuing to sign new acts such as Ashlee Simpson, Angels & Airwaves, Snoop Dogg and The Game, had boosted the company to the extent that it began gaining equal footing with the main Interscope label, leading some industry insiders to speculate that it could revert to operating as an independently managed imprint at UMG again. At the end of 2007, however, Geffen was absorbed further into Interscope, laying off sixty employees. In 2009, it was announced that Geffen Records had signed an agreement with the Holy See to produce an album of Marian songs and prayers from Pope Benedict XVI. Jimmy Iovine relaunched the Geffen imprint in 2011, moving its headquarters from California to New York City. Gee Roberson was appointed chairman.

It is one of the major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test. The Heaf test, a form of tine test, was used until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was also used in the USSR and is now prevalent in most of the post-Soviet states. History The size of induration is measured 48‚Äì72 hours later. Erythema (redness) should not be measured. Mantoux test injection site in a subject without chronic conditions or in a high-risk group clinically diagnosed as negative at 50 hours Tuberculin is a glycerol extract of the tubercle bacillus. Purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin is a precipitate of species-nonspecific molecules obtained from filtrates of sterilized, concentrated cultures. The tuberculin reaction was first described by Robert Koch in 1890. The test was first developed and described by the German physician Felix Mendel in 1908.F. Mendel. Therapeutische Monatshefte, Berlin, 1903, 16: 177. Die von Pirquet'sche Hautreaktion und die intraven√∂se Tuberkulinbehandlung.Medizinische Klinik, M√ºnchen, 1908, 4: 402-404. It is named after Charles Mantoux, a French physician who built on the work of Koch and Clemens von Pirquet to create his test in 1907. However, the test was unreliable due to impurities in tuberculin which tended to cause false results. Esmond R. Long and Florence B. Seibert identified the active agent in tuberculin as a protein. Seibert then spent a number of years developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) and enabling the creation of a reliable test for tuberculosis. Her first publication on the purification of tuberculin appeared in 1934. By the 1940s, Seibert's PPD was the international standard for tuberculin tests. In 1939, M. A. Linnikova in the USSR created a modified version of PPD. In 1954, the Soviet Union started mass production of PPD-L, named after Linnikova. Procedure A standard dose of 5 tuberculin units (TU - 0.1 ml), according to the CDC, or 2 TU of Statens Serum Institute (SSI) tuberculin RT23 in 0.1 ml solution, according to the NHS, is injected intradermally (between the layers of dermis) and read 48 to 72 hours later. This intradermal injection is termed the Mantoux technique. A person who has been exposed to the bacteria is expected to mount an immune response in the skin containing the bacterial proteins. The response is a classical example of delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DTH), a type IV of hypersensitivities. T cells and myeloid cells are attracted to the site of reaction in the timeframe of 1-3 days and generate local inflammation. The reaction is read by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable raised, hardened area) across the forearm (perpendicular to the long axis) in millimeters. If there is no induration, the result should be recorded as \\"0 mm\\". Erythema (redness) should not be measured. Classification of tuberculin reaction The results of this test must be interpreted carefully. The person's medical risk factors determine at which increment (5 mm, 10 mm, or 15 mm) of induration the result is considered positive.From the CDC team of the CDC team at the Saskatchewan Lung Association, photos of a PPD bump . A positive result indicates TB exposure. *5 mm or more is positive in An HIV- positive person Persons with recent contacts with a TB patient Persons with nodular or fibrotic changes on chest X-ray consistent with old healed TB Patients with organ transplants, and other immunosuppressed patients *10 mm or more is positive in Recent arrivals (less than five years) from high- prevalence countries Injection drug users Residents and employees of high- risk congregate settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, homeless shelters, etc.) Mycobacteriology lab personnel Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., diabetes, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, leukemia, end-stage renal disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, low body weight, etc.) Children less than four years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories *15 mm or more is positive in Persons with no known risk factors for TBMantoux Test in eac.int. A tuberculin test conversion is defined as an increase of 10 mm or more within a two-year period, regardless of age. Alternative criteria include increases of 6, 12, 15 or 18 mm. False positive result TST (tuberculin skin test) positive is measured by size of induration. The size of the induration considered to be a positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression. According to the Ohio Department of Health and US Department of Health, the Bacillus Calmette‚ÄìGu√©rin (BCG) vaccine does not protect against TB infection. It does, though, give 80% of children protection against tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. Therefore, a positive TST/PPD in a person who has received BCG vaccine is interpreted as latent TB infection (LTBI).Information also from ODH lecture at the Ohio State University 5/24/2012. Due to the test's low specificity, most positive reactions in low-risk individuals are false positives. A false positive result may be caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria or previous administration of BCG vaccine. Vaccination with BCG may result in a false-positive result for many years after vaccination. False positives can also occur when the injected area is touched, causing swelling and itching. If the swelling is less than 5 mm, it is possibly due to error by the healthcare personnel causing inflammation to the area. Another source of false positive results can be allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. Although rare, (about 0.08 reported reactions per million doses of tuberculin), these reactions can be dangerous and precautions should be taken by having epinephrin available. False negative result Reaction to the PPD or tuberculin test is suppressed by the following conditions: * Recent TB infection (less than 8‚Äì10 weeks) * Infectious mononucleosis * Live virus vaccine - The test should not be carried out within 3 weeks of live virus vaccination (e. g. MMR vaccine or Sabin vaccine). * Sarcoidosis * Hodgkin's disease * Corticosteroid therapy/steroid use * Malnutrition * Immunological compromise - Those on immuno-suppressive treatment or those with HIV and low CD4 T cell counts, frequently show negative results from the PPD test. This is because the immune system needs to be functional to mount a response to the protein derivative injected under the skin. A false negative result may occur in a person who has been recently infected with TB, but whose immune system hasn't yet reacted to the bacteria. * Upper respiratory virus infection In case a second tuberculin test is necessary it should be carried out in the other arm to avoid hypersensitising the skin. BCG vaccine and the Mantoux test The role of Mantoux testing in people who have been vaccinated is disputed. The US recommends that tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for BCG-vaccinated persons, and prior BCG vaccination should not influence the interpretation of the test. The UK recommends that interferon-Œ≥ testing should be used to help interpret positive Mantoux tests, and repeated tuberculin skin testing must not be done in people who have had BCG vaccinations. In general, the US recommendation results in a much larger number of people being falsely diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, while the UK approach probably misses patients with latent tuberculosis who should be treated. According to the US guidelines, latent tuberculosis infection diagnosis and treatment is considered for any BCG-vaccinated person whose skin test is 10 mm or greater, if any of these circumstances are present: *Was in contact with another person with infectious TB *Was born or has lived in a high TB prevalence country *Is continually exposed to populations where TB prevalence is high Anergy testing In cases of anergy, a lack of reaction by the body's defence mechanisms when it comes into contact with foreign substances, the tuberculin reaction will occur weakly, thus compromising the value of Mantoux testing. For example, anergy is present in AIDS, a disease which strongly depresses the immune system. Therefore, anergy testing is advised in cases where there is suspicion that anergy is present. However, routine anergy skin testing is not recommended. Two-step testing Some people who have been infected with TB may have a negative reaction when tested years after infection, as the immune system response may gradually wane. This initial skin test, though negative, may stimulate (boost) the body's ability to react to tuberculin in future tests. Thus, a positive reaction to a subsequent test may be misinterpreted as a new infection, when in fact it is the result of the boosted reaction to an old infection. Use of two-step testing is recommended for initial skin testing of adults who will be retested periodically (e.g., health care workers). This ensures any future positive tests can be interpreted as being caused by a new infection, rather than simply a reaction to an old infection. * The first test is read 48‚Äì72 hours after injection.  If the first test is positive, consider the person infected.  If the first test is negative, give a second test one to three weeks after the first injection. * The second test is read 48‚Äì72 hours after injection.  If the second test is positive, consider the person infected in the distant past  If the second test is negative, consider the person uninfected. A person who is diagnosed as \\"infected in the distant past\\" on two-step testing is called a \\"tuberculin reactor\\". The US recommendation that prior BCG vaccination be ignored results in almost universal false diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in people who have had BCG (mostly foreign nationals). The latest interpretation for Mantoux test results According to the guidelines published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005, the results are re-categorized into 3 parts based on their previous or baseline outcomes: *Baseline test: ‚â•10 mm is positive (either first or second step); 0 to 9 mm is negative *Serial testing without known exposure: Increase of ‚â•10 mm is positive *Known exposure: ‚â•5 mm is positive in patients with baseline of 0 mm ‚â•10 mm is positive in patients with negative baseline or previous screening result of >0 mm Recent developments In addition to tuberculin skin tests such as (principally) the Mantoux test, interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) have become common in clinical use in the 2010s. In some contexts they are used instead of TSTs, whereas in other contexts TSTs and IGRAs both continue to be useful. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold blood test measures the patient‚Äôs immune reactivity to the TB bacterium, and is useful for initial and serial testing of persons with an increased risk of latent or active tuberculosis infection. Guidelines for its use were released by the CDC in December 2005.Guidelines for Using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test for Detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection, United States QuantiFERON-TB Gold is FDA-approved in the United States, has CE Mark approval in Europe and has been approved by the MHLW in Japan.

In newborns, symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. Beginning in childhood, those affected become constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems are also typical of the disorder. Often, affected individuals have a narrow forehead, small hands and feet, short height, light skin and hair. Most are unable to have children. About 74% of cases occur when part of the father's chromosome 15 is deleted. In another 25% of cases, the affected person has two copies of the maternal chromosome 15 from the mother and lacks the paternal copy. As parts of the chromosome from the mother are turned off through imprinting, they end up with no working copies of certain genes. PWS is not generally inherited, but rather the genetic changes happen during the formation of the egg, sperm, or in early development. No risk factors are known for the disorder. Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected. A similar mechanism occurs in Angelman syndrome, except the defective chromosome 15 is from the mother, or two copies are from the father. Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome has no cure. Treatment may improve outcomes, especially if carried out early. In newborns, feeding difficulties may be supported with feeding tubes. Strict food supervision is typically required, starting around the age of three, in combination with an exercise program. Growth hormone therapy also improves outcomes. Counseling and medications may help with some behavioral problems. Group homes are often necessary in adulthood. PWS affects between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 30,000 people. The condition is named after Swiss physicians Andrea Prader and Heinrich Willi who, together with Alexis Labhart, described it in detail in 1956. An earlier description was made in 1887 by British physician John Langdon Down.  Signs and symptoms  Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype at 15 years of age: Note absence of typical PWS facial features and presence of mild truncal obesity. PWS has many signs and symptoms. The symptoms can range from poor muscle tone during infancy to behavioral problems in early childhood. Some symptoms that are usually found in infants, besides poor muscle tone, are a lack of eye coordination, some are born with almond-shaped eyes, and due to poor muscle tone, some may not have a strong sucking reflex. Their cries are weak, and they have difficulty waking up. Another sign of this condition is a thin upper lip. More aspects seen in a clinical overview include hypotonia and abnormal neurologic function, hypogonadism, developmental and cognitive delays, hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, and behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. Holm et al. (1993) describe the following features and signs as indicators of PWS, although not all will be present.  Uterus and birth   Childhood   Adulthood   Physical appearance   Neurocognitive  Individuals with PWS are at risk of learning and attention difficulties. Curfs and Fryns (1992) conducted research into the varying degrees of learning disability found in PWS. Their results, using a measure of IQ, were as follows: * 5%: IQ above 85 (high to low average intelligence) * 27%: IQ 70‚Äì85 (borderline intellectual functioning) * 39%: IQ 50‚Äì70 (mild intellectual disability) * 27%: IQ 35‚Äì50 (moderate intellectual disability) * 1%: IQ 20‚Äì35 (severe intellectual disability) * <1%: IQ <20 (profound intellectual disability) Cassidy found that 40% of individuals with PWS have borderline/low average intelligence, a figure higher than the 32% found in Curfs and Fryns' study. However, both studies suggest that most individuals (50‚Äì65%) fall within the mild/borderline/low average intelligence range. Children with PWS show an unusual cognitive profile. They are often strong in visual organization and perception, including reading and vocabulary, but their spoken language (sometimes affected by hypernasality) is generally poorer than their comprehension. A marked skill in completing jigsaw puzzles has been noted, but this may be an effect of increased practice. Auditory information processing and sequential processing are relatively poor, as are arithmetic and writing skills, visual and auditory short-term memory, and auditory attention span. These sometimes improve with age, but deficits in these areas remain throughout adulthood. PWS may be associated with psychosis.  Behavioral  PWS is frequently associated with a constant insatiable appetite, which persists no matter how much the patient eats, often resulting in morbid obesity. Caregivers need to strictly limit the patients' access to food, usually by installing locks on refrigerators and on all closets and cabinets where food is stored. It is the most common genetic cause of morbid obesity in children. Currently, no consensus exists as to the cause for this symptom, although genetic abnormalities in chromosome 15 disrupt the normal functioning of the hypothalamus. Given that the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus regulates many basic processes, including appetite, a link may well exist. In the hypothalamus of people with PWS, nerve cells that produce oxytocin, a hormone thought to contribute to satiety, have been found to be abnormal. People with PWS have high ghrelin levels, which are thought to directly contribute to the increased appetite, hyperphagia, and obesity seen in this syndrome. Cassidy states the need for a clear delineation of behavioral expectations, the reinforcement of behavioural limits, and the establishment of regular routines. The main mental health difficulties experienced by people with PWS include compulsive behaviour (usually manifested in skin picking) and anxiety. Psychiatric symptoms, for example, hallucinations, paranoia and depression, have been described in some cases and affect about 5‚Äì10% of young adults. Patients are also often extremely stubborn and prone to anger. Psychiatric and behavioural problems are the most common cause of hospitalization. Typically, 70‚Äì90% of affected individuals develop behavioral patterns in early childhood. Aspects of these patterns can include stubbornness, temper tantrums, controlling and manipulative behavior, difficulty with change in routine, and compulsive-like behaviors.  Endocrine  Several aspects of PWS support the concept of a growth hormone deficiency. Specifically, individuals with PWS have short stature, are obese with abnormal body composition, have reduced fat-free mass, have reduced lean body mass and total energy expenditure, and have decreased bone density. PWS is characterized by hypogonadism. This is manifested as undescended testes in males and benign premature adrenarche in females. Testes may descend with time or can be managed with surgery or testosterone replacement. Adrenarche may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.  Ophthalmologic  PWS is commonly associated with development of strabismus. In one study, over 50% of patients had strabismus, mainly esotropia.  Genetics  right PWS is related to an epigenetic phenomenon known as imprinting. Normally, a fetus inherits an imprinted maternal copy of PW genes and a functional paternal copy of PW genes. Due to imprinting, the maternally inherited copies of these genes are virtually silent, and the fetus therefore relies on the expression of the paternal copies of the genes. In PWS, however, there is mutation/deletion of the paternal copies of PW genes, leaving the fetus with no functioning PW genes. The PW genes are the SNRPN and NDN necdin genes, along with clusters of snoRNAs: SNORD64, SNORD107, SNORD108 and two copies of SNORD109, 29 copies of SNORD116 (HBII-85) and 48 copies of SNORD115 (HBII-52). These genes are located on chromosome 15 located in the region 15q11-13.\\"Prader-Willi Syndrome - MeSH - NCBI.\\" National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. November 1, 2016. <>. This so-called PWS/AS region in the paternal chromosome 15 may be lost by one of several genetic mechanisms, which in the majority of instances occurs through chance mutation. Other, less common mechanisms include uniparental disomy, sporadic mutations, chromosome translocations, and gene deletions. Region 15q11-13 is implicated in both PWS and Angelman syndrome (AS). While PWS results from the loss of PW genes within this region on the paternal chromosome, loss of a different gene (UBE3A) within the same region on the maternal chromosome causes AS. PWS and AS represent the first reported instances of disorders related to imprinting in humans. The risk to the sibling of an affected child of having PWS depends upon the genetic mechanism which caused the disorder. The risk to siblings is <1% if the affected child has a gene deletion or uniparental disomy, up to 50% if the affected child has a mutation of the imprinting control region, and up to 25% if a parental chromosomal translocation is present. Prenatal testing is possible for any of the known genetic mechanisms. A microdeletion in one family of the snoRNA HBII-52 has excluded it from playing a major role in the disease. Studies of human and mouse model systems have shown deletion of the 29 copies of the C/D box snoRNA SNORD116 (HBII-85) to be the primary cause of PWS.  Diagnosis  It is traditionally characterized by hypotonia, short stature, hyperphagia, obesity, behavioral issues (specifically obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder-like behaviors), small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and mild intellectual disability. However, with early diagnosis and early treatment (such as with growth hormone therapy), the prognosis for persons with PWS is beginning to change. Like autism, PWS is a spectrum disorder and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may change throughout the person's lifetime. Various organ systems are affected. Traditionally, PWS was diagnosed by clinical presentation. Currently, the syndrome is diagnosed through genetic testing; testing is recommended for newborns with pronounced hypotonia. Early diagnosis of PWS allows for early intervention and the early prescription of growth hormone. Daily recombinant growth hormone (GH) injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain. The mainstay of diagnosis is genetic testing, specifically DNA-based methylation testing to detect the absence of the paternally contributed PWS/AS region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation- specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings. PWS is often misdiagnosed as other syndromes due to many in the medical community's unfamiliarity with it. Sometimes it is misdiagnosed as Down syndrome, simply because of the relative frequency of Down syndrome compared to PWS.  Treatment  PWS has no cure; several treatments are available to lessen the condition's symptoms. During infancy, subjects should undergo therapies to improve muscle strength. Speech and occupational therapy are also indicated. During the school years, children benefit from a highly structured learning environment and extra help. The largest problem associated with the syndrome is severe obesity. Access to food must be strictly supervised and limited, usually by installing locks on all food-storage places including refrigerators. Physical activity in individuals with PWS for all ages is needed to optimize strength and promote a healthy lifestyle. Prescription of daily recombinant GH injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain. Because of severe obesity, obstructive sleep apnea is a common sequela, and a positive airway pressure machine is often needed. A person who has been diagnosed with PWS may have to undergo surgical procedures. One surgery that has proven to be unsuccessful for treating the obesity is gastric bypass. Behavior and psychiatric problems should be detected early for the best results. These issues are best when treated with parental education and training. Sometimes medication is introduced, as well. Serotonin agonists have been most effective in lessening temper tantrums and improving compulsivity. Epidemiology PWS affects one in 10,000 to one in 25,000 newborns. More than 400,000 people live with PWS.  Society and culture  A 1680 painting by Juan Carre√±o de Miranda of Eugenia Mart√≠nez Vallejo, a girl presumed to have PWS Despite its rarity, PWS has been often referenced in popular culture, partly due to curiosity surrounding the insatiable appetite and fascination with the trademark obesity symptomatic of the Syndrome . The syndrome has been depicted and documented several times in television. A fictional individual with PWS featured in the episode \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" of the television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired in the US on 24 November 2005. In July 2007 Channel 4 aired a 2006 documentary called Can't Stop Eating, surrounding the everyday lives of two people with PWS, Joe and Tamara. In a 2010 episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Sheryl Crow helped Ty Pennington rebuild a home for a family whose youngest son, Ethan Starkweather, was living with the syndrome. In a 2012 episode of Mystery Diagnosis on the Discovery Health channel, Conor Heybach, who has Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome, shared how he was diagnosed with it.

Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia. Routledge, 2005. p.698 From the 9th century, its meaning gradually shifted, so that it came to mean only the part of Britain lying north of the Firth of Forth: the Kingdom of Scotland. By the later Middle Ages it had become the fixed Latin term for what in English is called Scotland. The Romans referred to Ireland as \\"Scotia\\" around 500 A.D. Etymology and derivations The name of Scotland is derived from the Latin Scotia: the tribe name Scoti applied to all Gaels.https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/crowning-of-irelands-last- scottish-high-king/ The word Scoti (or Scotti) was first used by the Romans. It is found in Latin texts from the 4th century describing an Irish group which raided Roman Britain. It came to be applied to all the Gaels. It is not believed that any Gaelic groups called themselves Scoti in ancient times, except when writing in Latin. Old Irish documents use the term Scot (plural Scuit) going back as far as the 9th century, for example in the glossary of Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in. Oman derives it from Scuit, meaning someone cut-off. He believed it referred to bands of outcast Gaelic raiders, suggesting that the Scots were to the Gaels what the Vikings were to the Norse.C. Oman, A History of England before the Norman Conquest, London, 1910, p. 157.Sir Charles Oman: A History of England before the Norman Conquest The 19th century author Aonghas MacCoinnich of Glasgow proposed that Scoti was derived from a Gaelic ethnonym (proposed by MacCoinnich) Sgaothaich from sgaoth \\"swarm\\", plus the derivational suffix -ach (plural -aich)MacCoinnich, Aonghas Eachdraidh na h-Alba (Glasgow 1867) However, this proposal to date has not been met with any response in mainstream place-name studies. Pope Leo X (1513‚Äì1521) decreed that the use of the name Scotia be confined to referring to land that is now Scotland.Benedict's Fitzpatrick's Ireland and the Foundations of Europe, pp. 376-379 Virtually all names for Scotland are based on the Scotia root (cf. Dutch Schotland, French √âcosse, Czech Skotsko, Zulu IsiKotilandi, MƒÅori Koterana, Hakka S√ª-kak-l√†n, Quechua Iskusya, Turkish ƒ∞sko√ßya etc.), either directly or via intermediate languages. The only exceptions are the Celtic languages where the names are based on the Alba root, e.g. Manx Nalbin, Welsh Yr Alban\\", Irish \\"Albain.\\" Medieval usage A map from 1654 illustrating the latter use of Scotia for Scotland and Hibernia/Ivverna for Ireland Scotia was a way of saying \\"Land of the Gaels\\" ; compare Angli and Anglia; Franci and Francia; Romani and Romania; etc. It originally was used as a name for Ireland, for example in Adomn√°n's Life of Columba, and when Isidore of Seville in 580 CE writes \\"Scotia and Hibernia are the same country\\" (Isidore, lib. xii. c. 6), but the connotation is still ethnic. This is how it is used, for instance, by King Robert I of Scotland (Robert the Bruce) and Domhnall Ua N√©ill during the Scottish Wars of Independence, when Ireland was called Scotia Maior (greater Scotia) and Scotland Scotia Minor (lesser Scotia). After the 11th century, Scotia was used mostly for the kingdom of Alba or Scotland, and in this way became the fixed designation. As a translation of Alba, Scotia could mean both the whole kingdom belonging to the King of Scots, or just Scotland north of the Forth.

M√≠l had given Neferhotep military aid against ancient Ethiopia and was given Scota in marriage as a reward for his services.

As well as being an international soybean exporter, it is also involved in food processing, grain trading, and fertilizer. It competes with Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland. The company has approximately 32,000 employees in 40 countries.  History  Formation and listing Bunge & Born was founded in 1818 by Johann Peter Gottlieb Bunge in Amsterdam, it was relocated to Antwerp by Edouard Bunge in 1859. Edouard's brother; Ernest Bunge, took the Bunge name to Argentina in 1884, and in 1905 the business extended to Brazil and later on to the United States. The company was converted into the Bermuda- registered Bunge International in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international agribusiness and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.Clar√≠n: La retirada final del grupo Bunge & Born Archived copy Bunge ultimately went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited. In 1994, the Bermuda-registered Bunge International was created as the main company in which the families had shares. There were around 180 shareholders‚Äîthe main families were Hirsch, Bunge, Born, Engels, and De La Tour. This replaced the older structure in which individual shareholders had stakes in all the different Bunge companies. Now only in Argentina does the Bunge y Born name still exist. The New York Stock Exchange on August 4, 2011, when Bunge celebrated the 10th anniversary of its listing on the exchange. In 2001, under the leadership of Alberto Weisser, Bunge was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Through their three businesses‚Äîagribusiness, fertilizer, and food products‚Äîthey have established a leading global presence in the farm-to-consumer food chain. Bunge is the world's largest oilseed processor, the world's number one seller of bottled vegetable oil to consumers and the largest producer and supplier of fertilizers to farmers in South America. Acquisitions In 2004, Bunge acquired Cereol, parent of oilseed companies Central Soya and CanAmera Foods. In 2008, Bunge acquired Walter Rau, a margarine company, from Germany. In 2009, Bunge acquired the margarine business from Raisio Group, maker of functional food ingredients. In 2017, Bunge announced intentions to acquire a 70% stake in IOI Loders Croklaan for $946 million from Malaysian palm oil producer IOI Corp Berhad.  Brazilian sourcing protests  In 2012, Bunge came under criticism from NGO Survival International for sourcing its sugarcane from the ancestral land of the Guaran√≠ people in Brazil. It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions. Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers. In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company Ra√≠zen, which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area. Recent In May 2017, Glencore in Switzerland began pursuing the acquisition of Bunge. In early June 2017, Bunge hired advisers to help it fend off Glencore's takeover interest. In January 2017, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million. On January 19, 2018, it was reported that Archer Daniels Midland had approached Bunge Ltd. about a takeover, with details \\"unclear.\\" At that point, Bunge had a market value of about $9.8 billion, and was still being pursued by Glencore. In 2019, Bunge relocated its global headquarters from White Plains, New York, to the St Louis metropolitan area in 2020, where the company had its US headquarters. In April 2020, Bunge announced it agreed to sell 35 U.S interior grain elevators to Zen-Noh Corporation. The completion of the sale is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021.  Products  The company's operations include: *originating oilseeds and grains from the world's primary growing regions and transporting them to customers worldwide; *crushing oilseeds to make meal for the livestock industry and oil for the food processing, food service and biofuel industries; *producing bottled oils, mayonnaise, margarines and other food products for consumers; *crushing sugarcane to make sugar, ethanol and electricity; *milling wheat and corn for food processors, bakeries, brewers and other commercial customers; and *selling fertilizer to farmers. Environmental record In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency filed charges against Bunge company regarding pollution emissions. This involved twelve soybean processing plants and corn mills in eight states throughout the US. The lawsuit claimed Bunge violated the Clean Air Act by constructing major modifications that increased emissions. Bunge was required to implement engineering changes and pollution control projects, estimated to cost $12 million, to reduce emissions at the facilities by 2,200 tons a year. The settlement also called for Bunge to pay a cash penalty of $625,000 and to spend $1.25 million to fund community-based environmental projects selected by and to be supervised by the impacted states. The state of Kansas will receive $22,000 of the $625,000 civil penalty, this being issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.  Biofuel production  In November 2005, Bunge created a Europe production joint venture biodiesel with French company KBBV and Diester Industrie. The new company received the name Diester Industrie International. The joint venture will produce biodiesel in Germany, Austria and Italy. The total capacity of the plants will reach 430 thousand tons biodiesel per year.

Argentina‚Äôs revenue and customs service began an investigation into the four companies when prices for agricultural commodities spiked in 2008 and yet very little profit for the four companies had been reported to the office. As a result of the investigation, it was alleged that the companies had submitted false declarations of sales and routed profits through tax havens or through their headquarters. In some cases, they were said to have used phantom firms to buy grain and had inflated costs in Argentina in order to reduce the recorded profits earned in the country. According to the country‚Äôs revenue and customs service, the outstanding taxes amounted to almost USD 1 billion. The companies involved have denied the allegations. To date, the Argentinian tax authorities have not replied to the Swiss NGO Public Eye‚Äôs request regarding the current state of the case. In its 2018 annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bunge mentioned provisions which suggest that the case is still ongoing: ‚Äú[A]s of December 31, 2018, Bunge‚Äôs Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $34 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 4,246 million Argentine pesos (approximately $113 million]).‚Äù See also *Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (B)  References   External links  Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Multinational food companies Grain companies of the United States Companies of Bermuda Companies based in White Plains, New York 2001 initial public offerings Food and drink companies established in 1818 1818 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"Bunge Limited"},{"id":"54999","text":"Forbidden Planet is a 1956 American science fiction film, produced by Nicholas Nayfack, directed by Fred M.

Tony Magistrale describes it as one of the best examples of early techno-horror.Tony Magistrale, Abject Terrors: Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film, 2005 p. 82 Plot In the 23rd century, the starship C-57D reaches the distant planet Altair IV to determine the fate of an Earth expedition sent there 20 years earlier. Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the expedition's scientists, warns the relief ship not to land, saying he cannot guarantee their safety, but C-57D Commander John J. Adams ignores his warning. After landing, Adams and Lieutenants Jerry Farman and \\"Doc\\" Ostrow are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius' residence. Morbius describes how, one by one, the rest of the expedition was killed by a \\"planetary force\\" and that their starship, the Bellerophon, was vaporized as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes), and their daughter Altaira were somehow immune. Morbius offers to help them prepare to return home, but Adams says he must await further instructions from Earth. Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis in Forbidden Planet. The next day, Adams finds Farman trying to seduce Altaira; furious, he dresses down Farman and criticizes Altaira for her naivety around the crewmen and what he considers her excessively-revealing clothing. She reports the incident to Morbius, claiming that she never wishes to see Adams again, though she later designs new, more conservative clothing to appease Adams. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages equipment aboard the starship. Adams and Ostrow attempt to confront Morbius about this the following morning. While waiting, Adams goes outside to talk to Altaira. He apologizes for his behavior and they kiss. When they are unexpectedly attacked by Altaira's pet tiger, Adams disintegrates it with his blaster. When Morbius appears, Adams and Ostrow learn that he has been studying the Krell, a highly advanced native race that perished overnight 200,000 years before. In a Krell laboratory, Morbius shows them a \\"plastic educator\\", a device capable of measuring and enhancing intellectual capacity. When Morbius first used it, he barely survived, but his intellect was permanently doubled. Morbius takes them on a tour of a gigantic Krell underground machine complex, a cube long on each side, still functioning and powered by 9,200 thermonuclear reactors, operating in tandem. Afterwards, Adams demands that Morbius turn over his discoveries to Earth. Morbius, however, states that \\"humanity is not yet ready to receive such limitless power\\". Adams orders the crew to erect a force field fence around the starship to prevent further sabotage. It proves ineffective when the invisible intruder returns and murders Chief Engineer Quinn. Morbius warns Adams of his premonition of further deadly attacks, similar to what happened with the Bellerophon. That night, the invisible creature returns and is outlined in the fence's force field. The ship's blaster weapons have no effect and the creature kills Farman and two other crewmen. Morbius, asleep in the Krell lab, is startled awake by screams from Altaira. At the same instant, the roaring creature vanishes. Later, while Adams tries to persuade Altaira to leave, Ostrow sneaks away to use the Krell educator. He is fatally injured, but with his dying words, Ostrow tells Adams that the great machine was built to create anything from thought alone. He says that the Krell forgot one thing, however: \\"monsters from the id\\". Their own base subconscious desires, given free rein and unlimited power by the machine, brought about their quick extinction. Adams asserts that Morbius' subconscious mind created the creature that killed the original expedition and attacked his crew. Morbius refuses to believe him. After Altaira tells Morbius that she intends to leave with Adams, Robby detects the creature approaching. Morbius commands Robby to kill the monster, but the robot knows the monster is a creation of Morbius's subconscious mind and shuts down rather than harm him to stop it. Adams, Morbius, and Altaira take refuge in the Krell laboratory, but the creature melts its way through the doors. Morbius finally accepts the truth. He confronts and disowns the creature, but is fatally injured by the backlash. The id monster vanishes. Before Morbius dies, he tricks Adams into activating a planetary self-destruct sequence and tells them to leave the planet immediately. At a safe distance, Adams, Altaira, Robby, and the surviving crew watch the destruction of Altair IV. Adams then comforts Altaira by saying that this tragedy will serve as a reminder that, \\"... we are, after all, not God.\\" The starship departs for Earth. Cast Production The screenplay by Irving Block and Allen Adler, written in 1952, was originally titled Fatal Planet.Wierzbicki 2005, p. 5. The later screenplay draft by Cyril Hume renamed the film Forbidden Planet, because this was believed to have greater box- office appeal.Thompson, Lang. \\"Articles: Forbidden Planet\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: January 16, 2015. Block and Adler's drama took place in the year 1976 on the planet Mercury. An Earth expedition headed by John Grant is sent to the planet to retrieve Dr. Adams and his daughter Dorianne, who have been stranded there for twenty years. From then on, its plot is roughly the same as that of the completed film, though Grant is able to rescue both Adams and his daughter and escape the invisible monster stalking them. The film sets for Forbidden Planet were constructed on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) sound stage at its Culver City film lot and were designed by Cedric Gibbons and Arthur Lonergan. The film was shot entirely indoors, with all the Altair IV exterior scenes simulated using sets, visual effects, and matte paintings. A full-size mock-up of roughly three-quarters of the starship was built to suggest its full width of 170 ft (51 m). The starship was surrounded by a huge, painted cyclorama featuring the desert landscape of Altair IV; this one set took up all of the available space in one of the Culver City sound stages. Principal photography took place from April 18 to late May 1955.\\"Original print information: Forbidden Planet\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: January 16, 2015. Later, many costume and prop items were reused in several different episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone, most of which were filmed by Rod Serling's Cayuga Productions at the MGM studio in Culver City, including Robby the Robot, the various C-57D models, the full-scale mock-up of the base of the ship (which featured in the episodes \\"To Serve Man\\" and \\"On Thursday We Leave for Home\\"), the blaster pistols and rifles, crew uniforms, and special effects shots. At a cost of roughly $125,000, Robby the Robot was very expensive for a film prop at this time; it represented almost 7% of the film's $1.9 million budget and equates to at least $1 million in 2017 dollars. Both the electrically controlled passenger vehicle driven by Robby and the truck/tractor-crane off-loaded from the starship were also constructed especially for this film. Robby also starred in the science fiction film The Invisible Boy (1957) and later appeared in many TV series and films. The animated sequences of Forbidden Planet, especially the attack of the Id Monster, were created by veteran animator Joshua Meador,Lev 2006, p. 176. who was loaned to MGM by Walt Disney Productions. According to a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette on the film's DVD, a close look at the creature shows it to have a small goatee beard, suggesting its connection to Dr. Morbius, the only character with this physical feature. Unusually, the scene in which the Id Monster is finally revealed during its attack on the Earth ship was not created using traditional cel animation. Instead, Meador simply sketched each frame of the entire sequence in black pencil on animation stand translucent vellum paper; each page was then photographed in high contrast, so that only the major details remained visible. These images were then photographically reversed into negative and the resulting white line images were then tinted red, creating the effect of the Id Monster's body remaining largely invisible, with only its major outlines illuminated by the energy from the force-field and blaster beams.

Novelization Shortly before the film was released, a novelization appeared in hardcover and then later in mass- market paperback; it was written by W. J. Stuart (the mystery novelist Philip MacDonald writing under the pseudonym), which chapters the novel into separate first person narrations by Dr. Ostrow, Commander Adams, and Dr. Morbius.Stuart 1956 The novel delves further into the mysteries of the vanished Krell and Morbius' relationship to them. In the novel, he repeatedly exposes himself to the Krell's manifestation machine, which (as suggested in the film) boosts his brain power far beyond normal human intelligence. Unfortunately, Morbius retains enough of his imperfect human nature to be afflicted with hubris and a contempt for humanity. Not recognizing his own base primitive drives and limitations proves to be Morbius' downfall, as it had for the extinct Krell. While not stated explicitly in the film (although the basis for a deleted scene first included as an extra with the Criterion Collection's LaserDisc set and included with both the later 50th anniversary DVD and current Blu-ray releases), the novelization compared Altaira's ability to tame the tiger (until her sexual awakening with Commander Adams) to the medieval myth of a unicorn being tamable only by a virgin. The novel also includes some elements never included in the film: For one, Adams, Farman, and Ostrow clandestinely observe Morbius' house overnight one evening, but see or hear nothing. When they leave they accidentally kill one of Altaira's pet monkeys. When Dr. Ostrow later on dissects the dead animal he discovers that its internal structure precludes it from ever having been alive in the normal biological sense. The tiger, deer, and monkeys are all conscious creations by Dr. Morbius as companions (\\"pets\\") for his daughter and only outwardly resemble their Earth counterparts. The novel also differs somewhat from the film in that it does not directly establish the great machine as the progenitor of the animals or monster; instead only attributes them to Morbius' elevated mental power. The Krell's self-destruction can be interpreted by the reader as a cosmic punishment for misappropriating the life-creating power of God. This is why in the film's ending, Commander Adams says in his speech to Altaira \\"... we are, after all, not God\\". The novel ends with a postscript making a similar observation. Soundtrack Forbidden Planets innovative electronic music score, credited as \\"electronic tonalities\\", partly to avoid having to pay any of the film industry music guild fees,https://5mag.net/features/louis-and- bebe-barron-forbidden-planet/ was composed by Bebe and Louis Barron. MGM producer Dore Schary discovered the couple quite by chance at a beatnik nightclub in Greenwich Village while on a family Christmas visit to New York City; Schary hired them on the spot to compose his film's musical score. While the theremin (which was not used in Forbidden Planet) had been used on the soundtrack of Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), the Barrons' electronic composition is credited with being the first completely electronic film score; their soundtrack preceded the invention of the Moog synthesizer by eight years (1964). Using ideas and procedures from the book Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (1948) by the mathematician and electrical engineer Norbert Wiener, Louis Barron constructed his own electronic circuits that he used to generate the score's \\"bleeps, blurps, whirs, whines, throbs, hums, and screeches\\". Most of these sounds were generated using an electronic circuit called a \\"ring modulator\\". After recording the basic sounds, the Barrons further manipulated the sounds by adding other effects, such as reverberation and delay, and reversing or changing the speeds of certain sounds.\\"Notes about film soundtrack and CD\\". MovieGrooves. Retrieved: January 16, 2015. Since Bebe and Louis Barron did not belong to the Musicians Union, their work could not be considered for an Academy Award, in either the \\"soundtrack\\" or the \\"sound effects\\" categories. MGM declined to publish a soundtrack album at the time that Forbidden Planet was released. However, film composer and conductor David Rose later published a 7\\" (18 cm) single of his original main title theme that he had recorded at the MGM Studios in Culver City during March 1956. His main title theme had been discarded when Rose, who had originally been hired to compose the musical score in 1955, was discharged from the project by Dore Schary sometime between Christmas 1955 and New Year's Day. The film's original theatrical trailer contains snippets of Rose's score, the tapes of which Rose reportedly later destroyed.Wierzbicki 2015, p. 167. The Barrons finally released their soundtrack in 1976 as an LP album for the film's 20th anniversary; it was on their very own Planet Records label (later changed to Small Planet Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP was premiered at MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Kansas City, MO over the 1976 Labor Day weekend, as part of a 20th Anniversary celebration of Forbidden Planet held at that Worldcon; the Barrons were there promoting their album's first release, signing all the copies sold at the convention. They also introduced the first of three packed-house screenings that showed an MGM 35mm fine grain vault print in original CinemaScope and stereophonic sound. A decade later, in 1986, their soundtrack was released on a music CD for the film's 30th Anniversary, with a six-page color booklet containing images from Forbidden Planet, plus liner notes from the composers, Bebe and Louis Barron, and Bill Malone. A tribute to the film's soundtrack was performed live in concert by Jack Dangers, available on disc one of the album Forbidden Planet Explored.

III c. 83) setting procedures of governance in the Province of Quebec. The Acts principal components were: *The province's territory was expanded to take over part of the Indian Reserve, including much of what is now southern Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota. *Reference to the Protestant faith was removed from the oath of allegiance. *It guaranteed free practice of the Catholic faith. *It restored the use of the French civil law for matters of private law, except that, in accordance with the English common law, it granted unlimited freedom of testation. It maintained English common law for matters of public law, including administrative appeals, court procedure, and criminal prosecution. *It restored the Catholic Church's right to impose tithes. The Act had wide-ranging effects, both in Quebec itself as well as in the Thirteen Colonies. In Quebec, English-speaking immigrants from the Thirteen Colonies objected to a variety of its provisions, which they saw as a removal of certain political freedoms. Canadiens varied in their reaction; the land-owning seigneurs and ecclesiastics for example were generally happy with its provisions. In the Thirteen Colonies, the Quebec Act had been passed in the same session of Parliament as a number of other acts designed as punishment for the Boston Tea Party and other protests, which the American Patriots collectively termed the \\"Intolerable\\" or in England officially the \\"Coercive Acts\\". The provisions of the Quebec Act were seen by the colonists as a new model for administration in the colonies, which would strip them of their self-elected assemblies. It appeared to void the land claims of the colonies by granting most of the Ohio Country to the province of Quebec. The Americans also interpreted the Act as an \\"establishment\\" of Catholicism in the colony. Many Americans had participated in the French and Indian War, and they now saw the religious freedoms and land given to their former enemy as an affront. Background After the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), victorious Great Britain and defeated France formalized the peace with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Under the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of France ceded New France to Britain, choosing instead to keep the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique for their valuable sugar production. Canada (New France) was considered less valuable, as its only significant commercial product at the time was beaver pelts. The territory along the St. Lawrence River, called Canada by the French, was renamed Quebec by the British, after its capital city. Non-military administration of the territories acquired by the British in the war was defined in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Under the terms of the peace treaty, Canadiens who chose not to leave became British subjects. In order for them to serve in public offices, they were required to swear an oath to the King that contained specific provisions rejecting the Catholic faith. Since many of the predominantly Roman Catholic Canadiens were unwilling to take such an oath, this effectively prevented large numbers of Canadiens from participating in the local governments. With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the American Revolution, the British were worried that the Canadiens might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, Canadiens formed the vast majority of the settler population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and there was little immigration from Great Britain. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 Canadiens to the British crown, first Governor James Murray and later Governor Guy Carleton promoted the need for change. There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the Canadien subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in the enactment of the Quebec Act of 1774. Effects on the Province of Quebec Constitution of the Province of Quebec 1775 * Territory: The boundaries of the province were defined by the Act. In addition to the territory of the French province of Canada, the borders were expanded to include land that is now southern Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota. This increased the size of the province threefold over the size of the French province. * Religion: The Act allowed public office holders to practice the Roman Catholic faith, by replacing the oath sworn by officials from one to Elizabeth I and her heirs with one to George III that had no reference to the Protestant faith. This enabled, for the first time, Canadiens to legally participate in the affairs of the provincial government without formally renouncing their faith. It also reestablished the collection of tithes, which had been stopped under the previous administrative rules, and allowed Jesuit priests to return to the province. * Structure of government: The Act defined the structure of the provincial government. The governor was to be appointed by the Crown, and he was to govern with the assistance of a legislative council; there were no provisions for an elected legislative assembly.See full text of Act here. * Law: While the case of Campbell v. Hall effectively preserved French law despite the provisions in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Act provided for its ouster in favour of English law in matters of public law, criminal law and freedom of testation. * Land use: The seigneurial system as a means of distributing land and managing its use was restored. This was the system by which the French had administered the province; the British had instituted a Township system of land management in 1763. Participation of the Canadiens The internal communications of the British colonial government at Quebec suggest a relative failure of the purpose of the Quebec Act. On 4 February 1775 Governor Guy Carleton wrote to General Thomas Gage that he believed the Canadiens to be generally happy with the Act, yet he also added: > ... I must not however conceal from Your Excellency, that the Gentry, well > disposed, and heartily desirous as they are, to serve the Crown, and to > serve it with Zeal, when formed into regular Corps, do not relish commanding > a bare Militia, they never were used to that Service under the French > Government, (and perhaps for good Reasons) besides the sudden Dismission of > the Canadian Regiment raised in 1764, without Gratuity or Recompence to > Officers, who engaged in our Service almost immediately after the Cession of > the Country, of taking any Notice of them since, tho' they all expected half > pay, is still uppermost in their Thoughts, and not likely to encourage their > engaging a second Time in the same Way; as to the Habitants or Peasantry, > ever since the Civil Authority has been introduced into the Province, the > Government of it has hung so loose, and retained so little Power, they have > in a Manner emancipated themselves, and it will require Time, and discreet > Management likewise, to recall them to their ancient Habits of Obedience and > Discipline; considering all the new Ideas they have been acquiring for these > ten years past, can it be thought they will be pleased at being suddenly, > and without Preparation embodied into a Militia, and marched from their > Families, Lands, and Habitations to remote Provinces, and all the Horrors of > War, which they have already experienced; It would give appearance of Truth > to the Language of our Sons of Sedition, at this very Moment busily employed > instilling into their Minds, that the Act was passed merely to serve the > present Purposes of Government, and in the full Intention of ruling over > them with all the Despotism of their ancient Masters. On June 7, after having received word of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, as well as the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Benedict Arnold's subsequent raid on Fort Saint-Jean, he wrote to Colonial Secretary Dartmouth: > The little Force we have in the Province was immediately set in Motion, and > ordered to assemble at or near St. John's; The Noblesse of this > Neighbourhood were called upon to collect their Inhabitants, in order to > defend themselves, the Savages of those Parts likewise had the same orders; > but tho' the Gentlemen testified great Zeal, neither their Entreaties or > their Example could prevail upon the People; a few of the Gentry, consisting > principally of the Youth, residing in this Place, and its Neighbourhood, > formed a small Corps of Volunteers under the Command of Mr. Samuel Mackay, > and took Post at St. John's; the Indians shewed as much Backwardness as the > Canadian Peasantry. ... Less than a month later, on 28 June 1775, Chief Justice William Hey wrote to the Lord Chancellor from Quebec: > ... What will be your Lordships astonishment when I tell you that an act > passed for the express purpose of gratifying the Canadians & which was > supposed to comprehend all that they either wished or wanted is become the > first object of their discontent & dislike. English officers to command them > in time of war, & English Laws to govern them in time of Peace, is the > general wish. the former they know to be impossible (at least at present) & > by the latter if I understand them right, they mean no Laws & no Government > whatsoever ‚Äì in the mean time it may be truly said that Gen.

And they on their parts have been and are too much elated with > the advantages they supposed they should derive from the restoration of > their old Privileges & customs, & indulged themselves in a way of thinking & > talking that gave very just offence, as well to their own People as to the > English merchants. On 21 September 1775, Lieutenant-Governor Cramah√©, who governed at Quebec while Carleton was in Montreal, wrote to Dartmouth on the failure to rally the people after word arrived of the impending invasion from the colonies to the south: Effect on the Thirteen Colonies The Quebec Act angered the Americans and was termed one of the Intolerable Acts by the Patriots, and contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. Frontiersmen from Virginia and other colonies were already entering that area. Land development companies such as the Ohio Company had already been formed to acquire ownership of large tracts and sell land to settlers and trade with the Indians. Americans denounced the Act for promoting the growth of \\"Papism\\" (Catholicism)Joseph J. Casino, \\"Anti-Popery in Colonial Pennsylvania\\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography Vol. 105, No. 3 (Jul., 1981), pp. 279‚Äì309 in JSTOR and cutting back on their freedom and traditional rights. In particular, the colonial governments of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia were angered by the unilateral assignment of the Ohio lands to Quebec, which had each been granted them in their royal charters.Gordon Wood, The American Revolution (New York: Random House, 2002). Langston (2005) looked at press reaction in New England. Some colonial editors explained their views on how it reorganized Canadian governance, explaining how they felt it established direct rule by the Crown and limiting the reach of English law to criminal jurisprudence. Isaiah Thomas of the Massachusetts Spy drew links between the Quebec Act and legislation circumscribing American liberties, such as the Tea Act and the Coercive Acts. Editors shaped public opinion by writing editorials and reprinting opposition letters from both sides of the Atlantic. The First Continental Congress, which met from 5 September to 26 October 1774, addressed the inhabitants of Quebec, warning them of the perils of the supposedly arbitrary and tyrannical nature of Parliament. The Quebec Acts main significance in the Thirteen Colonies was that it angered the Patriots, and dismayed the Loyalists who supported the Crown, and helped to accelerate the confrontation that became the American Revolution (Miller 1943). The Act is listed as one of the rebels' 27 colonial grievances in the Declaration of IndependenceThe Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels as one of the \\"Acts of pretended Legislation ... The First Continental Congress petitioned Parliament to repeal the Intolerable Acts, which Parliament declined to do. Instead, in February 1775 Parliament passed the Conciliatory Resolution in an attempt to curry favor with the angry colonists. This was too little, too late, as the war broke out before news of its passage could reach the colonies. Although the Continental Congress did eventually receive this proposal, they ultimately rejected it. In Quebec, the 1774 Act was effectively superseded by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which partitioned Quebec into two new provinces, Upper and Lower Canada.

Subdivisions Historically, ethnologists have classified the Abenaki by geographic groups: Western Abenaki and Eastern Abenaki. Within these groups are the Abenaki bands: *Western Abenaki  Amoskeay  Arsigantegok (also Arrasaguntacook, Ersegontegog, Assagunticook, Anasaguntacook), lived along the St. Francis River in Qu√©bec. Principal village: St. Francis (Odanak). The people were referred to as St. Francis River Abenakis, and this term gradually was applied to all Western Abenaki.Colin G. Calloway: The Western Abenakis of Vermont, 1600‚Äì1800: War, Migration, and the Survival of an Indian People, University of Oklahoma Press, 1994,  Cocheco  Cowasuck (also Cohass, Cohasiac, Koasek, Koasek, Coos ‚Äì \\"People of the Pines\\"), lived in the upper Connecticut River Valley. Principal village: Cowass, near Newbury, Vermont.  Missiquoi (also Masipskwoik, Mazipskikskoik, Missique, Misiskuoi, Missisco, Missiassik ‚Äì \\"People of the Flint\\"), also known as the Sokoki. They lived in the Missisquoi Valley, from Lake Champlain to the headwaters. Principal village around Swanton, Vermont.  Nashua  Odanak (also known as St. Francis, St. Francois du Lac), lived southwest of Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, and included settlements along the St. Francois River.  Ossipee, lived along the shores of Ossipee Lake in east- central New Hampshire. Often classed as Eastern Abenaki.  Pemigewasset  Pennacook (also Penacook, Penikoke, Openango), lived in the Merrimack Valley, therefore sometimes called Merrimack. Principal village Penacook, New Hampshire. The Pennacook were once a large confederacy who were politically distinct and competitive with their northern Abenaki neighbors.  Pequawket (also Pigwacket, Pequaki), lived along the Saco River and in the White Mountains. Principal village Pigwacket was located on the upper Saco River near present-day Fryeburg, Maine. Occupied an intermediate location, therefore sometimes classed as Eastern Abenaki.  Piscataqua  Sokoki (also Sokwaki, Squakheag, Socoquis, Sokoquius, Zooquagese, Soquachjck, Onejagese ‚Äì \\"People Who Separated\\"), lived in the Middle and Upper Connecticut River Valley. Principal villages: Squakheag, Northfield, Massachusetts, and Fort Hill.  Souhegan  Winnipesaukee (also Winnibisauga, Wioninebeseck, Winninebesakik ‚Äì \\"region of the land around lakes\\"), lived along the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.  W√¥linak (also Becancour), lived around Trois- Rivi√®res, Quebec. *Eastern Abenaki  Apikwahki  Amaseconti, lived between the upper Kennebec and Androscoggin rivers in western Maine.  Androscoggin (also Alessikantekw, Arosaguntacock, Amariscoggin), lived in the Androscoggin Valley and along the St. Francis River, therefore often called St. Francis River Abenaki.  Kennebec (also Kinipekw, Kennebeck, Caniba, later known as Norridgewock), lived in the Kennebec River Valley in northern Maine. Principal village: Norridgewock (Naridgewalk, Neridgewok, Noronjawoke); other villages: Amaseconti (Amesokanti, Anmissoukanti), Kennebec, and Sagadahoc.  Kwupahag (also Kwapahag)  Maliseet (also Wolastoqiyik, Walastekwyk, Malecite), lived in the inland of upper Maine and middle New Brunswick along the St. John River. Principal villages: Meductic, Aukpaque. Now a separate federally recognized tribe.  Ossipee, lived along the shores of Ossipee Lake in east- central New Hampshire. Sometimes classed as Western Abenaki.  Penobscot (also Panawahpskek, Pamnaouamske, Pentagouet), lived in the Penobscot Valley. Principal villages: Penobscot (Pentagouet), now Indian Island, Old Town, Maine; other villages: Agguncia, Asnela, Catawamtek, Kenduskeag, Mattawamkeag, Meecombe, Negas, Olamon, Passadumkeag, Precaute, Segocket, and Wabigganus. Now a separate federally recognized tribe.  Passamaquoddy (also Peskotomuhktati, Pestomuhkati), lived on the Passamaquoddy Bay coast and inland, between the St. John, St. Croix and Penobscot rivers, in present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Principal village: Machias. Now a separate federally recognized tribe.  Rocameca, lived along the upper Androscoggin River, near Canton, Maine.  Wawinak (also Ouanwinak, Sheepscot, Wawenock, Wawnock, Wewenoc), lived in the coastal areas of southern Maine. Location Abenaki wigwam with birch bark covering The homeland of the Abenaki, which they call Ndakinna (our land), extended across most of what is now northern New England, southern Quebec, and the southern Canadian Maritimes. The Eastern Abenaki population was concentrated in portions of New Brunswick and Maine east of New Hampshire's White Mountains. The other major tribe, the Western Abenaki, lived in the Connecticut River valley in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.Waldman, Carl. Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes: Third Edition (New York: Checkmark Books, 2006) p. 1 The Missiquoi lived along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. The Pennacook lived along the Merrimack River in southern New Hampshire. The maritime Abenaki lived around the St. Croix and Wolastoq (Saint John River) valleys near the boundary line between Maine and New Brunswick. The English settlement of New England and frequent wars forced many Abenaki to retreat to Quebec. The Abenaki settled in the Sillery region of Quebec between 1676 and 1680, and subsequently, for about twenty years, lived on the banks of the Chaudi√®re River near the falls, before settling in Odanak and W√¥linak in the early eighteenth century. In those days, the Abenaki practiced a subsistence economy based on hunting, fishing, trapping, berry picking and on growing corn, beans, squash, potatoes and tobacco. They also produced baskets, made of ash and sweet grass, for picking wild berries, and boiled maple sap to make syrup. Basket weaving remains a traditional activity for members of both communities. During the Anglo-French wars, the Abenaki were allies of France, having been displaced from Ndakinna by immigrating English people. An anecdote from the period tells the story of a Maliseet war chief named Nescambuit or Assacumbuit, who killed more than 140 enemies of King Louis XIV of France and received the rank of knight. Not all Abenaki natives fought on the side of the French, however; many remained on their native lands in the northern colonies. Much of the trapping was done by the people and traded to the English colonists for durable goods. These contributions by Native American Abenaki peoples went largely unreported. Two tribal communities formed in Canada, one once known as Saint-Francois-du-lac near Pierreville, Quebec (now called Odanak, Abenaki for \\"coming home\\"), and the other near B√©cancour (now known as W√¥linak) on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, directly across the river from Trois-Rivi√®res. These two Abenaki reserves continue to grow and develop. Since the year 2000, the total Abenaki population (on and off reserve) has doubled to 2,101 members in 2011. Approximately 400 Abenaki reside on these two reserves, which cover a total area of less than . The unrecognized majority are off-reserve members, living in various cities and towns across Canada and the United States. There are about 3,200 Abenaki living in Vermont and New Hampshire, without reservations, chiefly around Lake Champlain. The remaining Abenaki people live in multi- racial towns and cities across Canada and the US, mainly in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England. Elnu Abenaki chief Four Abenaki tribes are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki tribes: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the Elnu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation received recognition by the State of Vermont. The Nulhegan are located in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, with tribal headquarters in Brownington, and the Elnu Abenaki are located in southeastern Vermont with tribal headquarters in Jamaica, Vermont. The Elnu Abenaki tribe focuses mainly on carrying on the traditions of their ancestors through their children and teaching about their culture. The chief and political leader of the Nulhegan Band is Don Stevens. The Sokoki (the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi) are located along the Missisquoi River in northwestern Vermont, with tribal headquarters in Swanton. Their traditional land is along the river, extending to its outlet at Lake Champlain. In December 2012, Vermont's Nulhegan Abenaki Tribe created a tribal forest in the town of Barton. This forest was established with assistance from the Vermont Sierra Club and the Vermont Land Trust. It contains a hunting camp and maple sugaring facilities that are administered cooperatively by the Nulhegan. The forest contains . The St Francis Missisquoi Tribe owns forest land in the town of Brunswick, centered around the Brunswick Springs. These springs are believed to be a sacred traditional religious site of the Abenaki. Together these Vermont forests are the only Abenaki held lands outside of the existing reservations in Quebec and Maine. Language The Abenaki language is closely related to the Panawahpskek (Penobscot) language. Other neighboring Wabanaki tribes, the Pestomuhkati (Passamaquoddy), Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), and MiÍûåkmaq, and other Eastern Algonquian languages share many linguistic similarities. It has come close to extinction as a spoken language. Tribal members are working to revive the Abenaki language at Odanak (means \\"in the village\\"), a First Nations Abenaki reserve near Pierreville, Quebec, and throughout New Hampshire, Vermont and New York state. The language is holophrastic, meaning that a phrase or an entire sentence is expressed by a single word. For example, the word for \\"white man\\" awanoch is a combination of the words awani meaning \\"who\\" and uji meaning \\"from\\". Thus, the word for \\"white man\\" literally translates to \\"Who is this man and where does he come from?\\" History In Reflections in Bullough's Pond, historian Diana Muir argues that the Abenakis' neighbors, pre-contact Iroquois, were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the corn/beans/squash agricultural complex enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring Algonquian peoples, including the Abenaki. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest.Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England. In 1614, Thomas Hunt captured 24 young Abenaki people and took them to England. During the European colonization of North America, the land occupied by the Abenaki was in the area between the new colonies of England in Massachusetts and the French in Quebec. Since no party agreed to territorial boundaries, there was regular conflict among them. The Abenaki were traditionally allied with the French; during the reign of Louis XIV, Chief Assacumbuit was designated a member of the French nobility for his service. Abenaki couple, 18th-century Facing annihilation from English attacks and epidemics of new infectious diseases, the Abenaki started to emigrate to Quebec around 1669. The governor of New France allocated two seigneuries (large self-administered areas similar to feudal fiefs). The first was on the Saint Francis River and is now known as the Odanak Indian Reservation; the second was founded near B√©cancour and is called the Wolinak Indian Reservation. Abenaki wars When the Wampanoag people under King Philip (Metacomet) fought the English colonists in New England in 1675 in King Philip's War, the Abenaki joined the Wampanoag. For three years they fought along the Maine frontier in the First Abenaki War. The Abenaki pushed back the line of white settlement through devastating raids on scattered farmhouses and small villages. The war was settled by a peace treaty in 1678, with the Wampanoag more than decimated and many Native survivors having been sold into slavery in Bermuda.\\"Worlds rejoined\\". Cape Cod online. During Queen Anne's War in 1702, the Abenaki were allied with the French; they raided numerous small English villages in Maine, from Wells to Casco, killing about 300 settlers over ten years. They also occasionally raided into Massachusetts, for instance in Groton and Deerfield in 1704. The raids stopped when the war ended. Some captives were adopted into the Mohawk and Abenaki tribes; older captives were generally ransomed, and the colonies carried on a brisk trade.Kenneth Morrison, The Embattled Northeast: the Elusive Ideal of Alliance in Abenaki-Euramerican Relations (1984) The Third Abenaki War (1722‚Äì25), called Father Rale's War, erupted when the French Jesuit missionary S√©bastien Rale (or Rasles, 1657?-1724) encouraged the Abenaki to halt the spread of Yankee settlements. When the Massachusetts militia tried to seize Rasles, the Abenaki raided the settlements at Brunswick, Arrowsick, and Merry- Meeting Bay. The Massachusetts government then declared war and bloody battles were fought at Norridgewock (1724), where Rasles was killed, and at a daylong battle at the Indian village near present-day Fryeburg, Maine, on the upper Saco River (1725). Peace conferences at Boston and Casco Bay brought an end to the war. After Rale died the Abenaki moved to a settlement on the St. Francis River. The Abenaki from St. Francois continued to raid British settlements in their former homelands along the New England frontier during Father Le Loutre's War (see Northeast Coast Campaign (1750)) and the French and Indian War. Canada The development of tourism projects has allowed the Canadian Abenaki to develop a modern economy, while preserving their culture and traditions. For example, since 1960, the Odanak Historical Society has managed the first and one of the largest aboriginal museums in Quebec, a few miles from the Quebec-Montreal axis. Over 5,000 people visit the Abenaki Museum annually. Several Abenaki companies include: in W√¥linak, General Fiberglass Engineering employs a dozen natives, with annual sales exceeding C$3 million. Odanak is now active in transportation and distribution. Notable Abenaki from this area include the documentary filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin (National Film Board of Canada). United States The Penobscot Indian Nation, Passamaquoddy people, and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have been federally recognized as tribes in the United States. =Vermont= In 2006, the state of Vermont officially recognized the Abenaki as a people, but not a tribe. The state noted that many Abenaki had been assimilated, and only small remnants remained on reservations during and after the French and Indian War, later eugenics projects further decimated the Abenaki people of America through forced sterilization and questionable 'miscarriages' at birth. As noted above, facing annihilation, many Abenaki had begun emigrating to Canada, then under French control, around 1669. The Sokoki-St. Francis Band of the Abenaki Nation organized a tribal council in 1976 at Swanton, Vermont. Vermont granted recognition of the council the same year, but later withdrew it. In 1982, the band applied for federal recognition, which is still pending. Four Abenaki communities are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont. The Abenaki who chose to remain in the United States did not fare as well as their Canadian counterparts. Tribal connections were lost as those Abenaki who were tolerated by the Anglo population were assimilated into colonial society. What familial groups remained were often eradicated, in the early 20th century, through forced sterilization and pregnancy termination policies in Vermont. There were over 3,400 reported cases of sterilization of Abenaki having been performed, many of which involved termination of an unborn fetus. No documentation of informed consent for these procedures was found. After this period the only Abenaki that remained in the United States were those who could pass for white, or avoid capture and subsequent dissolution of their families through forced internment in \\"schools\\" after their sterilization. At the time, many of the children who were sterilized were not even aware of what the physicians had done to them. This was performed under the auspices of the Brandon School of the Feeble-Minded, and the Vermont Reform School. It was documented in the 1911 \\"Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder's Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population.\\" Official state tribal recognition Statue of Keewakwa Abenaki Keenahbeh in Opechee Park in Laconia, New Hampshire (standing at 36 ft.) The Vermont Elnu (Jamaica) and Nulhegan (Brownington) bands' application for official recognition was recommended and referred to the Vermont General Assembly by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs on January 19, 2011, as a result of a process established by the Vermont legislature in 2010. Recognition allows applicants to seek scholarship funds reserved for American Indians and to receive federal \\"native made\\" designation for the bands' arts and crafts.Hallenbeck, Terri. Abenaki Turn to Vermont Legislature for Recognition Burlington Free Press January 20, 2011. Retrieved January 20, 2011 On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation received recognition by the State of Vermont. =New Hampshire and minority recognition= In New Hampshire the Abenaki, along with other Native American groups, have proposed legislation for recognition as a minority group. This bill was debated in 2010 in the state legislature. The bill would create a state commission on Native American relations, which would act as an advisory group to the governor and the state government in general. The Abenaki want to gain formal state recognition as a people. Some people have opposed the bill, as they fear it may lead to Abenaki land claims for property now owned and occupied by European Americans. Others worry that the Abenaki may use recognition as a step toward opening a casino. But, the bill specifically says that \\"this act shall not be interpreted to provide any Native American or Abenaki person with any other special rights or privileges that the state does not confer on or grant to other state residents.\\" New Hampshire has considered expanding gambling separate from the Native Americans. The council would be under the Department of Cultural Resources, so it would be in the same department as the State Council on the Arts. The bill would allow for the creation and sale of goods to be labeled as Native-made, to create a source of income for the Natives in New Hampshire. The numerous groups of Natives in the state have created a New Hampshire Inter-tribal Council, which holds statewide meetings and powwows. Dedicated to preserving the culture of the Natives in New Hampshire, the group is one of the chief supporters of the HB 1610; the Abenaki, the main tribe in the state, are the only people named specifically in the bill. Culture An Abenaki in Pan Indian (non traditional) clothing There are a dozen variations of the name \\"Abenaki\\", such as Abenaquiois, Abakivis, Quabenakionek, Wabenakies and others. The Abenaki were described in the Jesuit Relations as not cannibals, and as docile, ingenious, temperate in the use of liquor, and not profane. All Abenaki tribes lived a lifestyle similar to the Algonquian-speaking peoples of southern New England. They cultivated crops for food, and located their villages on or near fertile river floodplains. Other less major, but still important, parts of their diet included game and fish from hunting and fishing, and wild plants. They lived in scattered bands of extended families for most of the year. Each man had different hunting territories inherited through his father. Unlike the Iroquois, the Abenaki were patrilineal. Bands came together during the spring and summer at temporary villages near rivers, or somewhere along the seacoast for planting and fishing. These villages occasionally had to be fortified, depending on the alliances and enemies of other tribes or of Europeans near the village. Abenaki villages were quite small when compared to those of the Iroquois; the average number of people was about 100. Most Abenaki crafted dome-shaped, bark-covered wigwams for housing, though a few preferred oval-shaped long houses. During the winter, the Abenaki lived in small groups further inland. The homes there were bark-covered wigwams shaped in a way similar to the teepees of the Great Plains Indians. During the winter, the Abenaki lined the inside of their conical wigwams with bear and deer skins for warmth. The Abenaki also built long houses similar to those of the Iroquois. The Abenaki hold on to their traditions and ways of life in several ways. The Sokoki do so in the current constitution for their government. It has a chief, a council of elders, and methods and means for election to the council and chieftainship, as well as requirements for citizenship in the tribe.Constitution of the Sovereign Republic of the Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi They also list many of the different traditions they uphold, such as the different dances they perform and what those dances mean. During several of these dances there is no photography allowed, out of respect for the culture. For several, there are instructions such as \\"All stand while it is sung\\" or \\"All Stand to Show Respect.\\" Hair style and other marriage traditions Modernized traditional spiritual hairstyle for a married Abenaki man Traditionally, Abenaki men kept their hair long and loose. When a man found a girlfriend, he would tie his hair. When he married, he would attach the hair of the scalp with a piece of leather and shave all but the ponytail. The modernized spiritual version has the man with a girlfriend tying his hair and braiding it. When he marries, he keeps all his hair in a braid, shaving only the side and back of the head. The spiritual meaning surrounding this cut is most importantly to indicate betrothal or fidelity as a married Abenaki man. In much the same way as the Christian marriage tradition, there is an (optional) exchange and blessing of wedding rings. These rings are the outward and visible sign of the unity of this couple.The Encyclopedia of Native American CostumeThe Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki PeopleVerbal teachings (Oral Traditions) from the late \\"Berth Daigle\\" Changes in the hair style were symbolic of a complex courtship process. The man would give the woman a box made of a fine wood, which was decorated with the virtues of the woman; the woman would give a similar box to the man. Everyone in the tribe must agree to the marriage. They erect a pole planted in the earth, and if anyone disagrees, he strikes the pole. The disagreement must be resolved or the marriage does not happen. Gender, food, division of labor, and other cultural traits The Abenaki were a farming society that supplemented agriculture with hunting and gathering. Generally the men were the hunters. The women tended the fields and grew the crops. In their fields, they planted the crops in groups of \\"sisters\\". The three sisters were grown together: the stalk of corn supported the beans, and squash or pumpkins provided ground cover and reduced weeds. The men would hunt bears, deer, fish, and birds. The Abenaki were a patrilineal society, which was common among New England tribes. In this they differed from the six Iroquois tribes to the west in New York, and from many other North American Indian tribes who had matrilineal societies. In those systems, women controlled property and hereditary leadership was passed through the women's line. Children born to a married couple belonged to the mother's clan, and her eldest brother was an important mentor, especially for boys. The biological father had a lesser role. Group decision-making was done by a consensus method. The idea is that every group (family, band, tribe, etc.) must have equal say, so each group would elect a spokesperson. Each smaller group would send the decision of the group to an impartial facilitator. If there was a disagreement, the facilitator would tell the groups to discuss again. In addition to the debates, there was a goal of total understanding for all members. If there was not total understanding, the debate would stop until there was understanding. When the tribal members debate issues, they consider the Three Truths: #Peace: Is this preserved? #Righteousness: Is it moral? #Power: Does it preserve the integrity of the group? These truths guide all group deliberations, and the goal is to reach a consensus. If there is no consensus for change, they agree to keep the status quo. Storytelling Storytelling is a major part of Abenaki culture. It is used not only as entertainment but also as a teaching method. The Abenaki view stories as having lives of their own and being aware of how they are used. Stories were used as a means of teaching children behavior. Children were not to be mistreated, and so instead of punishing the child, they would be told a story. One of the stories is of Azban the Raccoon. This is a story about a proud raccoon that challenges a waterfall to a shouting contest. When the waterfall does not respond, Azban dives into the waterfall to try to outshout it; he is swept away because of his pride. This story would be used to show a child the pitfalls of pride. Mythology Ethnobotany The Abenaki smash the flowers and leaves of Ranunculus acris and sniff them for headaches.Rousseau, Jacques 1947 Ethnobotanique Abenakise. Archives de Folklore 11:145‚Äì182 (p. 166) They consume the fruit of Vaccinium myrtilloides as part of their traditional diet.Rousseau, Jacques, 1947, Ethnobotanique Abenakise, Archives de Folklore 11:145-182, page 152, 171 They also use the fruitRousseau, Jacques, 1947, Ethnobotanique Abenakise, Archives de Folklore 11:145-182, page 152 and the grains of Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides Rousseau, Jacques, 1947, Ethnobotanique Abenakise, Archives de Folklore 11:145-182, page 173 for food.A full list of their ethnobotany can be found at the Native American Ethnobotany Database (159 documented plant uses). Many other plants are used for various healing and treatment modalities, including for the skin, as a disinfectant, as a cure-all, as a respiratory aid, for colds, coughs, fevers, grippe, gas, blood strengthening, headaches and other pains, rheumatism, demulcent, nasal inflammation, anthelmintic, for the eyes, abortifacent, for the bones, antihemorrhagic, as a sedative, anaphrodisiac, swellings, urinary aid, gastrointestinal aid, as a hemostat, pediatric aid (such as for teething), and other unspecified or general uses. They use Hierochloe odorata, Apocynum, Betula papyrifera, Fraxinus americana, Fraxinus nigra, Laportea canadensis, a variety of Salix species, and Tilia americana var. americana for making baskets, canoes, snowshoes, and whistles. They use Hierochloe odorata and willow to make containers, Betula papyrifera to create containers, moose calls and other utilitarian pieces, and the bark of Cornus sericea ssp. sericea for smoking. They also use Acer rubrum, Acornus calamus, an unknown Amelanchier species, Caltha palustris, Cardamine diphylla, Cornus canadensis, an unknown Crataegus species, Fragaria virginiana, Gaultheria procumbens, Osmunda cinnamomea, Phaseolus vulgaris, Photinia melanocarpa, Prunus virginiana, Rubus idaeus and another unknown Rubus species, Solanum tuberosum, Spiraea alba var. latifolia, Vaccinium angustifolium, and Zea mays as a tea, soup, jelly, sweetener, condiment, snack, or meal. Population and epidemics Before the Abenaki, except the Pennacook and MiÍûåkmaq, had contact with the European world, their population may have numbered as many as 40,000. Around 20,000 would have been Eastern Abenaki, another 10,000 would have been Western Abenaki, and the last 10,000 would have been Maritime Abenaki. Early contacts with European fishermen resulted in two major epidemics that affected Abenaki during the 16th century. The first epidemic was an unknown sickness occurring sometime between 1564 and 1570, and the second one was typhus in 1586. Multiple epidemics arrived a decade prior to the English settlement of Massachusetts in 1620, when three separate sicknesses swept across New England and the Canadian Maritimes. Maine was hit very hard during the year of 1617, with a fatality rate of 75%, and the population of the Eastern Abenaki fell to about 5,000. The more isolated Western Abenaki suffered fewer fatalities, losing about half of their original population of 10,000. The new diseases continued to strike in epidemics, starting with smallpox in 1631, 1633, and 1639. Seven years later, an unknown epidemic struck, with influenza passing through the following year. Smallpox affected the Abenaki again in 1649, and diphtheria came through 10 years later. Smallpox struck in 1670, and influenza in 1675. Smallpox affected the Native Americans in 1677, 1679, 1687, along with measles, 1691, 1729, 1733, 1755, and finally in 1758. The Abenaki population continued to decline, but in 1676, they took in thousands of refugees from many southern New England tribes displaced by settlement and King Philip's War. Because of this, descendants of nearly every southern New England Algonquian tribe can be found among the Abenaki people. A century later, fewer than 1,000 Abenaki remained after the American Revolution. In the 1990 U.S. Census, 1,549 people identified themselves as Abenaki. So did 2,544 people in the 2000 U.S census, with 6,012 people claiming Abenaki heritage. In 1991 Canadian Abenaki numbered 945; by 2006 they numbered 2,164. Fiction Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, \\"The Church in the Wilderness\\" (1828). Several Abenaki characters and much about their 18th- century culture are featured in the Kenneth Roberts novel Arundel (1930). The film Northwest Passage (1940) is based on a novel of the same name by Roberts. The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel Bride of the Wilderness (1988), and James Archibald Houston's novel Ghost Fox (1977), both of which are set in the eighteenth century; and in Jodi Picoult's Second Glance (2003) and Lone Wolf (2012) novels, set in the contemporary world. Books for younger readers both have historical settings: Joseph Bruchac's The Arrow Over the Door (1998) (grades 4‚Äì6) is set in 1777; and Beth Kanell's young adult novel, The Darkness Under the Water (2008), concerns a young Abenaki-French Canadian girl during the time of the Vermont Eugenics Project, 1931‚Äì1936. The first sentence in Norman Mailer's novel Harlot's Ghost makes reference to the Abenaki: \\"On a late-winter evening in 1983, while driving through fog along the Maine coast, recollections of old campfires began to drift into the March mist, and I thought of the Abnaki Indians of the Algonquin tribe who dwelt near Bangor a thousand years ago.\\" Non-fiction Letters and other non-fiction writing can be found in the anthology Dawnland Voices. Selections include letters from leader of the early praying town, Wamesit in Massachusetts Samuel Numphow, Sagamore Kancamagus, and writings on the Abenaki language by former chief of the reserve at Odanak in Quebec, Joseph Laurent as well as many others. Accounts of life with the Abenaki can be found in the captivity narratives written by women taken captive by the Abenaki from the early New England settlements: Mary Rowlandson (1682), Hannah Duston (1702); Elizabeth Hanson (1728); Susannah Willard Johnson (1754); and Jemima Howe (1792).Women's Indian Captivity Narratives, ed.

One of the pioneers of gothic rock, Bauhaus were known for their dark image and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, psychedelia, funk, power pop and ska.‚ÄúBig Ups: Bauhaus‚Äô Kevin Haskins Dompe and David J Haskins Pick Their Bandcamp Favorites‚Äú. Bandcamp.com. Retrieved 2 November 2019 Bauhaus broke up in 1983. Murphy began a solo career while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour, again from 2005 to 2008, and once again in 2019. History The Bauhaus emblem, designed by Oskar Schlemmer. Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played together in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived of these was a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song \\"In the Flat Field\\". Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control. Instead, Chris Barber was brought in to play bass, and together the four musicians formed the band S.R. However, within a few weeks Ash relented, and replaced Barber with David J, who suggested the new name Bauhaus 1919. David J. had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was \\"the right thing to do\\". With their lineup complete, the band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year's Eve 1978. The band had chosen the name Bauhaus 1919, a reference to the German Bauhaus art movement of the 1920s, because of its \\"stylistic implications and associations\\", according to David J. The band also chose the same typeface used on the Bauhaus college building in Dessau, Germany, as well as the Bauhaus emblem, designed by Oskar Schlemmer. Bauhaus associate Graham Bentley said that the group was unlike any Northampton band of the time, most of which played predominantly cover songs. Bentley videotaped a performance by the group, which was sent to several record labels, in the hope of obtaining a contract. This approach was hindered partly because many record companies at the time did not have home video equipment, so the group decided to record a demo. \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" and 4AD After only six weeks as a band, Bauhaus entered the studio for the first time at Beck Studios in Wellingborough to record a demo. One of the five tracks recorded during the session, \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\", more than nine minutes long, was released as the group's debut single in August 1979 on Small Wonder Records. The band was listed simply as Bauhaus, with the \\"1919\\" abandoned. The single received a positive review in Sounds, and stayed on the British independent charts for two years. The song received crucial airplay on BBC Radio 1 and DJ John Peel's evening show, and Bauhaus were subsequently asked to record a session for Peel's show, which was broadcast on 3 January 1980. Of the additional tracks, Classic Rock Magazine wrote that, \\"The rest of the material finds a band fumbling for direction, even touching on ska.\\" Signing with the 4AD label, the band released two more singles, \\"Dark Entries\\" in January 1980 and \\"Terror Couple Kill Colonel\\" in June 1980, before issuing their first album In the Flat Field in October 1980. NME described it as \\"Gothick-Romantick pseudo-decadence\\". Despite negative reviews, In the Flat Field topped the indie charts, and made headway on the UK Albums Chart, peaking for one week at No. 72. In December 1980 Bauhaus released a cover of \\"Telegram Sam\\", a hit by glam rock pioneers T. Rex, as a single. Beggars Banquet and breakup Bauhaus' growing success outstripped 4AD's resources, so the band moved to 4AD's parent label, Beggars Banquet Records. Bauhaus released \\"Kick in the Eye\\" in March 1981 as its debut release on the label. The single reached No. 59 on the charts. The following single, \\"The Passion of Lovers\\", peaked at No. 56 in July 1981. Bauhaus released their second album, Mask, in October 1981. The band employed more keyboards, and a variety of other instruments, to add to the diversity of the record. In an unconventional move, the group shot a video for the album's title track as a promotional tool for the band as a whole, rather than any specific song from the record. In July 1982 Bauhaus released the single \\"Spirit\\", produced by Hugh Jones. It was intended to break into the Top 30, but only reached No. 42. The band was displeased with the single, and re-recorded it later in 1982 for their third album The Sky's Gone Out. In the same year, Bauhaus scored their biggest hit with a cover of David Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", which was recorded during a BBC session. The song reached No. 15 on the British charts, and earned the band an appearance on the television show Top of the Pops. Due to the success of the single, the album also became the band's biggest hit, peaking at No. 4. That same year, Bauhaus made an appearance in the horror film The Hunger, where they performed \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" during the opening credits. The final cut of the scene focused on Murphy; this, coupled with the singer's modelling work in a popular ad campaign for Maxell, caused resentment among the rest of the group. Prior to the recording of their fourth album, Burning from the Inside (1983), Murphy was stricken with pneumonia, which prevented him from contributing much to the album. Ash and David J took the reins, becoming the driving forces behind the record and even performing lead vocals on several tracks. The album's lead single, \\"She's in Parties\\", reached No. 26 on the charts and earned Bauhaus their third and final Top of the Pops appearance. Bauhaus then embarked on an international promotional tour for the album, with dates in Europe and the Far East. David J recalled that the night before they were supposed to perform two shows at Hammersmith Palais in London, the group decided to disband. The band played their farewell show on 5 July 1983 at the Hammersmith Palais; dedicated fans had been warned by the band's crew not to miss the show, without telling them it was the last. After a long encore, consisting of some of their early songs, David J left the stage with the words \\"rest in peace\\". Burning from the Inside was released a week later. The album received largely positive reviews and reached No. 13 on the charts. Bauhaus released the single \\"Sanity Assassin\\" in limited quantities as a farewell gift for those who joined the group's fan club.  Subsequent developments: reunions and a final album  Bauhaus reunited for the \\"Resurrection Tour\\" in 1998, their stage show opened with Double Dare and Pete Murphy singing to the audience via a TV screen set up centre- stage.http://link2wales.co.uk/1998/gigreviews/bauhaus-manchester-academy/ The tour featured a new song, \\"The Dog's a Vapour\\", which was also included in the Heavy Metal 2000 film soundtrack. A live album was recorded during the tour, Gotham, which was released the following year. It included a studio recording of Bauhaus' cover of the Dead Can Dance song \\"Severance\\". Daniel Ash in 2006 Bauhaus reunited again in 2005, playing that year's Coachella Festival in Indio, California. They opened their set with Murphy being lowered upside-down to the stage, singing \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\". Following Murphy's 2005 tour, Bauhaus embarked on a full tour beginning in North America in autumn 2005, ending in Europe in February 2006. During the tour, Bauhaus covered Joy Division's \\"Transmission\\". The band also mentioned that they hoped to record new music. In May they performed as opening act for Nine Inch Nails on the summer leg of the latter's US tour. In 2008, Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's end and the album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said \\"We were getting along really well, but there was an incident that occurred\\", and added that as a result, \\"Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit\\". In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he \\"was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable\\", but in the end, \\"that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really\\". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: \\"You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer\\". In September 2019, after a 13-year hiatus, Bauhaus announced a show at the 5-000 seat Hollywood Palladium with all original members on November 3. A second show was added for the following night, after the first show sold out quickly. A third date at the same venue was then confirmed for December 1.  Post-Bauhaus careers  After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band moved on to various solo work. Murphy worked briefly with bassist Mick Karn of Japan in the band Dalis Car, before going solo with such albums as 1986's Should the World Fail to Fall Apart, 1988's Love Hysteria and 1989's Deep. Ash had already started Tones on Tail with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side project in 1982; after Bauhaus broke up, Kevin Haskins joined the group, and the trio released an album and several EPs before breaking up after a 1984 American tour. During this time, David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with the Jazz Butcher, and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist Alan Moore in the short-lived band the Sinister Ducks. During a discussion about the state of their projects at the time, Ash and David J began talking about reforming Bauhaus. All four band members arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed to show up on the scheduled day. The other three band members rehearsed regardless, and were inspired by the chemistry they had as a trio. As a result, Ash and the Haskins brothers formed Love and Rockets in 1985. Love and Rockets scored a US hit four years later with \\"So Alive\\". The band broke up in 1999 after seven albums. Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single \\"Candy on the Cross\\". In 2017, Ash and Kevin Haskins toured as Poptone with Haskins' daughter Diva Dompe on bass. The group performed songs from Bauhaus, Tones on Tail, and Love and Rockets along with cover songs. A live album recorded at various stops on the tour was released through PledgeMusic. In 2018, Murphy and David J announced a tour of New Zealand, Australia and Europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Bauhaus, with the pair performing In the Flat Field in its entirety.  Musical style  Vocalist Peter Murphy. Bauhaus cited early post- punk bands Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees among their influences. Daniel Ash said his earliest influence was the music of Dave and Ansell Collins, particularly their Double Barrel single.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpjJXPzNMw The singing was compared to David Bowie and Jacques Brel. The band's other influences included punk rock (e.g. Devo, the Stooges and Sex Pistols), glam rock (e.g. David Bowie, T. Rex, Alice Cooper and Gary Glitter), psychedelic rock (e.g. Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd, the Beatles and The Doors), art rock/avant-garde music/experimental rock (e.g. Brian Eno, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Pere Ubu, Roxy Music, Suicide and the Velvet Underground), krautrock (e.g. Kraftwerk, Can and Neu!), funk (e.g. James Brown, Bobby Byrd, Sly and the Family Stone) and Jamaican dub music (e.g. Lee Scratch Perry, Errol Thompson and King Tubby). When asked about the influence of reggae on Bauhaus' music, Murphy stated that it was \\"massive. We were listening to toasting music all the time, and David brought in a lot of bass lines that were very lead riffs [...] those bass lines really formed the basis of the music\\" \\" In regards to the influence of the original Bauhaus movement on the band, Murphy stated that \\"Bauhaus had no influence on Bauhaus (the band) except for being the sound, shape, energetic, and sensory birth name of our group.\\" Bauhaus combined these influences to create a gloomy, earnest and introspective version of post-punk, which appealed to many music fans who felt disillusioned in the wake of punk's collapse. Its crucial elements included Murphy's deep and sonorous voice, Ash's jagged guitar playing and David J's dub-influenced bass. Their sound and gloomy style would eventually come to be known as gothic rock.  Legacy and influence  Brixton Academy in London, England, 3 February 2006 Although the band were short- lived, their music was influential upon many bands and artists that followed. They had a significant impact on gothic, darkwave and deathrock artists including Christian Death, Type O Negative, Deine Lakaien, Lycia, and Wolfsheim. The Mission's Wayne Hussey sang with Murphy on stage in 2013. Bauhaus inspired many industrial rock groups and artists, like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Nitzer Ebb, Skinny Puppy, and Maynard James Keenan (from Tool). The band has been cited as an influence by electronic act Carl Craig, the Iranian musician Azam Ali, the electronica act Moby, the crust punk band Amebix, the grindcore band Napalm Death, the hard rock/heavy metal band the Cult, the extreme metal band Celtic Frost, and the lo-fi musician Ariel Pink. Bauhaus were also hailed by several alternative/indie rock groups including Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden, the Smashing Pumpkins, A Neon Rome, AFI, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Korn, Hole, Interpol, My Chemical Romance, She Wants Revenge, Shearwater, Elliott Smith, the Dresden Dolls, the Flaming Lips and the Horrors. Bauhaus influenced Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra in the writing of that band's 1982 album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses listed the Bauhaus compilation Bauhaus 1979‚Äì1983 in his 100 favorite albums list. The group have been namechecked by several other prominent musicians, including Steve Albini (of Big Black), Jeff Ament (of Pearl Jam), Bradford Cox (of Deerhunter), Courtney Taylor-Taylor (of the Dandy Warhols), Jesse Hughes (of the Eagles of Death Metal), Jaz Coleman (of Killing Joke), Al Jourgensen (of Ministry), Randy Blythe (of Lamb of God), Fred Durst (of Limp Bizkit), Jonathan Davis (of Korn), Mark Lanegan (of Screaming Trees), Sean Yseult (of White Zombie), Bilinda Butcher (of My Bloody Valentine), Alan Sparhawk (of Low), Stuart Braithwaite (of Mogwai) Jehnny Beth of Savages, and Stephen Malkmus (of Pavement). Blink-182 namedropped Bauhaus on their song \\"She's Out of Her Mind\\" on their California album. The Bauhaus song \\"All We Ever Wanted Was Everything\\" (from The Sky's Gone Out) was covered by several artists and bands, including John Frusciante (guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), MGMT and Xiu Xiu (who recorded it in 2006 for their Tu Mi Piaci EP). Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins sang T. Rex's \\"Telegram Sam\\" and \\"All We Ever Wanted Was Everything\\" live on stage with Bauhaus in 1998. \\"Double Dare\\" was covered by the alternative rock band the God Machine. The band's signature song, \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\", was covered by numerous acts, including Until December (1986), the Electric Hellfire Club (1996), Opera IX (on 2000 album The Black Opera: Symphoni√¶ Mysteriorum in Laudem Tenebrarum), Sepultura (on 2001 album Nation), Nouvelle Vague (on 2006 album Bande √† part), Chris Cornell (2007), Nine Inch Nails (2009), Trent Reznor with Murphy and TV on the Radio (2013), Massive Attack (2013), David J with Jill Tracy (2013), Chvrches (for the 2014 Vampire Academy soundtrack), Dead Cross (on their 2017 debut album) and The Damned (2019).  Cultural references  Bauhaus's fanbase extends beyond music; the American novelist Chuck Palahniuk was influenced by the Bauhaus song \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" when writing his 2005 novel Haunted. In James O'Barr's 1989 comic book The Crow, the facial features of Eric Draven were based on those of Peter Murphy. In Neil Gaiman's series The Sandman, Dream's face and appearance were also based on Murphy. Additionally, comic book writer Alan Moore wrote the sleeve notes of Mask and contributed an anonymous Bauhaus review called \\"Phantoms of the Teenage Opera\\" to the UK music paper Sounds.br /> The 1984 music video of the song \\"You're the Inspiration\\" from the American band Chicago featured lead singer Peter Cetera wearing a Bauhaus T-shirt. In the Beavis and Butt-head season 3 episode \\"Meet God, Part II\\" (1993), they view and comment on a music video for Bauhaus' Bowie cover, \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". Susie Lewis, the co-creator of the American animated series Daria, is a fan of the band and used their song \\"1. David Jay 2. Peter Murphy 3. Kevin Haskins 4. Daniel Ash\\" in the closing credits of episode 213, \\"Write Where it Hurts\\". In the 2003 South Park episode \\"Raisins\\", Henrietta Biggle (one of the \\"goth kids\\") had a bedroom poster of \\"Blauhaus\\", a parody version of the band. Saturday Night Live's recurring \\"Goth Talk\\" skit used \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" as its theme song.

He appeared in more than 100 films and 150 television programs, portraying more than 220 characters. Nielsen was born in Regina, Saskatchewan. He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and later worked as a disc jockey before receiving a scholarship to study theatre at the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his acting debut in 1950, appearing in 46 live television programs a year. Nielsen made his film debut in 1956, with supporting roles in several drama, Western, and romance films produced between the 1950s and the 1970s. Although his notable performances in the films Forbidden Planet and The Poseidon Adventure gave him standing as a serious actor, Nielsen later gained enduring recognition for his deadpan comedy roles during the 1980s, after being cast against type for the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker comedy film Airplane!. In his comedy roles, Nielsen specialized in portraying characters oblivious to and complicit in their absurd surroundings. Nielsen's performance in Airplane! marked his turning point, which made him \\"the Olivier of spoofs\\" according to film critic Roger Ebert, and leading to further success in the genre with The Naked Gun film series, based on the earlier short-lived television series Police Squad!, in which Nielsen also starred. Nielsen received a variety of awards and was inducted into the Canada's Walk of Fame and Hollywood Walk of Fame. Early life Nielsen was born on 11 February 1926 in Regina, Saskatchewan. His mother, Mabel Elizabeth (n√©e Davies), was an immigrant from Wales, and his father, Ingvard Eversen Nielsen (1900‚Äì1975), was a Danish-born constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nielsen was born the second of three boys, the elder, Erik Nielsen (1924‚Äì2008), was a long-time Canadian Member of Parliament, cabinet minister, and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1986. Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt (pictured here in the 1936 film His Brother's Wife) inspired him to become an actor. Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was an actor known for his portrayal of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, \\"I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at me as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I was in a position to know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better.\\" Nielsen lived for several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories, where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he graduated from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of the Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, \\"I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose, and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75 (). Career Early career Nielsen's career began in dramatic roles on television during \\"Television's Golden Age\\", appearing in 46 live programs in 1950 alone. He said there \\"was very little gold, we only got $75 or $100 per show.\\" He narrated documentaries and commercials and most of his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful. Hal Erickson of Allmovie noted that \\"much of Nielsen's early work was undistinguished; he was merely a handsome leading man in an industry overstocked with handsome leading men.\\" In 1956, he made his feature-film debut in the Michael Curtiz-directed musical film The Vagabond King. In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Nielsen remembered Curtiz as \\"a sadist, a charming sadist, but a sadist\\". Nielsen called this film \\"The Vagabond Turkey\\". Though the film was not a success, producer Nicholas Nayfack offered him an audition for the science-fiction film Forbidden Planet, resulting in Nielsen's taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Nielsen, along with co-star Anne Francis, in his second film, Forbidden Planet (1956). Nielsen: \\"Supposedly a science-fiction version of Shakespeare's The Tempest, it was all about the id, or something like that. Who knows? The Trekkies today regard it as the forerunner of Star Trek. I just had to wear a tight uniform and make eyes at Anne Francis. I was pretty thin back then.\\" Forbidden Planet became an instant success, and roles in other MGM films such as Ransom! (1956), The Opposite Sex (1956) and Hot Summer Night (1957) followed. In 1957 he won the lead role opposite Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor, which, as a Chicago Tribune critic wrote in 1998, made people consider Nielsen a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead. However, dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios \\"a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver\\", Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd got the role. After leaving the studios, Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox, as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In a 1988 interview, he reflected on the series, saying, \\"That was a great experience, because the Disney people didn't do their shows like everyone else, knocking out an episode a week. ... We only had to do an episode a month, and the budgets were extremely high for TV at that time. We had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops, and very authentic costumes.\\" Eight episodes were produced and aired between 1959 and 1961. Nielsen and Nancy Malone in Bonanza (1967) His television appearances include Justice, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Virginian, and The Wild Wild West. In 1961, he was the lead in a Los Angeles police drama called The New Breed. He guest-starred in a 1964 episode of Daniel Boone with Fess Parker in a minor but credited role. In 1968, he had a major role in the pilot for the police series Hawaii Five-O, and appeared in one of the seventh-season episodes. In 1969, he had the leading role as a police officer in The Bold Ones: The Protectors. In 1972, Nielsen appeared as the ship's captain in The Poseidon Adventure. He also starred in the William Girdler's 1977 action film, Project: Kill. His last dramatic role before mainly comedy roles was the 1979 Canadian disaster film City on Fire, in which he played a corrupt mayor. In 1980, he guest-starred as Sinclair on the CBS miniseries The Chisholms. Airplane! and The Naked Gun Nielsen's supporting role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! was a turning point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, \\"Surely you can't be serious?\\", he responded with a curt, \\"I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.\\" In several interviews, he reflected on the line: \\"I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise ... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was \\"pleased and honored that [he] had a chance to deliver that line.\\" As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at number 79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top-10 comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second-greatest comedy film of all time.\\"Life of Brian named best comedy\\". BBC News. Retrieved 18 January 2014 In 2012, Empire voted it number one in the 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010, Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Leslie Nielsen (right) in the role that established him as a comedic actor: Dr. Rumack in the 1980 movie Airplane! The directors cast Nielsen for his ability to play like \\"a fish in water\\", saying \\"You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly ... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy.\\" For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had \\"always been cast against type before\\", and that comedy was what he always wanted to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series. Police Squad's opening sequence was based on the 1950s show M Squad, which starred Lee Marvin, and opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The Hank Simms voice-over and the show's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including The Fugitive, The Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, The F.B.I., and Cannon. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him. Although the show lasted only six episodes, Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Six years after cancellation of Police Squad!, the film The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: \\"You have an idea of how you're going to do something, and it's your vision ... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance.\\" This movie grossed over $78 million and was well received by critics. Ebert's ‚Äìstar review (out of four) noted, \\"You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing.\\" The Naked Gun spawned two sequels: The Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear (1991) and Naked Gun : The Final Insult (1994). The Naked Gun grossed more than the original, with $86.9 million, while ' grossed $51.1 million. Nielsen remained open to a fourth Naked Gun film, although he doubted that it would be produced ‚Äî \\"I don't think so\\", he said in 2005. \\"If there hasn't been one by now, I doubt it. I think it would be wonderful.\\" Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw, capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of the Undertaker, who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find the Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut), thus they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider. Noncomedic roles after Airplane! included Prom Night (1980) and Creepshow (1982), both horror films, and as a dramatic and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy Soul Man. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client of a prostitute killed in self- defense by Barbra Streisand's character, Claudia Draper, in Martin Ritt's courtroom drama Nuts (1987). Later comedies After Airplane! and The Naked Gun, Nielsen portrayed similarly styled roles in a number of other films. These mostly emulated the style of The Naked Gun with varying success and often targeted specific films; many were panned by critics and most performed poorly. Repossessed (1990) and 2001: A Space Travesty (2001) were parodies of The Exorcist and 2001: A Space Odyssey, respectively. Both attempted absurd comedy, but were poorly received. Even a leading role in a Mel Brooks comic horror, Dracula: Dead and Loving It, failed to generate much box-office excitement, although it did gain a following in a later release to video. Both 1996's Spy Hard and 1998's Wrongfully Accused, a parody of James Bond films and The Fugitive, were popular on video, but not well received by critics. His attempt at children's comedies met additional criticism. Surf Ninjas (1993) and Mr. Magoo (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in Surf Ninjas was only \\"an extended cameo\\" and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers \\"avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen outside of the Naked Gun series.\\" Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo, a live-action remake of the 1950s cartoon, by saying, \\"I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better, but I can't think of anything to say other than to make the film again.\\" Nielsen's first major success since The Naked Gun came in a supporting role in Scary Movie 3 (2003). His appearance as President Harris led to a second appearance in its sequel, Scary Movie 4 (2006). This was the first time Nielsen had reprised a character since Frank Drebin. In one scene, Nielsen appeared almost nude, and one critic referred to the scene as putting \\"the 'scary' in Scary Movie 4.\\" Video, stage, and celebrity productions Nielsen also produced instructional golf videos, which were not presented in a serious style, beginning with 1993's Bad Golf Made Easier. The videos combined comedy with golf techniques. The series spawned two additional sequels, Bad Golf My Way (1994) and Stupid Little Golf Video (1997). Nielsen also co-wrote a fictional autobiography titled The Naked Truth. The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor with a long history of prestigious films. In his 80s, Nielsen performed serious roles on screen and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, in which he played Clarence Darrow), as well as providing voice-overs and appearances for commercials (including spots for a credit union in Arizona, where he owned a secondary residence), cartoons such as Zeroman, where he had the leading role/voice, children's shows, such as Pumper Pups, which he narrated, and comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played The Price Is Right, Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and Press Your Luck for charity. Final acting years Leslie Nielsen in March 2009 at DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania. Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen began playing a small role as a doctor in the humorous yet educational television show Doctor*Ology. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: \\"There are any number of things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries.\\" In 2007, Nielsen starred in the drama Music Within. In 2008, he portrayed a version of Uncle Ben for Superhero Movie, a spoof of superhero films. He then appeared in the 2008 parody An American Carol, which David Zucker directed, produced, and co-wrote. He appeared in the 2009 parody Stan Helsing. Nielsen portrayed the doctor in the Spanish horror comedy Spanish Movie, a spoof comedy like Scary Movie, but making fun of popular Spanish films. Nielsen appeared in more than 100 films and 1,500 television episodes, portraying more than 220 characters. Personal life Nielsen married four times: to nightclub singer Monica Boyar (1950‚Äì1956), Alisande Ullman (1958‚Äì1973), Brooks Oliver (1981‚Äì1983), and Barbaree Earl (2001‚Äì2010). Nielsen had two daughters from his second marriage, Maura and Thea Nielsen. Nielsen often played golf. He joked, \\"I have no goals or ambition. I do, however, wish to work enough to maintain whatever celebrity status I have so that they will continue to invite me to golf tournaments.\\" His interest in the sport led him to comedic instructional films. Nielsen was a practical joker, and known for pranking people with a portable hand- controlled fart machine.Will Harris, \\"Surely You Can't Be Serious: An Oral History of Airplane!\\", A.V.

His epitaph reads \\"Let 'er rip\\", a final reference to his favourite practical joke. In his later years, Nielsen and his wife Barbaree resided between homes in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Paradise Valley, Arizona. Nielsen was legally deaf and wore hearing aids for most of his life. Because of this, he supported the Better Hearing Institute. Later in life, Nielsen had knee osteoarthritis. He participated in an educational video from The Arthritis Research Centre of Canada (ARC), demonstrating the physical examination of a patient with knee osteoarthritis. Death Leslie Nielsen's gravestone bearing his epitaph, a final reference to his favorite practical joke, a fart machine. In November 2010, Nielsen was admitted to Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with pneumonia. On 28 November, Doug Nielsen, Nielsen's nephew, told the CJOB radio station that 84-year-old Nielsen had died in his sleep from pneumonia around 5:30 pm EST surrounded by family and friends. His body was interred in Fort Lauderdale's Evergreen Cemetery. As a final bit of humor, Nielsen chose \\"Let 'er rip\\" as his epitaph. Achievements Among his awards, in 1995 Nielsen received UCLA's Jack Benny Award. In 1988, he became the 1,884th personality to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Blvd. In 2001 he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. The following year he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, although he was also a naturalized US citizen. With his American status, he maintained his Canadian heritage: \\"There's no way you can be a Canadian and think you can lose it ... Canadians are a goodly group. They are very aware of caring and helping.\\" On 19 May 2005, during the centennial gala of his birth province, Saskatchewan, Leslie Nielsen was introduced to HM Queen Elizabeth II. In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. On 20 February 2002, Nielsen was named an honorary citizen of West Virginia and an Ambassador of Mountain State Goodwill. Nielsen visited the state many times to speak and visit friends. In 2003, in honour of Nielsen, Grant MacEwan College named its school of communications after him. Also in 2003, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists awarded him the ACTRA Award of Excellence.

His writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under Ottoman rule. Born in Travnik in the Austria-Hungary, modern-day Bosnia, Andriƒá attended high school in Sarajevo, where he became an active member of several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andriƒá was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his Ph.D. in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andriƒá returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including Na Drini ƒáuprija (The Bridge on the Drina). Following the war, Andriƒá was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E. M. Forster. The Committee cited \\"the epic force with which he ... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\\". Afterwards, Andriƒá's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andriƒá's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March. In the years following Andriƒá's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andriƒá. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andriƒá was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons, and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community at the start of the 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature. Early life Family The house in which Andriƒá was born Ivan Andriƒá was born in the village of Dolac, near Travnik, on 9 October 1892, while his mother, Katarina (' Pejiƒá), was in the town visiting relatives. Andriƒá's parents were both Catholic Croats. He was his parents' only child. His father, Antun, was a struggling silversmith who resorted to working as a school janitor in Sarajevo, where he lived with his wife and infant son. At the age of 32, Antun died of tuberculosis, like most of his siblings. Andriƒá was only two years old at the time. Widowed and penniless, Andriƒá's mother took him to Vi≈°egrad and placed him in the care of her sister-in-law Ana and brother-in-law Ivan Matkoviƒá, a police officer. The couple were financially stable but childless, so they agreed to look after the infant and brought him up as their own. Meanwhile, Andriƒá's mother returned to Sarajevo seeking employment. Andriƒá was raised in a country that had changed little since the Ottoman period despite being mandated to Austria-Hungary at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Eastern and Western culture intermingled in Bosnia to a far greater extent than anywhere else in the Balkan peninsula. Having lived there from an early age, Andriƒá came to cherish Vi≈°egrad, calling it \\"my real home\\". Though it was a small provincial town (or kasaba), Vi≈°egrad proved to be an enduring source of inspiration. It was a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional town, the predominant groups being Serbs (Orthodox Christians) and Bosniaks (Muslims). From an early age, Andriƒá closely observed the customs of the local people. These customs, and the particularities of life in eastern Bosnia, would later be detailed in his works. Andriƒá made his first friends in Vi≈°egrad, playing with them along the Drina River and the town's famous Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge. Primary and secondary education At age six, Andriƒá began primary school. He later recounted that these were the happiest days of his life. At the age of ten, he received a three-year scholarship from a Croat cultural group called Napredak (Progress) to study in Sarajevo. In the autumn of 1902, he was registered at the Great Sarajevo Gymnasium (), the oldest secondary school in Bosnia. While in Sarajevo, Andriƒá lived with his mother, who worked in a rug factory. At the time, the city was overflowing with civil servants from all parts of Austria-Hungary, and thus many languages could be heard in its restaurants, caf√©s and on its streets. Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this. From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andriƒá's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \\"The teaching program,\\" biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, \\"was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [Habsburg] Monarchy\\". Andriƒá disapproved. \\"All that came ... at secondary school and university,\\" he wrote, \\"was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love.\\" Andriƒá experienced difficulty in his studies, finding mathematics particularly challenging, and had to repeat the sixth grade. For a time, he lost his scholarship due to poor grades. Hawkesworth attributes Andriƒá's initial lack of academic success at least partly to his alienation from most of his teachers. Nonetheless, he excelled in languages, particularly Latin, Greek and German. Although he initially showed substantial interest in natural sciences, he later began focusing on literature, likely under the influence of his two Croat instructors, writer and politician ƒêuro ≈†urmin and poet . Of all his teachers in Sarajevo, Andriƒá liked Alaupoviƒá best, and the two became lifelong friends. Andriƒá felt he was destined to become a writer. He began writing in secondary school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her one of his first works, she replied: \\"Did you write this? What did you do that for?\\" Andriƒá published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Knji≈æevne novine (Literary News). One of Andriƒá's favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andriƒá's poetry from this period as \\"subjective and mostly melancholic\\". Andriƒá's translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time. Student activism In 1908, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the chagrin of South Slav nationalists like Andriƒá. In late 1911, Andriƒá was elected the first president of the Serbo-Croat Progressive Movement (; SHNO), a Sarajevo-based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists, who dismissed them as \\"traitors to their nations\\". Unfazed, Andriƒá continued agitating against the Austro-Hungarians. On 28 February 1912, he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo's railway station, urging them to continue their demonstrations. The Austro-Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members. Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way, though Andriƒá himself escaped punishment. Andriƒá also joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia, becoming one of its most prominent members. In 1912, Andriƒá registered at the University of Zagreb, having received a scholarship from an educational foundation in Sarajevo. He enrolled in the department of mathematics and natural sciences because these were the only fields for which scholarships were offered, but was able to take some courses in Croatian literature. Andriƒá was well received by South Slav nationalists there, and regularly participated in on-campus demonstrations. This led to his being reprimanded by the university. In 1913, after completing two semesters in Zagreb, Andriƒá transferred to the University of Vienna, where he resumed his studies. While in Vienna, he joined South Slav students in promoting the cause of Yugoslav unity and worked closely with two Yugoslav student societies, the Serbian cultural society Zora (Dawn) and the Croatian student club Zvonimir, which shared his views on \\"integral Yugoslavism\\" (the eventual assimilation of all South Slav cultures into one). Despite finding like-minded students in Vienna, the city's climate took a toll on Andriƒá's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been taking part in a protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andriƒá had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. He transferred in early 1914. Andriƒá started his literary career as a poet. In 1914, he was one of the contributors to Hrvatska mlada lirika (Croatian Youth Lyrics) and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews. World War I Ovƒçarevo monastery, Travnik On 28 June 1914, Andriƒá learned of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a Young Bosnian and close friend of Andriƒá who had been one of the first to join the SHNO in 1911. Upon hearing the news, Andriƒá decided to leave Krak√≥w and return to Bosnia. He travelled by train to Zagreb, and in mid-July, departed for the coastal city of Split with his friend, the poet and fellow South Slav nationalist Vladimir ƒåerina. Andriƒá and ƒåerina spent the rest of July at the latter's summer home. As the month progressed, the two became increasingly uneasy about the escalating political crisis that followed the Archduke's assassination and eventually led to the outbreak of World War I. They then went to Rijeka, where ƒåerina left Andriƒá without explanation, only saying he urgently needed to go to Italy. Several days later, Andriƒá learned that ƒåerina was being sought by the police. By the time war was declared, Andriƒá had returned to Split feeling exhausted and ill. Given that most of his friends had already been arrested for nationalist activities, he was certain the same fate would befall him. Despite not being involved in the assassination plot, in late July or early August, Andriƒá was arrested for \\"anti-state activities\\", and imprisoned in Split. He was subsequently transferred to a prison in ≈†ibenik, then to Rijeka and finally to Maribor, where he arrived on 19 August. Plagued by tuberculosis, Andriƒá passed the time reading, talking to his cellmates and learning languages. By the following year, the case against Andriƒá was dropped due to lack of evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovƒçarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan friars. Andriƒá soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perƒçinliƒá and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andriƒá lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andriƒá's mother soon came to visit him and offered to serve as the parish priest's housekeeper. \\"Mother is very happy,\\" Andriƒá wrote. \\"It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can't grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother.\\" Andriƒá was later transferred to a prison in Zenica, where Perƒçinliƒá regularly visited him. The Austro-Hungarian Army declared Andriƒá a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for all of Austria- Hungary's political prisoners. His freedom of movement restored, Andriƒá visited Vi≈°egrad and reunited with several of his school friends. He remained in Vi≈°egrad until late July, when he was mobilized. Because of his poor health, Andriƒá was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the Reservospital in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb. There, Andriƒá again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a gathering place for dissidents and former political prisoners. In January 1918, Andriƒá joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a short-lived pan-Yugoslav periodical called Knji≈æevni jug (Literary South). Here and in other periodicals, Andriƒá published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over the course of several months in early 1918, Andriƒá's health began to deteriorate, and his friends believed he was nearing death. However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in Krapina writing Ex ponto, a book of prose poetry that was published in July. It was his first book. Interwar period The end of World War I saw the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, which was replaced by a newly established South Slav state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). In late 1918, Andriƒá re-enrolled at the University of Zagreb and resumed his studies. By January 1919, he fell ill again and was back in the hospital. Fellow writer Ivo Vojnoviƒá became worried for his friend's life and appealed to Andriƒá's old schoolteacher Tugomir Alaupoviƒá (who had just been appointed the new kingdom's Minister of Religious Affairs) to use his connections and help Andriƒá pay for treatment abroad. In February, Andriƒá wrote Alaupoviƒá and asked for help finding a government job in Belgrade. Eventually, Andriƒá chose to seek treatment in Split, where he stayed for the following six months. During his time on the Mediterranean coast, Andriƒá completed a second volume of prose poetry, titled Nemiri (Unrest), which was published the following year. By the time Andriƒá left, he had almost fully recovered, and quipped that he was cured by the \\"air, sun and figs.\\" Troubled by news that his uncle was seriously ill, Andriƒá left Split in August and went to him in Vi≈°egrad. He returned to Zagreb two weeks later. Early diplomatic career bust of Andriƒá in Graz, Austria In the immediate aftermath of the war, Andriƒá's tendency to identify with Serbdom became increasingly apparent. In a correspondence dated December 1918, Vojnoviƒá described the young writer as \\"a Catholic ... a Serb from Bosnia.\\" By 1919, Andriƒá had acquired his undergraduate degree in South Slavic history and literature at the University of Zagreb. He was perennially impoverished, and earned a meagre sum through his writing and editorial work. By mid-1919, he realized that he would be unable to financially support himself and his aging mother, aunt and uncle for much longer, and his appeals to Alaupoviƒá for help securing a government job became more frequent. In September 1919, Alaupoviƒá offered him a secretarial position at the Ministry of Religion, which Andriƒá accepted. In late October, Andriƒá left for Belgrade. He became involved in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andriƒá disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupoviƒá asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andriƒá's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the Vatican. Andriƒá left Belgrade soon after, and reported for duty in late February. At this time, he published his first short story, Put Alije ƒêerzeleza (The Journey of Alija ƒêerzelez). He complained that the consulate was understaffed and that he did not have enough time to write. All evidence suggests he had a strong distaste for the ceremony and pomp that accompanied his work in the diplomatic service, but according to Hawkesworth, he endured it with \\"dignified good grace\\". Around this time, he began writing in the Ekavian dialect used in Serbia, and ceased writing in the Ijekavian dialect used in his native Bosnia. Andriƒá soon requested another assignment, and in November, he was transferred to Bucharest. Once again, his health deteriorated. Nevertheless, Andriƒá found his consular duties there did not require much effort, so he focused on writing, contributed articles to a Romanian journal and even had time to visit his family in Bosnia. In 1922, Andriƒá requested another reassignment. He was transferred to the consulate in Trieste, where he arrived on 9 December. The city's damp climate only caused Andriƒá's health to deteriorate further, and on his doctor's advice, he transferred to Graz in January 1923. He arrived in the city on 23 January, and was appointed vice-consul. Andriƒá soon enrolled at the University of Graz, resumed his schooling and began working on his doctoral dissertation in Slavic studies. Advancement Andriƒá completed his doctoral dissertation at the University of Graz. In August 1923, Andriƒá experienced an unexpected career setback. A law had been passed stipulating that all civil servants had to have a doctoral degree. As Andriƒá had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andriƒá's well-connected friends intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister Momƒçilo Ninƒçiƒá, citing Andriƒá's diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andriƒá as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his Ph.D. Three months later, on 24 May, Andriƒá submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval. This allowed Andriƒá to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andriƒá's dissertation be published. Andriƒá chose the title Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der t√ºrkischen Herrschaft (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule). In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as a yoke that still loomed over Bosnia. \\"The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative,\\" he wrote. \\"The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission, even to those South Slavs who accepted Islam.\\" Several days after receiving his Ph.D, Andriƒá wrote the Foreign Minister asking to be reinstated and submitted a copy of his dissertation, university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andriƒá stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andriƒá spent much of his time writing. His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926). In October 1926, he was assigned to the consulate in Marseille and again appointed vice-consul. On 9 December 1926, he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris. Andriƒá's time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation. His uncle had died in 1924, his mother the following year, and upon arriving in France, he was informed that his aunt had died as well. \\"Apart from official contacts,\\" he wrote Alaupoviƒá, \\"I have no company whatever.\\" Andriƒá spent much of his time in the Paris archives poring over the reports of the French consulate in Travnik between 1809 and 1814, material he would use in Travniƒçka hronika (Travnik Chronicle), one of his future novels. In April 1928, Andriƒá was posted to Madrid as vice-consul. While there, he wrote essays on Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Francisco Goya, and began work on the novel Prokleta avlija (The Damned Yard). In June 1929, he was named secretary of the Yugoslav legation to Belgium and Luxembourg in Brussels. On 1 January 1930, he was sent to Switzerland as part of Yugoslavia's permanent delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva, and was named deputy delegate the following year. In 1933, Andriƒá returned to Belgrade; two years later, he was named head of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 5 November 1937, Andriƒá became assistant to Milan Stojadinoviƒá, Yugoslavia's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. That year, France decorated him with the Order of the Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. World War II Andriƒá was appointed Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows that he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille in 1934. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul was established to rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andriƒá's back, in his capacity as ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andriƒá had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, a group of pro- Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andriƒá's position was an extremely difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. Prior to their invasion of his country, the Germans had offered Andriƒá the opportunity to evacuate to neutral Switzerland. He declined on the basis that his staff would not be allowed to go with him. On 6 April 1941, the Germans and their allies invaded Yugoslavia. The country capitulated on 17 April and was subsequently partitioned between the Axis powers. In early June, Andriƒá and his staff were taken back to German-occupied Belgrade, where some were jailed. Andriƒá was retired from the diplomatic service, but refused to receive his pension or cooperate in any way with the puppet government that the Germans had installed in Serbia. He was spared jail, but the Germans kept him under close surveillance throughout the occupation. Because of his Croat heritage, they had offered him the chance to settle in Zagreb, then the capital of the fascist puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia, but he declined. Andriƒá spent the following three years in a friend's Belgrade apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. In August 1941, the puppet authorities in German-occupied Serbia issued the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, calling upon the country's inhabitants to abstain from the communist-led rebellion against the Germans; Andriƒá refused to sign. He directed most of his energies towards writing, and during this time completed two of his best known novels, Na Drini ƒáuprija (The Bridge on the Drina) and Travniƒçka hronika. In mid-1942, Andriƒá sent a message of sympathy to Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, the leader of the royalist Chetniks, one of two resistance movements vying for power in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, the other being Josip Broz Tito's communist Partisans. In 1944, Andriƒá was forced to leave his friend's apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city. As he joined a column of refugees, he became ashamed that he was fleeing by himself, in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children, spouses and infirm parents. \\"I looked myself up and down,\\" he wrote, \\"and saw I was saving only myself and my overcoat.\\" In the ensuing months, Andriƒá refused to leave the apartment, even during the heaviest bombing. That October, the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade, and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia's ruler. Later life Political career and marriage Ivo Andriƒá, 1951 Andriƒá initially had a precarious relationship with the communists because he had previously been an official in the royalist government. He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade. Na Drini ƒáuprija was published in March 1945. It was followed by Travniƒçka hronika that September and Gospoƒëica (The Young Lady) that November. Na Drini ƒáuprija came to be regarded as Andriƒá's magnum opus and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav literature by the communists. It chronicles the history of the Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge and the town of Vi≈°egrad from the bridge's construction in the 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel, Travniƒçka hronika, follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars. The third, Gospoƒëica, revolves around the life of a Sarajevan woman. In the post-war period, Andriƒá also published several short story collections, some travel memoirs, and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, and Petar Koƒçiƒá. In November 1946, Andriƒá was elected vice-president of the Society for the Cultural Cooperation of Yugoslavia with the Soviet Union. The same month, he was named president of the Yugoslav Writers' Union. The following year, he became a member of the People's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1948, Andriƒá published a collection of short stories he had written during the war. His work came to influence writers such as Branko ƒÜopiƒá, Vladan Desnica, Mihailo Laliƒá and Me≈°a Selimoviƒá. In April 1950, Andriƒá became a deputy in the National Assembly of Yugoslavia. He was decorated by the Presidium of the National Assembly for his services to the Yugoslav people in 1952. In 1953, his career as a parliamentary deputy came to an end. The following year, Andriƒá published the novella Prokleta avlija (The Damned Yard), which tells of life in an Ottoman prison in Istanbul. That December, he was admitted into the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the country's ruling party. According to Hawkesworth, it is unlikely he joined the party out of ideological conviction, but rather to \\"serve his country as fully as possible\\". On 27 September 1958, the 66-year-old Andriƒá married Milica Babiƒá, a costume designer at the National Theatre of Serbia who was almost twenty years his junior. Earlier, he had announced it was \\"probably better\\" that a writer never marry. \\"He was perpetually persecuted by a kind of fear,\\" a close friend recalled. \\"It seemed as though he had been born afraid, and that is why he married so late. He simply did not dare enter that area of life.\\" Nobel Prize, international recognition and death Andriƒá with his wife Milica upon learning he had won the Nobel Prize in Literature By the late 1950s, Andriƒá's works had been translated into a number of languages. On 26 October 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy. Documents released 50 years later revealed that the Nobel Committee had selected Andriƒá over writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E.M. Forster. The Committee cited \\"the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\\". Once the news was announced, Andriƒá's Belgrade apartment was swarmed by reporters, and he publicly thanked the Nobel Committee for selecting him as the winner of that year's prize. Andriƒá donated the entirety of his prize money, which amounted to some 30 million dinars, and prescribed that it be used to purchase library books in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Nobel Prize ensured Andriƒá received global recognition. The following March, he fell ill while on a trip to Cairo and had to return to Belgrade for an operation. He was obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America, but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages. Judging by letters he wrote at the time, Andriƒá felt burdened by the attention but did his best not to show it publicly. Upon receiving the Nobel Prize, the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied. He received the Order of the Republic in 1962, as well as 27 July Award of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the AVNOJ Award in 1967, and the Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour in 1972. In addition to being a member of the Yugoslav and Serbian academies of sciences and arts, he also became a correspondent of their Bosnian and Slovenian counterparts, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Belgrade, Sarajevo and Krak√≥w. Andriƒá's wife died on 16 March 1968. His health deteriorated steadily and he travelled little in his final years. He continued to write until 1974, when his health took another turn for the worse. In December 1974, he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital. He soon fell into a coma, and died in the Military Medical Academy at 1:15 a.m. on 13 March 1975, aged 82. His remains were cremated, and on 24 April, the urn containing his ashes was buried at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade's New Cemetery. The ceremony was attended by about 10,000 residents of Belgrade. Influences, style and themes Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge, the eponymous bridge on the Drina Andriƒá was an avid reader in his youth. The young Andriƒá's literary interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann, the French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and the British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andriƒá also read the works of the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, the Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, the Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James, and the Czechoslovak philosopher Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk. Andriƒá was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karad≈æiƒá, Njego≈°, Koƒçiƒá and Aleksa ≈†antiƒá. Andriƒá also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears to have had a significant influence on Andriƒá's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andriƒá even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature. Much of Andriƒá's work was inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of life in Bosnia, and examines the complexity and cultural contrasts of the region's Muslim, Serb and Croat inhabitants. His two best known novels, Na Drini ƒáuprija and Travniƒçka hronika, subtly contrast Ottoman Bosnia's \\"oriental\\" propensities to the \\"Western atmosphere\\" first introduced by the French and later the Austro-Hungarians. His works contain many words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that found their way into the languages of the South Slavs during Ottoman rule. According to Vucinich, Andriƒá uses these words to \\"express oriental nuances and subtleties that cannot be rendered as well in his own Serbo-Croatian\\". In the opinion of literary historian Nicholas Moravcevich, Andriƒá's work \\"frequently betrays his profound sadness over the misery and waste inherent in the passing of time\\". Na Drini ƒáuprija remains his most famous novel and has received the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars have interpreted the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War. In his Nobel acceptance speech, Andriƒá described the country as one \\"which, at break-neck speed and at the cost of great sacrifices and prodigious efforts, is trying in all fields, including the field of culture, to make up for those things of which it has been deprived by a singularly turbulent and hostile past.\\" In Andriƒá's view, the seemingly conflicting positions of Yugoslavia's disparate ethnic groups could be overcome by knowing one's history. This, he surmised, would help future generations avoid the mistakes of the past, and was in line with his cyclical view of time. Andriƒá expressed hope that these differences could be bridged and \\"histories demystified\\". Legacy Andriƒá signing books at the Belgrade Book Fair Shortly before his death, Andriƒá stated that he wished for all his possessions to be preserved as part of an endowment to be used for \\"general cultural and humanitarian purposes\\". In March 1976, an administrative committee decided that the purpose of the endowment would be to promote the study of Andriƒá's work, as well as art and literature in general. The Ivo Andriƒá Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer's works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books relating to Andriƒá. An annual yearbook, titled Sveske Zadu≈æbine Ive Andriƒáa (The Journals of the Ivo Andriƒá Endowment), is published by the organization. Andriƒá's will and testament stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year's best collection of short stories. The street that runs beside Belgrade's New Palace, now the seat of the President of Serbia, was posthumously named Andriƒáev venac (Andriƒá's Crescent) in his honour. It includes a life-sized statue of the writer. The flat in which Andriƒá spent his final years has been turned into a museum. Opened over a year after Andriƒá's death, it houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and personal belongings. Several of Serbia's other major cities, such as Novi Sad and Kragujevac, have streets named after Andriƒá., Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Vi≈°egrad, also carry his name., , , Andriƒá remains the only writer from the former Yugoslavia to have been awarded the Nobel Prize. Given his use of the Ekavian dialect, and the fact that most of his novels and short stories were written in Belgrade, his works have become associated almost exclusively with Serbian literature. The Slavonic studies professor Bojan Aleksov characterizes Andriƒá as one of Serbian literature's two central pillars, the other being Njego≈°. \\"The plasticity of his narrative,\\" Moravcevich writes, \\"the depth of his psychological insight, and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature.\\" Due to his self-identification as a Serb, many in the Bosniak and Croat literary establishments have come to \\"reject or limit Andriƒá's association with their literatures\\". Following Yugoslavia's disintegration in the early 1990s, Andriƒá's works were blacklisted in Croatia under President Franjo Tuƒëman. The Croatian historian and politician Ivo Banac characterizes Andriƒá as a writer who \\"missed the Chetnik train by a very small margin\\". Though Andriƒá remains a controversial figure in Croatia, the Croatian literary establishment largely rehabilitated his works following Tuƒëman's death in 1999. Bosniak scholars have objected to the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andriƒá's works. During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of being a plagiarist, homosexual and Serbian nationalist. Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Vi≈°egrad destroyed a statue of Andriƒá with a sledgehammer. In 2009, Nezim Haliloviƒá, the imam of Sarajevo's King Fahd Mosque, derided Andriƒá as a \\"Chetnik ideologue\\" during a sermon. In 2012, the filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andriƒá in Vi≈°egrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andriƒágrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andriƒágrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Bibliography study Source: *1918 Ex Ponto.

Josquin des Prez (; ‚Äì 27 August 1521), often referred to simply as Josquin, was a French composer of the Renaissance. He was the most famous European composer between Guillaume Dufay and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and is usually considered to be the central figure of the Franco-Flemish School. Josquin is widely considered to be the first master of the high Renaissance style of polyphonic vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime. During the 16th century, Josquin gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame, with Luther declaring that \\"he is the master of the notes. They must do as he wills; as for the other composers, they have to do as the notes will.\\"Burkholder, J. Peter, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. A History of Western Music. Ninth edition. New York, N.Y.: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2014, pp. 203. Theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection.Wegman, pp. 21‚Äì25. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales.Reese, Grove. More than 370 works are attributed to him;Wegman, p. 28. it was only after the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were challenged, and revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. The lives of dozens of less revered Renaissance composers are better documented than that of Josquin.Wegman, pp. 21‚Äì22. Josquin wrote both sacred and secular music, and in all of the significant vocal forms of the age, including masses, motets, chansons and frottole. During the 16th century, he was praised for both his supreme melodic gift and his use of ingenious technical devices. In modern times, scholars have attempted to ascertain the basic details of his biography, and have tried to define the key characteristics of his style to correct misattributions, a task that has proved difficult, as Josquin liked to solve compositional problems in different ways in successive compositions‚Äîsometimes he wrote in an austere style devoid of ornamentation, and at other times he wrote music requiring considerable virtuosity.Sherr, p. 3. Heinrich Glarean wrote in 1547 that Josquin was not only a \\"magnificent virtuoso\\" (the Latin can be translated also as \\"show-off\\") but capable of being a \\"mocker\\", using satire effectively.Glareanus, quoted in Sherr, p. 3. While the focus of scholarship in recent years has been to remove music from the \\"Josquin canon\\" (including some of his most famous pieces) and to reattribute it to his contemporaries, the remaining music represents some of the most famous and enduring of the Renaissance.Sherr, p. 10. Name His original name is sometimes given as Josquin Lebloitte and his later name is given under a wide variety of spellings in French, Italian, and Latin, including and . His motet Illibata Dei virgo nutrix includes an acrostic of his name, where he spelled it \\"Josquin des Prez\\".ChoralWiki Illibata Dei virgo nutrix (Josquin des Prez)Clutterham. Life  Birth and early career  Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498.Sherr, Richard (n.d.) \\"Josquin's Biography\\", Smith College, Massachusetts, retrieved 8 October 2020 Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.Matthews and Merkley, pp. 208‚Äì209. According to an account by Claude H√©mer√©, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint- Quentin,Reese et al., p. 3. Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of H√©mer√©'s account, however.Macey et al., ¬ß1. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was an important center of royal patronage. Both Jean Mouton and Loyset Comp√®re were buried there and it is certainly possible that Josquin acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin. The first definite record of his employment is dated 19 April 1477, and it shows that he was a singer at the chapel of Ren√©, Duke of Anjou, in Aix-en-Provence. He remained there at least until 1478. No certain records of his movements exist for the period from March 1478 until 1483, but if he remained in the employ of Ren√© he would have transferred to Paris in 1481 along with the rest of the chapel. One of Josquin's early motets, Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo, suggests a direct connection with Louis XI, who was king during this time. In 1483 Josquin returned to Cond√© to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed by the army of Louis XI in May 1478, when they besieged the town, locked the population into the church, and burned them alive.Macey et al., ¬ß2.  Milan  The period from 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers; contradictory evidence exists suggesting either that Josquin was still in France, or was already in the service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503‚Äì04 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.Macey et al., ¬ß3. In either 1483 or 1484, Josquin is known to have been in the service of the Sforza family in Milan. While in their employ, he made one or more trips to Rome, and possibly also to Paris; while in Milan he made the acquaintance of Franchinus Gaffurius, who was maestro di cappella of the cathedral there. He was in Milan again in 1489, after a possible period of travel; but he left that year.  Rome  From 1489 to 1495, Josquin was a member of the papal choir, first under Pope Innocent VIII, and later under the Borgia pope Alexander VI. He may have gone there as part of a singer exchange with Gaspar van Weerbeke, who went back to Milan at the same time. While there, he may have been the one who carved his name into the wall of the Sistine Chapel; a \\"JOSQUINJ\\" was revealed by workers restoring the chapel in 1998. Since it was traditional for singers to carve their names into the walls, and hundreds of names were inscribed there during the period from the 15th to the 18th centuries, it is considered highly likely that the graffiti is by Josquin‚Äîand if so, it would be his only surviving autograph.PietschmannSherr, frontispiece Josquin's mature style evolved during this period; as in Milan he had absorbed the influence of light Italian secular music, in Rome he refined his techniques of sacred music. Several of his motets have been dated to the years he spent at the papal chapel.  Departure from Rome; Milan and France  Around 1498, Josquin most likely re- entered the service of the Sforza family, on the evidence of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families.Macey et al., ¬ß5. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career around the turn of the 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy, he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi (\\"I have placed my hope in you, Lord\\"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.Macey, p. 155. Some of Josquin's compositions, such as the instrumental Vive le roy, have been tentatively dated to the period around 1500 when he was in France. A motet, Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo (\\"Remember thy promise unto thy servant\\"), was, according to Heinrich Glarean writing in the Dodecachordon of 1547, composed as a gentle reminder to the king to keep his promise of a benefice to Josquin, which he had forgotten to keep. According to Glarean's story, it worked: the court applauded, and the king gave Josquin his benefice. Upon receiving it, Josquin reportedly wrote a motet on the text Benefecisti servo tuo, Domine (\\"Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant\\") to show his gratitude to the king.David W. Barber, If It Ain't Baroque: More Music History as It Ought to Be Taught (Toronto: Sound and Vision, 1992), p. 34.  Ferrara  Ercole I d'Este was an important patron of the arts during the Italian Renaissance; he was Josquin's employer in 1503 and 1504. Josquin probably remained in the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there.Merkley, pp. 544‚Äì583. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier to get along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.Macey et al., ¬ß6. While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote some of his most famous compositions, including the austere, Savonarola-influenced Miserere,Macey, p. 184. which became one of the most widely distributed motets of the 16th century; the utterly contrasting, virtuoso motet Virgo salutiferi;Milsom, p. 307. and possibly the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which is written on a cantus firmus derived from the musical letters in the Duke's name, a technique known as soggetto cavato. Josquin did not stay in Ferrara long. An outbreak of the plague in the summer of 1503 prompted the evacuation of the Duke and his family, as well as two-thirds of the citizens, and Josquin left by April of the next year, possibly also to escape the plague. His replacement, Jacob Obrecht, died of the plague in the summer of 1505, to be replaced by Antoine Brumel in 1506, who stayed until the disbanding of the chapel in 1510.  Retirement to Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut  Josquin went directly from Ferrara to his home region of Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, southeast of Lille on the present-day border between Belgium and France, becoming provost of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame on 3 May 1504, a large musical establishment that he headed for the rest of his life.Sherr, p. 16. While the chapter at Bourges Cathedral asked him to become master of the choirboys there in 1508, it is not known how he responded, and there is no record of his having been employed there; most scholars presume he remained in Cond√©.Sherr, p. 17. In 1509, he held concurrently provost and choir master offices at Saint Quentin collegiate church. During the last two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with his music. The newly developed technology of printing made wide dissemination of his music possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of Petrucci's first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.Boorman, Stanley. \\"Petrucci, Ottaviano (dei).\\" Music Printing and Publishing. New York: Norton, 1990, pp. 365‚Äì369. On his death-bed, Josquin asked that he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his property would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Cond√©. This bit of evidence has been used to show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.Milsom, pp. 303‚Äì305.  Music   Overview  Josquin lived during a transitional stage in music history. Musical styles were changing rapidly, in part owing to the movement of musicians between different regions of Europe.Reese, pp. 184‚Äì185. Many northern musicians moved to Italy, the heart of the Renaissance, attracted by the Italian nobility's patronage of the arts; while in Italy, these composers were influenced by the native Italian styles, and often brought those ideas with them back to their homelands. The sinuous musical lines of the Ockeghem generation, the contrapuntal complexity of the Netherlanders, and the homophonic textures of the Italian lauda and secular music began to merge into a unified style; indeed Josquin was to be the leading figure in this musical process, which eventually resulted in the formation of an international musical language, of which the most famous composers included Palestrina and Lassus.Noble, Grove (1980) Josquin likely learned his craft in his home region in the North, in France, and then in Italy when he went to Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal complexity and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, but at the same time he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been. Many \\"modern\\" musical compositional practices were being born in the era around 1500. Josquin made extensive use of \\"motivic cells\\" in his compositions, short, easily recognizable melodic fragments which passed from voice to voice in a contrapuntal texture, giving it an inner unity. This is a basic organizational principle in music which has been practiced continuously from approximately 1500 until the present day.Irving Godt, JMT, 264‚Äì292. Josquin wrote in all of the important forms current at the time, including masses, motets, chansons, and frottole. He even contributed to the development of a new form, the motet-chanson, of which he left at least three examples. In addition, some of his pieces were probably intended for instrumental performance. Each area of his output can be further subdivided by form or by hypothetical period of composition. Since dating Josquin's compositions is particularly problematic, with scholarly consensus only achieved on a minority of works, discussion here is by type.  Masses  300px Josquin wrote towards the end of the period in which the mass was the predominant form of sacred composition in Europe. The mass, as it had developed through the 15th century, was a long, multi-section form, with opportunities for large-scale structure and organization not possible in the other forms such as the motet. Josquin wrote some of the most famous examples of the genre, most using some kind of cyclic organization. He wrote masses using the following general techniques, although there is considerable overlap between techniques in individual compositions: * cantus firmus mass, in which a pre-existing tune appeared, mostly unchanged, in one voice of the texture, with the other voices being more or less freely composed; * paraphrase mass, in which a pre-existing tune was used freely in all voices, and in many variations; * parody mass, in which a pre-existing multi-voice song appeared in whole or in part, with material from all voices in use, not just the tune; * soggetto cavato, or solmization mass, in which the tune is drawn from the syllables of a name or phrase (for example \\"la sol fa re mi\\"‚ÄîA, G, F, D, E‚Äîbased on the syllables of Lascia fare mi (\\"let me do it\\", a phrase used by an unknown patron, in a context around which much legend has arisen). * canon, in which an entire mass is based on canonic techniques, and no pre-existing material has been identified.Blackburn, Planchart, Bloxham, Sherr, in Sherr, 51‚Äì248. Most of these techniques, particularly paraphrase and parody, became standardized during the first half of the 16th century; Josquin was very much a pioneer, and what was perceived by later observers as the mixing of these techniques was actually the process by which they were created. = Cantus-firmus masses = Prior to Josquin's mature period, the most common technique for writing masses was the cantus firmus, a technique which had been in use already for most of the 15th century. It was the technique that Josquin used earliest in his career, with the Missa L'ami Baudichon, possibly his first mass. This mass is based on a secular‚Äîindeed ribald‚Äîtune similar to \\"Three Blind Mice\\". That basing a mass on such a source was an accepted procedure is evident from the existence of the mass in Sistine Chapel part-books copied during the papacy of Julius II (1503 to 1513).Blackburn, p. 72. Josquin's most famous cantus-firmus masses are the two based on the L'homme arm√© tune, which was the favorite tune for mass composition of the entire Renaissance. The earlier of the two, Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales, is a technical tour-de-force on the tune, containing numerous mensuration canons and contrapuntal display. It was by far the most famous of all his masses.Blackburn, pp. 53‚Äì62 The second, Missa L'homme arm√© sexti toni, is a \\"fantasia on the theme of the armed man.\\"Blackburn, p. 63 While based on a cantus firmus, it is also a paraphrase mass, for fragments of the tune appear in all voices. Technically it is almost restrained, compared to the other L'homme arm√© mass, until the closing Agnus Dei, which contains a complex canonic structure including a rare retrograde canon, around which other voices are woven.Blackburn, p. 64 = Paraphrase masses = The paraphrase technique differs from the cantus-firmus technique in that the source material, though it still consists of a monophonic original, is embellished, often with ornaments. As in the cantus-firmus technique, the source tune may appear in many voices of the mass. Several of Josquin's masses feature the paraphrase technique, and they include some of his most famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, which probably dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; it is also one of his shortest masses.Planchart, in Sherr, p. 109. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.Planchart, in Sherr, pp. 120‚Äì130 By far the most famous of Josquin's masses using the technique, and one of the most famous mass settings of the entire era, was the Missa pange lingua, based on the hymn by Thomas Aquinas for the Vespers of Corpus Christi. It was probably the last mass that Josquin composed.Planchart, in Sherr, pp. 130, 132. This mass is an extended fantasia on the tune, using the melody in all voices and in all parts of the mass, in elaborate and ever-changing polyphony. One of the high points of the mass is the et incarnatus est section of the Credo, where the texture becomes homophonic, and the tune appears in the topmost voice; here the portion which would normally set \\"Sing, O my tongue, of the mystery of the divine body\\" is instead given the words \\"And he became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man.\\"Planchart, in Sherr, p. 142. = Parody masses, masses on popular songs = In parody masses, the source material was not a single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus.Reese, p. 240. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition for the remainder of the 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem. = Masses on solmization syllables = The earliest known mass by any composer using this method of composition‚Äîthe soggetto cavato‚Äîis the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which Josquin probably wrote in the early 1480s for the powerful Ercole I, Duke of Ferrara. The notes of the cantus firmus are drawn from the musical syllables of the Duke's name in the following way: Ercole, Duke of Ferrara in Latin is Hercules Dux Ferrarie. Taking the solmization syllables with the same vowels gives: Taruskin, p. 560. (in modern nomenclature: ). Another mass using this technique is the Missa La sol fa re mi, based on the musical syllables contained in \\"Lascia fare mi\\" (\\"let me do it\\"). The story, as told by Glareanus in 1547, was that an unknown aristocrat used to order suitors away with this phrase, and Josquin immediately wrote an \\"exceedingly elegant\\" mass on it as a jab at him.Blackburn, p. 78. = Canonic masses = Opening of the Agnus Dei II from the Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales. The movement consists of a three-out-of-one mensuration canon. The middle voice is the slowest; the lowest voice sings at twice the speed of the middle voice, and the top voice at three times the speed. The first four notes of the canon are shown connected by lines of the same color. (The first eight notes of the canon are a quotation of the contratenor of Ockeghem's \\"Ma bouche rit\\".) Canonic masses came into increasing prominence in the latter part of the 15th century. Early examples include Ockeghem's famous Missa prolationum, consisting entirely of mensuration canons, the Missa L'homme arm√© of Guillaume Faugues, whose cantus firmus is presented in canon at the descending fifth, the Missa [Ad fugam] of Marbrianus de Orto, based on freely composed canons at the fifth between superius and tenor, and the two great canonic masses of Josquin, the Missa Ad fugam and Missa Sine nomine. Josquin makes use of canon in the Osanna and Agnus Dei III of the Missa L'homme arm√© sexti toni, throughout the Missa Sine nomine and Missa Ad fugam, and in the final three movements of the Missa De beata virgine. The Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales incorporates mensuration canons in the Kyrie, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei II.A canon from the Agnus Dei II from the Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales is written in a triangular form in Dosso Dossi's Allegory of Music. See the entry Eye music.  Motets  Josquin's motet style varied from almost strictly homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes with the addition of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices.Milsom, p. 282 No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin. Ps. 37 Vulgate; Ps. 38 Hebrew/English). Three variants of a motive built on a major triad are introduced, each in paired imitation between two voices. Almost all of Josquin's motets use some kind of compositional constraint on the process; they are not freely composed.Milsom, p. 284 Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.Milsom, p. 290 Josquin frequently used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive lines of the text he was setting. An example is his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of the lines of the psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.Reese, p. 249 In writing polyphonic settings of psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form a large proportion of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings.Reese, p. 246 Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola,Macey, p. xxx Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two settings of De profundis (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.Milsom, p. 305  Chansons and instrumental compositions  In the domain of secular music, Josquin left numerous French chansons, for from three to six voices, as well as a handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.Louise Litterick, in Sherr, pp. 335, 393 Josquin's earliest chansons were probably composed in northern Europe, under the influence of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the formes fixes‚Äîthe rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade‚Äîinstead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with many of his sacred works. He was one of the first composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and many of his chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets. Inside of his chansons, he often used a cantus firmus, sometimes a popular song whose origin can no longer be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion.Brown, Grove (1980), \\"Chanson.\\" Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent (\\"The problem with money\\"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her. Some of his chansons were doubtless designed to be performed instrumentally. That Petrucci published many of them without text is strong evidence of this; additionally, some of the pieces (for example, the fanfare-like Vive le roy) contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices. Josquin's most famous chansons circulated widely in Europe. Some of the better known include his lament on the death of Ockeghem, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam; Mille regretz (the attribution of which has recently been questioned);Litterick, in Sherr, pp. 374‚Äì376 Plus nulz regretz; and Je me complains. In addition to his French chansons, he wrote at least three pieces in the manner of the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during his years in Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.  Motet-chansons  While in Milan, Josquin wrote several examples of a new type of piece developed by the composers there, the motet-chanson. These compositions were texturally very similar to 15th century chansons in the formes fixes mold, except that unlike those completely secular works, they contained a chant-derived Latin cantus- firmus in the lowest of the three voices. The other voices, in French, sang a secular text which had either a symbolic relationship to the sacred Latin text, or commented on it.Litterick, in Sherr, p. 336 Josquin's three known motet-chansons, Que vous madame/In pace, A la mort/Monstra te esse matrem, and Fortune destrange plummaige/Pauper sum ego, are similar stylistically to those by the other composers of the Milan chapel, such as Loyset Comp√®re and Alexander Agricola.  Influence  Josquin's fame lasted throughout the 16th century, and indeed increased for several decades after his death. Zarlino, writing in the 1580s, was still using examples from Josquin in his treatises on composition; and Josquin's fame was only eclipsed after the beginning of the Baroque era, with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style. During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin's fame was overshadowed by later Roman School composer Palestrina, whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement, and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as Johann Fux. Despite the decline of popularity in Josquin‚Äôs music during this time, Josquin‚Äôs influence in music beyond the 15th century cannot be overstated. Travelling Franco-Flemish composers like Josquin were a primary component in Italian chapels. They used their unique styles and ideas to influence Italian music, thus contributing to iconic Italian genres such as the madrigal. During the 20th century, Josquin's reputation has grown steadily, to the point where scholars again consider him \\"the greatest and most successful composer of the age.\\"David Fallows, in Sherr, p. 575.Higgins. Due to Josquin‚Äôs popularity, scholars have worked diligently to weed out misattributed works. To sell more copies of their compositions, it was not uncommon for composers or publishers to put Josquin‚Äôs name on their work both during and after Josquin‚Äôs lifetime. Analysis of dissonance treatments and cantus firmi have helped scholars in the past decades to determine which pieces were most likely written by Josquin himself. According to Richard Sherr, writing in the introduction to the Josquin Companion, addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin's canon due to correction of misattributions, \\"Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent as everybody has always said it was.\\" Since the 1950s Josquin's reputation has been boosted by the increasing availability of recordings, of which there are many, and the rise of ensembles specializing in the performance of 16th century vocal music, many of which place Josquin's output at the heart of their repertoire.Sherr, p. 577; also Appendix B (Discography)  Media   Works list  The difficulties in compiling a works list for Josquin cannot be overstated. Because of his immense prestige in the early sixteenth century, many scribes and publishers did not resist the temptation of attributing anonymous or otherwise spurious works to Josquin. The German editor Georg Forster summed up the situation admirably in 1540 when he wrote, \\"I remember a certain eminent man saying that, now that Josquin is dead, he is putting out more works than when he was alive.\\"Jesse Rodin, \\"A Josquin Substitution,\\" Early Music 34.2 (2006), p. 246 Thus, the authenticity of many of the works listed below is disputed on stylistic grounds or problems with sources or both.

Most animals use a variety of gaits, selecting gait based on speed, terrain, the need to maneuver, and energetic efficiency. Different animal species may use different gaits due to differences in anatomy that prevent use of certain gaits, or simply due to evolved innate preferences as a result of habitat differences. While various gaits are given specific names, the complexity of biological systems and interacting with the environment make these distinctions \\"fuzzy\\" at best. Gaits are typically classified according to footfall patterns, but recent studies often prefer definitions based on mechanics. The term typically does not refer to limb-based propulsion through fluid mediums such as water or air, but rather to propulsion across a solid substrate by generating reactive forces against it (which can apply to walking while underwater as well as on land). Due to the rapidity of animal movement, simple direct observation is rarely sufficient to give any insight into the pattern of limb movement. In spite of early attempts to classify gaits based on footprints or the sound of footfalls, it was not until Eadweard Muybridge and √âtienne-Jules Marey began taking rapid series of photographs that proper scientific examination of gaits could begin. Overview Milton Hildebrand pioneered the contemporary scientific analysis and the classification of gaits. The movement of each limb was partitioned into a stance phase, where the foot was in contact with the ground, and a swing phase, where the foot was lifted and moved forwards. Each limb must complete a cycle in the same length of time, otherwise one limb's relationship to the others can change with time, and a steady pattern cannot occur. Thus, any gait can completely be described in terms of the beginning and end of stance phase of three limbs relative to a cycle of a reference limb, usually the left hindlimb. Variables Gait graphs in the style of Hildebrand. Dark areas indicate times of contact, bottom axis is % of cycle Gaits are generally classed as \\"symmetrical\\" and \\"asymmetrical\\" based on limb movement. It is important to note that these terms have nothing to do with left-right symmetry. In a symmetrical gait, the left and right limbs of a pair alternate, while in an asymmetrical gait, the limbs move together. Asymmetrical gaits are sometimes termed \\"leaping gaits\\", due to the presence of a suspended phase. The key variables for gait are the duty factor and the forelimb-hindlimb phase relationship. Duty factor is simply the percent of the total cycle which a given foot is on the ground. This value will usually be the same for forelimbs and hindlimbs unless the animal is moving with a specially trained gait or is accelerating or decelerating. Duty factors over 50% are considered a \\"walk\\", while those less than 50% are considered a run. Forelimb-hindlimb phase is the temporal relationship between the limb pairs. If the same-side forelimbs and hindlimbs initiate stance phase at the same time, the phase is 0 (or 100%). If the same-side forelimb contacts the ground half of the cycle later than the hindlimb, the phase is 50%. Physiological effects of gait Gait choice can have effects beyond immediate changes in limb movement and speed, notably in terms of ventilation. Because they lack a diaphragm, lizards and salamanders must expand and contract their body wall in order to force air in and out of their lungs, but these are the same muscles used to laterally undulate the body during locomotion. Thus, they cannot move and breathe at the same time, a situation called Carrier's constraint, though some, such as monitor lizards, can circumvent this restriction via buccal pumping. In contrast, the spinal flexion of a galloping mammal causes the abdominal viscera to act as a piston, inflating and deflating the lungs as the animal's spine flexes and extends, increasing ventilation and allowing greater oxygen exchange. Differences between species A hamster walking on a transparent treadmill. Alternating tripod gait of walking desert ants. Any given animal uses a relatively restricted set of gaits, and different species use different gaits. Almost all animals are capable of symmetrical gaits, while asymmetrical gaits are largely confined to mammals, who are capable of enough spinal flexion to increase stride length (though small crocodilians are capable of using a bounding gait). Lateral sequence gaits during walking and running are most common in mammals,Lemelin P, Schmitt D and Cartmill M. 2003. Footfall patterns and interlimb co-ordination in opossums (Family Didelphidae): evidence for the evolution of diagonal-sequence walking gaits in primates. J. Zool. Lond. 260:423-429. Web link to pdf but arboreal mammals such as monkeys, some opossums, and kinkajous use diagonal sequence walks for enhanced stability. Diagonal sequence walks and runs (aka trots) are most frequently used by sprawling tetrapods such as salamanders and lizards, due to the lateral oscillations of their bodies during movement. Bipeds are a unique case, and most bipeds will display only three gaits‚Äîwalking, running, and hopping‚Äîduring natural locomotion. Other gaits, such as human skipping, are not used without deliberate effort. Energy-based gait classification While gaits can be classified by footfall, new work involving whole-body kinematics and force-plate records has given rise to an alternative classification scheme, based on the mechanics of the movement. In this scheme, movements are divided into walking and running. Walking gaits are all characterized by a \\"vaulting\\" movement of the body over the legs, frequently described as an inverted pendulum (displaying fluctuations in kinetic and potential energy which are out of phase), a mechanism described by Giovanni Cavagna. In running, the kinetic and potential energy fluctuate in-phase, and the energy change is passed on to muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments acting as springs (thus it is described by the spring-mass model). Energetics Bison galloping Speed generally governs gait selection, with quadrupedal mammals moving from a walk to a run to a gallop as speed increases. Each of these gaits has an optimum speed, at which the minimum calories per metre are consumed, and costs increase at slower or faster speeds. Gait transitions occur near the speed where the cost of a fast walk becomes higher than the cost of a slow run. Unrestrained animals will typically move at the optimum speed for their gait to minimize energy cost. The cost of transport is used to compare the energetics of different gaits, as well as the gaits of different animals. Non-tetrapod gaits In spite of the differences in leg number shown in terrestrial vertebrates, according to the inverted pendulum model of walking and spring-mass model of running, \\"walks\\" and \\"runs\\" are seen in animals with 2, 4, 6, or more legs. The term \\"gait\\" has even been applied to flying and swimming organisms that produce distinct patterns of wake vortices.

Mesolithic also falls between these two periods, and the two are sometimes confused or used as synonyms. More often, they are distinct, referring to approximately the same period of time in different geographic areas. Epipaleolithic always includes this period in the Levant and, often, the rest of the Near East. It sometimes includes parts of Southeast Europe, where Mesolithic is much more commonly used. Mesolithic very rarely includes the Levant or the Near East; in Europe, Epipalaeolithic is used, though not very often, to refer to the early Mesolithic. The Epipalaeolithic has been defined as the \\"final Upper Palaeolithic industries occurring at the end of the final glaciation which appear to merge technologically into the Mesolithic\\".Bahn, Paul, The Penguin Archaeology Guide, Penguin, London, p. 141. The period is generally dated from BP to 10,000 BP in the Levant,Simmons, 46 but later in Europe. If used as a synonym or equivalent for Mesolithic in Europe, it might end at about BP or even later. In the Levant, the period may be subdivided into Early, Middle and Late Epipaleolithic, the last also being the Natufian.Simmons, 47‚Äì48 The preceding final Upper Paleolithic period is the Kebaran or \\"Upper Paleolithic Stage VI\\".Simmons, 47‚Äì48 Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers, generally nomadic, made relatively advanced tools from small flint or obsidian blades, known as microliths, that were hafted in wooden implements. There are settlements with \\"flimsy structures\\", probably not permanently occupied except at some rich sites, but used and returned to seasonally.Simmons, 48‚Äì49  Term usage  The Epipaleolithic corresponds to the first period of progressive warming after the Last Glacial Maximum. Evolution of temperatures in the Post-Glacial period according to Greenland ice cores. In describing the period before the start of the Neolithic, \\"Epipaleolithic\\" is typically used for cultures in regions that were far from the glaciers of the Ice Age, so that the retreat of the glaciers made a less dramatic change to conditions. This was the case in the Levant.Simmons, 46‚Äì48; agriculture, origins of. (2008). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved April 10, 2008, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Conversely, the term \\"Mesolithic\\" is most likely to be used for Western Europe where climatic change and the extinction of the megafauna had a great impact of the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age, creating post- glacial cultures such as the Azilian, Sauveterrian, Tardenoisian, and Maglemosian. In the past, French archaeologists had a general tendency to prefer the term \\"Epipaleolithic\\" to \\"Mesolithic\\", even for Western Europe. Where \\"Epipaleolithic\\" is still used for Europe, it is generally for areas close to the Mediterranean, as with the Azilian industry. \\"Epipalaeolithic\\" stresses the continuity with the Upper Paleolithic. Alfonso Moure says in this respect: In Europe, the Epipalaeolithic may be regarded as a period preceding the Early Mesolithic,\\"...there are no sites defining the transition from the Epipalaeolithic Azilian to the Early Mesolithic\\" ‚Äì p. 249, Thomas, Homer L., A Handbook of Archaeology: Cultures and Sites: North Africa, Egypt, Southwest Asia, Mediterranean, Northwest Europe, Northern Europe, ..., Volume 1, 1996, Paul Astroms Forlag, or as locally constituting at least a part of it. Other authors treat the Epipalaeolithic as part of the Late Palaeolithic;referring to the Azilian: Jones, Emily Lena, In Search of the Broad Spectrum Revolution in Paleolithic Southwest Europe, pp. 5‚Äì6, 2015, Springer, , google books the culture in southern Portugal between about 10,500 to 8,500 years ago is \\"variously labelled as 'Terminal Magdalenian' and 'Epipalaeolithic.Straus, Lawrence Guy, p. 310 in Bailey and Spikins The different usages often reflect the degree of innovation and \\"economic intensification in the direction of domestication, sedentism or environmental modification\\" seen in the culture. If the Palaeolithic way of life continues with only adaptation to reflect changes in the types of wild food available, the culture may be called Epipalaeolithic.Encyclopedia of Human Evolution and Prehistory (2nd Edition), eds. Eric Delson, Ian Tattersall, et al., p. 236. 2004, Routledge, , google books (quoted); Bailey and Spikins, 4 One writer, talking of Azilian microliths in Vasco-Cantabria talks of \\"some exceptions that seem to herald the coming of 'true' Mesolithic technologies a few centuries later\\".Straus, Lawrence Guy, in Bailey and Spikins, 312 History of the term Microliths tools from Ein Qashish South, Jezreel Valley, Israel, Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran, ca. 23,000-16.500 BP The Ain Sakhri lovers, Ain Sakhri near Bethleem, Israel. Kebaran culture, Late Epipaleolithic Near East The concept of the \\"Epipalaeolithic\\" arrived several decades after the main components of the three-age system, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. It was first proposed in 1910 by the Swedish archaeologist, Knut Stjerna, his initial example being a culture or sub-culture in Scandinavian archaeology, that would not be often called Epipalaeolithic today. This left stone-lined pit graves containing implements of bone, such as harpoon and javelin heads. Stjerna observed that they \\"persisted during the recent Paleolithic period and also during the Protoneolithic\\". Here he had used a new term, \\"Protoneolithic\\", which was according to him to be applied to the Danish kitchen-middens.: \\"... a persist√© pendant la p√©riode pal√©olithique r√©cente et m√™me pendant la p√©riode proton√©olithique.\\" Stjerna also said that the eastern culture \\"is attached to the Paleolithic civilization\\" (\\"se trouve rattach√©e √† la civilisation pal√©olithique\\"). However, it was not intermediary and of its intermediates he said \\"we cannot discuss them here\\" (\\"nous ne pouvons pas examiner ici\\"). This \\"attached\\" and non-transitional culture he chose to call the Epipaleolithic, defining it as follows: > With Epipaleolithic I mean the period during the early days that followed > the age of the reindeer, the one that retained Paleolithic customs. This > period has two stages in Scandinavia, that of Maglemose and that of Kunda. > (Par √©poque √©pipal√©olithique j'entends la p√©riode qui, pendant les premiers > temps qui ont suivi l'√¢ge du Renne, conserve les coutumes pal√©olithiques. > Cette p√©riode pr√©sente deux √©tapes en Scandinavie, celle de Maglemose et de > Kunda.) Stjerna made no mention of the Mesolithic, and it is unclear if he intended his terms to replace that. His new terms were soon adopted by the German Hugo Obermaier, who in 1916 used them in El Hombre f√≥sil (translated into English in 1924) as part of an attack on the concept of the Mesolithic, which he insisted was a period of \\"transition\\" and an \\"interim\\" rather than \\"transformation\\": > But in my opinion this term is not justified, as it would be if these phases > presented a natural evolutionary development ‚Äì a progressive transformation > from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the Capsian, > the Tardenoisian, the Azilian and the northern Maglemose industries are the > posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic ... This early history of the term introduced the ambiguity and degree of confusion which has continued to surround its use, at least as relates to the archaeology of Europe.

Example in Western Apache: lƒôk'e' created Values Nasalization The use of the ogonek to indicate nasality is common in the transcription of the indigenous languages of the Americas. This usage originated in the orthographies created by Christian missionaries to transcribe these languages. Later, the practice was continued by Americanist anthropologists and linguists who still, to the present day, follow this convention in phonetic transcription (see Americanist phonetic notation). The ogonek is also used to indicate a nasalized vowel in Polish, academic transliteration of Old Church Slavonic, Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, T≈ÇƒØch Yati√¨, Slavey, D√´ne S≈≥≈Çin√© and Elfdalian. In Polish, ƒô is nasalized e; however, ƒÖ is nasalized o, not a, because of a vowel shift: ƒÖ, originally a long nasal a, turned into a short nasal o when the distinction in vowel quantity disappeared. Length In Lithuanian, the nosinƒó (literally, \\"nasal\\") mark originally indicated vowel nasalization but around the late 17th century, nasal vowels gradually evolved into the corresponding long non-nasal vowels in most dialects. Thus, the mark is now de facto an indicator of vowel length (the length of etymologically non-nasal vowels is marked differently). The mark also helps to distinguish different grammatical forms with otherwise the same written form, but are pronounced differently. Lowered articulation Between 1927 and 1989, the ogonek denoted lowering in vowels, and, since 1976, in consonants as well, in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). While the obsolete diacritic has also been identified as the left half ring diacritic , many publications of the IPA used the ogonek. Page 84, note 2. In Rheinische Dokumenta, it marks vowels that are more open than those denoted by their base letters √Ñ√§, Oo, √ñ√∂. In two cases, it can be combined with umlaut marks. Similar diacritics E caudata and o caudata The E caudata (ƒô), a symbol similar to an e with ogonek, evolved from a ligature of a and e in medieval scripts, in Latin and Irish palaeography. The O caudata of Old NorseFor this traditional and correct name, see e.g. Einar Haugen (ed. and trans.), First Grammatical Treatise, 2nd edition, Longman, 1972. (letter «´, with «´ÃÅ) is used to write the open-mid back rounded vowel, . Medieval Nordic manuscripts show this 'hook' in both directions, in combination with several vowels. Despite this distinction, the term 'ogonek' is sometimes used in discussions of typesetting and encoding Norse texts, as o caudata is typographically identical to o with ogonek. Similarly, the E caudata was sometimes used to designate the Norse vowel […õ] or [√¶]. Cedilla and comma The ogonek is functionally equivalent to the cedilla and comma diacritic marks. If two of these three are used within the same orthography their respective use is restricted to certain classes of letters, i.e. usually the ogonek is used with vowels whereas the cedilla is applied to consonants. In handwritten text, the marks may even look the same. Superscript ogonek In Old Norse and Old Icelandic manuscripts, there is an over-hook or curl that may be considered a variant of the ogonek. It occurs on the letters a·∑é e·∑é i·∑é o·∑é √∏·∑é u·∑é. Typographical notes The ogonek should be almost the same size as a descender (relatively, its size in larger type may be significantly shorter), and should not be confused with the cedilla or comma diacritics used in other languages.  Encoding  Because attaching an ogonek does not affect the shape of the base letter, Unicode covers it with a combining diacritic, U+0328. There are a number of precomposed legacy characters, but new ones are not being added to Unicode (e.g. for or ).  LaTeX2e  In LaTeX2e, macro \`\\\\k\` will typeset a letter with ogonek, if it is supported by the font encoding, e.g. \`\\\\k{a}\` will typeset ƒÖ. (The default LaTeX OT1 encoding does not support it, but the newer T1 one does. It may be enabled by saying \`\\\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\` in the preamble.) However, \`\\\\k{e}\` rather places the diacritic \\"right-aligned\\" with the carrying e (ƒô), suitably for Polish, while \`\\\\textogonekcentered\` horizontally centers the diacritic with respect to the carrier, suitably for Native American Languages as well as for e caudata and o caudata. So \`\\\\textogonekcentered{e}\` better fits the latter purposes. Actually, \`\\\\k{o}\` (for «´) is defined to result in \`\\\\textogonekcentered{o}\`, and \`\\\\k{O}\` is defined to result in \`\\\\textogonekcentered{O}\`.See t1enc.def in LaTeX2e distributions. The package TIPA, activated by using the command \\"\`\\\\usepackage{tipa}\`\\", offers a different way: \\"\`\\\\textpolhook{a}\`\\" will produce ƒÖ.

What type of thing is agriculture?  Agriculture can be described as all of the following: * An academic discipline * A science  An applied science * An industry  Agricultural activities  * Agricultural cycle - annual cycle of activities related to the growth and harvest of a crop. * Land use - management and modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as fields, pastures, and settlements. Agricultural production * Cash crop - agricultural crop which is grown for sale for profit. * Agricultural products  Food - any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.  Natural fibers - class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of thread. They can be spun into filaments, thread, or rope. Natural fibers are made from plant, animal and mineral sources.  Lumber - wood in any of its stages from felling to readiness for use as structural material for construction, or wood pulp for paper production.  Paper - sheet material used for writing on or printing on (or as a non-waterproof container), usually made by draining cellulose fibres from a suspension in water.  Medicine great quantity of herbal and animal parts are used for medicinal purposes worldwide, especially in traditional and naturopathic medicines.  Biofuels wide range of plants and plant products are used for converting to fuels, such as firewood, biodiesel, methane gas etc. Agricultural resources * Agricultural land - denotes the land suitable for agricultural production, both crops and livestock. It is one of the main resources in agriculture. * Labor (economics) - measure of the work done by human beings. * Water - chemical substance with the chemical formula H2O. * Agricultural machinery - machinery used in the operation of an agricultural area or farm. * Fertilizers - any organic or inorganic material of natural or synthetic origin (other than liming materials) that is added to a soil to supply one or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants. Branches of agriculture  By type of life form produced or harvested  *Agronomy - science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, feed, fiber, and reclamation. Organic gardening - science and art of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plants by following the essential principles of organic agriculture in soil building and conservation, pest management, and heirloom variety preservation. *Animal husbandry - agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock.  By industry  =Aquafarming= *Aquaculture - farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and aquatic plants. *Mariculture - specialized branch of aquaculture involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater. = Farming =  Types of farming  *Alligator farming - establishment for breeding and raising of crocodilians in order to produce meat, leather, and other goods. * Aquaculture - farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and aquatic plants. *Contract farming - agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers *Dairy farming - class of agricultural, or an animal husbandry, enterprise, for long-term production of milk, usually from dairy cows but also from goats and sheep, which may be either processed on-site or transported to a dairy factory for processing and eventual retail sale. *Integrated farming - more integrated approach to farming as compared to existing monoculture approaches. It refers to agricultural systems that integrate livestock and crop production and may sometimes be known as Integrated Biosystems. * Orchardry - managing orchards, intentional planting of trees or shrubs that are maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit or nut-producing trees which are grown for commercial production. *Organic farming - form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control. * Pig farming - * Poultry farming *Sericulture - silk farming, the rearing of silkworms for the production of raw silk. * Sheep husbandry - specifically dealing with the raising and breeding of domestic sheep. * Viticulture - the cultivation and harvesting of grapes.

Orchard - intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. * Farm - * Greenhouse - building in which plants are grown.  Farming equipment  Farm equipment - any kind of machinery used on a farm to help with farming. *Baler - piece of farm machinery used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, cotton, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. *Combine harvester - or simply combine, is a machine that harvests grain crops. *Farm tractor - vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. *Manure spreader used to distribute manure over a field as a fertilizer. *Mower - machine for cutting grass or other plants that grow on the ground. Usually mowing is distinguished from reaping, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for harvesting grain crops, e.g. with reapers and combines. *Pickup truck - is a light motor vehicle with an open- top rear cargo area (bed). *Plough - is a tool (or machine) used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances in agriculture. Farming products *Livestock - domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber and labor. The term \\"livestock\\" as used in this article does not include poultry or farmed fish; however the inclusion of these, especially poultry, within the meaning of \\"livestock\\" is common. Cattle - most common type of large domesticated ungulates. Pigs - any of the animals in the genus Sus. Poultry - category of domesticated birds kept by humans for the purpose of collecting their eggs, or killing for their meat and/or feathers. Sheep - are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. *Produce - farm-produced goods, not limited to fruits and vegetables (i.e. meats, grains, oats, etc.). Grains - grasses (members of the monocot family Poaceae, also known as Gramineae) cultivated for the edible components of their grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Fruits - part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries. Legumes - plant in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), or a fruit of these specific plants. A legume fruit is a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. Nut (fruit)s - hard-shelled indehiscent fruit of some plants.

It stretches more than from Dauan Island in the Torres Strait off the northern tip of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over .Shaw, John H., Collins Australian Encyclopedia, William Collins Pty Ltd., Sydney, 1984, The Greater Blue Mountains Area, Gondwana Rainforests, and Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Areas are located in the range. Geography The Great Dividing Range consists of a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments. The Dividing Range does not consist of a single mountain range. It consists of a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments with an ancient and complex geological history. The physiographic division name for the landmass is called the East Australian Cordillera. In some places the terrain is relatively flat, consisting of very low hills. Typically the highlands range from in height. The mountains and plateaus, which consist of limestones, sandstone, quartzite, schists and dolomite, have been created by faulting and folding processes. The crest of the range is defined by the watershed or boundary between the drainage basins of rivers which drain directly eastward into the Pacific Ocean, or southward into Bass Strait, and those rivers which drain into the Murray‚ÄìDarling river system towards the west and south. In central Queensland, the rivers on the west side drain into Lake Eyre basin. In north Queensland, the rivers on the west side of the range drain towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. The higher and more rugged parts of the \\"range\\" do not necessarily form part of the crest of the range, but may be branches and offshoots from it. The term \\"Great Dividing Range\\" may refer specifically to the watershed crest of the range, or to the entire upland complex including all of the hills and mountains between the east coast of Australia and the central plains and lowlands. At some places it can be up to wide. Notable ranges and other features which form part of the range complex have their own distinctive names. The sharp rise between the coastal lowlands and the eastern uplands has affected Australia's climate, mainly due to orographic precipitation, and these areas of highest relief have revealed an impressive gorge country. Areas to the east of the mountain range in southern NSW usually experience a F√∂hn effect, which is a dry wind originating from the Great Dividing Range that abruptly raises the air temperature in the lee of that mountain range and reduces atmospheric moisture.Drechsel, S., Mayr, G.J. (2008) Objective forecasting of foehn winds for a subgrid-scale alpine valley. Weather and Forecasting, 23, 205-218. This dry wind, which elevates fire danger in the warm months, occurs because of the partial orographic obstruction of relatively damp low-level air and the subsiding of drier upper-level air in leeward of the mountains. The drier air is then heated more because of the adiabatic compression as it comes down the lee slopes.Sharples, J.J. Mills, G.A., McRae, R.H.D., Weber, R.O.

History Kings Highway between Braidwood and Bungendore, New South Wales The Great Dividing Range was formed during the Carboniferous period‚Äîover 300 million years ago‚Äîwhen Australia collided with what are now parts of South America and New Zealand. The range has experienced significant erosion since. (See Geology of Australia.) For tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation the ranges were home to various Aboriginal Australian nations and clans. Evidence remains in some places of their traditional way of life including decorated caves, campsites and trails used to travel between the coastal and inland regions. Many descendants of these nations still exist today, and some remain the traditional owners and custodians of their lands. After British colonisation in 1788, the ranges were an obstacle to exploration and settlement by the British settlers. Although not high, parts of the highlands were very rugged. Crossing the Blue Mountains was particularly challenging due to the mistaken idea that the creeks should be followed rather than the ridges, and almost impenetrable, labyrinthine, sandstone mountains. Although the most daunting obstacle to western expansion of the colony, the Blue Mountains actually lie to the east of the watershed that divides the Hawkesbury-Nepean system and the Murray-Darling system, the true Great Dividing Range. The watershed in this area lies to the west of Lithgow, passing near the locality of Mt Lambie and village of Capertee. There, as in some other places in New South Wales, the Great Divide is only a slight rise in the surrounding topography. Knowing that local Aboriginal people had already established routes crossing the range and by making use of Aboriginal walking trails, a usable ridge-top route was finally discovered by Europeans directly westward from Sydney across the Blue Mountains to Bathurst by an expedition jointly led by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth. Towns in the Blue Mountains were later named after each of these men. This was the start of the development of the agricultural districts of inland New South Wales. A road was built to Blaxland by convicts within six months. Easier routes to inland New South Wales were discovered towards Goulburn to the southwest, and westwards from Newcastle. Subsequent explorations were made across and around the ranges by Allan Cunningham, John Oxley, Hamilton Hume, Paul Edmund Strzelecki, Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell. These explorers were mainly concerned with finding and appropriating good agricultural land. By the late 1830s the most fertile rangelands adjacent to the mountain ranges had been explored, appropriated from the traditional inhabitants and some settled. These included the Gippsland and Riverina regions in the south, up to the Liverpool Plains and the Darling Downs in the north. Various road and railway routes were subsequently established through many parts of the ranges, although many areas remain remote to this day. For example, in eastern Victoria there is only one major road crossing the highlands from north to south, the Great Alpine Road. Natural components The Snowy Mountains alpine region Mt Feathertop viewed from Smoko. Parts of the highlands consisting of relatively flat and, by Australian standards, well-watered land were developed for agricultural and pastoral uses. Such areas include the Atherton Tableland and Darling Downs in Queensland, and the Northern Tablelands, Southern Highlands and Southern Tablelands in New South Wales. Other parts of the highlands are too rugged for agriculture and have been used for forestry. Many parts of the highlands which were not developed are now included in National Parks. All of mainland Australia's alpine areas, including its highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko ( AHD), are part of this range, called the Main Range. The highest areas in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria are known as the Australian Alps. The central core of the Great Dividing Range is dotted with hundreds of peaks and is surrounded by many smaller mountain ranges or spurs, canyons, valleys and plains of regional significance. Some of the major plains include the High Plains of South- Eastern Australia, the Southern Highlands, the Central Highlands and Bogong High Plains of Victoria. Other tablelands considered part of the Great Dividing Range are the Atherton Tableland, Canberra wine region and the Southern Tablelands. The Dandenong Ranges, Barrington Tops, Bunya Mountains, Blue Mountains, Liverpool Range, McPherson Ranges and the Moonbi Range are some of the smaller spurs and ranges that make up the greater dividing range. Other notable ranges and tablelands which form part of the Great Dividing Range include the Liverpool Range, Mount Royal Range and the Monaro District. Whilst some of the peaks of the highlands reach respectable heights of a little over , the age of the range and its erosion mean that most of the mountains are not very steep, and virtually all peaks can be reached without mountaineering equipment. In some areas, such as the Snowy Mountains, Victorian Alps, the Scenic Rim and the eastern escarpments of the New England region, the highlands form a significant barrier. The eastern escarpment is the site of many spectacular waterfalls which were formed by rivers plunging off the tablelands. In other areas the slopes are gentle and in places the range is barely perceptible. Well known passes on the range include Coxs Gap, Cunninghams Gap, Dead Horse Gap, Nowlands Gap, and Spicers Gap. Major cities located on the upland areas of the range include Canberra, Toowoomba and the outer suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Cairns in north Queensland. Many towns and cities are located on the range, and also in lowland areas and foothills adjacent to the highlands. There is a strong natural history and cultural attachment to the Dividing Range region in towns and on many, sometimes remote, landholdings. Some of the towns/cities located on the range include: * Canberra - ACT * Goulburn - NSW * Cooma - NSW * Jindabyne - NSW * Katoomba - NSW * Oberon - NSW * Bowral - NSW * Bathurst - NSW * Orange - NSW * Armidale - NSW * Scone - NSW * Walcha - NSW * Guyra - NSW * Tenterfield - NSW * Toowoomba - QLD * Stanthorpe - QLD * Warwick - QLD * Kingaroy - QLD * Biloela - QLD * Emerald - QLD * Moranbah - QLD * Atherton - QLD * Mareeba - QLD * Omeo - VIC * Healesville - VIC * Gisborne - VIC * Ballarat - VIC * Ararat - VIC Water catchments Some of the most spectacular waterfalls in Australia, such as Dangar Falls at Dorrigo, New South Wales, are located along the Great Dividing Range. The lower reaches are used for forestry, an activity that causes friction with conservationists. The range is also the source of virtually all of eastern Australia's water supply, both through runoff caught in dams, and throughout much of Queensland, through the Great Artesian Basin. Valleys along the chain of mountains have yielded a water source for important reservoirs and water supply projects such as the Upper Nepean Scheme, Snowy Mountains Scheme and Warragamba Dam. The Bradfield Scheme has been mooted as a way to transport water from the Wet Tropics of Queensland in the coastal northeast of Far North Queensland via a series of Dams & Tunnels, southwest to inland dryer regions, including a tunnel through the Great Dividing Range into the Flinders River then a tunnel into the Torrens Creek in the White Mountains National Park then flows south into Thompson River / Cooper Creek, part of the Eyre Basin. Many other variations have been proposed. The Great Dividing Range creates the drainage basins of the Australian south-east coast drainage division and the Australian north-east coast drainage division, whose water flows to the east coast and into the Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, and Bass Strait with the westerly Murray‚ÄìDarling basin which flow inland, away from the coast into the interior plains. Some of the rivers which flow west of the ranges includes the Condamine River, Flinders River, Herbert River, Lachlan River, Macdonald River, Macintyre River and Namoi River. Rivers that flow north into the Murray‚ÄìDarling Basin from Victoria include the Goulburn, Mitta Mitta, Kiewa, Ovens, King, Loddon and Campaspe rivers. Rivers that flow east into the Pacific Ocean include the Brisbane River, Burdekin River, Clarence River, Hastings River, Hawkesbury River, Hunter River, Macleay River, Mary River, Richmond River and the Shoalhaven River. Those that flow south, primarily through Victoria, include the Snowy, Cann, Tambo, Mitchell, Latrobe, Thomson, Yarra, Werribee, Hopkins and Glenelg rivers. Features At some high hill passes the range provides cool sites appropriate for vineyards. Railways A number of scenic railways, such as this one at Katoomba, climb various shorter routes along the range The engineers of early rail passages across the Great Dividing Range needed to find low sections of the range to cross, as well as suitable, \\"low\\" gradient paths up the mountains on either side. Rail passages include: * Townsville-Mt Isa * Rockhampton-Winton * Brisbane‚ÄìToowoomba (1867) (2.0% gradient) * Newcastle‚ÄìTamworth (c 1870), summit at Ardglen Tunnel (2073' HASL) * Sandy Hollow to Maryvale Railway Line started in the 1930s to Maryvale (Main Western Railway Line), completed the 1980s to Gulgong (Sandy Hollow‚ÄìGulgong Section), summit just west of Ulan - (500M / 1640') The lowest, 4th & last crossing in NSW. * Sydney‚ÄìLithgow (1869), crossing the range via the Blue Mountains (summit near Bell 3507' HASL) (3.00% gradient) * Sydney‚ÄìGoulburn (1869), though the divide is actually a few kilometres further west near the crossing with Parkesbourne Road near Cullerin.

There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as Fragaria √ó ananassa. Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world. Description Strawberries are not true berries.Esau, K. 1977. Anatomy of seed plants. John Wiley and Sons, New York. The fleshy and edible part of the fruit is a receptacle, and the parts that are sometimes mistakenly called \\"seeds\\" are achenes.E-Flora BC: Electronic Atlas of the Plants of British Columbia: Fragaria virginiana. Etymology Although it is commonly thought that strawberries get their name from straw being used as a mulch in cultivating the plants, the word is possibly derived from \\"strewn berry\\" in reference to the runners that \\"strew\\" or \\"stray away\\" from the base of the plants. David Mikkelson argues that \\"the word 'strawberry' has been part of the English language for at least a thousand years, well before strawberries were cultivated as garden or farm edibles.\\" (1966). The Strawberry: History, Breeding and Physiology 3. Early History of the Strawberry: 16 Classification There are more than 20 different Fragaria species worldwide. Numbers of other species have been proposed, some of which are now recognized as subspecies. Key to the classification of strawberry species is recognizing that they vary in the number of chromosomes. There are seven basic types of chromosomes that they all have in common. However, they exhibit different polyploidy. Some species are diploid, having two sets of the seven chromosomes (14 chromosomes total). Others are tetraploid (four sets, 28 chromosomes total), hexaploid (six sets, 42 chromosomes total), octoploid (eight sets, 56 chromosomes total), or decaploid (ten sets, 70 chromosomes total). As a rough rule (with exceptions), strawberry species with more chromosomes tend to be more robust and produce larger plants with larger berries.Darrow, George M.

Although most kinds of shellfish are harvested from saltwater environments, some are found in freshwater. In addition, a few species of land crabs are eaten, for example Cardisoma guanhumi in the Caribbean. Shellfish are among the most common food allergens. Despite the name, shellfish are not actually fish, but are simply water-dwelling animals. Most shellfish are low on the food chain and eat a diet composed primarily of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Many varieties of shellfish, and crustaceans in particular, are actually closely related to insects and arachnids; crustaceans make up one of the main subphyla of the phylum Arthropoda. Molluscs include cephalopods (squids, octopuses, cuttlefish) and bivalves (clams, oysters), as well as gastropods (aquatic species such as whelks and winkles; land species such as snails and slugs). Molluscs used as a food source by humans include many species of clams, mussels, oysters, winkles, and scallops. Some crustaceans that are commonly eaten are shrimp, lobsters, crayfish, and crabs. Echinoderms are not as frequently harvested for food as molluscs and crustaceans; however, sea urchin roe is quite popular in many parts of the world, where the live delicacy is harder to transport. Terminology Cooked musselsThe term ‚Äúshellfish‚Äù is used both broadly and specifically. In common parlance, as in \\"having shellfish for dinner\\", it can refer to anything from clams and oysters to lobster and shrimp. For regulatory purposes it is often narrowly defined as filter-feeding molluscs such as clams, mussels, and oyster to the exclusion of crustaceans and all else.Maryland Shellfish Harvesting Areas , Maryland Department of the Environment Although the term is primarily applied to marine species, edible freshwater invertebrates such as crayfish and river mussels are also sometimes grouped under the umbrella term \\"shellfish\\". Although their shells may differ, all shellfish are invertebrates. As non-mammalian animals that spend their entire lives in water they are \\"fish\\" in an informal sense; however, the term ‚Äùfinfish‚Äù is sometimes used to distinguish fish, animals defined by having vertebrae, from shellfish in modern terminology. The word \\"shellfish\\" is both singular and plural; the rarely used \\"shellfishes\\" is sometimes employed to distinguish among various types of shellfish. Shellfish in various cuisines Archaeological finds have shown that humans have been making use of shellfish as a food item for hundreds of thousands of years. In the present, shellfish dishes are a feature of almost all the cuisines of the world, providing an important source of protein in many cuisines around the world, especially in the countries with coastal areas. Sakura ebi ('cherry shrimp') In Japan In the Japanese cuisine, chefs often use shellfish and their roe in different dishes. Sushi (vinegared rice, topped with other ingredients, including shellfish, fish, meat and vegetables) features both raw and cooked shellfish. Sashimi primarily consists of very fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces. Both sushi and sashimi are served with soy sauce and wasabi paste (a Japanese horseradish root, a spice with extremely strong, hot flavor), thinly sliced pickled ginger root, and a simple garnish such as shiso (a kitchen herb, member of the mint family) or finely shredded daikon radish, or both. In the United States Maine lobster Lobster in particular is a great delicacy in the United States, where families in the Northeast region make them into the centerpiece of a clam bake, usually for special occasions. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the American lobster ranges from Newfoundland down to about the Carolinas, but is most often associated with Maine. A typical meal involves boiling the lobster with some slight seasoning and then serving it with drawn butter, baked potato, and corn on the cob. Clamming is done both commercially and recreationally along the Northeast coastline of the US. Various type of clams are incorporated into the cuisine of New England. The soft-shelled clam is eaten either fried or steamed (and then called \\"steamers\\"). Many types of clams can be used for clam chowder, but the quahog, a hard shelled clam also known as a chowder clam, is often used because the long cooking time softens its tougher meat. The Chesapeake Bay and Maryland region has generally been associated more with crabs, but in recent years the area has been trying to reduce its catch of blue crabs, as wild populations have been depleted. This has not, however, stemmed the demand: Maryland-style crabcakes are still a well known treat in crabhouses all over the bay, though the catch now comes from points farther south. Scallop sandwich served in San Diego In the Southeast, and particularly the gulf states, shrimping is an important industry. Copious amounts of shrimp are harvested each year in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean to satisfy a national demand for shrimp. Locally, prawns and shrimp are often deep fried; in the Cajun and Creole kitchens of Louisiana, shrimp and prawns are a common addition to traditional recipes like jambalaya and certain stews. Crawfish are a well known and much eaten delicacy there, often boiled in huge pots and heavily spiced. In many major cities with active fishing ports, raw oyster bars are also a feature of shellfish consumption. When served freshly shucked (opened) and iced, one may find a liquid inside the shell, called the liquor. Some believe that oysters have the properties of an aphrodisiac. Inter-tidal herbivorous shellfish such as mussels and clams can help people reach a healthy balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fats in their diets, instead of the current Western diets. For this reason, the eating of shellfish is often encouraged by dietitians. Shellfish are also a rich source of the amino acid taurine. Around the world Large shrimp or prawns for sale in Italy nerites from the Rajang River, Sarawak, Malaysia Shellfish is a common part of indigenous cuisines throughout the Philippines. Some popular dishes using shellfish: * Ceviche * Cioppino * Callaloo * Clam chowder * Curanto * Fruits de mer * Paella * Sashimi * Shrimp cocktail * Lobster bisque * She-crab soup * Sliced fish soup * Sushi * Shrimp Saganaki Religious dietary restrictions The Torah forbids the consumption of shellfish (i.e. the only permitted seafood is fish with fins and scales), in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Jews (of all religious traditions) who fully observe the dietary laws thus do not eat shellfish. Neither do Seventh-day Adventists, who follow Jewish dietary law. Islamic schools of thought vary on whether (and which types of) shellfish may be acceptable.  Allergy  While estimates vary from shellfish, approximately 1% of the population is estimated to suffer from seafood allergy, which is more common in teenage and adult life than very early childhood. An estimated 20% will grow out of their allergy with time.  Toxic content  Some shellfish, such as whelk, contain arsenic. A sample of whelk was found to have a total content of arsenic at of which 1% is inorganic arsenic. Shellfish caught in Alaska can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). PSP is caused by toxins released by dinoflagellate, a type of algae, which are extremely poisonous (1000 times more potent than cyanide) and can lead to death by paralyzing the breathing muscles. Due to warming oceans algae blooms have become more widespread, thereby increasing the likelihood of intoxications of various types.

Dagens Nyheter. Retrieved 2010-04-27. \\"He was found [dead] Saturday afternoon in his home [...] in Stockholm.\\" was a Swedish musician best known for his four instrumental albums released in the 1970s. Early life and musical career Hansson spent his early life in a remote village in the pine forests of northern Sweden, but a change in his parents' fortunes forced a move to Stockholm and they were forced to leave the young Hansson behind, in the care of family friends. As a teenager he joined his parents in Stockholm, where he soon became interested in the burgeoning rock and roll scene and taught himself to play the guitar, before joining the band Rock-Olga. After the rock and roll craze gave way to jazz and blues in the late fifties, he joined 'Slim Notini's Blues Gang' as a guitarist. Hansson was able to move on and form his own blues group The Merrymen, who supported The Rolling Stones on an early Scandinavian tour. In 1966, Hansson saw American jazz organist Jack McDuff perform at Stockholm's Gyllene Cirkeln Club, and was so captivated by the performance that he decided to leave The Merrymen to expand his musical horizons. Encouraged by fellow Merryman Bill √ñhrstr√∂m, he eventually acquired his own Hammond organ. √ñhrstr√∂m became an A&R; man and producer at Polydor Sweden, and introduced Hansson to other musicians, one of whom was drummer Janne Carlsson. Hansson and Carlsson immediately hit it off and were signed by Polydor under the band name Hansson & Karlsson, playing up-tempo Hammond organ based music and releasing three albums between 1967 and 1969. They became immensely popular in their home country and some parts of Europe, and even reached the ear of Jimi Hendrix, who took time out from his tour to jam with the duo, along with George Clemons on drums and Georg Wadenius on guitar, at the Klub Filips in Stockholm in late 1967. Hendrix went on to record a Hansson song, \\"Tax Free\\". \\"Tax Free\\" appears on War Heroes, South Saturn Delta, and various live bootleg recordings. Solo debut By 1969, Janne Carlsson had become a successful comedian and TV host, and Hansson decided to break up the partnership. Entranced by a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, which he had purloined from his girlfriend, he moved into a friend's vacant apartment and started writing. When the unfortunate friend returned, he found that he had been evicted from his apartment after numerous complaints about the noise Hansson was creating. Hansson retreated to a remote cottage on an island off Stockholm where he, drummer Rune Carlsson and engineer Anders Lind, who had worked previously with Hansson & Karlsson, spent the winter of 1969 recording what was to become Hansson's debut solo album on a borrowed four track recorder. The resourceful Lind was even able to gain use of the only eight track recorder in Sweden at that time at the Swedish National Radio station, on the pretext that he was interested in buying one himself and wanted to test it. Once there, he persuaded session musicians Gunnar Bergsten and Sten Bergman to flesh out the recordings. Sagan Om Ringen was released on Silence Records (Sweden's first independent record label which was set up by Anders Lind) in autumn 1970 and became a huge hit. Copies of the album began to filter across to Britain where it came to the attention of Tony Stratton- Smith, who was so impressed that he released the album as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings on his own Charisma Records label in September 1972. The album peaked at #34 on the UK Album Chart and became Hansson's only UK Top 40 album. Further musical career Encouraged by the success of his first album, Hansson was booked into Stockholm's Studio Decibel where he began work on the follow-up. Using the same team, along with guitarist Kenny H√•kansson, the new recordings benefitted from the superior equipment and Ur Trollkarlens Hatt was released on Silence Records in late 1972, and on Charisma in the UK as Magician's Hat in October 1973. Although critically acclaimed, it failed to reach the popularity of the earlier work, and did not chart in the UK. Popularity in Sweden, however, put pressure on Hansson to tour, and a touring band was hastily assembled. The tour was cancelled by the reclusive keyboard player, however, citing a lack of motivation. Instead, he returned to Studio Decibel and started work on his third album. Using the tried and trusted backing musicians the recordings continued the progression of the previous album, and Mellanv√§sen was issued on Silence Records in October 1975, and as Attic Thoughts on Charisma in the UK in February 1976. Despite being the most accomplished record of Hansson's career, it did not achieve popularity, although it did feature the song \\"Rabbit Music\\" which would point the way to Hansson's next album. In 1976 Hansson and Silence Records parted company, and he was able to negotiate a worldwide deal with Charisma. He returned once again to Studio Decibel and began work on recordings that were inspired by another book; Richard Adams' Watership Down. Using the same session musicians but with a new producer, Pontus Olssen, the recordings were issued in September 1977 as El 'Ahrairah (after the novel's rabbit god) and Music Inspired by Watership Down on Charisma in the UK, and on Sire Records in the US. Another disappointing chart performance led to Hansson's withdrawal from the popular music scene, and though he worked on a number of projects with friends, little was heard from him until 1985 when he released, in Sweden only, the album Mitt I Livet (In the Middle of Life) on Silence Records (SRS 4700). He then fell into obscurity. Later years Hansson found a new following amongst Swedish DJs in recent years, who sampled his music ‚Äì something which apparently pleased him enormously. Although the better known Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings made it onto CD in 1988, in a remixed version accompanied by selected tracks from Magician's Hat and Attic Thoughts, his other 1970s albums remained unavailable in full until 2005 when Silence Records (through EMI) re-issued them on CD, digitally re-mastered and with previously unreleased extra material. In 1998 Hansson & Karlsson reunited for some live concerts and a compilation album. Due to his pioneering work and the mysteries surrounding Hansson & Karlsson's rise and fall, Hansson received the status of a living legend among the independent musical community in Sweden. He occasionally performed live sets with fellow organist Eric Malmberg who has been greatly inspired by Hansson's work. Bo Hansson died in Stockholm on 23 April 2010.

The massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13, 1937, the day that the Japanese captured Nanjing. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army murdered disarmed combatants and Chinese civilians numbering an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000,Levene, Mark and Penny Roberts. 1999. The Massacre in History. pp. 223‚Äì24.Totten, Samuel. 2008. Dictionary of Genocide. pp. 298‚Äì99. and perpetrated widespread rape and looting.Chang, Iris. 1997. The Rape of Nanking. p. 6. Since most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945, historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre. In 1946, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident. China's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947. The death toll has been contested by scholars since the 1980s. The event remains a contentious political issue and an obstacle in Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese government has been accused of exaggerating aspects of the massacre such as the death toll by many Japanese; historical negationists and Japanese nationalists go as far as claiming the massacre was fabricated for propaganda purposes.Fogel, Joshua A. 2000.

The controversy surrounding the massacre remains a central issue in Japanese relations with other East Asian nations, such as South Korea.Gallicchio, Marc S. 2007. The Unpredictability of the Past. p. 158. The Government of Japan has admitted to the killing of many non-combatants, looting and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanjing, and Japanese veterans who served there have confirmed that a massacre took place. A small but vocal minority in the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred. Denial of the massacre and revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of Japanese nationalism.Yoshida, Takashi. 2006. The Making of the 'Rape of Nanking'. pp. 157‚Äì58. In Japan, public opinion of the massacre varies but few deny outright that the event occurred.  Military situation  In August 1937, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai where they met strong resistance and suffered heavy casualties. The battle was bloody as both sides faced attrition in urban hand-to-hand combat.1937 Japanese Field Commander's Map of the Battle of Shanghai, China geographicus.com Retrieved 22 April 2020 By mid-November the Japanese had captured Shanghai with the help of naval and (aerial) bombardment. The General Staff Headquarters in Tokyo initially decided not to expand the war due to the high casualties incurred and the low morale of the troops.The Nanjing Massacre exequy.wordpress.com Retrieved 22 April 2020 Nevertheless, on December 1, headquarters ordered the Central China Area Army and the 10th Army to capture Nanjing, then-capital of the Republic of China.  Relocation of the capital  After losing the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek knew that the fall of Nanjing was a matter of time. He and his staff realized that they could not risk the annihilation of their elite troops in a symbolic but hopeless defense of the capital. To preserve the army for future battles, most of it was withdrawn. Chiang's strategy was to follow the suggestion of his German advisers to draw the Japanese army deep into China and use China's vast territory as a defensive strength. Chiang planned to fight a protracted war of attrition to wear down the Japanese in the hinterland of China.  Strategy for the defense of Nanjing  In a press release to foreign reporters, Tang Shengzhi announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death. Tang gathered about 100,000 soldiers, largely untrained, including Chinese troops who had participated in the Battle of Shanghai. The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanjing to an International Committee led by John Rabe, a German national. In an attempt to secure permission for this cease-fire from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Rabe, who was living in Nanjing and had been acting as the Chairman of the Nanjing International Safety Zone Committee, boarded the USS Panay on December 9. From this gunboat, Rabe sent two telegrams. The first was to Chiang through an American ambassador in Hankow, asking that Chinese forces \\"undertake no military operations\\" within Nanjing. The second telegram was sent through Shanghai to Japanese military leaders, advocating for a three-day ceasefire so that the Chinese could withdraw from the city. The following day, on December 10, Rabe got his answer from the Generalissimo. The American ambassador in Hankow replied that although he supported Rabe's proposal for a ceasefire, Chiang did not. Rabe says that the ambassador also \\"sent us a separate confidential telegram telling us that he has been officially informed by the Foreign Ministry in Hankow that our understanding that General Tang agreed to a three-day armistice and the withdrawal of his troops from Nanjing is mistaken, and moreover that Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he is not in a position to accept such an offer.\\" This rejection of the committee's ceasefire plan, in Rabe's mind, sealed the fate of the city. Nanjing had been constantly bombed for days and the Chinese troops that remained there were disheartened and had taken to drinking before the city's inevitable fall. On December 11, Rabe found that Chinese soldiers were still residing in areas of the Safety Zone, meaning that it became an intended target for Japanese attack despite the majority being innocent civilians. Rabe commented on how efforts to remove these Chinese troops failed and Japanese soldiers began to lob grenades into the refugee zone.Rabe, John, and Erwin Wickert. 1998.

Sword used in the \\"contest\\" on display at the Republic of China Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan Although the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing. According to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time:Cummins, Joseph. 2009. The World's Bloodiest History. p. 149. > The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanjing quite rapidly is due > to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and > rape as they wish. In his novel Ikiteiru Heitai ('Living Soldiers'), Tatsuz≈ç Ishikawa vividly describes how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanjing. The novel itself was based on interviews that Ishikawa conducted with troops in Nanjing in January 1938.Honda, Katsuichi, and Frank Gibney. \\"The Nanjing massacre: a Japanese journalist confronts Japan's national shame.\\" pp. 39‚Äì41. Perhaps the most notorious atrocity was a killing contest between two Japanese officers as reported in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and the English-language Japan Advertiser. The contest‚Äîa race between the two officers to see who could kill 100 people first using only a sword‚Äîwas covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days.Tokyo Nichi Nichi, 13 December 1937 article on the killing contest.Japan Advertiser, 7 December 1937 (an American owned and edited English-language daily paper in Tokyo) In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.. In 2000, historian Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the national fighting spirit. In 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that \\"the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people\\" and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false. The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old. The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.  Retreating Chinese Troops' Scorched-Earth Policy  The Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiakuan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates. Targets within and outside of the city walls‚Äîsuch as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages‚Äîwere completely burnt down, at an estimated value of US$20‚Äì30 million (1937).  Establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone  Many Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners. Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16. Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city. German businessman John Rabe was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the Nazi Party and the existence of the German-Japanese bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. The Japanese government had previously agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the Committee managed to persuade the Chinese government to move their troops out of the area. The Nanking Safety Zone was demarcated through the use of Red Cross Flags On December 1, 1937, Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaochun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanjing to move into the \\"Safety Zone.\\" Many fled the city on December 7, and the International Committee took over as the de facto government of Nanjing.  Prince Asaka appointed as commander  Prince Yasuhiko Asaka in 1940 In a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled Prince Yasuhiko Asaka out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was \\"not good.\\" He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends. It appears that Hirohito had never learned about, or had refused to admit, Asaka's role in the ensuing massacre. On December 5, Asaka left Tokyo by plane and arrived at the front three days later. He met with division commanders, lieutenant-generals Kesago Nakajima and Heisuke Yanagawa, who informed him that the Japanese troops had almost completely surrounded 300,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Nanjing and that preliminary negotiations suggested that the Chinese were ready to surrender. Prince Asaka is alleged to have issued an order to \\"kill all captives,\\" thus providing official sanction for the crimes which took place during and after the battle.Chen, World War II Database Some authors record that Prince Asaka signed the order for Japanese soldiers in Nanjing to \\"kill all captives\\".David Bergamini, Japan's imperial Conspiracy, 1971, p. 24 Others assert that lieutenant colonel Isamu Ch≈ç, Asaka's aide-de-camp, sent this order under the Prince's sign-manual without the Prince's knowledge or assent.Iris Chang, The Rape of Nanking, 1997, p. 40 Nevertheless, even if Ch≈ç took the initiative, Asaka was nominally the officer in charge and gave no orders to stop the carnage. While the extent of Prince Asaka's responsibility for the massacre remains a matter of debate, the ultimate sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China were issued in Emperor Hirohito's ratification of the Japanese army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5, 1937.Akira Fujiwara, \\"Nitch≈´ Sens≈ç ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu2, Kikan Sens≈ç Sekinin Kenky≈´ 9, 1995, p. 22  Battle of Nanjing   Siege of the city  The Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching the last lines of Chinese resistance, and arriving outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.  Demand for surrender  At noon on December 9, the Japanese military dropped leaflets into the city, urging the city of Nanjing to surrender within 24 hours, promising \\"no mercy\\" if the offer is refused. In the meantime, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position. John Rabe boarded the U.S. gunboat on December 9 and sent two telegrams, one to Chiang Kai-shek by way of the American ambassador in Hankow, and one to the Japanese military authority in Shanghai.  Assault and capture of Nanjing  Iwane Matsui enters Nanjing. The Japanese awaited an answer to their demand for surrender but no response was received from the Chinese by the deadline on December 10. General Iwane Matsui waited another hour before issuing the command to take Nanjing by force. The Japanese army mounted its assault on the Nanjing walls from multiple directions; the SEF's 16th Division attacked three gates on the eastern side, the 6th Division of the 10A launched its offensive on the western walls, and the SEF's 9th Division advanced into the area in-between. On December 12, under heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, General Tang Sheng-chi ordered his men to retreat. What followed was nothing short of chaos. Some Chinese soldiers stripped civilians of their clothing in a desperate attempt to blend in, and many others were shot by the Chinese supervisory unit as they tried to flee. On 13 December, the 6th and the 116th Divisions of the Japanese Army were the first to enter the city, facing little military resistance. Simultaneously, the 9th Division entered nearby Guanghua Gate, and the 16th Division entered the Zhongshan and Taiping gates. That same afternoon, two small Japanese Navy fleets arrived on both sides of the Yangtze River.  Pursuit and mopping-up operations  Japanese troops pursued the retreating Chinese army units, primarily in the Xiakuan area to the north of the city walls and around the Zijin Mountain in the east. Although most sources suggest that the final phase of the battle consisted of a one-sided slaughter of Chinese troops by the Japanese, some Japanese historians maintain that the remaining Chinese military still posed a serious threat to the Japanese. Prince Yasuhiko Asaka told a war correspondent later that he was in a very perilous position when his headquarters was ambushed by Chinese forces that were in the midst of fleeing from Nanjing east of the city. On the other side of the city, the 11th Company of the 45th Regiment encountered some 20,000 Chinese soldiers who were making their way from Xiakuan. The Japanese army conducted its mopping-up operation both inside and outside the Nanjing Safety Zone. Since the area outside the safety zone had been almost completely evacuated, the mopping-up effort was concentrated in the safety zone. The safety zone, an area of 3.85 square kilometres, was packed with the remaining population of Nanjing. The Japanese army leadership assigned sections of the safety zone to some units to separate alleged plain- clothed soldiers from the civilians. The number of Chinese soldiers in plain clothes that were executed are estimated to be around 4,000.Yoshiaki Itakura, Êú¨ÂΩì„ÅØ„Åì„ÅÜ„Å†„Å£„ÅüÂçó‰∫¨‰∫ã‰ª∂ (Tokyo: Nihon Tosho Kankokai, 1999), 11.  Civilian evacuation  Evacuation and flight of civilians With the relocation of the capital of China and the reports of Japanese brutality, most of the civilian population fled Nanjing out of fear. Wealthy families were the first to flee, leaving Nanjing in automobiles, followed by the evacuation of the middle class and then the poor, while only the destitute lowest class such as the ethnic Tanka boat people remained behind. More than three quarters of the population had fled Nanjing before the Japanese arrived.  Massacre  Eyewitness accounts of Westerners and Chinese present at Nanjing in the weeks after the fall of the city say that, over the course of six weeks following the fall of Nanjing, Japanese troops engaged in mass rape, murder, torture, theft, arson, and other war crimes. Some of these primary accounts, including the diaries of John Rabe and American Minnie Vautrin, came from foreigners who opted to stay behind to protect the Chinese civilians from harm. Other accounts include first-person testimonies of Nanjing Massacre survivors, eyewitness reports of journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel. American missionary John Magee stayed behind to provide a 16 mm film documentary and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre. A group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee on November 22 and mapped out the Nanjing Safety Zone in order to safeguard civilians in the city. The city population of Nanjing inflated drastically during the mid-1930s, as many refugees fled from the Japanese aggression in the north. Rabe and American missionary Lewis S. C. Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the University of Nanking, recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.  Massacre contest  In 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division. The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78. The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people. By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people.. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Mukai and Noda were both arrested and tried as war criminals, and both of them were found guilty and executed by shooting.ÂõΩÈò≤ÈÉ®ÂÆ°Âà§ÊàòÁäØÂÜõ‰∫ãÊ≥ïÂ∫≠ÂØπÊàòÁäØÂêë‰∫ïÊïèÊòéÁ≠â‰∫∫ÁöÑÂà§ÂÜ≥‰π¶.

A woman and her two teenaged daughters were raped, and Japanese soldiers rammed a bottle and a cane into her vagina. An eight-year- old girl was stabbed, but she and her younger sister survived. They were found alive two weeks after the killings by the elderly woman shown in the photo. Bodies of the victims can also be seen in the photo.John G.

Hong Kong University Press, 2004 The International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that 20,000 women, including some children and the elderly, were raped during the occupation.Paragraph 2, p. 1012, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East. A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang raped. The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit mutilation\\"A Debt of Blood: An Eyewitness Account of the Barbarous Acts of the Japanese Invaders in Nanjing.\\" Dagong Daily (Wuhan ed.). 7 February 1938.; as quoted by Xingzu, Gao, Wu Shimin, Hu Yungong, and Cha Ruizhen.

Grey. or by penetrating vaginas with bayonets, long sticks of bamboo, or other objects. Young children were not exempt from these atrocities and were cut open to allow Japanese soldiers to rape them. On 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:Hua-ling Hu, American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin, 2000, p. 97 > I know not where to end.

Two bayoneted corpses are > the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their > headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning or reason and > killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the > hospital. Let me recount some instances occurring in the last two days. Last > night the house of one of the Chinese staff members of the university was > broken into and two of the women, his relatives, were raped. Two girls, > about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University > Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last > night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were > satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who [had] five bayonet > wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of omentum was > outside the abdomen. I think he will live. In his diary kept during the aggression against the city and its occupation by the Imperial Japanese Army, the leader of the Safety Zone, John Rabe, wrote many comments about Japanese atrocities. For 17 December: > Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to > break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two > Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they > return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my > garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. > I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital ... Last > night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 > girls at Ginling College‚Ä¶alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or > brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the > brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers. There are also accounts of Japanese troops forcing families to commit incestuous acts.Chang, Iris. 1997. The Rape of Nanking. Penguin Books. p. 95. Sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters. Iris Chang estimated that the number of Chinese women raped by Japanese soldiers ranged from 20,000 to 80,000.Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 89, citing:  Massacre of civilians  A boy killed by a Japanese soldier with the butt of a rifle because he did not take off his hat Following the capture of Nanjing, a massacre, which was perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), led to the deaths of up to 60,000 residents in the city, a figure difficult to precisely calculate due to the many bodies deliberately burnt, buried in mass graves, or deposited in the Yangtze River by the IJA. Japanese ultra-nationalists have strongly disputed such death tolls, with some claiming that no more than several hundred civilians were killed during the massacre. B. Campbell, in an article published in the journal Sociological Theory, has described the Nanjing Massacre as a genocide, given the fact that residents were still slaughtered en masse during the aftermath, despite the successful and certain outcome in battle. On 13 December 1937, John Rabe wrote in his diary: > It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of destruction. We > come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I > examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been > fleeing and were shot from behind.

Hempel's > hotel was broken into as well, as [was] almost every shop on Chung Shang and > Taiping Road. On 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee to recommend its purchase. > During the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking ‚Äì which, by the way, > continues to this day to a considerable degree ‚Äì the Reverend John Magee, a > member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost > a quarter of a century, took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to > the atrocities committed by the Japanese.‚Ä¶ One will have to wait and see > whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have > indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even > today.

The older was > bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword. On 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Sh≈´d≈ç Higashinakano and the publisher Tendensha to pay four million yen in damages to Mrs. Shuqin Xia, who claims to be the 7- or 8-year-old girl who appears in Magee's film. Higashinakano had claimed in his book, Thorough Review of Nanjing Massacre, that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanjing massacre, but he was unable to prove this at trial.english.peopledaily.com.cn, Author on Nanjing loses libel appeal, search.japantimes.co.jp Bodies of Chinese massacred by Japanese troops along a river in Nanjing Pregnant women were targeted for murder, as their stomachs were often bayoneted, sometimes after rape.

According to Navy veteran Sho Mitani, \\"The Army used a trumpet sound that meant 'Kill all Chinese who run away'.\\"Japan's Last Vets of Nanking Massacre Open Up , Yahoo News! Thousands were led away and mass-executed in an excavation known as the \\"Ten-Thousand-Corpse Ditch\\", a trench measuring about 300 m long and 5 m wide. Since records were not kept, estimates regarding the number of victims buried in the ditch range from 4,000 to 20,000. However, most scholars and historians consider the number to be more than 12,000 victims. Author refers to source as Yin, James. (1996) The Rape of Nanking: An Undeniable History in Photographs. Chicago: Innovative Publishing Group, p. 103. The Hui people, a minority Chinese group, the majority of them Muslim, suffered as well during the massacre. One mosque was found destroyed and others found to be \\"filled with dead bodies.\\" Hui volunteers and imams buried over a hundred of their dead following Muslim ritual.  Extrajudicial killing of Chinese prisoners of war  On 5 August 1937, the Deputy Minister of Military of Japan notified Japanese Troops in Shanghai of the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners (\\"Riku Shi Mitsu No.198\\"). The directive also advised staff officers to no longer to use the term Prisoner of War.Ikuhiko Hata 2007 Nanking Jiken Gyakusatsu no Kozo p. 197 Chuko-Shinsho Pub., A Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer using a shin-gunt≈ç Soon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men. Many were taken to the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned to death. What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18. For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together. At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire. Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately. It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual. The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River. The Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at Taiping Gate and murdered them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol and set on fire. The survivors were killed with bayonets. American news correspondents F. Tillman Durdin and Archibald Steele reported seeing corpses of massacred Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanjing Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who worked for The New York Times, toured Nanjing before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. He would later state that he had seen tank guns used on bound soldiers. Two days later, in his report to The New York Times, Durdin stated that the alleys and street were filled with the dead, amongst them women and children. Durdin stated \\"[i]t should be said that certain Japanese units exercised restraint and that certain Japanese officers tempered power with generosity and commission,\\" but continued \\"the conduct of the Japanese army as a whole in Nanjing was a blot on the reputation of their country\\".\\"Durdin, F.

Ralph L. Phillips, a missionary, testified to the U.S. State Assembly Investigating Committee, that he was \\"forced to watch while the Japs disembowled a Chinese soldier\\" and \\"roasted his heart and liver and ate them.\\"CBI Roundup, 16 December 1943, Rape of Nanking described by Missionary, cbi-theater-1.home.comcast.net  Theft and arson  One-third of the city was destroyed as a result of arson. According to reports, Japanese troops torched newly built government buildings as well as the homes of many civilians. There was considerable destruction to areas outside the city walls. Soldiers pillaged from the poor and the wealthy alike. The lack of resistance from Chinese troops and civilians in Nanjing meant that the Japanese soldiers were free to divide up the city's valuables as they saw fit. This resulted in the widespread looting and burglary.Chang, Iris. The Rape of Nanking, Penguin Books, 1997, p. 162. On 17 December, chairman John Rabe wrote a complaint to Kiyoshi Fukui, second secretary of the Japanese Embassy. The following is an excerpt: > In other words, on the 13th when your troops entered the city, we had nearly > all the civilian population gathered in a Zone in which there had been very > little destruction by stray shells and no looting by Chinese soldiers even > in full retreat.‚Ä¶ All 27 Occidentals in the city at that time and our > Chinese population were totally surprised by the reign of robbery, raping > and killing initiated by your soldiers on the 14th.

In the latter process we are glad to > cooperate in any way we can. But even last night between 8 and 9 p.m. when > five Occidental members of our staff and Committee toured the Zone to > observe conditions, we did not find any single Japanese patrol either in the > Zone or at the entrances!  Nanjing Safety Zone and the role of foreigners  The Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots. During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts.Chang, Iris, The Rape of Nanking: The forgotten holocaust of World War ll, Basic Books, A Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C., 1997 pp. 105-139, the chapter on the Safety Zone Rabe wrote that, from time to time, the Japanese would enter the Safety Zone at will, carry off a few hundred men and women, and either summarily execute them or rape and then kill them. By February 5, 1938, the International Committee had forwarded to the Japanese embassy a total of 450 cases of murder, rape, and general disorder by Japanese soldiers that had been reported after the American, British and German diplomats had returned to their embassies: * \\"Case 5 ‚Äì On the night of December 14th, there were many cases of Japanese soldiers entering houses and raping women or taking them away. This created panic in the area and hundreds of women moved into the Ginling College campus yesterday.\\" * \\"Case 10 ‚Äì On the night of December 15th, a number of Japanese soldiers entered the University of Nanjing buildings at Tao Yuen and raped 30 women on the spot, some by six men.\\" * \\"Case 13 ‚Äì December 18, 4 p.m., at No. 18 I Ho Lu, Japanese soldiers wanted a man's cigarette case and when he hesitated, one of the soldier crashed in the side of his head with a bayonet.

File:Chinese civilians to be buried alive.jpgPrisoners being buried alive File:Victims in Nanjing massacre.jpgSkeletons of the massacre's victims  Matsui's reaction to the massacre  On December 18, 1937, as General Iwane Matsui began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed. He reportedly told one of his civilian aides: > I now realize that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on > this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese > friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I > cannot but feel depressed. I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to > rejoice about this victory.‚Ä¶ I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to > the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents. Now, in the > winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep > emotion, to a million innocent people. On New Year's Day, over a toast he confided to a Japanese diplomat: \\"My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable.\\"  End of the massacre  In late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have \\"restored order\\". After the establishment of the weixin zhengfu (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably. On 18 February 1938, the Nanjing Safety Zone International Committee was forcibly renamed \\"Nanking International Rescue Committee\\", and the Safety Zone effectively ceased to function. The last refugee camps were closed in May 1938.  Recall of Matsui and Asaka  In February 1938, both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939, though he held no further military commands.  Death toll estimates  Estimates of the number of victims vary based on the definitions of the geographical range and the duration of the event. The extent of the atrocities is debated,A more complete account of what numbers are claimed by who, can be found in self-described \\"moderate\\" article by historian Ikuhiko Hata The Nanking Atrocities: Fact and Fable with numbers ranging from some Japanese claims of several hundred,Masaaki Tanaka claims that very few citizens were killed, and that the massacre is in fact a fabrication in his book \\"Nankin gyakusatsu\\" no kyok√ô (The \\"Nanking Massacre\\" as Fabrication). to the Chinese claim of a non-combatant death toll of 300,000.Marquand, Robert (August 20, 2001) \\"Why the Past Still Separates China and Japan\\", Christian Science Monitor states an estimate of 300,000 dead. Historian Tokushi Kasahara states \\"more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more\\", referring to his own book.Iwanami Shinsho, Fujiwara Akira (editor). Nankin jiken O Dou Miruka, 1998, Aoki shoten, , pg. 18. This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanjing, which is objected to by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p. 146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes \\"more than 200,000\\" in his book.Yoshida, Hiroshi. Nankin jiken o dou miruka pg. 123, Tennou no guntai to Nankin jiken 1998, Aoki shoten, pg. 160; . Tomio Hora writes of 50,000‚Äì100,000 deaths.Tanaka Masaaki What Really Happened in Nanking, Sekai Shuppan, Inc., 2000; , pg. 5. Mainstream scholars consider figures from 40,000 to over 300,000 to be an accurate estimate. According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, estimates made at a later date indicate that the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanjing and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was up to 200,000. These estimates are borne out by the figures of burial societies and other organizations, which testify to over 155,000 buried bodies. These figures also do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning, drowning or other means, or whose bodies were interred in mass graves. According to the verdict of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal on 10 March 1947, there are \\"more than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.\\"Tokushi Kasahara. However, this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57,418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan, though the latest research indicates that between 4,000 and 20,000 were massacred,Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), p. 193.Ono Kenji, \\"Massacre Near Mufushan,\\" in The Nanking Atrocity, 1937‚Äì38: Complicating the Picture, ed. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), p. 85. and it also includes the 112,266 corpses allegedly buried by the Chongshantang, a charitable association, though today mainstream historians agree that the Chongshantang's records were at least greatly exaggerated if not entirely fabricated.Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 112.David Askew, \\"The Scale of Japanese Atrocities in Nanjing: An Examination of the Burial Records,\\" Ritsumeikan Journal of Asia Pacific Studies, June 2004, 7‚Äì10. Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates of over 200,000 are not credible.Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, \\"Leftover Problems,\\" in The Nanking Atrocity, 1937‚Äì38: Complicating the Picture, ed. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), 382‚Äì384. Ikuhiko Hata considers the number 300,000 to be a \\"symbolic figure\\" representative of China's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally.Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 252. Some researchers estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people were killed, which corresponds to the figures from three sources; one is the Red Army's official journal of the time, Hangdibao and another is that of Miner Searle Bates of the International Safety Zone Committee, and the third is the aforementioned figure written by John Rabe in a letter. John Rabe, Chairman of the International Committee and Nanjing Safety Zone, estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 (civilians) were killed. However, Erwin Wickert, the editor of The diaries of John Rabe, points out that \\"It is likely that Rabe's estimate is too low, since he could not have had an overview of the entire municipal area during the period of the worst atrocities. Moreover, many troops of captured Chinese soldiers were led out of the city and down to the Yangtze, where they were summarily executed. But, as noted, no one actually counted the dead.\\" A mass grave from the Nanjing Massacre The casualty count of 300,000 was first promulgated in January 1938 by Harold Timperley, a journalist in China during the Japanese invasion, based on reports from contemporary eyewitnesses. Other sources, including Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking, also conclude that the death toll reached 300,000. In December 2007, newly declassified U.S. government archive documents revealed that a telegraph by the U.S. ambassador to Germany in Berlin sent one day after the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, stated that he heard the Japanese ambassador in Germany boasting that the Japanese army had killed 500,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing. According to the archives research \\"The telegrams sent by the U.S. diplomats [in Berlin] pointed to the massacre of an estimated half a million people in Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi and Changzhou\\".U.S. Archives Reveal War Massacre of 500,000 Chinese by Japanese Army . In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed.  Range and duration  The most conservative viewpoint is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few km2 of the city known as the Safety Zone, where the civilians gathered after the invasion. Many Japanese historians have insisted that during the Japanese invasion there were only 200,000‚Äì250,000 citizens in Nanjing as reported by John Rabe, to argue that the PRC's estimate of 300,000 deaths is an exaggeration. Many historians include a much larger area around the city. Including the Xiaguan district (the suburbs north of Nanjing, about 31 km2 in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city, the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just before the Japanese occupation. Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality. The duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks. Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered Jiangsu province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and stretch the end of the massacre to late March 1938. To many Japanese scholars, post-war estimations were distorted by \\"victor's justice\\", when Japan was condemned as the sole aggressor. They believed the 300,000 toll typified a \\"Chinese-style exaggeration\\" with disregard for evidence. Yet, in China, this figure has come to symbolize the justice, legality, and authority of the post-war trials condemning Japan as the aggressor.Yang Daqing, \\"Convergence or Divergence? Recent Historical Writings on the Rape of Nanjing\\", The American Historical Review 104 (1999), p. 852.  Various estimates  Japanese historians, depending on their definition of the geographical and time duration of the killings, give wide-ranging estimates for the number of massacred civilians, from several thousand to upwards of 200,000. The lowest estimate by a Japanese historian is 40,000. Chinese language newspapers tend to claim that the massacred civilians and unarmed soldiers may be as high as 200,000.  200,000 Nanjing population debate  Japanese sources assert that there was a population of only 200,000 in Nanjing, thus making the 300,000 death toll impossible. In 2003, Zhang Lianhong, professor of Nanjing Massacre Research Center in Nanjing Normal University, published an article in the Beijing Daily in which he used historical facts to show that the population of Nanjing urban area was between 367,000 and 467,000, and the overall Nanjing population was between 535,000 and 635,000, to refute the assertion of a population of 200,000.  War crimes tribunals  Shortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial. General Matsui was indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \\"deliberately and recklessly\\" ignoring his legal duty \\"to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches\\" of the Hague Convention. Hisao Tani, the lieutenant general of the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army in Nanjing, was tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal. Other Japanese military leaders in charge at the time of the Nanjing Massacre were not tried. Prince Kan'in Kotohito, chief of staff of the Imperial Japanese Army during the massacre, had died before the end of the war in May 1945. Prince Asaka was granted immunity because of his status as a member of the imperial family.Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2000, p. 583John W. Dower, Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II, 1999, p. 326. Isamu Ch≈ç, the aide to Prince Asaka, and whom some historians believe issued the \\"kill all captives\\" memo, had committed suicide during the Battle of Okinawa.Thomas M. Huber, Japan's Battle of Okinawa, April‚ÄìJune 1945, Leavenworth Papers Number 18, Combat Studies Institute, 1990, p. 47 File:International Military Tribunal Ichigaya Court.jpgThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was convened at \\"Ichigaya Court,\\" formally Imperial Japanese Army HQ building in Ichigaya, Tokyo. File:Iwane Matsui.jpgGeneral Iwane Matsui File:Tani Hisao.jpgGeneral Hisao Tani  Grant of immunity to Prince Asaka  On May 1, 1946, SCAP officials interrogated Prince Asaka, who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal. Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.Awaya Kentar√¥, Yoshida Yutaka, Kokusai kensatsukyoku jinmonch√¥sho, dai 8 kan, Nihon Tosho Cent√¢, 1993., Case 44, pp. 358‚Äì66.  Evidence and testimony  Harold John Timperley's telegram of 17 January 1938 describing the atrocities The prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946. Dr. Robert O. Wilson, a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone, took the witness stand first. Other members of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone who took the witness stand included Miner Searle Bates and John Magee. George A. Fitch, Lewis S. C. Smythe, and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters. Another piece of evidence that was submitted to the tribunal was Harold Timperley's telegram regarding the Nanjing Massacre which had been intercepted and decoded by the Americans on January 17, 1938. One of the books by Hs√º, Documents of the Nanjing Safety Zone, was also adduced in court. The entry for the same day in Matsui's diary read, \\"I could only feel sadness and responsibility today, which has been overwhelmingly piercing my heart. This is caused by the Army's misbehaviors after the fall of Nanjing and failure to proceed with the autonomous government and other political plans.\\"  Matsui's defense  Matsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese POWs. He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives. At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect Prince Asaka by shifting blame to lower ranking division commanders.  Verdict  K≈çki Hirota, who had been the Foreign Minister when Japan conquered Nanjing, was convicted of participating in \\"the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\\" (count 1), waging \\"a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China\\" (count 27) and count 55. Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the \\"orgy of crime\\" at Nanjing because, \\"He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.\\" > Organized and wholesale murder of male civilians was conducted with the > apparent sanction of the commanders on the pretext that Chinese soldiers had > removed their uniforms and were mingling with the population. Groups of > Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their hands behind their backs, > and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups > by machine gun fire and with bayonets. --- From Judgment of the > International Military Tribunal  Sentence  On November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging. Eighteen others received lesser sentences. The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence. General Hisao Tani was sentenced to death by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.  Memorials  * In 1985, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built by the Nanjing Municipal Government in remembrance of the victims and to raise awareness of the Nanjing Massacre. It is located near a site where thousands of bodies were buried, called the \\"pit of ten thousand corpses\\" (w√†n r√©n kƒìng). , there are total 10,615 Nanjing Massacre victim names inscribed on a memorial wall. * In 1995, Daniel Kwan held a photograph exhibit in Los Angeles titled, \\"The Forgotten Holocaust\\". * In 2005, John Rabe's former residence in Nanjing was renovated and now accommodates the \\"John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\\", which opened in 2006. * On December 13, 2009, both the Chinese and Japanese monks held religious assembly to mourn Chinese civilians killed by invading Japanese troops. * On December 13, 2014, China held its first Nanjing Massacre memorial day. On October 9, 2015, Documents of Nanjing Massacre have been listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

Disputes over the historical portrayal of these events continue to cause tensions between Japan on one side and China and other East Asian countries on the other side.  Cold War  Before the 1970s, China did relatively little to draw attention to the Nanjing massacre. In her book Rape of Nanking, Iris Chang asserted that the politics of the Cold War encouraged Chairman Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan.  Debate in Japan  The debate concerning the massacre took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Aspersions were cast regarding the authenticity and accuracy of burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which the Japanese government claimed were fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanjing Massacre. During the 1970s, Katsuichi Honda wrote a series of articles for the Asahi Shimbun on war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers during World War II (such as the Nanjing Massacre). The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes. In response, Shichihei Yamamoto and Akira Suzuki wrote two controversial yet influential articles which sparked the Japanese Negationist movement. In 1984, in an attempt to refute the allegations of war crimes in Nanjing, the Japanese Army Veterans Association (Kaikosha) interviewed former Japanese soldiers who had served in the Nanjing area from 1937 to 1938. Instead of refuting the allegations, the interviewed veterans confirmed that a massacre had taken place and openly described and admitted to taking part in the atrocities. The results of the survey were published in the association's magazine, Kaiko, in 1985 along with an admission and apology that read, \\"Whatever the severity of war or special circumstances of war psychology, we just lose words faced with this mass illegal killing. As those who are related to the prewar military, we simply apologize deeply to the people of China. It was truly a regrettable act of barbarity.\\"Kingston, Jeff. March 1, 2014. \\"Japan's reactionaries waging culture war.\\" Japan Times.  Apology and condolences by the Prime Minister and Emperor of Japan  On August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the Surrender of Japan, the Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama gave the first formal apology for Japanese actions during the war. He offered his apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor Akihito pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan. Iris Chang, author of The Rape of Nanking, criticized Murayama for not providing the written apology that had been expected. She said that the people of China \\"don't believe that an... unequivocal and sincere apology has ever been made by Japan to China\\" and that a written apology from Japan would send a better message to the international community.  Denials of the massacre by public officials in Japan  In May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a \\"fabrication\\". On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a \\"political advertisement\\". On February 20, 2012, Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya, told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre \\"probably never happened\\". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, \\"Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.\\"Hongo, Jun, \\"Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark\\", Japan Times, 23 February 2012, p. 2. On April 1, 2013, Kawamura said his position remained unchanged when the issue came up during an election debate. On February 24, 2012, Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time. He believes the actual death toll was 10,000. On February 3, 2014, Naoki Hyakuta, a member of the board of governors of Japan's public broadcasting company, NHK, was quoted as saying the massacre never occurred. He said that there were isolated incidents of brutality but no widespread atrocity, and criticized the Tokyo Trials figure of 200,000.  Legacy   Effect on international relations  The memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino- Japanese relations since the early 1970s.Yuan 2004 Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually. Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust and animosity toward Japan that originates from the memory of Japanese war crimes such as the Nanjing Massacre. This sense of mistrust is strengthened by the belief that Japan is unwilling to admit to and apologize for the atrocities. Takashi Yoshida described how changing political concerns and perceptions of the \\"national interest\\" in Japan, China, and the U.S. have shaped collective memory of the Nanjing massacre. Yoshida contended that over time the event has acquired different meanings to different people. People from mainland China saw themselves as the victims. For Japan, it was a question they needed to answer, but were reluctant to do so because they too identified themselves as victims after the A-bombs. The U.S., which served as the melting pot of cultures and is home to descendants of members of both of Chinese and Japanese cultures, took up the mantle of investigator for the victimized Chinese. Yoshida has argued that the Nanjing Massacre has figured in the attempts of all three nations as they work to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.Yoshida, Takashi. The Making of the Rape of Nanking: History and Memory in Japan, China, and the United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pg. 5. Many Japanese prime ministers have visited the Yasukuni Shrine, a shrine for Japanese war deaths up until the end of the Second World War, which includes war criminals that were involved in the Nanjing Massacre. In the museum adjacent to the shrine, a panel informs visitors that there was no massacre in Nanjing, but that Chinese soldiers in plain clothes were \\"dealt with severely\\". In 2006 former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi made a pilgrimage to the shrine despite warnings from China and South Korea. His decision to visit the shrine regardless sparked international outrage. Although Koizumi denied that he was trying to glorify war or historical Japanese militarism, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Koizumi of \\"wrecking the political foundations of China-Japan relations\\". An official from South Korea said they would summon the Tokyo ambassador to protest.  As a component of national identity  Yoshida asserts that \\"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\\"  Japan  In Japan, the Nanjing Massacre touches upon national identity and notions of \\"pride, honor and shame\\". Yoshida argues that \\"Nanking crystallizes a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or ... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.\\" Recognizing the Nanjing Massacre as such can be viewed in some circles in Japan as \\"Japan bashing\\" (in the case of foreigners) or \\"self- flagellation\\" (in the case of Japanese). The government of Japan believes it can not be denied that the killing of a large number of noncombatants, looting and other acts by the Japanese army occurred. However, the actual number of victims is hard to determine, according to government of Japan. In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed. The range of the death toll estimated by Japanese historians is from tens of thousands to 200,000. According to a brief reference to Nanjing at the Yasukuni museum in Tokyo, the Japanese general in charge gave his men maps showing foreign settlements and a civilian \\"safety zone\\", and ordered them to maintain strict military discipline. The visitor is left to assume they did. The museum notes only that \\"Chinese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes, which numbered around 4000 were severely prosecuted\\". This nationalist view does not, however, represent a widely shared understanding of what happened at Nanjing, as illustrated by Japanese textbooks' rather different treatment of the atrocity. While the books' take on Nanjing is stilted and feels like the product of a committee, in various versions they acknowledge the deaths of thousands of Chinese including women and children, as well as looting, arson and assaults by Japanese soldiers. They do not mention sexual assaults. \\"During this period, when the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing it killed a large number of Chinese and carried out looting, arson and assaults. In regard to the number of victims of this Nanjing Massacre ... the Tokyo (War Crime) Trials later found it in excess of 200,000, and prosecuted Japan's responsibility severely\\", reads one Japanese textbook. Another history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which had been approved by the government in 2001, attempts to whitewash Japan's war record during the 1930s and early 1940s. It referred to the Nanjing massacre as an \\"incident\\", and glossed over the issue of comfort women. Indeed, there is only one sentence that refers to this event: \\"they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December.\\"  China  The Nanjing massacre has emerged as one fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity. Modern Chinese (including citizens of the PRC, Taiwan, and overseas) will refer to the Nanjing Massacre to explain certain stances they hold or ideas they have; this \\"national unifying event\\" holds true to middle-school educated peasants and to senior government officials alike.  Australia  Dockworkers in Australia were horrified at the massacre, and refused to load pig iron onto ships heading for Japan, leading to the Dalfram Dispute of 1938.Jones, Paul. \\"2001 ASSLH conference ‚Äì Chinese seamen and Australian labour: The mass desertion from the SS Silksworth at Newcastle, October 1937\\".

Long Expedition) was a military retreat undertaken by the Red Army of the Communist Party of China, the forerunner of the People's Liberation Army, to evade the pursuit of the Kuomintang (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party) army. There was not one Long March, but a series of marches, as various Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. The best known is the march from Jiangxi province which began in October 1934 and ended in Yan'an, Shaanxi province in October 1935. The First Front Army of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Generalissimo Chiang Kai- shek's troops in their stronghold in Jiangxi province. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers (5600 miles) over 370 days.Zhang, Chunhou. Vaughan, C. Edwin. [2002] (2002). Mao Zedong as Poet and Revolutionary Leader: Social and Historical Perspectives. Lexington books. . pg 65. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi. The Long March began the ascent to power of Mao Zedong, whose leadership during the retreat gained him the support of the members of the party. The bitter struggles of the Long March, which was completed by only about one-tenth of the force that left Jiangxi (about eight thousand of some hundred thousand), would come to represent a significant episode in the history of the Communist Party of China, and would seal the personal prestige of Mao Zedong and his supporters as the new leaders of the party in the following decades.

Background  The Red Army in 1934 Although the literal translation of the Chinese Ch√°ng Zhƒìng is \\"Long March\\", official publications of the People's Republic of China refer to it as \\"The Long March of the Red Army\\" (). The Long March most commonly refers to the transfer of the main group of the First (or Central) Red Army, which included the leaders of the Communist Party of China, from Yudu in the province of Jiangxi to Yan'an in Shaanxi. In this sense, the Long March lasted from October 16, 1934, to October 19, 1935. In a broader view, the Long March included two other forces retreating under pressure from the Kuomintang: the Second Red Army and the Fourth Red Army. The retreat of all the Red Armies was not complete until October 22, 1935, when the three forces linked up in Shaanxi. The divisions of the \\"Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ∑•Ëæ≤Á¥ÖËªç) were named according to historical circumstances, not by chronological order. Indeed, early Communist units would often form by defection from existing Kuomintang forces, and they kept their original designations. By the time of the Long March, numerous small units had been organized into three unified groups: the First Red Army (Á¥Ö‰∏ÄÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢‰∏ÄÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng Yƒ´ FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n), the Second Red Army (Á¥Ö‰∫åÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢‰∫åÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng √àr FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n), and the Fourth Red Army (Á¥ÖÂõõÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢ÂõõÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng S√¨ FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n).Peoples Liberation Army Daily (August 14, 2006) Notes Retrieved 2007-02-17 Some translations refer to these same units as the \\"First Front Red Army\\", \\"Second Front Red Army\\", and \\"Fourth Front Red Army\\" to distinguish them from earlier organizational divisions. The First Red Army formed from the First, Third and Fifth Army Groups in southern Jiangxi under the command of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. When several smaller units formed the Fourth Red Army under Zhang Guotao in the Sichuan‚ÄìShaanxi border area, no standard nomenclature of the armies of the Communist Party existed; moreover, during the Chinese Civil War, central control of separate Communist-controlled enclaves within China was limited. After the organization of these first two main forces, the Second Red Army formed in eastern Guizhou by unifying the Second and Sixth Army Groups under He Long and Xiao Ke. In this case, a \\"Third Red Army\\" was led by He Long, who established his base area in the Hunan‚ÄìHubei border. The defeat of his forces in 1932 led to a merge in October 1934 with the 6th Army Corps, led by Xiao Ke, to form the Second Red Army. These three armies would maintain their historical designation as the First, Second and Fourth Red Armies until Communist military forces were nominally integrated into the National Revolutionary Army, forming the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, during the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945.  Civil War  The Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded in 1921 by Chen Duxiu with Soviet support. The CCP initially collaborated with the Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang (KMT), founded by the revolutionary republican Sun Yat-sen. However, after the unexpected death of Sun in March 1925, a power struggle within the KMT led to the shift in the party's authority to Chiang Kai-shek, whose Northern Expedition forces succeeded in wresting control of large areas of China from local warlords and establishing a unified government in Nanjing in April 1927. Unlike other nationalist leaders, like Wang Jingwei, Chiang was opposed to the idea of continued collaboration with the Communist Party. The initial period of cooperation to unify China and end the unequal treaties broke up in April 1927 when Chiang Kai-shek struck out against the Communists. Unsuccessful urban insurrections (in Nanchang, Wuhan and Guangzhou) and the suppression of the Communist Party in Shanghai and other cities drove many party supporters to rural strongholds such as the Jiangxi Soviet, which was organized by Mao Zedong. By 1928, deserters and defecting Kuomintang army units, supplemented by peasants from the Communist rural soviets, formed the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The ideological confrontation between the CCP and the KMT soon evolved into the first phase of the Chinese Civil War. The Jiangxi Soviet By 1930, the Communist Red Army had established the Chinese Soviet Republic in the provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian around the city of Ruijin, including industrial facilities.Ruth Rogaski, PhD, in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006: Mao Zedong, III. Rise to Power (Retrieved November 25, 2006). Archived 2009-11-01. After the establishment of the Jiangxi Soviet, Mao's status within the Party declined. In 1930, Mao claimed a need to eliminate alleged KMT spies and Anti-Bolsheviks operating inside the Jiangxi Soviet and began an ideological campaign featuring torture and guilt by association, in order to eliminate his enemies. The campaign continued until the end of 1931, killing approximately 70,000 people and reducing the size of the Red Army from 40,000 to less than 10,000. The de facto leader of the party at the time, Zhou Enlai, originally supported Mao's purges as necessary to eliminate KMT spies. After Zhou arrived in Jiangxi in December 1931, he criticized Mao's campaigns for being directed more against anti-Maoists than legitimate threats to the Party, for the campaign's general senselessness, and for the widespread use of torture to extract confessions. During 1932, following Zhou's efforts to end Mao's ideological persecutions, the campaigns gradually subsided.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life.

Zhou's support was not enough, and Mao was demoted to being a figurehead in the Soviet government, until he regained his position later, during the Long March.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

Zhou at this time, apparently with strong support from Party and military colleagues, reorganized and standardized the Red Army. Under Zhou, Bo, and Braun, the Red Army defeated four attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops.Wilson 51 Chiang's fifth campaign was much more difficult to contain. In September 1933, the National Revolutionary Army under Chiang Kai-shek eventually completely encircled Jiangxi, with the advice and tactical assistance of his German adviser, Hans von Seeckt.Vercamer, Arvo. The German Military Mission to China: 1927‚Äì1938. (Retrieved November 23, 2006) A fortified perimeter was established by Chiang's forces, and Jiangxi was besieged in an attempt to destroy the Communist forces trapped within. In July 1934, the leaders of the Party, dominated by the \\"Twenty-Eight Bolsheviks\\", a militant group formed in Moscow by Wang Ming and Bo Gu, forced Mao from the Politburo of the Communist Party in Ruijin and placed him briefly under house arrest. Mao was replaced by Zhou Enlai as leader of the military commission. Chiang's strategy of slowly constructing a series of interlinking blockhouses (resembling medieval castles) was successful, and Chiang's army was able to capture several major Communist strongholds within months. Between January and March 1934, the Nationalists advanced slowly. Bo and Braun continued to employ orthodox military tactics, resulting in a series of Kuomintang advances and heavy Communist casualties. In October 1934 KMT troops won a decisive battle and drove deep into the heart of the Central Soviet Area. When Ruijin became exposed to KMT attack, Party leaders faced the choice of either remaining and perishing or of abandoning the base area and attempting to break through the enemy encirclement.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. pp.56‚Äì57 In August 1934, with the Red Army depleted by the prolonged conflict, a spy, Mo Xiong, who had been placed by Zhou Enlai in the KMT army headquarters in Nanchang, brought news that Chiang Kai-shek was preparing a major offensive against the Communist capital, Ruijin. The Communist leadership decided on a strategic retreat to regroup with other Communist units, and to avoid annihilation. The original plan was to link up with the Second Red Army commanded by He Long, thought to be in Hubei to the west and north. Communications between divided groups of the Red Army had been disrupted by the Kuomintang campaign. During the planning to evacuate Jiangxi, the First Red Army was unaware that these other Communist forces were also retreating westward. The Long March Escape from Jiangxi Since the Central Base Area could not be held, the Standing Committee appointed Bo (responsible for politics), Braun (responsible for military strategy), and Zhou (responsible for the implementation of military planning) to organize the evacuation. Since the enemy was close, Zhou, in charge of logistics, made his plans in complete secrecy. It was not disclosed who was to leave or when: even senior leaders were only at the last moments told of the Army's movements. It is not known what criteria were used to determine who would stay and who would go, but 16,000 troops and some of the Communists' most notable commanders at the time (including Xiang Ying, Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, and Qu Qiubai) were left to form a rear guard, to divert the main force of Nationalist troops from noticing, and preventing, the general withdrawal.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved at <> on March 12, 2011. pp.56‚Äì57 The first movements to screen the retreat were undertaken by forces led by Fang Zhimin, breaking through Kuomintang lines in June 1934. Although Fang Zhimin's troops were soon destroyed, these movements surprised the Kuomintang, who were numerically superior to the Communists at the time and did not expect an attack on their fortified perimeter. The early troop movements were actually a diversion to allow the retreat of more important leaders from Jiangxi. On October 16, 1934, a force of about 130,000 soldiers and civilians under Bo Gu and Otto Braun attacked the line of Kuomintang positions near Yudu. More than 86,000 troops, 11,000 administrative personnel and thousands of civilian porters actually completed the breakout; the remainder, largely wounded or ill soldiers, continued to fight a delaying action after the main force had left, and then dispersed into the countryside.Mao Zedong, On Tactics...: Note 26 retrieved 2007-02-17 Several prominent members of the Chinese Soviet who remained behind were captured and executed by the Kuomintang after the fall of Ruijin in November 1934, including Qu Qiubai and the youngest brother of Mao Zedong, Mao Zetan. Map drawn by the Red Army Command before the Battle of Xiangjiang The withdrawal began in early October 1934. Zhou's intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang's blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General Chen Jitang, a Guangdong warlord who Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting. Zhou sent Pan Hannian to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. p.58 The Red army successfully crossed the Xinfeng River and marched through the province of Guangdong and into Hunan before encountering the last of Chiang's fortifications at the Xiang River. After passing through three of the four blockhouse fortifications needed to escape Chiang's encirclement, the Red Army was finally intercepted by regular Nationalist troops, and suffered heavy casualties. Of the 86,000 Communists who attempted to break out of Jiangxi with the First Red Army, only 36,000 successfully escaped. Due to the low morale within the Red Army at the time, it is not possible to know what proportion of these losses were due to military casualties, and which proportion were due to desertion. The conditions of the Red Army's forced withdrawal demoralized some Communist leaders (particularly Bo Gu and Otto Braun), but Zhou remained calm and retained his command. Most Communist losses occurred over only two days of heavy fighting, from November 30 to December 1, 1934. Determining the direction of the Red Army After escaping Chiang's encirclement, it was obvious to Party leaders that Chiang was intent on intercepting what remained of the Red Army in Hunan, and the direction of the Red Army's movements had to be reconsidered. The plan to rendezvous and join He Long's army in Hunan had become too risky. Mao suggested to Zhou that the Red Army change direction, towards Guizhou, where Mao expected enemy defenses to be weak. A meeting at Tongdao, close to the border of Hunan and Guizhou, was convened to discuss the direction of the Red Army on December 12, 1934. Zhou endorsed Mao's proposal, encouraging other leaders to overrule the objections of Bo and Braun. Another dispute of the direction of the Red Army occurred soon after, once the Red Army reached Liping, in the mountains of southeast Guizhou. Braun believed that they should travel to eastern Guizhou, but Mao wanted to go to western Guizhou, where he expected KMT forces to be lighter and which borders Sichuan, and to establish a base area there. In a meeting to decide the army's direction, Zhou sided with Mao, making Braun \\"fly into a rage because he was overruled in the debate.\\" At the meeting it was decided that the Red Army would travel towards Zunyi, in western Guizhou.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved at <> on March 12, 2011. p.59 On January 1, 1935, the Red Army reached the Wu River. Bo and Braun again insisted the Red Army move back to western Hunan to join other Communist troops in the area, but their prestige had considerably declined by that point, and their suggestion was rejected. Even Zhou had become impatient, and proposed a new rule which was put into effect immediately: that all military plans had to be submitted to the Politburo for approval. The movement passed, clearly depriving Braun of the right to direct military affairs. On January 15 the Red Army captured Zunyi, the second largest city in Guizhou. As Mao had predicted, the city was weakly defended, and was too far from Nationalist forces to be under immediate threat of attack. By the time the Red Army occupied Zunyi, it was highly depleted, and counted little more than 10,000 men.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. pp.60‚Äì61 Zhou used the peace afforded in Zunyi to call an enlarged Politburo meeting, in order to examine the causes of the Communists' repeated defeats. The Zunyi Conference The Communists' Zunyi Conference lasted from January 15‚Äì17, 1935, and resulted in a reshuffling of the Party politburo. Zhou intended the conference to draw lessons from the Red Army's past failures, and to develop strategies for the future. Much of the discussion revolved around whether the defeats of the Red Army were due to unavoidable circumstances, or inadequacies of leadership. Bo Gu, the first speaker, attributed the Red Army's losses to \\"objective\\" causes, particularly the enemy's overwhelming numerical superiority, and poor coordination of Communist forces. Braun's interpreter, Wu Xiuquan, later recalled that Bo's arguments did not impress his audience, and that Bo came across as someone attempting to avoid responsibility. Zhou Enlai was the next to speak. Zhou blamed the Red Army's failures on poor decisions at the leadership level, and blamed himself as one of the three people most responsible. Zhou's willingness to accept responsibility was well received. Zhang Wentian, basing many of his conclusions on recent discussions with Mao, attacked Bo and Braun directly, criticizing them for numerous strategic and tactical errors.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. p.60 After Zhang, Mao gave a speech in which he analyzed the poor tactics and strategies of the two leaders. With Zhou's explicit backing, Mao won over the meeting. Seventeen of the meeting's twenty participants (the exceptions being Bo, Braun, and He Kequan) argued in his favor. Of the three leaders who had controlled the Party before the Zunyi Conference, only Zhou Enlai's political career survived. Zhou was held partially responsible for the Red Army's defeat, but was retained at the top level of Party leadership because of his differences with Bo and Braun at Ningdu, his successful tactics in defeating Chiang's fourth Encirclement Campaign, and his resolute support of Mao. Although the failed leadership of Bo Gu and Otto Braun was denounced, Mao was not able to win the support of a sufficient number of Party leaders to gain outright power at the conference. A major shift in the Party's leadership occurred two months later, in March 1935. Mao was passed over for the position of General Secretary by Zhang Wentian, but gained enough influence to be elected one of three members of Military Affairs Commission. The other two members were Zhou Enlai, who retained his position as Director of the Commission, and Wang Jiaxiang, whose support Mao had enlisted earlier. Within this group, Zhou was empowered to make the final decisions on military matters, while Mao was Zhou's assistant. Wang was in charge of Party affairs. Escaping Chiang's pursuit When the army resumed its march northward, the direct route to Sichuan was blocked by Chiang's forces. Mao's forces spent the next several months maneuvering to avoid direct confrontation with hostile forces, but still attempting to move north to join Zhang Guotao's Fourth Red Army.Chang and Halliday suggested that Mao delayed the move into Sichuan in order to consolidate his power before joining the other parts of the Red Army, and that rather than facing direct attack from Chiang's forces, Chiang was herding the Reds into Sichuan. (Chang, Halliday, Mao, The Unknown Story, pp 135‚Äì162). The work, however, has been criticized for lacking strong evidence. While Chiang's armies approached Mao in northern Guizhou from three directions, Mao maneuvered out of the encirclement by crossing the Chishui River four times. Then, Mao led the Red Army, crossing the Wu River and marching towards Guiyang. He feigned an attack to this city when Chiang was visiting. Chiang ordered his army in Kunming to move eastward to save Guiyang, but the Red Army turned towards Kunming immediately and entered Yunnan, where the Yangtze River was lightly guarded. In February 1935, Mao's wife, He Zizhen, gave birth to a daughter. Because of the harsh conditions, the infant was left with a local family (Two Europeans retracing the Long March route in 2003 met a woman in rural Yunnan province said by local officials to be Mao and He Zizhen's long-lost daughterGeorge Mason University, History News Network: Woman wonders whether she is Mao's abandoned Long March daughter (Retrieved 2007-03-15)). The Luding Bridge The Communist forces were harassed by both the Kuomintang and local warlords. To avoid a fatal confrontation, Zhou and Mao maneuvered the Red army south and west, through Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan, feigning attacks on Guiyang and Kunming to disguise their movements. The First Red Army crossed the Yangtze (the section of Jinsha River) on May 9, 1935, finally escaping determined pursuit, but still had to deal with dangerous mountain passes at heights of up to 4,000 meters, rough climatic conditions, shortages of food, clothing, and equipment, and tribes of local ethnic groups hostile to Chinese encroachment.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. p.61 The Red Army had to capture river crossings defended by warlords and Nationalist troops. The most famous was Luding Bridge, extolled in official history as an heroic triumph, although many historians now believe that the difficulty of the battle was exaggerated or that the incident was fabricated for propaganda purposes. Conflict with ethnic warlords Warlords often refused to help out the Kuomintang against the Communist Red Army, preferring to save their own forces. 300 \\"Khampa bandits\\" were enlisted into the Kuomintang's Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government of China to penetrate and destabilize the local Han warlords such as Liu Wenhui. The Chinese government sought to exercise full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to do battle with the Red Army, to save his own military from destruction. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Communist Red Army, but were defeated when their religious leader was captured by Communist forces. Communist forces on the Long March clashed against Kham rebels in the 1934 Khamba Rebellion, who were fleeing from Tibetan government forces. The Fourth Red Army In June‚ÄìJuly 1935, the troops under Mao united with the Fourth Red Army, led by Zhang Guotao, which had retreated west from Henan. Zhang had taken a different route of evacuation, and arrived at Lianghekou with 84,000 troops in relatively good condition. The fact that he had control of superior forces gave him the power to challenge the authority of Zhou and Mao, whose power was based largely on the Party's support. Zhang demanded that one of his own generals, Chen Changhao, take over Zhou's position as political commissar of the entire Red Army, and suggested that Zhang himself replace Zhu De on the Military Commission. Zhang argued that such a reorganization would create a more \\"equal\\" army organization. On July 18, Zhou relinquished his position as political commissar, and several leading positions were taken over by generals of the Fourth Red Army. These changes had no long-term significance because Zhang and Mao disagreed with the direction of the army. Zhang insisted on going southwest, while Mao insisted on going northwards, towards Shaanxi. No agreement was reached, and the two armies eventually split, each going their separate ways. Zhang Guotao's Fourth Red Army took a different route than Mao, travelling south, then west, and finally north through China. On the way Zhang's forces were largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his Chinese Muslim allies, the Ma clique. The remnants of Zhang's forces later rejoined elements of the Second Red Army before eventually linking up with Mao's forces in Shaanxi.New Long March 2: Fourth Front Army (Retrieved November 23, 2006) The Second Red Army Tiger Leaping Gorge in the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain massif of western Yunnan province The Second Red Army began its own withdrawal west from Hubei in November 1935, led by He Long, who commanded the KMT Twentieth Army in 1923 before joining the Communist Party of China (CPC). For retribution Chiang Kai-Shek had He Long's relatives executed, including three sisters and a brother. In 1932 he established a soviet in the Hunan-Jiangxi border area, and in August 1934 received command of the Second Red Army, establishing a base in Hubei. An advance party of the First Red Army, called the Sixth Corps, commanded by Xiao Ke, was sent towards the Second Red Army two months before the beginning of the Long March. Xiao Ke's force would link up with He Long and his army, but lost communication with the First Army that came behind. It was at this point that Li Zhen's unit was assigned to He Long's command, having already served in the Sixth Corps. On November 19, 1935, the Second Red Army set out on its own Long March. He Long's force was driven further west than the First Red Army, all the way to Lijiang in Yunnan province, then across the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain massif and through the Tibetan highlands of western Sichuan. He Long and Xiao Ke were married to sisters who also accompanied the army. He Long's wife, Jian Xianren, carried the baby daughter she had given birth to three weeks before the retreat began. Jian Xianfo gave birth to a son in the desolate swamps of northern Sichuan.China Daily (November 23, 2003): Stepping into history (Retrieved November 23, 2006) Forces of the Second Army detained two European missionaries, Rudolf Bosshardt and Arnolis Hayman, for 16 months.The New Long March, Photo Archive (January 5, 2005): Kidnapped!

Finally, in October 1935, Mao's army reached Shaanxi province and joined with local Communist forces there, led by Liu Zhidan, Gao Gang, and Xu Haidong, who had already established a Soviet base in northern Shaanxi.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

After an expedition of almost a year, the Second Red Army reached Bao'an (Shaanxi) on October 22, 1936, known in China as the \\"union of the three armies\\", and the end of the Long March. All along the way, the Communist Army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor. Nevertheless, only some 8,000 troops under Mao's command, the First Front Army, ultimately made it to the final destination of Yan'an in 1935. Of these, less than 7,000 were among the original 100,000 soldiers who had started the march. A variety of factors contributed to the losses including fatigue, hunger and cold, sickness, desertion, and military casualties. During the retreat, membership in the party fell from 300,000 to around 40,000. In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen. (After Zhang Gutao reached Shaanxi, Deng was replaced by Zhang). This marked Mao's position as the pre-eminent leader of the Party, with Zhou in a position second to Mao. Both Mao and Zhou would retain their positions until their deaths, in 1976. Aftermath A Communist leader addressing Long March survivors While costly, the Long March gave the Communist Party of China (CCP) the isolation it needed, allowing its army to recuperate and rebuild in the north. It also was vital in helping the CCP to gain a positive reputation among the peasants due to the determination and dedication of the surviving participants of the Long March. Mao wrote in 1935: > The Long March is a manifesto. It has proclaimed to the world that the Red > Army is an army of heroes, while the imperialists and their running dogs, > Chiang Kai-shek and his like, are impotent. It has proclaimed their utter > failure to encircle, pursue, obstruct and intercept us. The Long March is > also a propaganda force. It has announced to some 200 million people in > eleven provinces that the road of the Red Army is their only road to > liberation.Mao Zedong, in On Tactics against Japanese Imperialism (December > 27, 1935): \\"The Characteristics of the Present Political Situation\\" > (Retrieved November 25, 2006) In addition, policies ordered by Mao for all soldiers to follow, the Eight Points of Attention, instructed the army to avoid harm to or disrespect for the peasants, in spite of the desperate need for food and supplies. This policy won support for the Communists among the rural peasants. Hostilities ceased while the Nationalists and Chinese Communists formed a nominal alliance during the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 until 1945. During these years, the Chinese Communist Party persevered and strengthened its influence. The Red Army fought a disciplined and organized guerilla campaign* against superior Japanese forces, allowing it to gain experience. Following the end of World War II, the resurgent Communist Eighth Route Army, later called the People's Liberation Army, returned to drive the Kuomintang out of Mainland China to the island of Taiwan. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Long March has been glorified as an example of the Communist Party's strength and resilience. The Long March solidified Mao's status as the undisputed leader of the CCP, though he did not officially become party chairman until 1943. Other survivors of the March also went on to become prominent party leaders well into the 1990s, including Zhu De, Lin Biao, Liu Shaoqi, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, Yang Shangkun, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.

Historical controversies The Long March is surrounded by conflicting accounts of what occurred. Some critics and researchers call the earlier accounts myths, but find that they are difficult to prove or disprove because the Chinese government prevents independent historians from exploring the topic. The few who were able to perform research recently struggle with the fact that many years have gone by since the march took place. Many of the survivors are no longer alive or able to accurately recall events.Sun, Shuyun. \\"The Real Long March.\\" March 2, 2006.http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sun1/English (Retrieved April 2011). Length In 2003, controversy arose about the distance covered by Mao's First Front Army in the Long March.CNN (November 5, 2003): Mao's long March 'comes up short' (Retrieved November 25, 2006) The figure of 25,000 li (12,500 kilometres or about 8,000 miles) was Mao's estimate, quoted by his biographer Edgar Snow in Red Star Over China, published not long after the end of the Long March in 1938. In 2003, two British researchers, Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen, retraced the route in 384 days,Indo-Asian News Service (October 22, 2006): Retracing Mao's Long March (Retrieved November 23, 2006) and in their 2006 book \\"The Long March\\" estimated the March actually covered about 6,000 km (3,700 miles). Jocelyn and McEwen conclude in their book that \\"Mao and his followers twisted the tale of the Long March for their own ends. Mao's role was mythologized to the point where ... it seemed he had single-handedly saved the Red Army and defeated Chiang Kai-shek\\". Mao exaggerated, perhaps even doubled, the length of the march, they believe.

The official account of the battle depicts exhausted and depleted Communist forces in a desperate situation, where they must fight across a bridge that is guarded by the numerically superior forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his warlord allies. The Communists send a small volunteer force that braves a hail of gunfire to climb across the bridge on underlying chains and assault the enemy positions on the other side, hence securing the bridgehead for the rest of the army to cross. However, there is evidence that differs from the official account of the battle. This suggests that much of the fighting was dramatized, by Communist leaders, for propaganda purposes. Authors Andrew McEwen and Ed Jocelyn who retraced the route of the Long March, interviewing survivors along the way, said that a woman in her early 80s recalled that local people led the way across the bridge and were all shot and killed.The Economist Apr 27, 2006.\\"China's Long March: The Long and Winding Road.\\".

A slaughterhouse, also called abattoir (), is a facility where animals are slaughtered, most often (though not always) to provide food for humans. Slaughterhouses supply meat, which then becomes the responsibility of a packaging facility. Slaughterhouses that produce meat that is not intended to be eaten by humans are sometimes referred to as knacker's yards or knackeries. This is where animals are slaughtered that are not fit for human consumption or that can no longer work on a farm, such as retired work horses. Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant problems in terms of logistics, animal welfare, and the environment, and the process must meet public health requirements. Due to public aversion in many cultures, determining where to build slaughterhouses is also a matter of some consideration. Frequently, animal rights groups raise concerns about the methods of transport to and from slaughterhouses, preparation prior to slaughter, animal herding, and the killing itself. Terlouw, E., Arnould, C., Auperin, B., Berri, C., Le Bihan-Duval, E., Deiss, V., ... Mounier, L. (2008). \\"Pre-slaughter conditions, animal stress and welfare: Current status and possible future research\\". Animal 2 (10), p. 1501-1517. doi:10.1017/S1751731108002723 History In the slaughterhouse, Lovis Corinth, 1893. Until modern times, the slaughter of animals generally took place in a haphazard and unregulated manner in diverse places. Early maps of London show numerous stockyards in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air or under cover such as wet markets. A term for such open-air slaughterhouses was shambles, and there are streets named \\"The Shambles\\" in some English and Irish towns (e.g., Worcester, York, Bandon) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. Fishamble Street, Dublin was formerly a fish-shambles. Reform movement The slaughterhouse emerged as a coherent institution in the nineteenth century. A combination of health and social concerns, exacerbated by the rapid urbanisation experienced during the Industrial Revolution, led social reformers to call for the isolation, sequester and regulation of animal slaughter. As well as the concerns raised regarding hygiene and disease, there were also criticisms of the practice on the grounds that the effect that killing had, both on the butchers and the observers, \\"educate[d] the men in the practice of violence and cruelty, so that they seem to have no restraint on the use of it.\\" An additional motivation for eliminating private slaughter was to impose a careful system of regulation for the \\"morally dangerous\\" task of putting animals to death. Smithfield Market in 1855, before it was reconstructed. As a result of this tension, meat markets within the city were closed and abattoirs built outside city limits. An early framework for the establishment of public slaughterhouses was put in place in Paris in 1810, under the reign of the Emperor Napoleon. Five areas were set aside on the outskirts of the city and the feudal privileges of the guilds were curtailed. As the meat requirements of the growing number of residents in London steadily expanded, the meat markets both within the city and beyond attracted increasing levels of public disapproval. Meat had been traded at Smithfield Market as early as the 10th century. By 1726, it was regarded as \\"without question, the greatest in the world\\", by Daniel Defoe. By the middle of the 19th century, in the course of a single year 220,000 head of cattle and 1,500,000 sheep would be \\"violently forced into an area of five acres, in the very heart of London, through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares\\". Part of the original construction of the Smithfield Market in 1868. By the early 19th century, pamphlets were being circulated arguing in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the city due to the extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle. In 1843, the Farmer's Magazine published a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, aldermen, butchers and local residents against the expansion of the livestock market. An Act of Parliament was finally passed in 1852. Under its provisions, a new cattle-market was constructed in Copenhagen Fields, Islington. The new Metropolitan Cattle Market was also opened in 1855, and West Smithfield was left as waste ground for about a decade, until the construction of the new market began in the 1860s under the authority of the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act. The market was designed by architect Sir Horace Jones and was completed in 1868. A cut and cover railway tunnel was constructed beneath the market to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross.Snowhill (London Railways) accessed 13 April 2009 This allowed animals to be transported into the slaughterhouse by train and the subsequent transfer of animal carcasses to the Cold Store building, or direct to the meat market via lifts. At the same time, the first large and centralized slaughterhouse in Paris was constructed in 1867 under the orders of Napoleon III at the Parc de la Villette and heavily influenced the subsequent development of the institution throughout Europe. Regulation and expansion Blueprint for a mechanized public abattoir, designed by slaughterhouse reformer Benjamin Ward Richardson. These slaughterhouses were regulated by law to ensure good standards of hygiene, the prevention of the spread of disease and the minimization of needless animal cruelty. The slaughterhouse had to be equipped with a specialized water supply system to effectively clean the operating area of blood and offal. Veterinary scientists, notably George Fleming and John Gamgee, campaigned for stringent levels of inspection to ensure that epizootics such as rinderpest (a devastating outbreak of the disease covered all of Britain in 1865) would not be able to spread. By 1874, three meat inspectors were appointed for the London area, and the Public Health Act 1875 required local authorities to provide central slaughterhouses (they were only given powers to close unsanitary slaughterhouses in 1890). Yet the appointment of slaughterhouse inspectors and the establishment of centralised abattoirs took place much earlier in the British colonies, such as the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. In Victoria, for example, the Melbourne Abattoirs Act 1850 (NSW) \\"confined the slaughtering of animals to prescribed public abattoirs, while at the same time prohibiting the killing of sheep, lamb, pigs or goats at any other place within the city limits\\". Attempts were also made throughout the British Empire to reform the practice of slaughter itself, as the methods used came under increasing criticism for causing undue pain to the animals. The eminent physician, Benjamin Ward Richardson, spent many years in developing more humane methods of slaughter. He brought into use no fewer than fourteen possible anesthetics for use in the slaughterhouse and even experimented with the use of electric current at the Royal Polytechnic Institution. As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death relatively painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter. The invention of refrigeration and the expansion of transportation networks by sea and rail allowed for the safe exportation of meat around the world. Additionally, meat-packing millionaire Philip Danforth Armour's invention of the 'disassembly line' greatly increased the productivity and profit margin of the meat packing industry: \\"according to some, animal slaughtering became the first mass- production industry in the United States.\\" This expansion has been accompanied by increased concern about the physical and mental conditions of the workers along with controversy over the ethical and environmental implications of slaughtering animals for meat. Design In the latter part of the 20th century, the layout and design of most U.S. slaughterhouses was influenced by the work of Temple Grandin. She suggested that reducing the stress of animals being led to slaughter may help slaughterhouse operators improve efficiency and profit.Grandin, T. and Deesing, M. \\"Humane Livestock Handling\\" 2008. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA, USA. In particular she applied an understanding of animal psychology to design pens and corrals which funnel a herd of animals arriving at a slaughterhouse into a single file ready for slaughter. Her corrals employ long sweeping curves Why does a curved chute and round crowd pen work better than a straight one? As the animals go around the curve, they think they are going back to where they came from. The animals can not see people and other moving objects at the end of the chute. It takes advantage of the natural circling behaviour of cattle and sheep. Some of the design principles that are taught are the use of solid sides on chutes and crowd pens to prevent animals from seeing out with their wide-angle vision and layout of curved chutes and round crowd pens. Some people believe the animals can smell or hear death, however, and these may be area that need improvement, such as the use of scent masking agents or acoustical barriers. As well, some animals in some situations may grow to learn that after their fellows are corralled in that area, their fellows never return. An improvement could be made by detouring off some of the animals so that they return to the pack (after the odors and sounds are masked so they will return untraumatized). A circular crowd pen and a curved chute reduced the time spent moving cattle by up to 50% (Vowles and Hollier, 1982 [Vowles, W. J., and T. J. Hollier. 1982. The influence of yard design on the movement of animals. Proc. Aust. Soc. Anim. Prod. 14:597]). so that each animal is prevented from seeing what lies ahead and just concentrates on the hind quarters of the animal in front of it. This design ‚Äì along with the design elements of solid sides, solid crowd gate, and reduced noise at the end point ‚Äì work together to encourage animals forward in the chute and to not reverse direction. Cattle will move more easily through a curved race. Solid sides which prevent the cattle from seeing people and other distractions outside the fence should be installed on the chutes (races) and the crowd pen which leads up to the single file chute. The use of solid sides is especially important in slaughter plants, truck loading ramps, and other places where there is much activity outside the fence. Solid sides are essential in slaughter plants to block the animal's view of people and equipment. A curved chute (race) with solid sides at a ranch facility. It works better than a straight chute because cattle think they are going back to where they came from. The outer fence is solid to prevent the cattle from seeing distractions outside the fence... The facility must be located in a pasture that has no nearby equipment, moving vehicles or extra people, or put inside a building that has solid side walls. In many facilities, adding solid fences will improve animal movement... Solid sides in these areas help prevent cattle from becoming agitated when they see activity outside the fence -- such as people. Cattle tend to be calmer in a chute with solid sides. Cattle move more easily through the curved race system because they can not see people and other distractions ahead. , Grandin claimed to have designed over 54% of the slaughterhouses in the United States as well as many others around the world. Mobile design Beginning in 2008 the Local Infrastructure for Local Agriculture, a non-profit committed to revitalizing opportunities for \\"small farmers and strengthening the connection between local supply and demand\\", constructed a mobile slaughterhouse facility in efforts for small farmers to process meat quickly and cost effectively. Named the Modular Harvest System, or M.H.S., it received USDA approval in 2010. The M.H.S. consists of three separate trailers: One for slaughtering, one for consumable body parts, and one for other body parts. Preparation of individual cuts is done at a butchery or other meat preparation facility. International variations The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses vary considerably around the world. In many countries the slaughter of animals is regulated by custom and tradition rather than by law. In the non-Western world, including the Arab world, the Indian sub-continent, etc., both forms of meat are available: one which is produced in modern mechanized slaughterhouses, and the other from local butcher shops. In some communities animal slaughter and permitted species may be controlled by religious laws, most notably halal for Muslims and kashrut for Jewish communities. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering to the rules of religious preparation is located in some Western countries. In Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be stunned prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning where the shock is non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. The use of electronarcosis and other methods of dulling the sensing has been approved by the Egyptian Fatwa Committee. This allows these entities to continue their religious techniques while keeping accordance to the national regulations. In some societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved. In Japan, where the ban on slaughter of livestock for food was lifted in the late 19th century, the newly found slaughter industry drew workers primarily from villages of burakumin, who traditionally worked in occupations relating to death (such as executioners and undertakers). In some parts of western Japan, prejudice faced by current and former residents of such areas (burakumin \\"hamlet people\\") is still a sensitive issue. Because of this, even the Japanese word for \\"slaughter\\" (Â±†ÊÆ∫ tosatsu) is deemed politically incorrect by some pressure groups as its inclusion of the kanji for \\"kill\\" (ÊÆ∫) supposedly portrays those who practice it in a negative manner. Some countries have laws that exclude specific animal species or grades of animal from being slaughtered for human consumption, especially those that are taboo food. The former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee suggested in 2004 introducing legislation banning the slaughter of cows throughout India, as Hinduism holds cows as sacred and considers their slaughter unthinkable and offensive. This was often opposed on grounds of religious freedom. The slaughter of cows and the importation of beef into the nation of Nepal are strictly forbidden. Freezing works Refrigeration technology allowed meat from the slaughterhouse to be preserved for longer periods. This led to the concept as the slaughterhouse as a freezing works. Prior to this, canning was an option. Freezing works are common in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In countries where meat is exported for a substantial profit the freezing works were built near docks, or near transport infrastructure. Mobile poultry processing units (MPPUs) follow the same principles, but typically require only one trailer and, in much of the United States, may legally operate under USDA exemptions not available to red meat processors. Several MPPUs have been in operation since before 2010, under various models of operation and ownership. Law 147x147px Most countries have laws in regard to the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses. In the United States, there is the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, a law requiring that all swine, sheep, cattle, and horses be stunned unconscious with application of a stunning device by a trained person before being hoisted up on the line. There is some debate over the enforcement of this act. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as kosher shechita and dhabiha halal. Most strict interpretations of kashrut require that the animal be fully sensible when its carotid artery is cut. The novel The Jungle detailed unsanitary conditions, fictionalized, in slaughterhouses and the meatpacking industry during the 1800s. This led directly to an investigation commissioned directly by President Theodore Roosevelt, and to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which established the Food and Drug Administration. A much larger body of regulation deals with the public health and worker safety regulation and inspection. Worker exploitation concerns American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years, in the UK 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents. In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that \\"excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer\\" in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry. Working at slaughterhouses often leads to a high amount of psychological trauma. A 2016 study in Organization indicates, \\"Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior.\\" In her thesis submitted to and approved by University of Colorado, Anna Dorovskikh states that slaughterhouse workers are \\"at risk of Perpetration-Inducted Traumatic Stress, which is a form of posttraumatic stress disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation.\\" A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, \\"slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries.\\" As authors from the PTSD Journal explain, \\"These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD.\\" Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage. Animal welfare concerns In 1997, Gail Eisnitz, chief investigator for the Humane Farming Association (HFA), released a book Slaughterhouse. Within, she unveils the interviews of slaughterhouse workers in the U.S. who say that, because of the speed with which they are required to work, animals are routinely skinned while apparently alive and still blinking, kicking and shrieking. Eisnitz argues that this is not only cruel to the animals but also dangerous for the human workers, as cows weighing several thousands of pounds thrashing around in pain are likely to kick out and debilitate anyone working near them.Eisnitz, Gail A. Slaughterhouse. Prometheus Books, 1997, cited in Torres, Bob. Making a Killing. AK Press, 2007, p. 46. This would imply that certain slaughterhouses throughout the country are not following the guidelines and regulations spelled out by the Humane Slaughter Act, requiring all animals to be put down and thus insusceptible to pain by some form, typically electronarcosis, before undergoing any form of violent action. According to the HFA, Eiznitz interviewed slaughterhouse workers representing over two million hours of experience, who, without exception, told her that they have beaten, strangled, boiled and dismembered animals alive or have failed to report those who do. The workers described the effects the violence has had on their personal lives, with several admitting to being physically abusive or taking to alcohol and other drugs.\\"HFA Expos√© Uncovers Federal Crimes\\" , Humane Farming Association. Retrieved March 8, 2008. The HFA alleges that workers are required to kill up to 1,100 hogs an hour and end up taking their frustration out on the animals. Eisnitz interviewed one worker, who had worked in ten slaughterhouses, about pig production. He told her: Animal rights activists, anti-speciesists, vegetarians and vegans are prominent critics of slaughterhouses and have created events such as the March to close all slaughterhouses to voice concerns about the conditions in slaughterhouses and ask for their abolition. Some have gone so far as to argue that humane animal slaughter is impossible. Browning, H.; Veit, W. Is Humane Slaughter Possible?

Though the precise definition of cultural genocide remains contested, the Armenian Genocide Museum defines it as \\"acts and measures undertaken to destroy nations' or ethnic groups' culture through spiritual, national, and cultural destruction.\\" Some ethnologists, such as Robert Jaulin, use the term ethnocide as a substitute for cultural genocide, although this usage has been criticized as risking the confusion between ethnicity and culture. Juxtaposed next to ethnocide, cultural genocide was considered in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; however, it was removed in the final document and simply replaced with \\"genocide.\\" Definition  The legal definition of genocide is unspecific about the exact way in which genocide is committed, only stating that it is destruction with the intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group. As such, cultural genocide involves the eradication and destruction of cultural artifacts, such as books, artworks, and structures, as well as the suppression of cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer's notion of what is appropriate. Among many other potential reasons, cultural genocide may be committed for religious motives (e.g., iconoclasm); as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing in order to remove the evidence of a people from a specific locale or history; as part of an effort to implement a Year Zero, in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is \\"reset\\"; the suppression of an indigenous culture by invaders and colonisers, etc. History   Etymology  The notion of 'cultural genocide' has been acknowledged as early as 1944, when lawyer Raphael Lemkin distinguished a cultural component of genocide. The term itself would not emerge until later. The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to actions that destroy cultural heritage and tradition. It is also often misused as a catchphrase to condemn any form of destruction that the speaker disapproves of, without regard for the criterion of intent to destroy an affected group as such. Proposed inclusion in UN's DRIP Those who drafted the 1948 Genocide Convention initially considered using of the term, but later dropped it from inclusion. Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP) uses the phrase \\"cultural genocide\\" but does not define what it means. The complete article in the draft read as follows: :Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for: ::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities; ::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources; ::(c) Any form of population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights; ::(d) Any form of assimilation or integration by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures; ::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them. This wording only ever appeared in a draft. The DRIP‚Äîwhich was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its 62nd session at UN Headquarters in New York City on 13 September 2007‚Äîonly makes reference to genocide once, when it mentions \\"genocide, or any other act of violence\\" in Article 7. Though the concept of \\"ethnocide\\" and \\"cultural genocide\\" was removed in the version adopted by the General Assembly, the sub-points from the draft noted above were retained (with slightly expanded wording) in Article 8 that speaks to \\"the right not to be subject to forced assimilation.\\" List of cultural genocides  The term has been used to describe the destruction of cultural heritage in connection with various events: * The persecution of Bah√°'√≠s in Iran as a case of religious persecution has been called a cultural genocide. * In reference to the Axis powers (primarily, Nazi Germany)'s policies towards some nations during World War II (ex. the destruction of Polish culture). * In the Bosnian War during the Siege of Sarajevo, culturcide was committed by Bosnian Serb forces. The National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina was specifically targeted and besieged by cannons positioned all around the city. The National Library was completely destroyed in the fire, along with 80 percent of its contents. Some 3 million books destroyed, along with hundreds of original documents from the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. * The Stolen Generations in Australia where half-caste children were removed and bred with white people to destroy the race. * 2004 unrest in Kosovo. In an urgent appeal,Appeal from the extraordinary session of the Expanded Convocation of the Holy Synod of Serbian Orthodox Church issued on 18 March by the extraordinary session of the Expanded Convocation of the Holy Synod of Serbian Orthodox Church (), it was reported that a number of Serbian churches and shrines in Kosovo had been damaged or destroyed by rioters. At least 30 sites were completely destroyed, more or less destroyed, or further destroyed (sites that had been previously damaged). *Francoist Spain: the alleged prohibition of the use of minority languages such as Catalan in the public space, from schools to shops, public transport, or even in the streets, the banning of the use of Catalan birth names for children, the persecution and destruction of books in Catalan language, renaming of cities, streets and all toponyms from Catalan to Spanish, and the abolition of government and all cultural institutions in Catalonia, with the goal of total cultural suppression and assimilation.  John D. Hargreaves writes that \\"A policy of cultural genocide was implemented: the Catalan language and key symbols of Catalan independent identity and nationhood, such as the flag (the senyera), the national hymn ('Els Segadors') and the national dance (the sardana), were proscribed. Any sign of independence or opposition, in fact, was brutally suppressed. Catalan identity and consequently the Catalan nation were threatened with extinction.\\"  However, these allegations can be contested: Josep Pla and other Catalan authors published books in Catalan in the 1950s, and even there were prizes of Catalan Literature during Francoism like the Premi Sant Jordi de novel¬∑la. Other prominent case of popularization of Catalan was Joan Manuel Serrat: he could compose Catalan songs and gained certain notoriety. So there were no official repression on using the Catalan but a political one. * In reference to the newly-unified Vietnam after the end of the Vietnam War (particularly its policies towards South Vietnam). * The destruction by Azerbaijan of thousands of medieval Armenian gravestones at a cemetery in Julfa, and Azerbaijan's subsequent denial that the site had ever existed, has been cited as an example of cultural genocide. * Branch of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the German occupation of Poland and the Japanese occupation of Korea have also been cited as cases of cultural genocide. * In 1989, Robert Badinter, a French criminal lawyer known for his stance against the death penalty, used the term \\"cultural genocide\\" on a television show to describe what he said was the disappearance of Tibetan culture in the presence of the 14th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama would later use the term in 1993 and he would use it again in 2008. * Historian Jean Brownfield cited the 1638 Treaty of Hartford as a \\"clear and explicit historical example of a cultural genocide, in which the Pequot language and name were outlawed and there was a clearly stated intention that this cultural entity would simply cease to exist.\\"Dr. Jean F. Brownfield, \\"The Dark Pits of American History\\" (Forward; Ch. 3) *Armenian cultural heritage in Turkey. * Persecution of Native Hawaiian culture in annexed Hawaii *ISIL forced conversions in its territory and destroyed ancient Assyrian, Roman, Yazidi and Christian heritage sites and museums. *Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 2007, a Canadian Member of Parliament criticized the Ministry of Indian Affairs' destruction of documents that were evidence to the \\"cultural genocide\\" imposed on Indigenous peoples within Canada. The Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded that the Canadian Indian residential school system \\"can best be described as 'cultural genocide.'\\" In 2015, Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin, of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated in a speech to the Global Centre for Pluralism that Canada's historical treatment of Indigenous peoples was an attempt at cultural genocide, and \\"the worst stain on Canada's human-rights record.\\" *Hmong persecution in Laos. *Ireland has been described as enduring cultural genocide under British rule, which aimed to eradicate the Irish language, Irish culture, and the Catholic faith. Ireland's cultural genocide is discussed in the Dictionary of Genocide (2007), as well as by Christopher Murray (1997) in reference to the suppression of the Irish language; Hilary M. Carey (1997) in reference to the transportation of Irish convicts to Australia; and by Tom√°s Mac S√≠om√≥in (2018). *The Uyghur genocide in China. Reportedly, some one million members of China's Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps, termed \\"reeducation camps,\\" which are aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. Satellite evidence suggests that China has also razed more than two dozen Uyghur Muslim religious sites to the ground.

Among the earliest peoples to master mounted warfare, the Scythians replaced the Cimmerians as the dominant power on the Pontic Steppe in the 8th century BC. During this time they and related peoples came to dominate the entire Eurasian Steppe from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to Ordos Plateau in the east, \\"The Scythians, or Northern Iranians, who were culturally and ethnolinguistically a single group at the beginning of their expansion, had earlier controlled the entire steppe zone.\\" \\"The preservation of the earlier form. *Sakla. in the extreme eastern dialects supports the historicity of the conquest of the entire steppe zone by the Northern Iranians‚Äîliterally, by the 'Scythians'‚Äîin the Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age...\\" creating what has been called the first Central Asian nomadic empire. Based in what is modern- day Ukraine and southern Russia, the Scythians called themselves Scoloti and were led by a nomadic warrior aristocracy known as the Royal Scythians. In the 7th century BC, the Scythians crossed the Caucasus and frequently raided the Middle East along with the Cimmerians, playing an important role in the political developments of the region. Around 650‚Äì630 BC, Scythians briefly dominated the Medes of the western Iranian Plateau, stretching their power to the borders of Egypt. After losing control over Media, the Scythians continued intervening in Middle Eastern affairs, playing a leading role in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire in the Sack of Nineveh in 612 BC. The Scythians subsequently engaged in frequent conflicts with the Achaemenid Empire. The Scythians suffered a major defeat against Macedonia in the 4th century BC and were subsequently gradually conquered by the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to their east. In the late 2nd century BC, their capital at Scythian Neapolis in the Crimea was captured by Mithradates VI and their territories incorporated into the Bosporan Kingdom. By this time they had been largely Hellenized. By the 3rd century AD, the Sarmatians and last remnants of the Scythians were dominated by the Alans, and were being overwhelmed by the Goths. By the early Middle Ages, the Scythians and the Sarmatians had been largely assimilated and absorbed by early Slavs. \\"Indeed, it is now accepted that the Sarmatians merged in with pre-Slavic populations.\\" \\"In their Ukrainian and Polish homeland the Slavs were intermixed and at times overlain by Germanic speakers (the Goths) and by Iranian speakers (Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans) in a shifting array of tribal and national configurations.\\" The Scythians were instrumental in the ethnogenesis of the Ossetians, who are believed to be descended from the Alans. The Scythians played an important part in the Silk Road, a vast trade network connecting Greece, Persia, India and China, perhaps contributing to the contemporary flourishing of those civilisations. Settled metalworkers made portable decorative objects for the Scythians. These objects survive mainly in metal, forming a distinctive Scythian art. The name of the Scythians survived in the region of Scythia. Early authors continued to use the term \\"Scythian\\", applying it to many groups unrelated to the original Scythians, such as Huns, Goths, T√ºrks, Avars, Khazars, and other unnamed nomads. \\"Greek authors... frequently applied the name Scythians to later nomadic groups who had no relation whatever to the original Scythians\\" The scientific study of the Scythians is called Scythology. Names Etymology Linguist Oswald Szemer√©nyi studied synonyms of various origins for Scythian and differentiated the following terms: Skuthes Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏Œ∑œÇ, Skudra, Sug(u)da and Saka. * Skuthes Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏Œ∑œÇ, Skudra, Sug(u)da descended from the Indo-European root (s)kewd-, meaning \\"propel, shoot\\" (cognate with English shoot). *skud- is the zero-grade form of the same root. Szemer√©nyi restores the Scythians' self-name as *skuda (roughly \\"archer\\"). This yields the Ancient Greek Skuthƒìs Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏Œ∑œÇ (plural Skuthai Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏Œ±Œπ) and the Assyrian A≈°kuz. The Old Armenian: skiwt ∞ is based on itacistic Greek. A late Scythian sound change from /d/ to /l/ established the Greek word Skolotoi (Œ£Œ∫œéŒªŒøœÑŒøŒπ), from the Scythian *skula which, according to Herodotus, was the self-designation of the Royal Scythians. Other sound changes have produced Sogdia. * The term Saka reflected in Old Persian: SakƒÅ, Greek: ; Latin: Sacae, Sanskrit: ≈öaka comes from an Iranian verbal root sak-, \\"go, roam\\" and thus means \\"nomad\\". Although closely related, the Saka people are nomadic Iranians, that are to be distinguished from the Scythians and inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin. Exonyms The name Scythian is derived from the name used for them by the ancient Greeks. Iskuzai or Askuzai was the name given them by the Assyrians. The ancient Persians used the term Saka for all nomads of the Eurasian Steppe, including the Scythians. Ethnonyms Herodotus said the ruling class of the Scythians, whom he referred to as the Royal Scythians, called themselves Skolotoi. Modern terminology In scholarship, the term Scythians generally refers to the nomadic Iranian people who dominated the Pontic steppe from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC. The Scythians share several cultural similarities with other populations living to their east, in particular similar weapons, horse gear and Scythian art, which has been referred to as the Scythian triad. \\"Even though there were fundamental ways in which nomadic groups over such a vast territory differed, the terms \\"Scythian\\" and \\"Scythic\\" have been widely adopted to describe a special phase that followed the widespread diffusion of mounted nomadism, characterized by the presence of special weapons, horse gear, and animal art in the form of metal plaques. Archaeologists have used the term \\"Scythic continuum\\" in a broad cultural sense to indicate the early nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe. The term \\"Scythic\\" draws attention to the fact that there are elements - shapes of weapons, vessels, and ornaments, as well as lifestyle - common to both the eastern and western ends of the Eurasian steppe region. However, the extension and variety of sites across Asia makes Scythian and Scythic terms too broad to be viable, and the more neutral \\"early nomadic\\" is preferable, since the cultures of the Northern Zone cannot be directly associated with either the historical Scythians or any specific archaeological culture defined as Saka or Scytho-Siberian.\\" Cultures sharing these characteristics have often been referred to as Scythian cultures, and its peoples called Scythians. \\"The term 'Scythic' has been used above to denote a group of basic traits which characterize material culture from the fifth to the first century B.C. in the whole zone stretching from the Transpontine steppe to the Ordos, and without ethnic connotation. How far nomadic populations in central Asia and the eastern steppes may be of Scythian, Iranic, race, or contain such elements makes a precarious speculation.\\" Peoples associated with Scythian cultures include not only the Scythians themselves, who were a distinct ethnic group, \\"Horse-riding nomadism has been referred to as the culture of 'Early Nomads'. This term encompasses different ethnic groups (such as Scythians, Saka, Massagetae, and Yuezhi)...\\" but also Cimmerians, Massagetae, Saka, Sarmatians and various obscure peoples of the forest steppe, such as early Slavs, Balts and Finno-Ugric peoples. Within this broad definition of the term Scythian, the actual Scythians have often been distinguished from other groups through the terms Classical Scythians, Western Scythians, European Scythians or Pontic Scythians. Scythologist Askold Ivantchik notes with dismay that the term \\"Scythian\\" has been used within both a broad and a narrow context, leading to a good deal of confusion. He reserves the term \\"Scythian\\" for the Iranian people dominating the Pontic steppe from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC. Nicola Di Cosmo writes that the broad concept of \\"Scythian\\" is \\"too broad to be viable\\", and that the term \\"early nomadic\\" is preferable. History Origins =Literary evidence= Greek historian Herodotus is the most important literary source on the origins of the Scythians The Scythians first appeared in the historical record in the 8th century BC. Herodotus reported three contradictory versions as to the origins of the Scythians, but placed greatest faith in this version:, 4.11 Herodotus presented four different versions of Scythian origins: # Firstly (4.7), the Scythians' legend about themselves, which portrays the first Scythian king, Targitaus, as the child of the sky-god and of a daughter of the Dnieper. Targitaus allegedly lived a thousand years before the failed Persian invasion of Scythia, or around 1500 BC. He had three sons, before whom fell from the sky a set of four golden implements ‚Äì a plough, a yoke, a cup and a battle-axe. Only the youngest son succeeded in touching the golden implements without them bursting with fire, and this son's descendants, called by Herodotus the \\"Royal Scythians\\", continued to guard them. # Secondly (4.8), a legend told by the Pontic Greeks featuring Scythes, the first king of the Scythians, as a child of Hercules and Echidna. # Thirdly (4.11), in the version which Herodotus said he believed most, the Scythians came from a more southern part of Central Asia, until a war with the Massagetae (a powerful tribe of steppe nomads who lived just northeast of Persia) forced them westward. # Finally (4.13), a legend which Herodotus attributed to the Greek bard Aristeas, who claimed to have got himself into such a Bachanalian fury that he ran all the way northeast across Scythia and further. According to this, the Scythians originally lived south of the Rhipaean mountains, until they got into a conflict with a tribe called the Issedones, pressed in their turn by the \\"one- eyed Arimaspians\\"; and so the Scythians decided to migrate westwards. Accounts by Herodotus of Scythian origins has been discounted recently; although his accounts of Scythian raiding activities contemporary to his writings have been deemed more reliable. \\"Ever since critical history began, scholars have recognized that much of what Herodotos gives us is silly.\\" =Archaeological evidence= Modern interpretation of historical, archaeological and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on Scythian origins. The first hypothesis, formerly more espoused by Soviet and then Russian researchers, roughly followed Herodotus' (third) account, holding that the Scythians were an Eastern Iranian-speaking group who arrived from Inner Asia, i.e. from the area of Turkestan and western Siberia. The second hypothesis, according to Roman Ghirshman and others, proposes that the Scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the Srubna culture at the Black Sea coast, although this is also associated with the Cimmerians. According to Pavel Dolukhanov this proposal is supported by anthropological evidence which has found that Scythian skulls are similar to preceding findings from the Srubna culture, and distinct from those of the Central Asian Saka. Yet, according to J. P. Mallory, the archaeological evidence is poor, and the Andronovo culture and \\"at least the eastern outliers of the Timber- grave culture\\" may be identified as Indo-Iranian. =Genetic evidence= In 2017, a genetic study of the Scythians suggested that the Scythians were ultimately descended from the Yamna culture, and emerged on the Pontic steppe independently of peoples belonging to Scythian cultures further east. Based on the analysis of mithocondrial lineages, another later 2017 study suggested that the Scythians were directly descended from the Srubnaya culture. A later analysis of paternal lineages, published in 2018, found significant genetic differences between the Srubnaya and the Scythians, suggesting that the Srubnaya and the Scythians instead traced a common origin in the Yamnaya culture, with the Scythians and related peoples such as the Sarmatians perhaps tracing their origin to the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppes and the southern Urals. Another 2019 study also concluded that migrations must have played a part in the emergence of the Scythians as the dominant power of the Pontic steppe. Early history Gold Scythian belt title, Mingachevir (ancient Scythian kingdom), Azerbaijan, 7th century BC Herodotus provides the first detailed description of the Scythians. He classes the Cimmerians as a distinct autochthonous tribe, expelled by the Scythians from the northern Black Sea coast (Hist. 4.11‚Äì12). Herodotus also states (4.6) that the Scythians consisted of the Auchatae, Catiaroi, Traspians, and Paralatae or \\"Royal Scythians\\". In the early 7th century BC, the Scythians and Cimmerians are recorded in Assyrian texts as having conquered Urartu. In the 670s, the Scythians under their king Bartatua raided the territories of the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrian king Esarhaddon managed to make peace with the Scythians by marrying of his daughter to Bartatua and by paying a large amount of tribute. Bartatua was succeeded by his son Madius ca. 645 BC, after which they launched a great raid on Palestine and Egypt. Madius subsequently subjugated the Median Empire. During this time, Herodotus notes that the Scythians raided and exacted tribute from \\"the whole of Asia\\". In the 620s, Cyaxares, leader of the Medes, treacherously killed a large number of Scythian chieftains had a feast, the Scythians subsequently driven back to the steppe. In 612 BC, the Medes and Scythians participated in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire with the Battle of Nineveh. During this period of influence in the Middle East, the Scythians became heavily influenced by the local civilizations. In the 6th century BC, the Greeks had began establishing settlements along the coasts and rivers of the Pontic steppe, coming in contact with the Scythians. Relations between the Greeks and the Scythians appear to have been peaceful, with the Scythians being substantially influenced by the Greeks, although the city of the Panticapaeum might have been destroyed by the Scythians in the mid century BC. During this time, the Scythian philosopher Anacharsis traveled to Athens, where he made a great impression on the local people with his \\"barbarian wisdom\\". War with Persia Reliefs depicting the soldiers of the Achaemenid army, Xerxes I tomb, circa 480 BCE. The Achaemenids referred to all nomads to their north as Saka, and divided them into three categories: The SakƒÅ tayai paradraya (\\"beyond the sea\\", presumably the Scythians), the SakƒÅ tigraxaudƒÅ (‚Äúwith pointed caps‚Äù), and the SakƒÅ haumavargƒÅ (\\"Hauma drinkers\\", furthest East). By the late 6th century BC, the Archaemenid king Darius the Great had built Persia into becoming the most powerful empire in the world, stretching from Egypt to India. Planning an invasion of Greece, Darius first sought to secure his northern flank against Scythian introads. Thus, Darius declared war on the Scythians. At first, Darius sent his Cappadocian satrap Ariamnes with a vast fleet (estimated at 600 ships by Herodotus) into Scythian territory, where several Scythian nobles were captured. He then built a bridge across the Bosporus and easily defeated the Thracians, crossing the Danube into Scythian territory with a large army (700,000 men if one is to believe Herodotus) in 512 BC. At this time Scythians were separated into three major kingdoms, with the leader of the largest tribe, King Idanthyrsus, being the supreme ruler, and his subordinate kings being Scopasis and Taxacis. Unable to receive support from neighboring nomadic peoples against the Persians, the Scythians evacuated their civilians and livestock to the north and adopted a scorched earth strategy, while simultaneously harassing the extensive Persian supply lines. Suffering heavy losses, the Persians reached as far as the Sea of Azov, until Darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with Idanthyrsus, which however broke down. Darius and his army eventually reatreated across the Danube back into Persia, and the Scythians thereafter earned a reputation of invincibility among neighboring peoples. Golden Age In the aftermath of the their defeat of the Persian invasion, Scythian power grew considerably, and they launched campaigns against their Thracian neighbors in the west. In 496 BC, the Scythians launched an great expedition into Thrace, reaching as far as Chersonesos. During this time they negotiated an alliance with the Achaemenid Empire against the Spartan king Cleomenes I. A prominent king of the Scythians in the 5th century was Scyles. The Scythian offensive against the Thracians was checked by the Odrysian kingdom. The border between the Scythians and the Odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the Danube, and relations between the two dynasties were good, with dynastic marriages frequently occurring. The Scythians also expanded towards the north- west, where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations. A similar fate was suffered by the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast and parts of the Crimea, over which the Scythians established political control. Greek settlements along the Don River also came under the control of the Scythians. A division of responsibility developed, with the Scythians holding the political and military power, the urban population carrying out trade, and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor. Their territories grew grain, and shipped wheat, flocks, and cheese to Greece. The Scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the slave trade from the north to Greece through the Greek Black Sea colonial ports of Olbia, Chersonesos, Cimmerian Bosporus, and Gorgippia. When Herodotus wrote his Histories in the 5th century BC, Greeks distinguished Scythia Minor, in present-day Romania and Bulgaria, from a Greater Scythia that extended eastwards for a 20-day ride from the Danube River, across the steppes of today's East Ukraine to the lower Don basin. Scythian offensives against the Greek colonies of the northeastern Black Sea coast were largely unsuccessful, as the Greeks united under the leadership of the city of Panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence. These Greek cities developed into the Bosporan Kingdom. Meanwhile, several Greek colonies formerly under Scythian control began to reassert their independence. It is possible that the Scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time. By the mid 4th century BC, the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to the east of the Scythians, began expanding into Scythian territory. Scythian king Skilurus, relief from Scythian Neapolis, Crimea, 2nd century BC The 4th century BC was a flowering of Scythian culture. The Scythian king Ateas managed to unite under his power the Scythian tribes living between the Maeotian marshes and the Danube, while simultaneously enroaching upon the Thracians. He conquered territories along the Danube as far the Sava river and established a trade route from the Black Sea to the Adriatic, which enabled a flourishing of trade in the Scythian kingdom. The westward expansion of Ateas brought him into conflict with Philip II of Macedon (reigned 359 to 336 BC), with whom he had previously been allied, who took military action against the Scythians in 339 BC. Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated. Philip's son, Alexander the Great, continued the conflict with the Scythians. In 331 BC, his general Zopyrion invaded Scythian territory with a force of 30,000 men, but was routed and killed by the Scythians near Olbia. Decline In the aftermath of conflict between Macedon and the Scythians, the Celts seem to have displaced the Scythians from the Balkans; while in south Russia, a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 310-309 BC, as noted by Diodorus Siculus, the Scythians, in alliance with the Bosporan Kingdom, defeated the Siraces in a great battle at the river Thatis. By the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian culture of the Pontic steppe suddenly disappears. The reasons for this are controversial, but the expansion of the Sarmatians certainly played a role. The Scythians in turn shifted their focus towards the Greek cities of the Crimea. The territory of the Scythae Basilaei (\\"Royal Scyths\\") along the north shore of the Black Sea around 125 AD. By ca. 200 BC, the Scythians had largely withdrawn into the Crimea. By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea, centered at Scythian Neapolis near modern Simferopol. They had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations, in particular the Tauri, and were also subjected to Hellenization. They maintained close relations with the Bosporan Kingdom, with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage. A separate Scythian territory, known as Scythia Minor, existed in modern-day Dobruja, but was of little significance. In the 2nd century BC, the Scythian kings Skilurus and Palakus sought to exent their control over the Greek cities of north of the Black Sea. The Greek cities of Chersonesus and Olbia in turn requested the aid Mithridates the Great, king of Pontus, whose general Diophantus defeated their armies in battle, took their capital and annexed their territory to the Bosporan Kingdom. After this time, the Scythians practically disappeared from history. Scythia Minor was also defeated by Mithradates. In the years after the death of Mithradates, the Scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations. They made a resurgence in the 1st century AD and laid siege to Chersonesos, who were obliged to seek help from the Roman Empire. The Scythians were in turn defeated by Roman commander Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus. By the 2nd century AD, archaeological evidence show that the Scythians had been largely assimilated by the Sarmatians. Their capital city, Scythian Neapolis, was destroyed by the invading Goths in the mid-3rd century AD. Archaeology Scythian defence line 339 BC reconstruction in Polg√°r, Hungary Archaeological remains of the Scythians include kurgan tombs (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate \\"Royal kurgans\\" containing the \\"Scythian triad\\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), gold, silk, and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected human sacrifices. Mummification techniques and permafrost have aided in the relative preservation of some remains. Scythian archaeology also examines the remains of cities and fortifications. Scythian archaeology can be divided into three stages: * Early Scythian ‚Äì from the mid-8th or the late 7th century BC to about 500 BC * Classical Scythian or Mid-Scythian ‚Äì from about 500 BC to about 300 BC * Late Scythian ‚Äì from about 200 BC to the mid 3rd century CE, in the Crimea and the Lower Dnieper, by which time the population was settled. Early Scythian In the south of Eastern Europe, Early Scythian culture replaced sites of the so-called Novocherkassk type. The date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists. Dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 7th century BC have been proposed. A transition in the late 8th century has gained the most scholarly support. The origins of the Early Scythian culture is controversial. Many of its elements are of Central Asian origin, but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the Pontic steppe, partially through the influence of North Caucasian elements and to a smaller extent the influence of Near Eastern elements. The period in the 8th and 7th centuries BC when the Cimmerians and Scythians raided the Near East are ascribed to the later stages of the Early Scythian culture. Examples of Early Scythian burials in the Near East include those of Nor≈üuntepe and ƒ∞mirler. Objects of Early Scythian type have been found in Urartian fortresses such as Teishebaini, Bastam and Ayanis-kale. Near Eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by Near Eastern craftsmen on behalf of Scythian chieftains. An arm from the throne of a Scythian king, 7th century BC. Found at the Kerkemess kurgan, Krasnodar Krai in 1905. On exhibit at the Hermitage Museum Early Scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites, because the Scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements. The most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of Scythian territories in the forest steppes of the Dnieper, and the southeastern parts of Scythian territories in the North Caucasus. At this time it was common for the Scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories. Early Scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations. Kurgans from the Early Scythian culture have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Some if these are characterized by great wealth, and probably belonged royals of aristocrats. They contain not only the deceased, but also horses and even chariots. The burial rituals carried out in these kurgans correspond closely with those described by Herodotus. The greatest kurgans from the Early Scythian culture in the North Caucasus are found at Kelermesskaya, Novozavedennoe II (Ulsky Kurgans) and Kostromskaya. One kurgan at Ulsky was found measured at 15 meters in height and contained more than 400 horses. Kurgans from the 7th century BC, when the Scythians were raiding the Near East, typically contain objects of Near Eastern origin. Kurgans from the late 7th century however, contain few Middle Eastern objects, but rather objects of Greek origin, pointing to increased contacts between the Scythians and Greek colonists. Important Early Scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the Dnieper. The most important of these finds is the Melgunov Kurgan. This kurgan contains several objects of Near Eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in Kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop. Most of the Early Scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the Dnieper and its tributaries. The funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the North Caucasus. Important Early Scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the North Caucasus and the forest steppes. These include the Krivorozhskiƒ≠ kurgan on the eastern banks of the Donets, and the Temir-gora kurgan in the Crimea. Both date to the 7th century BC and contain Greek imports. The Krivorozhskiƒ≠ also display Near Eastern influences. The famous gold stag of Kostromskaya, Russia Apart from funerary sites, numerous settlements from the Early Scythian period have been discovered. Most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non- fortified. The most important of these sites in the Dnieper area are Trakhtemirovo, Motroninskoe and Pastyrskoe. East of these, at the banks of the Vorskla River, a tributary of the Dnieper, lies the Bilsk settlement. Occupying an area of 4,400 hectares with an outer rampart at over 30 km, Bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone. It has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by Boris Shramko as the site of Gelonus, the purported capital of Scythia. Another important large settlement can be found at Myriv. Dating from the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Myriv contains a significant amount of imported Greek objects, testifying to lively contacts with Borysthenes, the first Greek colony established on the Pontic steppe (ca. 625 BC). Within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings, which were probably occupied by nomadic Scythians seasonally visiting the sites. The Early Scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the 6th century BC. Classical Scythian Distribution of Scythian kurgans and other sites along the Dnieper Rapids during the Classical Scythian period By the end of the 6th century BC, a new period begins in the material culture of the Scythians. Certain scholars consider this a new stage in the Scythian culture, while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture. It is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east, who intermingled with the local Scythians. The Classical Scythian period saw major changes in Scythian material culture, both with regards to weapons and art style. This was largely through Greek influence. Other elements had probably been brought from the east. Like in Early Scythian culture, the Classical Scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites. The area of distribution of these sites has however changed. Most of them, including the richest, are located on the Pontic steppe, in particular the area around the Dnieper Rapids. At the end of the 6th century BC, new funerary rites appeared, characterized by more complex kurgans. This new style was rapidly adopted throughout Scythian territory. Like before, elite burials usually contained horses. A buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage. Burials containing both males and females are quite common both in elite burials and in the burials of the common people. The most important Scythian kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture in the 6th and 5th centuries BC are Ostraya Tomakovskaya Mogila, Zavadskaya Mogila 1, Novogrigor‚Äôevka 5, Baby and Raskopana Mogila in the Dnieper Rapids, and the Zolotoi and Kulakovskiƒ≠ kurgans in the Crimea. The greatest, so-called \\"royal\\" kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture are dated to the 4th century BC. These include Solokha, Bol‚Äôshaya Cymbalka, Chertomlyk, Oguz, Alexandropol and Kozel. The second greatest, so-called \\"aristocratic\\" kurgans, include Berdyanskiƒ≠, Tolstaya Mogila, Chmyreva Mogila, Five Brothers 8, Melitopolsky, Zheltokamenka and Krasnokutskiƒ≠. Kozel Kurgans Excavation at kurgan Sengileevskoe-2 found gold bowls with coatings indicating a strong opium beverage was used while cannabis was burning nearby. The gold bowls depicted scenes showing clothing and weapons. By the time of Classical Scythian culture, the North Caucasus appears to no longer be under Scythian control. Rich kurgans in the North Caucasus have been found at the Seven Brothers Hillfort, Elizavetovka and Ulyap, but although they contain elements of Scythian culture, these probably belonged to an unrelated local population. Rich kurgans of the forest steppe zone from the 5th and 4th centuries BC have been discovered at places such as Ryzhanovka, but these are not as grand as the kurgans of the steppe further south. Funerary sites with Scythian characteristics have also been discovered in several Greek cities. These include several unusually rich burials such as Kul-Oba (near Panticapaeum in the Crimea) and the necropolis of Nymphaion. The sites probably represent Scythian aristocrats who had close ties, if not family ties, with the elite of Nymphaion and aristocrats, perhaps even royals, of the Bosporan Kingdom. In total, more than 3,000 Scythian funerary sites from the 4th century BC have been discovered on the Pontic steppe. This number far exceeds the number of all funerary sites from previous centuries. Apart from funerary sites, remains of Scythian cities from this period have been discovered. These include both continuations from the Early Scythian period and newly founded settlements. The most important of these is the settlement of Kamenskoe on the Dniepr, which existed from the 5th century to the beginning of the 3rd century BC. It was a fortified settlement occupying an area of 12 square km. The chief occupation of its inhabitants appears to have been metalworking, and the city was probably an important supplier of metalwork for the nomadic Scythians. Part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists. It is likely that Kamenskoe also served as a political center in Scythia. A significant part of Kamenskoe was not built up, perhaps to set it aside for the Scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city. J√°nos Harmatta suggests that Kamenskoe served as a residence for the Scythian king Ateas. By the 4th century, it appears that some of the Scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes. As a result, a number of fortified and non-fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower Dnieper. Part of the settled inhabitants of Olbia were also of Scythian origin. Classical Scythian culture lasts until the late 4th century or early 3rd century BC. Late Scythian Remains of Scythian Neapolis near modern-day Simferopol, Crimea. It served as a political center of the Scythians in the Late Scythian period. The last period in the Scythian archaeological culture is the Late Scythian culture, which existed in the Crimea and the Lower Dnieper from the 3rd century BC. This area was at the time mostly settled by Scythians. Archaeologically the Late Scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors. It represents a fusion of Scythian traditions with those of the Greek colonists and the Tauri, who inhabited the mountains of the Crimea. The population of the Late Scythian culture was mainly settled, and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture. They were also important traders, serving as intermediaries between the classical world and the barbarian world. Recent excavations at Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe implies that this site was the political center of the Scythians in the 3rd century BC and the early part of the 2nd century BC. It was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with Greek principles. The most important site of the Late Crimean culture is Scythian Neaoplis, which was located in Crimea and served as the capital of the Late Scythian kingdom from the early 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Scythian Neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with Greek principles. Its royal palace was destroyed by Diophantus, a general of the Pontic king Mithridates VI, at the end of the 2nd century BC, and was not rebuilt. The city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center. It underwent significant change from the 1st century to the 2nd century AD, eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications. New funerary rites and material features also appear. It is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the Scythians by the Sarmatians. A certain continuity is however observable. From the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century AD, Scythian Neapolis transforms into a non-fortified settlement containing only a few buildings. Apart from Scythian Neapolis and Ak- Kaya/Vishennoe, more than 100 fortified and non-fortified settlements from the Late Scythian culture have been discovered. They are often accompanied by a necropolis. Late Scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the Crimean mountains and along the western coast of the Crimea. Some of these settlements had earlier been Greek settlements, such as Kalos Limen and Kerkinitis. Many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports. The largest Scythian settlements after Neapolis and Ak-Kaya-Vishennoe were Bulganak, Ust-Alma and Kermen-Kyr. Like Neapolis and Ak-Kaya, these are characterized by a combination of Greek architectural principles and local ones. A unique group of Late Scythian settlements were city-states located on the banks of the Lower Dnieper. The material culture of these settlements was even more Hellenized than those on the Crimea, and they were probably closely connected to Olbia, if not dependent it. Burials of the Late Scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises, with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses. The largest such necropolis has been found at Ust-Alma. Because of close similarities between the material culture of the Late Scythians and that of neighbouring Greek cities, many scholars have suggested that Late Scythian cites, particularly those of the Lower Dnieper, were populated at last partly by Greeks. Influences of Sarmatian elements and the La T√®ne culture have been pointed out. The Late Scythian culture ends in the 3rd century AD. Culture and society Kurgan stelae of a Scythian at Khortytsia, Ukraine Since the Scythians did not have a written language, their non-material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non-Scythian authors, parallels found among other Iranian peoples, and archaeological evidence. Tribal divisions Scythians lived in confederated tribes, a political form of voluntary association which regulated pastures and organised a common defence against encroaching neighbours for the pastoral tribes of mostly equestrian herdsmen. While the productivity of domesticated animal-breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies, the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce, and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples ‚Äì in exchange for animal produce and military protection. Herodotus relates that three main tribes of the Scythians descended from three sons of Targitaus: Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais. They called themselves Scoloti, after one of their kings.Traces of the Iranian root x≈°aya ‚Äì \\"ruler\\" ‚Äì may persist in all three names. Herodotus writes that the Auchatae tribe descended from Lipoxais, the Catiari and Traspians from Arpoxais, and the Paralatae (Royal Scythians) from Colaxais, who was the youngest brother., 4.5-4.7 According to Herodotus the Royal Scythians were the largest and most powerful Scythian tribe, and looked \\"upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves.\\", 4.20 Although scholars have traditionally treated the three tribes as geographically distinct, Georges Dum√©zil interpreted the divine gifts as the symbols of social occupations, illustrating his trifunctional vision of early Indo-European societies: the plough and yoke symbolised the farmers, the axe ‚Äì the warriors, the bowl ‚Äì the priests. The first scholar to compare the three strata of Scythian society to the Indian castes was Arthur Christensen. According to Dum√©zil, \\"the fruitless attempts of Arpoxais and Lipoxais, in contrast to the success of Colaxais, may explain why the highest strata was not that of farmers or magicians, but rather that of warriors.\\" Warfare Scythian bow, Kerch (ancient Panticapeum), Crimea, 4th century BC. The Scythians were skilled archers, and their style of archery influenced that of the Persians and subsequently other nations, including the Greeks. The Scythians were a warlike people. When engaged at war, almost the entire adult population, including a large number of women, participated in battle. The Athenian historian Thucydides noted that no people in either Europe or Asia could resist the Scythians without outside aid. Scythians were particularly known for their equestrian skills, and their early use of composite bows shot from horseback. With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. Ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites, Scythians had a reputation for their archers, and many gained employment as mercenaries. Scythian elites had kurgan tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of larch wood, a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter. The Ziwiye hoard, a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of Sakiz south of Lake Urmia and dated to between 680 and 625 BC, includes objects with Scythian \\"animal style\\" features. One silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions, as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of Scythian writing. Scythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types, for a nomadic life centred on horses ‚Äì \\"fed from horse-blood\\" according to Herodotus ‚Äì and for skill in guerrilla warfare. Some Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to Greek stories of Amazons. Graves of armed females have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. David Anthony notes, \\"About 20% of Scythian- Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a style that may have inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\\" Clothing Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an electrum cup from the Kul-Oba kurgan burial near Kerch, Crimea. The warrior on the right strings his bow, bracing it behind his knee; note the typical pointed hood, long jacket with fur or fleece trimming at the edges, decorated trousers, and short boots tied at the ankle. Scythians apparently wore their hair long and loose, and all adult men apparently bearded. The gorytos appears clearly on the left hip of the bare-headed spearman. The shield of the central figure may be made of plain leather over a wooden or wicker base. (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) According to Herodotus, Scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots, and open tunics. They rode without stirrups or saddles, using only saddle-cloths. Herodotus reports that Scythians used cannabis, both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke (Hist. 4.73‚Äì75); archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals. Men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear ‚Äì either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap. Costume has been regarded as one of the main identifying criteria for Scythians. Women wore a variety of different headdresses, some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders, also adorned with metal (golden) plaques. Scythian women wore long, loose robes, ornamented with metal plaques (gold). Women wore shawls, often richly decorated with metal (golden) plaques. Based on numerous archeological findings in Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan, men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts. Men and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu√©s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate and necessity. Men and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots, wool-leather-felt gaiter-boots and moccasin-like shoes. They were either of a laced or simple slip on type. Women wore also soft shoes with metal (gold) plaques. Men and women wore belts. Warrior belts were made of leather, often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner's gorytos, sword, whet stone, whip etc. Belts were fastened with metal or horn belt- hooks, leather thongs and metal (often golden) or horn belt-plates. Religion Scythian religion was a type of Pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion and differed from the post-Zoroastrian Iranian thoughts. The Scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the Zoroastrian and Hindu systems. The use of cannabis to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system. Our most important literary source on Scythian religion is Herodotus. According to him the leading deity in the Scythian pantheon was Tabiti, whom he compared to the Greek god Hestia. Tabiti was eventually replaced by Atar, the fire-pantheon of Iranian tribes, and Agni, the fire deity of Indo-Aryans. Other deities mentioned by Herodotus include Papaios, Api, Goitosyros/Oitosyros, Argimpasa and Thagimasadas, whom he identified with Zeus, Gaia, Apollo, Aphrodite and Poseidon respectively. The Scythians are also said by Herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of Heracles and Ares, but he does not mention their Scythian names. An additional Scythian deity, the goddess Dithagoia, is mentioned in the a dedication by Senamotis, daughter of King Skiluros, at Panticapaeum. Most of the names of Scythian deities can be traced back to Iranian roots. Herodotus states that Thagimasadas was worshipped by the Royal Scythians only, while the remaining deities were worshipped by all. He also states that \\"Ares\\", the god of war, was the only god to whom the Scythians dedicated statues, altars or temples. Tumuli were erected to him in every Scythian district, and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him. At least one shrine to \\"Ares\\" has been discovered by archaeologists. The Scythians had professional priests, but it is not known if they constituted a hereditary class. Among the priests there was a separate group, the Enarei, who worshipped the goddess Argimpasa and assumed feminine identities. Scythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \\"First Man\\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings. Similar myths are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin. The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as khvarenah in the Avesta, played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus‚Äô writings on them. Traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the Ossetians of the present day. In Scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts, with the warriors, considered part of the upper world, the priests of the middle level, and the producers of the lower one. Art pectoral, or neckpiece, from a royal kurgan in Tolstaya Mogila, Pokrov, Ukraine, dated to the second half of the 4th century BC, of Greek workmanship. The central lower tier shows three horses, each being torn apart by two griffins. Scythian art was especially focused on animal figures. The art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as Scythian art. It is particularly characterized by its use of the animal style. Scythian animal style appears in an already established form Eastern Europe in the 8th century BC along with the Early Scythian archaeological culture itself. It bears little resemblance to the art of pre-Scythian cultures of the area. Some scholars suggest the art style developed under Near Eastern influence during the military campaigns of the 7th century BC, but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the Eurasian Steppe under Chinese influence. Others have sought to reconcile the two theories, suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other, under Near Eastern and Chinese influences respectively. Regardless, the animal style art of the Scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east. Scythian animal style works are typically divided into birds, ungulates and beasts of prey. This probably reflects the tripatriate division of the Scythian cosmos, with birds belonging to the upper level, ungulates to the middle level and beasts of prey in the lower level. Images of mythological creatures such a griffins are not uncommon in Scythian animal style, but these are probably the result of Near Eastern influences. By the late 6th century, as Scythian activity in the Near East was reduced, depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from Scythian art. It however reappears again in the 4th century BC as a result of Greek influence. Anthropomorphic depictions in Early Scythian art is known only from kurgan stelae. These depict warriors with almond-shaped eyes and mustaches, often including weapons and other military equipment. Since the 5th century BC, Scythian art changed considerably. This was probably a result of Greek and Persian influence, and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east. The changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals, who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually. Kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of Greek influences, with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards. The 4th century BC show additional Greek influence. While animal style was still in use, it appears that much Scythian art by this point was being made by Greek craftsmen on behalf of Scythians. Such objects are frequently found in royal Scythian burials of the period. Depictions of human beings become more prevalent. Many objects of Scythian art made by Greeks are probably illustrations of Scythian legends. Several objects are believed to have been of religious significance. By the late 3rd century BC, original Scythian art disappears through ongoing Hellenization. The creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however. Works of Scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions. The largest collections of Scythian art are found at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg and the Museum of Historical Treasures of the Ukraine in Kyiv, while smaller collections are found at the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in Berlin, the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford, and the Louvre of Paris. Language The approximate extent of Eastern Iranian languages in the 1st century BC The Scythians spoke a language belonging to the Scythian languages, most probably a branch of the Eastern Iranian languages. Whether all the peoples included in the \\"Scytho-Siberian\\" archaeological culture spoke languages from this family is uncertain. The Scythian languages may have formed a dialect continuum: \\"Scytho-Sarmatian\\" in the west and \\"Scytho-Khotanese\\" or Saka in the east. The Scythian languages were mostly marginalised and assimilated as a consequence of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages Slavic and Turkic expansion. The western (Sarmatian) group of ancient Scythian survived as the medieval language of the Alans and eventually gave rise to the modern Ossetian language. Anthropology Physical and genetic analyses of ancient remains have concluded that Scythians possessed predominantly features of Europoids. Some mixed Mongoloid phenotypes were also present but more frequently in eastern Scythians, suggesting that Scythians as a whole were also descended partly from East Eurasian populations. Physical appearance vase-painting of a Scythian archer (a police force in Athens) by Epiktetos, 520‚Äì500 BC In artworks, the Scythians are portrayed exhibiting Caucasoid traits. In Histories, the 5th-century Greek historian Herodotus describes the Budini of Scythia as red-haired and grey-eyed. In the 5th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates argued that the Scythians were light skinned., 20 \\"The Scythians are a ruddy race because of the cold, not through any fierceness in the sun's heat. It is the cold that burns their white skin and turns it ruddy.\\" In the 3rd century BC, the Greek poet Callimachus described the Arismapes (Arimaspi) of Scythia as fair-haired., Hymn IV. To Delos. 291 \\"The first to bring thee these offerings fro the fair-haired Arimaspi...\\" The 2nd century BC Han Chinese envoy Zhang Qian described the Sai (Saka), an eastern people closely related to the Scythians, as having yellow (probably meaning hazel or green), and blue eyes. In Natural History, the 1st century AD Roman author Pliny the Elder characterises the Seres, sometimes identified as Saka or Tocharians, as red-haired, blue-eyed and unusually tall., Book VI, Chap. 24 \\". These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had flaxen hair, and blue eyes...\\" In the late 2nd century AD, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria says that the Scythians and the Celts and long auburn hair., Book 3. Chapter III \\"Of the nations, the Celts and Scythians wear their hair long, but do not deck themselves. The bushy hair of the barbarian has something fearful in it; and its auburn (ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ∏œåŒΩ) colour threatens war...\\" The 2nd century Greek philosopher Polemon includes the Scythians among the northern peoples characterised by red hair and blue-grey eyes. In the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD, the Greek physician Galen writes that Scythians, Sarmatians, Illyrians, Germanic peoples and other northern peoples have reddish hair., De Temperamentis. Book 2 \\"Ergo Aegyptii, Arabes, & Indi, omnes denique qui calidam & siccam regionem incolunt, nigros, exiguique incrementi, siccos, crispos, & fragiles pilos habent. Contra qui humidam, frigidamque regionem habitant, Illyrii, Germani, Sarmatae, & omnis Scytica plaga, modice auctiles, & graciles, & rectos, & rufos optinent. Qui uero inter hos temperatum colunt tractum, hi pilos plurimi incrementi, & robustissimos, & modice nigros, & mediocriter crassos, tum nec prorsus crispos, nec omnino rectos edunt.\\" The fourth-century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that the Alans, a people closely related to the Scythians, were tall, blond and light-eyed., Book XXI, II, 21 \\"Nearly all the Alani are men of great stature and beauty; their hair is somewhat yellow, their eyes are terribly fierce\\" The 4th century bishop Gregory of Nyssa wrote that the Scythians were fair skinned and blond haired. \\"[T]he Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge.\\" The 5th-century physician Adamantius, who often follows Polemon, describes the Scythians are fair-haired.Adamantius. Physiognomica. 2. 37 It is possible that the later physical descriptions by Adamantius and Gregory of Scythians refer to East Germanic tribes, as the latter were frequently referred to as \\"Scythians\\" in Roman sources at that time. Genetics In 2017, a genetic study of various Scythian cultures, including the Scythians, was published in Nature Communications. The study suggested that the Scythians arose independently of culturally similar groups further east. Though all groups studies shared a common origin in the Yamnaya culture, the presence of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages was largely absent among Scythians, but present among other groups further east. Modern populations most closely related to the Scythians were found to be populations living in proximity to the sites studied, suggesting genetic continuity. Another 2017 genetic study, published in Scientific Reports, found that the Scythians shared common mithocondrial lineages with the earlier Srubnaya culture. It also noted that the Scythians differed from materially similar groups further east by the absence of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages. The authors of the study suggested that the Srubnaya culture was the source of the Scythian cultures of at least the Pontic steppe. In 2018, a genetic study of the earlier Srubnaya culture, and later peoples of the Scythian cultures, including the Scythians, was published in Science Advances. Members of the Srubnaya culture were found to be exclusively carriers of haplogroup R1a1a1 (R1a-M417), which showed a major expansion during the Bronze Age. Six male Scythian samples from kurgans at Starosillya and Glinoe were successfully analyzed. These were found to be carriers of haplogroup R1b1a1a2 (R1b-M269). The Scythians were found to be closely related to the Afanasievo culture and the Andronovo culture. The authors of the study suggested that the Scythians were not directly descended from the Srubnaya culture, but that the Scythians and the Srubnaya shared a common origin through the earlier Yamnaya culture. Significant genetic differences were found between the Scythians and materially similar groups further east, which underpinned the notion that although materially similar, the Scythians and groups further east should be seen as separate peoples belonging to a common cultural horizon, which perhaps had its source on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe and the southern Urals. In 2019, a genetic study of remains from the Aldy-Bel culture of southern Siberia, which is materially similar to that of the Scythians, was published in Human Genetics. The majority of Aldy-Bel samples were found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a, including two carriers of haplogroup R1a1a1b2 (R1a-Z93). East Asian admixture was also detected. The results indicated that the Scythians and the Aldy-Bel people were of completely different paternal origins, with almost no paternal gene flowe between them. In 2019, a genetic study of various peoples belonging to the Scythian cultures, including the Scythians, was published in Current Biology. The Scythians remains were mostly found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a and various subclades of it. The authors of the study suggested that migrations must have played a role in the emergence of the Scythians as the dominant power on the Pontic steppe. Legacy Late Antiquity In Late Antiquity, the notion of a Scythian ethnicity grew more vague and outsiders might dub any people inhabiting the Pontic-Caspian steppe as \\"Scythians\\", regardless of their language. Thus, Priscus, a Byzantine emissary to Attila, repeatedly referred to the latter's followers as \\"Scythians\\". But Eunapius, Zosimus, Claudius Cladianus and Olympiodorus usually mean Goths when they write \\"Scythians\\". The Goths had displaced the Sarmatians in the 2nd century from most areas near the Roman frontier, and by early medieval times, early Slavs and largely marginalized the Eastern Iranian dialects in Eastern Europe as they assimilated and absorbed the Iranian ethnic groups in the region. The Scythians played an instrumental role in the ethnogenesis of the Ossetians, who are considered direct descendants of the Alans. \\"Iranian-speaking nomadic tribes, specifically the Scythians and Sarmatians, are special among the North Caucasian peoples. The Scytho-Sarmatians were instrumental in the ethnogenesis of some of the modern peoples living today in the Caucasus. Of importance in this group are the Ossetians, an Iranian-speaking group of people who are believed to have descended from the North Caucasian Alans.\\" Although the classical Scythians may have largely disappeared by the 1st century BC, Eastern Romans continued to speak conventionally of \\"Scythians\\" to designate Germanic tribes and confederations or mounted Eurasian nomadic barbarians in general. In AD 448 two mounted \\"Scythians\\" led the emissary Priscus to Attila's encampment in Pannonia. The Byzantines in this case carefully distinguished the Scythians from the Goths and Huns who also followed Attila. Byzantine sources also refer to the Rus raiders who attacked Constantinople circa 860 in contemporary accounts as \\"Tauroscythians\\", because of their geographical origin, and despite their lack of any ethnic relation to Scythians. Patriarch Photius may have first applied the term to them during the Siege of Constantinople (860). Early Modern usage Scythians at the Tomb of Ovid (c. 1640), by Johann Heinrich Sch√∂nfeld Owing to their reputation as established by Greek historians, the Scythians long served as the epitome of savagery and barbarism. The New Testament includes a single reference to Scythians in Colossians 3:11: in a letter ascribed to Paul, \\"Scythian\\" is used as an example of people whom some label pejoratively, but who are, in Christ, acceptable to God: Shakespeare, for instance, alluded to the legend that Scythians ate their children in his play King Lear: Characteristically, early modern English discourse on Ireland, such as that of William Camden and Edmund Spenser, frequently resorted to comparisons with Scythians in order to confirm that the indigenous population of Ireland descended from these ancient \\"bogeymen\\", and showed themselves as barbaric as their alleged ancestors. Romantic nationalism: Battle between the Scythians and the Slavs (Viktor Vasnetsov, 1881) Descent claims Eug√®ne Delacroix's painting of the Roman poet, Ovid, in exile among the Scythians A number of groups have claimed possible descent from the Scythians, including the Ossetians. Some legends of the Poles, the Picts, the Gaels, the Hungarians (in particular, the Jassics), among others, also include mention of Scythian origins. Some writers claim that Scythians figured in the formation of the empire of the Medes and likewise of Caucasian Albania. The Scythians also feature in some national origin-legends of the Celts. In the second paragraph of the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, the √©lite of Scotland claim Scythia as a former homeland of the Scots. According to the 11th-century Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (The Book of the Taking of Ireland), the 14th-century Auraicept na n-√âces and other Irish folklore, the Irish originated in Scythia and were descendants of F√©nius Farsaid, a Scythian prince who created the Ogham alphabet. The Carolingian kings of the Franks traced Merovingian ancestry to the Germanic tribe of the Sicambri. Gregory of Tours documents in his History of the Franks that when Clovis was baptised, he was referred to as a Sicamber with the words \\"Mitis depone colla, Sicamber, adora quod incendisti, incendi quod adorasti.\\" The Chronicle of Fredegar in turn reveals that the Franks believed the Sicambri to be a tribe of Scythian or Cimmerian descent, who had changed their name to Franks in honour of their chieftain Franco in 11 BC. In the 17th and 18th centuries, foreigners regarded the Russians as descendants of Scythians. It became conventional to refer to Russians as Scythians in 18th-century poetry, and Alexander Blok drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem, The Scythians (1920). In the 19th century, romantic revisionists in the West transformed the \\"barbarian\\" Scyths of literature into the wild and free, hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond Indo-Europeans. Based on such accounts of Scythian founders of certain Germanic as well as Celtic tribes, British historiography in the British Empire period such as Sharon Turner in his History of the Anglo-Saxons, made them the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons. The idea was taken up in the British Israelism of John Wilson, who adopted and promoted the idea that the \\"European Race, in particular the Anglo-Saxons, were descended from certain Scythian tribes, and these Scythian tribes (as many had previously stated from the Middle Ages onward) were in turn descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.\\" Tudor Parfitt, author of The Lost Tribes of Israel and Professor of Modern Jewish Studies, points out that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is \\"of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre.\\" Related ancient peoples Herodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the Scythians, and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture, often called \\"Scythian culture\\", even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the \\"linguistic Scythians\\".

The H.R. 6385 act was drafted by Harry Anslinger and introduced by Rep. Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, on April 14, 1937. The Seventy-fifth United States Congress held hearings on April 27, 28, 29th, 30th, and May 4, 1937. Upon the congressional hearings confirmation, the H.R. 6385 act was redrafted as H.R. 6906 and introduced with House Report 792. The Act is now commonly referred to, using the modern spelling, as the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. This act was overturned in 1969 in Leary v. United States, and was repealed by Congress the next year.For repeal, see section 1101(b)(3), Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, 1292 (Oct. 27, 1970) (repealing the Marihuana Tax Act which had been codified in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954). Background Regulations and restrictions on the sale of cannabis sativa as a drug began as early as 1906 (see Legal history of cannabis in the United States). The head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), Harry J. Anslinger, argued that, in the 1930s, the FBN had noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana.Harry J. Anslinger, U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics and Will Oursler : The Murderers, the story of the narcotic gangs, Pages: 541-554, 1961 He had also, in 1935, received support from president Franklin D. Roosevelt for adoption of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, state laws that included regulations of cannabis.ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 The total production of hemp fiber in the United States had in 1933 decreased to around 500 tons per year. Cultivation of hemp began to increase in 1934 and 1935 but production remained at very low volume compared with other fibers.David P. West: Fiber Wars: The Extinction of Kentucky Hemp chapter 8STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT, 1938 H.T. NUGENT: COMMERCIALIZED HEMP (1934-35 CROP) in the STATE OF MINNESOTA bast with fibers. The stem, which can become hemp hurds, in the middle. Some parties have argued that the aim of the Act was to reduce the size of the hemp industry largely as an effort of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. The same parties have argued that with the invention of the decorticator, hemp had become a very cheap substitute for the paper pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. These parties argue that Hearst felt that this was a threat to his extensive timber holdings. Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in the US, had invested heavily in the Du Pont family's new synthetic fiber, nylon, a fiber that was competing with hemp. In 1916, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 \\"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material\\", in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was \\"favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood\\".Lyster H. Dewey and Jason L. Merrill Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material USDA Bulletin No. 404, Washington, D.C., October 14, 1916, p.25 Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production. However, later research does not confirm this. The concentration of cellulose in hemp hurds is only between 32% and 38% (not 77%, a number often repeated by Jack Herer and others on the Internet). Manufacture of paper with hemp as a raw material has shown that hemp lacks the qualities needed to become a major competitor to the traditional paper industry, which still uses wood or waste paper as raw material. In 2003, 95% of the hemp hurds in the EU were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material. The DuPont Company and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue that the purpose of developing the nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon.Prof. L. Trossarelli: -the history of nylon, Prof. L. TrossarelliAmerican Chemical Society: THE FIRST NYLON PLANT. 1995 The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed the act because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation/manufacturing. The AMA proposed that cannabis instead be added to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. The bill was passed over the last-minute objections of the American Medical Association. Dr. William Creighton Woodward, legislative counsel for the AMA, objected to the bill on the grounds that the bill had been prepared in secret without giving proper time to prepare their opposition to the bill.Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, 75c 2s. HR6906. Library of Congress transcript. July 12, 1937 He doubted their claims about marijuana addiction, violence, and overdosage; he further asserted that because the word Marijuana was largely unknown at the time, the medical profession did not realize they were losing cannabis. \\"Marijuana is not the correct term ... Yet the burden of this bill is placed heavily on the doctors and pharmacists of this country.\\" The bill was passed on the grounds of different reportsThe Marijuana Tax Act, Reports and hearings.The Marijuana Tax Act Anslinger also referred to the International Opium Convention that from 1928 included cannabis as a drug not a medicine, and that all states had some kind of laws against improper use of cannabis (for ex. the Uniform State Narcotic Act). By 1951, however, new justifications had emerged, and the Boggs Act that superseded the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was passed. In August 1954, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was enacted, and the Marihuana Tax Act was included in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the 1954 Code. Operation of the act Overprint marijuana revenue stamps from 1937 Shortly after the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act went into effect on October 1, 1937, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Denver City police arrested Moses Baca for possession and Samuel Caldwell for dealing. Baca and Caldwell's arrest made them the first marijuana convictions under U.S. federal law for not paying the marijuana tax. Judge Foster Symes sentenced Baca to 18 months and Caldwell to four years in Leavenworth Penitentiary for violating the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. After the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the US Army urged farmers to grow fiber hemp. Tax stamps for cultivation of fiber hemp began to be issued to farmers. Without any change in the Marihuana Tax Act, were cultivated with hemp between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957.David P. West:Hemp and Marijuana:Myths & Realities In 1967, President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice opened, \\"The Act raises an insignificant amount of revenue and exposes an insignificant number of marijuana transactions to public view, since only a handful of people are registered under the Act. It has become, in effect, solely a criminal law, imposing sanctions upon persons who sell, acquire, or possess marijuana.\\"Balancing the Grass Account In 1969 in Leary v. United States, part of the Act was ruled to be unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, since a person seeking the tax stamp would have to incriminate him/herself.Timothy Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S. Ct. 1532 (1969) In response the Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the 1937 Act. Etymology Although the spelling \\"marijuana\\" is more common in current usage, the actual spelling used in the Marihuana Tax Act is \\"marihuana\\". \\"Marihuana\\" was the spelling most commonly used in Federal Government documents at the time. In addition, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 legitimized the use of the term \\"marijuana\\" as a label for hemp and cannabis plants and products in the US and around the world. Prior to 1937, \\"marijuana\\" was slang; it was not included in any official dictionaries.Webster's New International Dictionary, p. 1318, G. & C. Merriam Company (1921). The word marijuana is probably of Mexican origin. Mexico itself had passed prohibition for export to the US in 1925, following the International Opium Convention. In the years leading up to the tax act, it was in common use in the United States, \\"smoked like tobacco\\", and called \\"ganjah\\", or \\"ganja\\".The American Agriculturist Family Cyclopaedia, 751 Broadway, New York, copyright:1888, by A. L. BurtWebster's New International Dictionary, 1921, published by G.& C. Merriam Co., Springfield Massachusetts After the enactment, illegal immigrants and US citizens could be arrested for possession of cannabis. The La Guardia Committee Report The only authoritative voice that opposed Anslinger's campaign against cannabis was that of New York Mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, who appointed in 1938 a commission of investigation, and in 1944 strongly objected to Anslinger's campaign with the La Guardia Committee.The La Guardia Committee Report  See also  *Legal history of cannabis in the United States *Hemp for Victory (1942) a United States Department of Agriculture war-time film encouraging farmers to grow hemp suitable for U.S. Navy hawser requirements. *Reefer Madness, propagandistic film of 1936. *La Guardia Committee, the first in depth study into the effects of smoking marijuana.

The SEC holds primary responsibility for enforcing the federal securities laws, proposing securities rules, and regulating the securities industry, which is the nation's stock and options exchanges, and other activities and organizations, including the electronic securities markets in the United States. In addition to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created it, the SEC enforces the Securities Act of 1933, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002, and other statutes. The SEC was created by Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (now codified as and commonly referred to as the Exchange Act or the 1934 Act). Overview The SEC has a three-part mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. To achieve its mandate, the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that public companies and other regulated companies submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as other periodic reports. In addition to annual financial reports, company executives must provide a narrative account, called the \\"management discussion and analysis\\" (MD&A;), that outlines the previous year of operations and explains how the company fared in that time period. MD&A; will usually also touch on the upcoming year, outlining future goals and approaches to new projects. In an attempt to level the playing field for all investors, the SEC maintains an online database called EDGAR (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) online from which investors can access this and other information filed with the agency. Quarterly and semiannual reports from public companies are crucial for investors to make sound decisions when investing in the capital markets. Unlike banking, investment in the capital markets is not guaranteed by the federal government. The potential for big gains needs to be weighed against that of sizable losses. Mandatory disclosure of financial and other information about the issuer and the security itself gives private individuals as well as large institutions the same basic facts about the public companies they invest in, thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and fraud. The SEC makes reports available to the public through the EDGAR system. The SEC also offers publications on investment-related topics for public education. The same online system also takes tips and complaints from investors to help the SEC track down violators of the securities laws. The SEC adheres to a strict policy of never commenting on the existence or status of an ongoing investigation. History Prior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC, there existed so-called blue sky laws. They were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. stockbroker and brokerage firm. However, these blue sky laws were generally found to be ineffective. For example, the Investment Bankers Association told its members as early as 1915 that they could \\"ignore\\" blue sky laws by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail. After holding hearings on abuses on interstate frauds (commonly known as the Pecora Commission), Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (), which regulates interstate sales of securities (original issues) at the federal level. The subsequent Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () regulates sales of securities in the secondary market. Section 4 of the 1934 act created the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the federal securities laws; both laws are considered parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal raft of legislation. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr, the inaugural Chairman of the SEC The Securities Act of 1933 is also known as the \\"Truth in Securities Act\\" and the \\"Federal Securities Act\\", or just the \\"1933 Act\\". Its goal was to increase public trust in the capital markets by requiring uniform disclosure of information about public securities offerings. The primary drafters of 1933 Act were Huston Thompson, a former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chairman, and Walter Miller and Ollie Butler, two attorneys in the Commerce Department's Foreign Service Division, with input from Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. For the first year of the law's enactment, the enforcement of the statute rested with the Federal Trade Commission, but this power was transferred to the SEC following its creation in 1934. In 1934, Roosevelt named his friend Joseph P. Kennedy, a self-made multimillionaire financier and a leader among the Irish-American community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough to clean it up.He was the father of president John F. Kennedy. David Nasaw, The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy (2012) pp 204-37. Two of the other five commissioners were James M. Landis (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and Ferdinand Pecora (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of intelligent young lawyers, including William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and operating mode for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had to get rid of the penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich- quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.Nassau, The Patriarch, pp. 226‚Äì28 The law requires that issuing companies register distributions of securities with the SEC prior to interstate sales of these securities, so that investors may have access to basic financial information about issuing companies and risks involved in investing in the securities in question. Since 1994, most registration statements (and associated materials) filed with the SEC can be accessed via the SEC's online system, EDGAR. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is also known as \\"the Exchange Act\\" or \\"the 1934 Act\\". This act regulates secondary trading between individuals and companies which are often unrelated to the original issuers of securities. Entities under the SEC's authority include securities exchanges with physical trading floors such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), online trading platforms such as the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) and alternative trading systems (ATSs), and any other persons (e.g., securities brokers) engaged in transactions for the accounts of others. Later SEC commissioners and chairmen include William O. Douglas, Jerome Frank (one of the leaders of the legal realism movement), and William J. Casey (who later headed the Central Intelligence Agency under President Ronald Reagan). In 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society introduced an online gallery to illustrate changes in the US securities market structure since the1930s. The online gallery features a narrative history supported by dozens of documents, papers, interviews, photos and videos. Organizational structure Commission members The Commission has five Commissioners who are appointed by the President of the United States. The commission is kept Non- partisan as no more than three Commissioners may belong to the same political party. Their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner's term ends on June 5 of each year. Service may continue up to eighteen additional months past term expiration. The President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, the President does not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2008 presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises. {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" +Current SEC Commissioners - !scope=\\"col\\" Name !scope=\\"col\\" Title !scope=\\"col\\" Party !scope=\\"col\\" Took office !scope=\\"col\\" Term expires - !scope=\\"row\\" Jay Clayton  Chairman  Independent  May 4, 2017  June 5, 2021 - !scope=\\"row\\"Caroline A.

Headquartered in Washington, D.C.. The SEC's divisions are:Organization of the SEC U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission * Corporation Finance * Trading and Markets * Investment Management * Enforcement * Economic and Risk Analysis Corporation Finance is the division that oversees the disclosure made by public companies, as well as the registration of transactions, such as mergers, made by companies. The division is also responsible for operating EDGAR. The Trading and Markets division oversees self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and all broker-dealer firms and investment houses. This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry. In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become registered representatives.\\"How does the NASD differ from the SEC?\\" Investopedia. Investopedia Inc. The Investment Management Division oversees registered investment companies, which include mutual funds, as well as registered investment advisors. These entities are subject to extensive regulation under various federal securities laws.Lemke and Lins, Regulation of Investment Advisers (Thomson West, 2013 ed.); Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies (Matthew Bender, 2013 ed.). The Division of Investment Management administers various federal securities laws, in particular, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This division's responsibilities include: * assisting the Commission in interpreting laws and regulations for the public and SEC inspection and enforcement staff; * responding to no-action requests and requests for exemptive relief; * reviewing investment company and investment adviser filings; * assisting the Commission in enforcement matters involving investment companies and advisers; and * advising the Commission on adapting SEC rules to new circumstances. The Enforcement Division works with the other three divisions, and other Commission offices, to investigate violations of the securities laws and regulations and to bring actions against alleged violators. The SEC generally conducts investigations in private. The SEC's staff may seek voluntary production of documents and testimony, or may seek a formal order of investigation from the SEC, which allows the staff to compel the production of documents and witness testimony. The SEC can bring a civil action in a U.S. District Court, or an administrative proceeding which is heard by an independent administrative law judge (ALJ). The SEC does not have criminal authority but may refer matters to state and federal prosecutors. The director of the SEC's Enforcement Division Robert Khuzami left the office in February 2013. The Economic and Risk Analysis Division (DERA) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The Division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency's \\"think tank,\\" DERA relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the Commission approach complex matters in a fresh light. DERA also assists in the Commission's efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise. The Division's activities include providing detailed, high-quality economic and statistical analyses, and specific subject-matter expertise to the Commission and other Divisions/Offices and developing customized, analytic tools and analyses to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations of the Federal securities laws. Using data, DERA staff create analytic programs designed to detect patterns identifying risks, enabling Commission divisions and offices to deploy scarce resources targeting possible misconduct. DERA also houses the Commission's Chief Economist. Regional offices There are 11 regional offices throughout the US with the name of the regional director. Among the SEC's offices are: * The Office of General Counsel, which acts as the agency's \\"lawyer\\" before federal appellate courts and provides legal advice to the Commission and other SEC divisions and offices; * The Office of the Chief Accountant, which establishes and enforces accounting and auditing policies set by the SEC. This office has played a role in such areas as working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board to develop Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in developing audit requirements, and the International Accounting Standards Board in advancing the development of International Financial Reporting Standards; * The Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, which inspects broker-dealers, stock exchanges, credit rating agencies, registered investment companies, including both closed-end and open-end (mutual funds) investment companies, money funds. and Registered Investment Advisors; * The Office of International Affairs, which represents the SEC abroad and which negotiates international enforcement information-sharing agreements, develops the SEC's international regulatory policies in areas such as mutual recognition, and helps develop international regulatory standards through organizations such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Financial Stability Forum; and * The Office of Information Technology, which supports the Commission and staff in information technology, including application development, infrastructure operations. and engineering, user support, IT program management, capital planning, security, and enterprise architecture. * The Inspector General. The SEC announced in January 2013 that it had named Carl Hoecker the new inspector general. He has a staff of 22.Greene, Jenna,\\"The Conversation Stopper: SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz: Staffers may not like riding the elevator with him, but the SEC is taking his advice\\", Corporate Counsel, July 27, 2011. Retrieved August 18, 2011. * The SEC Office of the Whistleblower provides assistance and information from a whistleblower who knows of possible securities law violations: this can be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Created by Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \\"Exchange Act\\") by, among other things, adding Section 21F, entitled \\"Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection\\".https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/reg-21f.pdf Section 21F directs the Commission to make monetary awards to eligible individuals who voluntarily provide original information that leads to successful Commission enforcement actions resulting in the imposition of monetary sanctions over $1,000,000, and certain successful related actions.https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/annual-report-2012.pdf Communications Comment letters Comment letters are issued by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance in response to a company's public filing. This letter, initially private, contains an itemized list of requests from the SEC. Each comment in the letter asks the filer to provide additional information, modify their submitted filing, or change the way they disclose in future filings. The filer must reply to each item in the comment letter. The SEC may then reply back with follow-up comments. This correspondence is later made public. In October 2001 the SEC wrote to CA, Inc., covering 15 items, mostly about CA's accounting, including 5 about revenue recognition. The chief executive officer of CA, to whom the letter was addressed, pleaded guilty to fraud at CA in 2004. In June 2004, the SEC announced that it would publicly post all comment letters, to give investors access to the information in them. An analysis of regulatory filings in May 2006 over the prior 12 months indicated, that the SEC had not accomplished what it said it would do. The analysis found 212 companies that had reported receiving comment letters from the SEC, but only 21 letters for these companies were posted on the SEC's website. John W. White, the head of the Division of Corporation Finance, told the New York Times in 2006: \\"We have now resolved the hurdles of posting the information... We expect a significant number of new postings in the coming months.\\" No-action letters No-action letters are letters by the SEC staff indicating that the staff will not recommend to the Commission that the SEC undertake enforcement action against a person or company if that entity engages in a particular action. These letters are sent in response to requests made when the legal status of an activity is not clear. These letters are publicly released and increase the body of knowledge on what exactly is and is not allowed. They represent the staff's interpretations of the securities laws and, while persuasive, are not binding on the courts. One such use, from 1975 to 2007, was with the nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), a credit rating agency that issues credit ratings that the SEC permits other financial firms to use for certain regulatory purposes. Freedom of Information Act processing performance In the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the SEC was among the 5 lowest performers, earned a D‚àí by scoring 61 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade.

Operations  List of major SEC enforcement actions (2009‚Äì12)  The SEC's Enforcement Division took a number of major actions in 2009‚Äì12. Regulatory action in the credit crunch The SEC announced on September 17, 2008, strict new rules to prohibit all forms of \\"naked short selling\\" as a measure to reduce volatility in turbulent markets. The SEC investigated cases involving individuals attempting to manipulate the market by passing false rumors about certain financial institutions. The Commission has also investigated trading irregularities and abusive short-selling practices. Hedge fund managers, broker-dealers, and institutional investors were also asked to disclose under oath certain information pertaining to their positions in credit default swaps. The Commission also negotiated the largest settlements in the history of the SEC (approximately $51 billion in all) on behalf of investors who purchased auction rate securities from six different financial institutions. Regulatory failures The SEC has been criticized \\"for being too 'tentative and fearful' in confronting wrongdoing on Wall Street\\", and for doing \\"an especially poor job of holding executives accountable\\". Christopher Cox, the former SEC chairman, has recognized the organization's multiple failures in relation to the Bernard Madoff fraud. Starting with an investigation in 1992 into a Madoff feeder fund that only invested with Madoff, and which, according to the SEC, promised \\"curiously steady\\" returns, the SEC did not investigate indications that something was amiss in Madoff's investment firm. The SEC has been accused of missing numerous red flags and ignoring tips on Madoff's alleged fraud. As a result, Cox said that an investigation would ensue into \\"all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm\\". SEC Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations Eric Swanson had met Madoff's niece, Shana Madoff, when Swanson was conducting an SEC examination of whether Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme because she was the firm's compliance attorney. The investigation was closed, and Swanson subsequently left the SEC, and married Shana Madoff. Approximately 45 percent of institutional investors thought that better oversight by the SEC could have prevented the Madoff fraud. Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC's Boston office in 2000, telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because it was impossible to legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies that he said he used. In June 2010, the SEC settled a wrongful termination lawsuit with former SEC enforcement lawyer Gary J. Aguirre, who was terminated in September 2005 following his attempt to subpoena Wall Street figure John J. Mack in an insider trading case involving hedge fund Pequot Capital Management;Blaylock D.

Mary Jo White, who later served as chair of the SEC, was at the time representing Morgan Stanley and was involved in this case.Choice of Mary Jo White to Head SEC Puts Fox In Charge of Hen House.

U.S. Government Printing Office. On September 26, 2016 Democratic senator Mark Warner sent a letter to the SEC, asking them to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate, citing the low number of companies' disclosures to date. =Inspector General office failures= In 2009, the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, sent a letter to Congress criticizing the SEC for failing to implement more than half of the recommendations made to it by its Inspector General.Johnson, Fawn. (December 17, 2009) \\"Group Alleges Slack SEC Response to Internal Watchdog\\". NASDAQ. According to POGO, in the prior two years, the SEC had taken no action on 27 out of 52 recommended reforms suggested in Inspector General reports, and still had a \\"pending\\" status on 197 of the 312 recommendations made in audit reports. Some of the recommendations included imposing disciplinary action on SEC employees who receive improper gifts or other favors from financial companies, and investigating and reporting the causes of the failures to detect the Madoff ponzi scheme.Brian, Danielle. (December 16, 2009) \\"POGO Letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro regarding SEC's failure to act on hundreds of Inspector General recommendations\\" . The Project On Government Oversight Website. In a 2011 article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone, former SEC employees were interviewed and commented negatively on the SEC's Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Going to the OIG was \\"well-known to be a career-killer\\". Is the SEC Covering Up Wall Street Crimes?, Matt Taibbi, 2011 August 17 Because of concerns raised by David P. Weber, former SEC Chief Investigator, regarding conduct by SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent, outside review of Kotz's alleged improper conduct in 2012. Williams concluded in his 66-page Report that Kotz violated ethics rules by overseeing probes that involved people with whom he had conflicts of interest due to \\"personal relationships\\". The report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, among others, because Kotz was a \\"very good friend\\" with Markopolos. It concluded that while it was unclear when Kotz and Markopolos became friends, it would have violated U.S. ethics rules if their relationship began before or during Kotz's Madoff investigation. The report also found that Kotz himself \\"appeared to have a conflict of interest\\" and should not have opened his Standford investigation, because he was friends with a female attorney who represented victims of the fraud. = Destruction of documents = According to former SEC employee and whistleblower Darcy Flynn, also reported by Taibbi, the agency routinely destroyed thousands of documents related to preliminary investigations of alleged crimes committed by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, SAC Capital, and other financial companies involved in the Great Recession that the SEC was supposed to have been regulating. The documents included those relating to \\"Matters Under Inquiry\\", or MUI, the name the SEC gives to the first stages of the investigation process. The tradition of destruction began as early as the 1990s. This SEC activity eventually caused a conflict with the National Archives and Records Administration when it was revealed to them in 2010 by Flynn. Flynn also described a meeting at the SEC in which top staff discussed refusing to admit the destruction had taken place, because it was possibly illegal. Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley, among others, took note of Flynn's call for protection as a whistleblower, and the story of the agency's document-handling procedures. The SEC issued a statement defending its procedures. NPR quoted University of Denver Sturm College of Law professor Jay Brown as saying: \\"My initial take on this is it's a tempest in a teapot,\\" and Jacob Frenkel, a securities lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area, as saying in effect \\"there's no allegation the SEC tossed sensitive documents from banks it got under subpoena in high-profile cases that investors and lawmakers care about\\". NPR concluded its report: > The debate boils down to this: What does an investigative record mean to > Congress? And the courts? Under the law, those investigative records must be > kept for 25 years. But federal officials say no judge has ruled that papers > related to early-stage SEC inquiries are investigative records.

Relationship to other agencies  In addition to working with various self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the SEC also works with other federal agencies, state securities regulators, international securities agencies and law enforcement agencies.Regulatory Structure In 1988 Executive Order 12631 established the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. The Working Group is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the Chairman of the SEC, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The goal of the Working Group is to enhance the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of the financial markets while maintaining investor confidence.U.S. Treasury The Securities Act of 1933 was originally administered by the Federal Trade Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 transferred this responsibility from the FTC to the SEC. The main mission of the FTC is to promote consumer protection and to eradicate anti-competitive business practices. The FTC regulates general business practices, while the SEC focuses on the securities markets. The Temporary National Economic Committee was established by joint resolution of Congress 52 Stat. 705 on June 16, 1938. It was in charge of reporting to Congress on abuses of monopoly power. The committee was defunded in 1941, but its records are still under seal by order of the SEC. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) was established in 1975 by Congress to develop rules for companies involved in underwriting and trading municipal securities. The MSRB is monitored by the SEC, but the MSRB does not have the authority to enforce its rules. While most violations of securities laws are enforced by the SEC and the various SROs it monitors, state securities regulators can also enforce statewide securities blue sky laws. States may require securities to be registered in the state before they can be sold there. National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) addressed this dual system of federal- state regulation by amending Section 18 of the 1933 Act to exempt nationally traded securities from state registration, thereby pre-empting state law in this area. However, NSMIA preserves the states' anti-fraud authority over all securities traded in the state. The SEC also works with federal and state law enforcement agencies to carry out actions against actors alleged to be in violation of the securities laws. The SEC is a member of International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and uses the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding as well as direct bilateral agreements with other countries' securities commissions to deal with cross- border misconduct in securities markets.

The park is 593 km northwest of Brisbane. It began life as a reserve gazetted in 1932 to protect Carnarvon Gorge for its outstanding scenic values, its Indigenous and non- Indigenous cultural heritage, and its geological significance. Rocks and landscapes Situated within the Central Queensland Sandstone Belt, and straddling the Great Dividing Range, Carnarvon National Park preserves and presents significant elements of Queensland's geological history including two sedimentary basins, the Bowen and the Surat, and the Buckland Volcanic Province. The youngest rocks in the area are the igneous basalt rocks of the Buckland volcanic Province, which were laid down between 35 and 27 million years ago.Walsh, G. L. 1999. \\"Carnarvon and Beyond\\" p 27. Takarakka Nowan Kas Publications. Since that time, water and wind have eroded the park's landscapes into a network of sandy plains, valleys, and gorges separated by basalt-capped tablelands and ranges. The park is rich in groundwater, numerous springs. The elevated areas protected within Carnarvon National Park have high value for above-ground catchments as well. Five major river systems rise within the park's boundary: the Comet, Dawson, Maranoa, Nogoa, and Warrego. The Warrego and Maranoa lie inland of the Great Dividing Range on the northern boundary of the Murray-Darling Basin. Flora Forty regional ecosystems are known to exist within the park and nine of them are listed as endangered,Claire Grant. 2005. Carnarvon National Park - Management Plan pp 6. Environmental Protection Agency, Queensland. due to large-scale land clearing within the region. Twenty-three species of flora listed as rare and threatened (Under Queensland legislation) have been found in the park, including the iconic Livistona nitida (Carnarvon Fan Palm, Carnarvon Gorge section), Cadellia pentastylis (Ooline, Moolayember section), and Stemmacantha australis (Austral Cornflower, Mount Moffatt section). Several plants occur in disjunct populations, or reach the limits of their distribution, within the Park such as the isolated colony of Angiopteris evecta (King Fern) found in Wards Canyon, Carnarvon Gorge. Artesian springs in the Salvator Rosa section of the park are considered amongst the most biodiverse in the state. Fauna Over 210 bird species have been recorded within Carnarvon National Park, along with about 60 species of mammals. This park is particularly rich in species of bats with at least twenty known to be there. The Ornithorhyncus anatinus, the platypus, is at its western limit of habitation in Queensland within this National Park, along with most of the park's gliding possums. Carnarvon Gorge has commercial night tours that take visitors into the park in search of gliders and other nocturnal life. At least 90 species of reptiles call this park home, over half of which are either skinks or geckoes, and 35 species have their State distributional limits here. Twenty-two species of amphibians have been found in the park, including isolated populations of Litoria fallax (eastern Sedgefrog) and Adelotus brevis (Tusked Frog). Over ten species of fish inhabit the park's waterways, the largest of which is Anguilla reinhardtii (long-finned eel). The park's invertebrate fauna is thought to be extremely diverse, and at least nine species are considered to be endemic to the Carnarvon Range, including two species of dragonfly, two species of stonefly, a dobson fly, and four species of land snail. Feral animals are present within the National Park, the ones presenting the most serious problems being brumbies and pigs. In 2007, culling of both species began by riflemen in helicopters or airplanes. In 2008 the third phase of an aerial culling of Brumbies took place, by shooting 700 horses from a helicopter, in Carnarvon National Park. Such aerial culling is a contentious issue to some members of the public. However, there is little doubt that both species cause considerable alteration to the values the park is designed to protect. Through their grazing and their repetitious patterns of movement, feral horses alter the composition of the ground cover, and this can accelerate erosion through over-grazing and excessive hoof traffic. Feral pigs are thought to be responsible for the localised extinction of the Australian brush-turkey from some areas of this National Park. History Carnarvon National Park has grown significantly since its inception, and Carnarvon Gorge is now but one of its seven sections. * Goodlife * Salvator Rosa * Ka Ka Mundi * Buckland Tableland * Mount Moffatt * Carnarvon Gorge * Moolayember In expanding the National Park, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service have sought to enhance the reserves catchment value and increase the diversity of regional ecosystems protected within its boundaries. The park's regional conservation importance is significant as its 298,000 hectares represents over half the total landmass of protected areas within the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion. Human history Carnarvon National Park is significant to Bidjara, Karingbal, and Kara Kara people of Central Queensland. The park contains many reminders of Aboriginal cultural connection in rock art sites, burial places and occupation sites. Kenniff Cave, in the Mount Moffatt section, was the first Australian archaeological site to return carbon dates on occupational evidence that pushed human occupation of the continent into the Late Pleistocene at 19,500 years before present. Prior to D.J. Mulvaney's excavation of Kenniff Cave, it was thought that Australia had only been occupied during the Holocene, fewer than 10,000 years before present. Aboriginal art at Carnarvon Gorge The indigenous stencil artists of Central Queensland, such as those who created sites such as the Art Gallery and Cathedral Cave in Carnarvon Gorge, are regarded by some researchers as the best in the world. It appears they developed complex stencilling techniques that have not been replicated elsewhere. Only one full adult body stencil is known to exist in the world; it can be seen publicly at the Tombs site in the Mount Moffatt section of the park. It is the largest known stencil, and a good example of the heights to which this form of human expression was taken in Central Queensland. Contemporary Indigenous culture in the park is much changed from that of pre-colonial Central Queensland; however strong Indigenous links to the landscapes within Carnarvon National Park are maintained through traditional owner involvement in the protection and preservation of the Park's cultural sites. The first European to traverse the future park was Thomas Mitchell, in the 1840s. Settlers followed in the footsteps of the explorers, lured by reports of the region's permanent water. Altercations with local Indigenous groups soon broke out and escalated into a state of mutual aggression that was maintained until the 1870s. The remoteness of the area during early settlement attracted some interesting local characters, some of whom came to the area to avoid unwanted official scrutiny. The Ward brothers hunted fur in the Carnarvons year round at a time when there were restricted open seasons. The Kenniff brothers (Kenniff Cave's namesakes) became notorious local horse thieves, and later murderers. Today, tourism, recreation, and conservation are the main human activities conducted on the park. The most popular section of the park is the Carnarvon Gorge section which receives an estimated 65,000 visitors per year. Mount Moffatt is the next most visited section, followed by Salvator Rosa and Ka Ka Mundi. The remaining sections of the park receive virtually no visitation at all, and are consequently high in wilderness values. Carnarvon National Park offers a variety of recreational activities including four-wheel driving, wildlife watching, hiking along maintained tracks, and bush walking into remote areas. A ninety-kilometre-long trail is currently underway that will allow bush walkers to circumnavigate Carnarvon Gorge in around five days. Access The Carnarvon Gorge section is accessible from either Rolleston or Injune along the Carnarvon Highway. The Mount Moffatt section is accessible from either Injune or Mitchell. The Salvator Rosa and Ka Ka Mundi sections are accessible via the Tambo Road from either Tambo or Springsure. See also * Protected areas of Queensland Footnotes References *Whelan, Howard. (1996).

His innovative work in both the sciences‚Äîparticularly communications and acoustics‚Äîand the various arts of music, literature and radio presentation after the end of World War II, as well as his anti-nuclear activism and cultural criticism garnered him widespread recognition in his lifetime. Amongst the vast range of works and projects he undertook, Schaeffer is most widely and currently recognized for his accomplishments in electronic and experimental music, at the core of which stands his role as the chief developer of a unique and early form of avant- garde music known as musique concr√®te. The genre emerged in Europe from the utilization of new music technology developed in the post-war era, following the advance of electroacoustic and acousmatic music. Schaeffer's writings (which include written and radio-narrated essays, biographies, short novels, a number of musical treatises and several plays) \\"Schaeffer taught electronic composition at the Paris Conservatory from 1968 until 1980. His writings include novels, short stories, and essays, as well as theoretical works in music, such as √Ä la recherche d'une musique concr√®te (1952; 'In Search of a Concrete Music\\"'), Trait√© des objets musicaux (1966; 'Treatise on Musical Objects'), and the two-volume Machines √† communiquer (1970‚Äì72; 'Machines for Communicating').\\" are often oriented towards his development of the genre, as well as the theoretics and philosophy of music in general. Today, Schaeffer is considered one of the most influential experimental, electroacoustic and subsequently electronic musicians, having been the first composer to utilize a number of contemporary recording and sampling techniques that are now used worldwide by nearly all record production companies. His collaborative endeavors are considered milestones in the histories of electronic and experimental music.  Life   Early life and education  Schaeffer was born in Nancy in 1910. His parents were both musicians (his father a violinist; his mother, a singer), and at first it seemed that Pierre would also take on music as a career. However his parents discouraged his musical pursuits from childhood and had him educated in engineering. He studied at several universities in this inclination, the first of which was Lyc√©e Saint- Sigisbert located in his hometown of Nancy. Afterwards he moved westwards in 1929 to the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris and finally completed his education in the capital at the √âcole sup√©rieure d'√©lectricit√©, in 1934. Schaeffer received a diploma in radio broadcasting from the √âcole Polytechnique. He may have also received a similar qualification from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des t√©l√©communications, although it is not verifiable as to whether or not he ever actually attended this university.  First experimentations and work in broadcasting and engineering; marriage and fatherhood  Later in 1934 Schaeffer entered his first employment as an engineer, briefly working in telecommunications in Strasbourg. In 1935 he began a relationship with a woman named Elisabeth Schmitt, and later in the year married her and with her had his first child, Marie-Claire Schaeffer. He and his new family then officially relocated to Paris where he joined the Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise (now called Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise; French for \\"French Radio and Television Broadcasting\\") in 1936 and began his work in radio broadcasting and presentation. It was there that he began to move away from his initial interests in telecommunications and to pursue music instead, combining his abilities as an engineer with his passion for sound. In his work at the station, Schaeffer experimented with records and an assortment of other devices‚Äîthe sounds they made and the applications of those sounds‚Äîafter convincing the radio station's management to allow him to use their equipment. This period of experimentation was significant for Schaeffer's development, bringing forward many fundamental questions he had on the limits of modern musical expression. Schaeffer presenting the Acousmonium. In these experiments, Pierre tried playing sounds backwards, slowing them down, speeding them up and juxtaposing them with other sounds, all techniques which were virtually unknown at that time. He had begun working with new contemporaries whom he had met through RTF, and as such his experimentation deepened. Schaeffer's work gradually became more avant-garde, as he challenged traditional musical style with the use of various devices and practices. A unique variety of electronic instruments‚Äîones which Schaeffer and his colleagues created, using their own engineering skills‚Äîcame into play in his work, like the chromatic, sliding and universal phonogenes, Francois Bayle's Acousmonium and a host of other devices such as gramaphones and some of the earliest tape recorders. \\"Musique concr√®te was an experimental technique that combined pre-recorded sounds natural as well as musical to make musical compositions. Using only the earliest tape recorders, sounds were edited, played backwards and speeded up and down to create fascinating 'sound-scapes'. Pierre Henry was a prolific composer of musique concr√®te and collaborated with Schaeffer on many compositions. Luciano Berio and Steve Reich are also key figures in musique concr√®te composition. Karlheinz Stockhausen combined electronic and concr√®te sounds to become a leader of avant-garde music making.\\"  Beginnings of writing career  In 1938 Schaeffer began his career as a writer, penning various articles and essays for the Revue Musicale, a French journal of music. His first column, Basic Truths, provided a critical examination of musical aspects of the time. A known ardent Catholic, Schaeffer began to write minor religiously-based pieces, and in the same year as his Basic Truths he published his first novel: Chlothar Nicole ‚Äî a short Christian novel.  Club d'essai and the origin of musique concr√®te  The Studio d'Essai, later Club d'Essai, was founded in 1942 by Pierre Schaeffer at the Radiodiffusion Nationale (France). It played a role in the activities of the French resistance during World War II, and later became a center of musical activity.  Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concr√®te  In 1949, Schaeffer met the percussionist-composer Pierre Henry, with whom he collaborated on many different musical compositions, and in 1951, he founded the Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concr√®te (GRMC) in the French Radio Institution. This gave him a new studio, which included a tape recorder. This was a significant development for Schaeffer, who previously had to work with phonographs and turntables to produce music. Schaeffer is generally acknowledged as being the first composer to make music using magnetic tape. His continued experimentation led him to publish √Ä la Recherche d'une Musique Concr√®te (French for \\"In Search of a Concrete Music\\") in 1952, which was a summation of his working methods up to that point. His only opera, Orph√©e 53 (\\"Orpheus 53\\"), premiered in 1953. Schaeffer left the GRMC in 1953 and reformed the group in 1958 as the Groupe de Recherche Musicale[s] (GRM) (at first without \\"s\\", then with \\"s\\"), where he briefly mentored the young Jean Michel Jarre, among other students. His last \\"etude\\" (study) came in 1959: the \\"Study of Objects\\" (Etudes aux Objets). In 1954 Schaeffer founded traditional music label Ocora (\\"Office de Coop√©ration Radiophonique\\") alongside composer, pianist and musicologist Charles Duvelle, with a worldwide coverage in order to preserve African rural soundscapes. Ocora also served as a facility to train technicians in African national broadcasting services. Today, it is still run by Duvelle.  Later life and death  Schaeffer became an associate professor at the Paris Conservatoire from 1968 to 1980 after creating a \\"class of fundamental music and application to the audiovisual.\\" In the aftermath of the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the 78 year old Schaeffer led a 498-member French rescue team to look for survivors in Leninakan, and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave. Schaeffer suffered from Alzheimer's disease later in his life, and died from the condition in Aix-en- Provence in 1995. He was 85 years old. He is buried in Delincourt in the very nice and green Vexin region (55 minutes from Paris) where he used to have his countryside property. Schaeffer was thereafter remembered by many of his colleagues with the title, \\"Musician of Sounds\\".  Legacy   Musique concr√®te  √âtude aux chemins de fer\\"), for instance, featured recordings of the noises made by trains running along railroad tracks. The term musique concr√®te (French for \\"real music\\", literally \\"concrete music\\"), was coined by Schaeffer in 1948.*Kennedy, Michael (2006), The Oxford Dictionary of Music, 985 pages, Schaeffer believed traditionally classical (or as he called it, \\"serious\\") music begins as an abstraction (musical notation) that is later produced as audible music. Musique concr√®te, by contrast, strives to start with the \\"concrete\\" sounds that emanate from base phenomena and then abstracts them into a composition. The term musique concr√®te is then, in essence, the breaking down of the structured production of traditional instruments, harmony, rhythm, and even music theory itself, in an attempt to reconstruct music from the bottom up. From the contemporary point of view, the importance of Schaeffer's musique concr√®te is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found it was possible to remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as tape looping and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage. The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices. Schaeffer was among the first to use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of electronic and experimental instruments in a manner similar to Luigi Russolo, whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of \\"playing\\" (in his terms, jeu) in the creation of music. Schaeffer's idea of jeu comes from the French verb jouer, which carries the same double meaning as the English verb play: 'to enjoy oneself by interacting with one's surroundings', as well as 'to operate a musical instrument'. This notion is at the core of the concept of musique concr√®te, and reflects on freely improvised sound, or perhaps more specifically electroacoustic improvisation, from the standpoint of Schaeffer's work and research.  Influences on music  Pierre's aforementioned student in GRM, Jean Michel Jarre, went on to great international success in his own musical career. Jarre's 1997 album, Oxygene 7-13, is dedicated to Schaeffer. Pierre Henry also made a tribute to the man, composing his √âcho d'Orph√©e, Pour P. Schaeffer alongside him for Schaeffer's last work and second compilation, L'≈íuvre Musicale. His other notable pupils include Joanna Bruzdowicz, Bernard Parmegiani, Micheline Coulombe Saint-Marcoux, Armando Santiago, Elzbieta Sikora. Many rap albums, such as It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back by Public Enemy and 3 Feet High And Rising by De La Soul take ordinary sounds and use them to create a finished product.The Effects of Musique Concrete at Musique Concrete ‚Äì History and Figures Pierre Schaeffer moved away from the musical universe in the 1980s, after criticizing the avant-garde of the 1950s that sought to break with tradition. He spoke on this point with the pianist Otavio Henrique Soares Brand√£o who, under his direction, conducted a reading of his book Treatise on Musical Objects. This reading aims at the creation of an innovative instrumental technique that does not break with tradition (1). Pierre Schaeffer has written three texts on this subject: (1) About the transcription for piano by Otavio Brand√£o of Pierre Schaeffer's Study of Objects, program of the Soares Brand√£o concert at the House of Latin America (9 January 1988): https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105316909845907907792/album/6158828608049225697 .

Pierre himself was a prize winner at the awards more than once.  Works   Music  All of Schaeffer's musical compositions (concr√®te or otherwise) were recorded before the advent of the CD, either on cassettes or a more archaic form of magnetic tape (therefore the term \\"discography\\" cannot be appropriately used here; rather his music in general). Mass-production for his work was limited at best, and each piece was, by Schaeffer's terms, intended to be released foremost as an expos√© to the masses of what he believed was a new and somewhat revolutionizing form of music. The original production of his marketed work was done by the \\"Groupe de Recherches Musicales\\" (a.k.a. GRM; now owned and operated by INA or the Institut national de l'audiovisuel), the company which he initially had formed around his creations. Other music was broadcast live (Pierre himself being notable on French radio at the time) and/or done in live \\"concert\\". Some individual tracks even found their way into the use of other artists, with Pierre's work being fronted in mime performances and ballets. Now after his death, various musical production companies, such as Disques Ad√®s and Phonurgia Nova have been given rights to distribute his work. Below is a list of Schaeffer's musical works, showing his compositions and the year(s) they were recorded. * Concertino-Diapason (1948; collaboration with J.-J. Grunenwald) * Cinq √©tudes de bruits (1948) * Suite pour 14 instruments (1949) * Variations sur une fl√ªte mexicaine (1949) * Bidule en ut (1950; collaboration with Pierre Henry) * La course au kilocycle (1950; radio score, collaboration with Pierre Henry) * L'oiseau r.a.i.

Also known as Orph√©e 51) * Masquerage (1952; film score) * Les paroles d√©gel√©es (1952; music for a radio production) * Sc√®nes de Don Juan (1952; incidental music, collaboration with Monique Rollin) * Orph√©e 53 (1953; opera) * Sahara d'aujourd'hui (1957; film score, collaboration with Pierre Henry) * Continuo (1958; collaboration with Luc Ferrari) * Etude aux sons anim√©s (1958) * Etude aux allures (1958) * Exposition fran√ßaise √† Londres (1958; collaboration with Luc Ferrari) * Etude aux objets (1959) * Nocturne aux chemins de fer (1959; incidental music) * Ph√®dre (1959; incidental music) * Simultan√© camerounais (1959) * Ph√®dre (1961) * L'aura d'Olga (1962; music for a radio production, collaboration with Claude Arrieu) * Le tri√®dre fertile (1975; collaboration with Bernard Durr) * Bilude (1979)  Broadcast narratives  Apart from his published and publicized music, Schaeffer conducted several musical (and specifically musique concr√®te-related) presentations via French radio. Although these broadcasts contained musical pieces by Schaeffer they cannot be adequately described as part of his main line of musical output. This is because the radio \\"essays\\", as they were appropriately named, were mainly narration on Schaeffer's musical theories philosophies rather than compositions in and of themselves. Schaeffer's radio narratives include the following: * The Shell Filled With Planets (1944) * Cantata to Alsace (1945) * An Hour of the World (1946) * From Claudel to Brangues (1953) * Ten Years of Radiophonic Experiments from the 'Studio' to the 'Club' d'Essai: 1942‚Äì1952 (1955)  Selected writings  Schaeffer's literary works span a range of genres, both in terms of fiction and non- fiction. He predominantly wrote treatises and essays, but also penned a film review and two plays.

G. Wells, dating from the period of 1936‚Äì1938.Wells, H.G. (1938). World Brain. London: Methuen & Co., Ltd.; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran & Co., Inc. Ebook: World Brain Throughout the book, Wells describes his vision of the World Brain: a new, free, synthetic, authoritative, permanent \\"World Encyclopaedia\\" that could help world citizens make the best use of universal information resources and make the best contribution to world peace.  Background  Plans for creating a global knowledge network long predate Wells. Andrew Michael Ramsay described, c. 1737, an objective of freemasonry as follows:Francis Heylighen, \\"Conceptions of a Global Brain: An Historical Review\\", in Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social, ed. H. Barry et al.; Volgograd: Uchitel, 2011. > ... to furnish the materials for a Universal Dictionary ... By this means > the lights of all nations will be united in one single work, which will be a > universal library of all that is beautiful, great, luminous, solid, and > useful in all the sciences and in all noble arts. This work will augment in > each century, according to the increase of knowledge. The Encyclopedist movement in France in the mid eighteenth century was a major attempt to actualize this philosophy. However, efforts to encompass all knowledge came to seem less possible as the available corpus expanded exponentially. Paul Otlet, a contemporary of Wells and information science pioneer, revived this movement in the twentieth century. Otlet wrote in 1935, \\"Man would no longer need documentation if he were assimilated into a being that has become omniscient, in the manner of God himself.\\" Otlet, like Wells, supported the internationalist efforts of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation. For his part, Wells had advocated world government for at least a decade, arguing in such books as The Open Conspiracy for control of education by a scientific elite. Synopsis In the wake of the first World War, Wells believed that people needed to become more educated and conversant with events and knowledge that surrounded them. In order to do this he offered the idea of the knowledge system of the World Brain that all humans could access.  World Encyclopedia  This section, Wells's first expression of his dream of a World Brain, was delivered as a lecture at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, Weekly Evening Meeting, Friday, 20 November 1936. Wells begins the lecture with a statement on his preference for cohesive worldviews rather than isolated facts. Correspondingly, he wishes the world to be such a whole \\"as coherent and consistent as possible\\". He mentions The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1931), one of his own attempts at providing intellectual synthesis, and calls it disappointingly unmatched. He expresses dismay at the ignorance of social science among the Treaty of Versailles and League of Nations framers. He mentions some recent works on the role of science in society and states his main problem as follows: > We want the intellectual worker to become a more definitely organised factor > in the human scheme. How is that factor to be organised? Is there any way of > implementing knowledge for ready and universal effect? In answer he introduces the doctrine of New Encyclopaedism as a framework for integrating intellectuals into an organic whole. For the ordinary man, who will necessarily be an educated citizen in the modern state: > From his point of view the World Encyclopaedia would be a row of volumes in > his own home or in some neighbouring house or in a convenient public library > or in any school or college, and in this row of volumes he would, without > any great toil or difficulty, find in clear understandable language, and > kept up to date, the ruling concepts of our social order, the outlines and > main particulars in all fields of knowledge, an exact and reasonably > detailed picture of our universe, a general history of the world, and if by > any chance he wanted to pursue a question into its ultimate detail, a > trustworthy and complete system of reference to primary sources of > knowledge. In fields where wide varieties of method and opinion existed, he > would find, not casual summaries of opinions, but very carefully chosen and > correlated statements and arguments. [...] This World Encyclopaedia would be > the mental background of every intelligent man in the world. It would be > alive and growing and changing continually under revision, extension and > replacement from the original thinkers in the world everywhere. Every > university and research institution should be feeding it. Every fresh mind > should be brought into contact with its standing editorial organisation. And > on the other hand its contents would be the standard source of material for > the instructional side of school and college work, for the verification of > facts and the testing of statements‚Äîeverywhere in the world. Even > journalists would deign to use it; even newspaper proprietors might be made > to respect it. Such an encyclopedia would be akin to a secular bible. Universal acceptance would be possible due to the underlying similarity of human brains. For specialists and intellectuals, the World Encyclopedia will provide valuable coordination with other intellectuals working in similar areas. Wells calls for the formation of an Encyclopaedia Society to promote the project and defend it from exploitation (e.g. by an \\"enterprising publisher\\" trying to profit from it). This society would also organize departments for production. Of course, the existence of a society has its own risks: > And there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may > feel and attempt to realise a sort of proprietorship in the organisation, to > make a group or a gang of it. But to recognise that danger is half-way to > averting it. The language of the World Encyclopedia would be English because of its greater range, precision, and subtlety. Intellectual workers across the world would be increasingly bound together through their participation. Wells wishes that wise world citizens would ensure world peace. He suggests that a world intellectual project will have more positive impact to this end than will any political movement such as communism, fascism, imperialism, pacifism, etc. He was a communalist and contextualist and ended his lecture as follows: > [W]hat I am saying ... is this, that without a World Encyclopaedia to hold > men's minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality, > there is no hope whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory > alleviation of any of our world troubles.  The Brain Organization of the Modern World  This section was first delivered as a lecture in America, October and November 1937. This lecture promotes the doctrine New Encyclopedism described previously. Wells begins with the observation that the world has become a single interconnected community due to the enormously increased speed of telecommunications. Secondly, he says that energy is available on a new scale, enabling, among other things, the capability for mass destruction. Consequently, the establishment of a new world order is imperative: > One needs an exceptional stupidity even to question the urgency we are under > to establish some effective World Pax, before gathering disaster overwhelms > us. The problem of reshaping human affairs on a world-scale, this World > problem, is drawing together an ever-increasing multitude of minds. Neither Christianity nor socialism can solve the World Problem. The solution is a modernized \\"World Knowledge Apparatus\\"‚Äîthe World Encyclopedia‚Äî\\"a sort of mental clearing house for the mind, a depot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested, clarified and compared\\". Wells thought that technological advances such as microfilm could be used towards this end so that \\"any student, in any part of the world, will be able to sit with his projector in his own study at his or her convenience to examine any book, any document, in an exact replica\\". In this lecture Wells develops the analogy of the encyclopedia to a brain, saying, \\"it would be a clearing house for universities and research institutions; it would play the role of a cerebral cortex to these essential ganglia\\". He mentions the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, an advisory branch of the League of Nations, and the 1937 World Congress of Universal Documentation as contemporary forerunners of the world brain.  A Permanent World Encyclopedia  This section was first published in Harper's Magazine, April 1937, and contributed to the new Encyclop√©die fran√ßaise, August 1937. In this essay, Wells explains how current encyclopaedias have failed to adapt to both the growing increase in recorded knowledge and the expansion of people requiring information that was accurate and readily accessible. He asserts that these 19th-century encyclopaedias continue to follow the 18th-century pattern, organisation and scale. \\"Our contemporary encyclopedias are still in the coach-and-horse phase of development,\\" he argued, \\"rather than in the phase of the automobile and the aeroplane.\\" Wells saw the potential for world-altering impacts this technology could bring. He felt that the creation of the encyclopaedia could bring about the peaceful days of the past, \\"with a common understanding and the conception of a common purpose, and of a commonwealth such as now we hardly dream of\\".\\"The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia\\". Contribution by H. G. Wells to the new Encyclop√©die Fran√ßaise, August 1937 Wells anticipated the effect and contribution that his World Brain would have on the university system as well. He wanted to see universities contributing to it, helping it grow, and feeding its search for holistic information. \\"Every university and research institution should be feeding it\\" (p. 14). Elsewhere Wells wrote: \\"It would become the logical nucleus of the world's research universities and post- graduate studies.\\"Wells, H.G. (1931a) The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind, New York: Greenwood. p. 796 He suggested that the organization he was proposing \\"would outgrow in scale and influence alike any single university that exists, and it would inevitably take the place of the loose-knit university system of the world in the concentration of research and thought and the direction of the general education of mankind\\". In fact the new encyclopedism he was advocating was \\"the only possible method I can imagine, of bringing the universities and research institutions around the world into effective cooperation and creating an intellectual authority sufficient to control and direct collective life\\". Ultimately the World Encyclopaedia would be \\"a permanent institution, a mighty super-university, holding together, utilizing and dominating all of the teaching and research organizations at present in existence\\".Wells, H.G. (1942a) Science and the World Mind, London: New Europe Publishing Co. p. 59.  Speech to the Congr√©s Mondial De La Documentation Universelle  This section provides a brief excerpt of Wells's speech at the World Congress of Universal Documentation, 20 August 1937. He tells the participants directly that they are participating in the creation of a world brain. He says: > I am speaking of a process of mental organisation throughout the world which > I believe to be as inevitable as anything can be in human affairs. The world > has to pull its mind together, and this is the beginning of its effort. The > world is a Phoenix. It perishes in flames and even as it dies it is born > again. This synthesis of knowledge is the necessary beginning to the new > world.  The Informative Content of Education  This section was delivered as the Presidential Address to the Educational Science Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 2 September 1937. Wells expresses his dismay at the general state of public ignorance, even among the educated, and suggest that the Educational Science Section focus on the bigger picture: > For this year I suggest we give the questions of drill, skills, art, music, > the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, > aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we > concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about > the world in which they are to live? He asks how the \\"irreducible minimum of knowledge\\" can be imparted to all people within ten years of education‚Äîrealistically, he says, amounting to 2400 hours of classroom instruction. He suggests minimizing the teaching of names and dates in British history and focusing instead on newly available information about prehistory, early civilisation (without the traditionally heavy emphasis on Palestine and the Israelites), and the broad contours of world history. He suggests better education in geography, with an inventory of the world's natural resources, and a better curriculum in money and economics. He calls for a \\"modernised type of teacher\\", better paid, with better equipment, and continually updated training.  Influence  1930s: World Congress of Universal Documentation One of the stated goals of this Congress, held in Paris, France, in 1937, was to discuss ideas and methods for implementing Wells's ideas of the World Brain. Wells himself gave a lecture at the Congress. Reginald Arthur Smith extended Wells's ideas in the book A Living Encyclop√¶dia: A Contribution to Mr. Wells's New Encyclop√¶dism (London: Andrew Dakers Ltd., 1941).  1960s: The World Brain as a supercomputer  = From World Library to World Brain = In his 1962 book Profiles of the Future, Arthur C. Clarke predicted that the construction of what H. G. Wells called the World Brain would take place in two stages. He identified the first stage as the construction of the World Library, which is basically Wells's concept of a universal encyclopaedia accessible to everyone from their home on computer terminals. He predicted this phase would be established (at least in the developed countries) by the year 2000. The second stage, the World Brain, would be a superintelligent artificially intelligent supercomputer that humans would be able to mutually interact with to solve various world problems. The \\"World Library\\" would be incorporated into the \\"World Brain\\" as a subsection of it. He suggested that this supercomputer should be installed in the former war rooms of the United States and the Soviet Union once the superpowers had matured enough to agree to co-operate rather than conflict with each other. Clarke predicted the construction of the \\"World Brain\\" would be completed by the year 2100.Clarke, Arthur C. Profiles of the Future; an Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible. New York: Harper & Row, 1962 In 1964, Eugene Garfield published an article in the journal Science introducing the Science Citation Index; the article's first sentence invoked Wells's \\"magnificent, if premature, plea for the establishment of a world information center\\", and Garfield predicted that the Science Citation Index \\"is a harbinger of things to come‚Äîa forerunner of the World Brain\\".  1990s: World Wide Web of documents  = World Wide Web as a World Brain = Brian R. Gaines in his 1996 paper \\"Convergence to the Information Highway\\" saw the World Wide Web as an extension of Wells's \\"World Brain\\" that individuals can access using personal computers. In papers published in 1996 and 1997 that did not cite Wells, Francis Heylighen and Ben Goertzel envisaged the further development of the World Wide Web into a global brain, i.e. an intelligent network of people and computers at the planetary level. The difference between \\"global brain\\" and \\"world brain\\" is that the latter, as envisaged by Wells, is centrally controlled, while the former is fully decentralised and self-organizing. In 2001, Doug Schuler, a professor at Evergreen State University, proposed a worldwide civic intelligence network as the fulfillment of Wells's world brain. As examples he cited Sustainable Seattle and the \\"Technology Healthy City\\" project in Seattle. =Wikipedia as a World Brain= There are a few similarities that link Wells' World Brain as a precursor to Wikipedia. Two to mention are the noncommercial aspect of both Wikipedia and the World Brain, as well as its international aspect. Wells did not want the Brain to be commercially funded, just as Jimmy Wales has decided not to have advertisements on Wikipedia, ensuring both were free from commercial bias. In addition, Wells envisioned microfilm as a universal format for which people could share information through the World Brain. His intention of using microfilm as the form for the World Brain mimics the use of the internet because he contended that the use of microfilm would abolish the distance between information and knowledge. A number of commentators have suggested that Wikipedia represents the World Brain as described by Wells.Joseph Stromberg, In 1937, H.G. Wells predicted Wikipedia. But he thought it'd lead to world peace, Vox.com, February 23, 2015. Joseph Reagle has compared Wells's warning about the need to defend the World Encyclopedia from propaganda with Wikipedia's \\"Neutral Point of View\\" norm: > In keeping with the universal vision, and anticipating a key Wikipedia norm, > H. G. Wells was concerned that his World Brain be an \\"encyclopedia appealing > to all mankind,\\" and therefore it must remain open to corrective criticism, > be skeptical of myths (no matter how \\"venerated\\") and guard against > \\"narrowing propaganda.\\" This strikes me as similar to the pluralism inherent > in the Wikipedia \\"Neutral Point of View\\" goal of \\"representing significant > views fairly, proportionately, and without bias.\\" See also *Collective intelligence *Jo√´l de Rosnay *Noosphere *Organizational learning *Citizendium *The Forbin Project * The Library of Babel *Encyclopedia Galactica  Footnotes   Further reading    External links  *World brain Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, Doran 1938 via Internet Archive from the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto 1938 non-fiction books Books by H.

She was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) on the shores of Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, Germany, and was operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin- Reederei). The airship flew from March 1936 until she was destroyed by fire 14 months later on May 6, 1937 while attempting to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Manchester Township, New Jersey, at the end of the first North American transatlantic journey of her second season of service with the loss of 36 lives. This was the last of the great airship disasters; it was preceded by the crashes of the British R38 in 1921 (44 dead), the US airship Roma in 1922 (34 dead), the French Dixmude in 1923 (52 dead), the British R101 in 1930 (48 dead), and the USS Akron in 1933 (73 dead). Hindenburg was named after the late Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. Design and development The Zeppelin Company had proposed LZ 128 in 1929, after the world flight of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. This ship was to be approximately long and carry of hydrogen. Ten Maybach engines were to power five tandem engine cars (a plan from 1930 only showed four). The disaster of the British airship R 101 prompted the Zeppelin Company to reconsider the use of hydrogen, therefore scrapping the LZ 128 in favour of a new airship designed for helium, the LZ 129. Initial plans projected the LZ 129 to have a length of , but were dropped from the tail in order to allow the ship to fit in Lakehurst Hangar No. 1. Hindenburg under construction Manufacturing of components began in 1931, but construction of the Hindenburg did not commence until March 1932. The delay was largely due to Daimler-Benz designing and refining the LOF-6 diesel engines to reduce weight while fulfilling the output requirements set by the Zeppelin Company. Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship's outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater's skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101.\\"R101: the Final Trials and Loss of the Ship.\\" The Airship Heritage Trust.

Dining room Lounge, with the world map painted on the wall Hindenburgs interior furnishings were designed by Fritz August Breuhaus, whose design experience included Pullman coaches, ocean liners, and warships of the German Navy.Lehmann 1937, p. 319. The upper \\"A\\" Deck contained small passenger quarters in the middle flanked by large public rooms: a dining room to port and a lounge and writing room to starboard. Paintings on the dining room walls portrayed the Graf Zeppelins trips to South America. A stylized world map covered the wall of the lounge. Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passengers were expected to spend most of their time in the public areas, rather than their cramped cabins.Dick and Robinson 1985, p. 96. The lower \\"B\\" Deck contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Harold G. Dick, an American representative from the Goodyear Zeppelin Company,\\"The Goodyear Zeppelin Company.\\" Ohio History Central. Retrieved October 27, 2010. recalled \\"The only entrance to the smoking room, which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen, was via the bar, which had a swiveling air lock door, and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward to make sure they were not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe.\\"Dick and Robinson 1985, p. 97.\\"LZ-129 The Latest Airship,\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1935. Use of hydrogen instead of helium Helium was initially selected for the lifting gas because it was the safest to use in airships, as it is not flammable.MacGregor, Anne. \\"The Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause\\" (Documentary film). Moondance Films/Discovery Channel, Broadcast air date: 2001. One proposed measure to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with vertical ducting to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was available in industrial quantities only from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.Vaeth 2005, p. 38. Despite a U.S. ban on the export of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927, the Germans designed the airship to use the far safer gas in the belief that they could convince the US government to license its export. When the designers learned that the National Munitions Control Board refused to lift the export ban, they were forced to re-engineer Hindenburg to use hydrogen for lift. Flammable hydrogen was the only alternative lighter-than-air gas that could provide sufficient lift. One beneficial side effect of employing hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added. Operational history Launching and trial flights Hindenburg on its first flight on March 4, 1936. The name of the airship was not yet painted on the hull. Five years after construction began in 1931, Hindenburg made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin company's eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers.Lehmann 1937, p. 323.

As the massive airship began to rise under full engine power she was caught by a 35-degree crosswind gust, causing her lower vertical tail fin to strike and be dragged across the ground, resulting in significant damage to the bottom portion of the airfoil and its attached rudder.Lehmann 1937, p. 326.Photograph by Harold Dick of damaged lower vertical tail fin. specialcollections.wichita.edu.

It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew used only the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders for the remainder of the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine crankshaft failed and the cap fell into the crank case.

The flights were considered demonstrative rather than routine in schedule. The first passenger trip across the North Atlantic left Frankfurt on 6 May with 56 crew and 50 passengers, arriving in Lakehurst on 9 May. As the elevation at Rhein-Main's airfield lies at above sea level, the airship could lift more at takeoff there than she could from Friedrichshafen which was situated at .Lehmann 1937, p. 343.

The last eastward trip of the year left Lakehurst on October 10; the first North Atlantic trip of 1937 ended in the Hindenburg disaster. In May and June 1936, Hindenburg made surprise visits to England. In May it was on a flight from America to Germany when she flew low over the West Yorkshire town of Keighley. A parcel was then thrown overboard and landed in the High Street.

Historian Oliver Denton speculates that the June visit may have had a more sinister purpose: to observe the industrial heartlands of Northern England.

The airship was said to be so stable a pen or pencil could be balanced on end atop a tablet without falling. Launches were so smooth that passengers often missed them, believing the airship was still docked to the mooring mast.

Additionally, the Olympic rings painted on the hull were removed for the 1937 season. Hindenburg also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear‚ÄìZeppelin built airships Akron and Macon. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to Hindenburg to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing.Dick and Robinson 1985, pp. 142‚Äì145.

A fire-scorched duralumin Hindenburg cross brace salvaged from the crash site The exact location of the initial fire, its source of ignition, and the source of fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Manually-controlled and automatic valves for releasing hydrogen were located partway up one-meter diameter ventilation shafts that ran vertically through the airship.Air Commerce Bulletin of August 15, 1937 (vol. 9, no. 2) published by the United States Department of Commerce Hydrogen released into a shaft, whether intentionally or because of a stuck valve, mixes with air already in the shaft- potentially in an explosive ratio. Alternatively, a gas cell could have been ruptured by the breaking of a structural tension wire causing a mixing of hydrogen with air.\\"The Hindenburg Accident. A Comparative Digest of the Investigations and Findings With the American and Translated German Reports Included.\\" R.W. Knight, Acting Chief, Air Transport Section. U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Air Commerce, Safety and Planning Division, Report No. 11, August 1938. The high static charge collected from flying within stormy conditions and inadequate grounding of the outer envelope to the frame could have ignited any resulting gas-air mixture at the top of the airship.Report of the German Investigation Commission about the Accident of the Airship \\"Hindenburg\\" on May 6, 1937, at Lakehurst, U.S.A. In support of the hypothesis that hydrogen was leaking from the aft portion of the Hindenburg prior to the conflagration, water ballast was released at the rear of the airship and 6 crew members were dispatched to the bow to keep the craft level. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which would not be visible if the fire had spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships. The duralumin framework of Hindenburg was salvaged and shipped back to Germany. There the scrap was recycled and used in the construction of military aircraft for the Luftwaffe, as were the frames of Graf Zeppelin and Graf Zeppelin II when they were scrapped in 1940.Mooney 1972, p. 262.

While the region is surrounded by agricultural land, the area of the Little Desert itself \\"consists mainly of deep sandy soils with very low fertility, interspersed with small pockets of clay soils. There are occasional rocky, sandstone outcrops and buckshot rises. Average yearly rainfall varies remarkably from the east to the west.\\" The Little Desert \\"remains relatively undisturbed by human activity, even though in the earlier years of European settlement it experienced some industry in the way of grazing and woodcutting.\\" Now the desert is a National Park, and is \\"broken up into three blocks\\": Western Block, Central Block and Eastern Block; demarcated by two north-south roads, the Nhill-Harrow road and the Kaniva-Edenhope road. Today the National Park is an important tourist destination receiving about 50,000 visitors each year. Parks Victoria maintain multiple camping sites, walking tracks, look-outs and four-wheel-driving tracks throughout the park. Although most internal roads within the National Park are only accessible by four-wheel-drive vehicles and some are closed during winter or after wet weather. History Pre- National Park Prior to the establishment of the park, small aboriginal family groups camped along the Wimmera River. European activity began with grazing from the 1840s but had ceased by the 1960s. During the Second World World War the Central Block was used as a bombing and gunnery range and the remains of several concrete observation bunkers are still present. National Park The low-nutrient sandy soil combined with low rainfalls made farming difficult. After the Second World War, the State Government considered clearing and selling land in the Little Desert region. Local opposition to selling the land for farming was intense and quickly gathered support around Victoria. The Bolte Government was initially unmoved by environmental concerns. Public outrage over the proposed subdivision resulted in the responsible minister's losing his safe seat in a by-election. The Little Desert debate galvanised Victoria's conservation movement into forming a peak body, the Conservation Council of Victoria, and the conservative Victorian government of Henry Bolte to adopt environmental policies, such as establishing the Land Conservation Council to systematically and independently review all future public land use across the state. The architect of the Land Conservation Council was the newly appointed Minister of Lands, Conservation and Soldier Settlement, William Borthwick, who supported retaining the area as a nature reserve. So in 1955 the Kiata Lowan Sanctuary was established to preserve the 'Eastern block' of the Desert and protect the local Malleefowl. In 1969 this Sanctuary became 'The Little Desert National Park' in the 'Eastern Block' and in 1986 the 'Central' and 'Western' Blocks were added. Flora and fauna The Little Desert receives an annual rainfall of approximately , though there is a gradient from in the east to near Naracoorte. The vegetation of the park ranges from pure mallee heathland in the Eastern Block to cypress pine and casuarina woodlands in the moister Western Block. In the Western Block, there are large areas of seasonal swampland formed over claypans. Laterites are scattered throughout the sandy areas of the park and characterised by broombush. Brush-tailed possums and Grey kangaroos are common throughout the park, and lizards can be observed basking in the sun. Birds With over 200 species of birds the national park has been identified by BirdLife International, an international NGO, as an Important Bird Area because it supports populations of malleefowl and diamond firetails. The malleefowl is a rare bird found on the site and their protection was a contributory factor in the decision to preserve the area in 1968.

It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites. The history of the city probably dates back to the 7th century, when the town known as Ragusa was founded by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia). It was under the protection of the Byzantine Empire and later under the sovereignty of Republic of Venice. Between the 14th and 19th centuries, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state. The prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature. The entire city was almost destroyed when a devastating earthquake hit in 1667. During the Napoleonic Wars, Dubrovnik was occupied by the French Empire forces, and then the Republic of Ragusa was abolished and incorporated into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and later into Illyrian Provinces. During most of the 19th and 20th centuries, Dubrovnik was a part of the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary and Yugoslavia. In 1991, during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by the Yugoslav People's Army for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After undergoing repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, it re-emerged as one of the Mediterranean's top tourist destinations, as well as a popular filming location, especially known for the HBO television series Game of Thrones. Names The names Dubrovnik and Ragusa co-existed for several centuries. Ragusa, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while Dubrovnik, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century. The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as , a Celtic name for water (Gaulish , Irish , Welsh , Cornish ), akin to the toponyms , Dover, and ; or originating from a Proto-Slavic word meaning 'oak'. The term means the 'oakwood', as in all other Slavic languages the word , , means 'oak' and , means the 'oakwood'. The historical name Ragusa is recorded in the Greek form (, Latinized ) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek , \\"grape\\"; from Greek , \\"narrow passage\\"; Greek \\"ragged (of rocks)\\", () \\"fissure\\"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the Rhogoi, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (\\"Pelasgian\\"), from a root cognate to Greek \\"fissure\\", with a suffix -ussa also found in the Greek name of Braƒç, Elaphousa. The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa () is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of Lausa, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek \\"rock, stone\\"). History Origins According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De Administrando Imperio ( 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a \\"rocky island\\" called Lausa, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Roman city situated some 15 km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions. Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls. The size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time. There is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.ZBORNIK.indd (2009) Antun Niƒçetiƒá, in his 1996 book ' (), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Korƒçula, apart from each other. Republic of Ragusa Medieval fortresses, Lovrijenac & Bokar, Dubrovnik Dubrovnik before the earthquake in 1667 After the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. Dubrovnik in those medieval centuries had a Roman population. In 12th and 13th centuries Dubrovnik became a truly oligarchic republic, and benefited greatly by becoming a commercial outpost for the rising and prosperous Serbian state, especially after the signing of a treaty with Stefan the First-Crowned.The Birth of Yugoslavia by Henry Baerlein After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205‚Äì1358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240, Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uro≈° I king of Serbia who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Hum.Dubrovnik:A History by Robin Harris, chapter \\"Territorial expansion\\" After a fire destroyed most of the city in the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed.Dubrovnik: A History, page 289, Robin Harris, Saqi Books, 2006.

By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ragusa experienced further expansion when, in 1333, Serbian emperor Stefan Du≈°an, sold Pelje≈°ac and Ston in exchange for cash and an annual tributeThe Late Medieval Balkans by John V. A.

Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina on Foot During the Insurrection by Sir Arthur Evans, pages 416 and 417 Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan.Pitcher, Donald Edgar. An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire, Leiden: Brill, 1968, p. 70 The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics. For centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire's chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a \\"Venetian Bay\\", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice- Austria-Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders as seen on this map. The Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272, which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons). The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches. The city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries. The languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature. Big Onofrio's fountain (1438) The economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (argosy) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the word (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418. Many Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: Ivan Rabljanin (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon. Territory of the Republic before 1808 The Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667Husebye, Eystein Sverre. Earthquake Monitoring and Seismic Hazard Mitigation in Balkan Countries which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.Dubrovnik and the American Revolution: Francesco Favi's Letters, Francesco Favi, ed. by Wayne S. Vucinich, Ragusan Press, 1977. On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of \\"Duke of Ragusa\\" (Duc de Raguse) and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces. After seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of ≈†ipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS Bacchante and . Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinoviƒá offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him to keep the gate to the east closed to the Ragusan forces and to let Austrian forces enter the City from the west, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered. After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinoviƒá ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so \\"for the masses had hoisted it\\". Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinoviƒá, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city. Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (\\"inviolatam libertatem\\") to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic. Languages The \\"Libertas\\" Flag of Dubrovnik The official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik's historical documents simply as \\"Slavic\\". To oppose the demographics change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of ≈Ωupa Dubrovaƒçka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city. The Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population. Austrian rule When the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People's Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines. The combination of these two forces‚Äîa flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community‚Äîposed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Serbo- Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. Further complicating matters was the reality that increased emphases on ethnic identification in the nineteenth century did not break down along religious lines, as evident in the Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. In 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Moko≈°ica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire. In 1832, Baron ≈†i≈°mundo Getaldiƒá-Gunduliƒá (Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola) (1795‚Äì1860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of \\"Baron\\". Count Rafael Puciƒá (Raffaele Pozza), (1828‚Äì1890) was elected for first time Podest√† of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Korƒçula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podest√†) of Dubrovnik Rafael Puciƒá, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review \\"Slovinac\\"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebiƒá, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split. In 1889, the Serb-Catholics circle supported Baron Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola, the candidate of the Autonomous Party, vs the candidate of Popular Party Vlaho de Giulli, in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet. The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldiƒá-Gunduliƒá founded the Societ√† Philately on 4 December 1890. In 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Buniƒá ‚Äì certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project ‚Äì was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato ≈†ariƒá, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Graciƒá, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Katiƒá and Antun Miliƒá. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970. Pero ƒåingrija (1837‚Äì1921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia, played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905. Yugoslav period (1918‚Äì1991) With the fall of Austria‚ÄìHungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 Banovina, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia. During World War II, Dubrovnik became part of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, occupied by the Italian army first, and by the German army after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 Yugoslav Partisans occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa Massacre.\\"6 Uninhabited and Mysterious Islands with Bizarre Pasts\\", The Daily Star, 28 October 2015. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.Politiƒçki zatvorenik Retrieved 16 January 2012 Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the second world war, the city started to attract crowds of tourists - even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Old Town of Dubrovnik. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport.Dubrovnik Travel The Dubrovnik Summer Festival started being held in 1950.Dubrovnik Summer Festival The \\"Adriatic Highway\\" (Magistrala) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the touristification of the Croatian riviera.The Informal Housing of Privatnici and the Question of Class Two Stories From The Post-Yugoslav Roadside, de Mi≈°o Kapetanoviƒá et Ivana Katuriƒá, Dans Revue d‚Äô√©tudes comparatives Est-Ouest 2015/4 (N¬∞ 46), pages 61 √† 91 A villa on Dubrovnik‚Äôs Lapad peninsula was nationalised and used by Tito; after a 12-year battle for restitution, it was given back to the original owners, the Banac family.

At that event, Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed Republic of Croatia. Despite the demilitarisation of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 Yugoslavia's Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up a military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro, led by president Momir Bulatoviƒá, and prime minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, coming to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and allied to Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of an independent Croatia, but rather more historically aligned with the coastal history of Montenegro. Be that as it may, at the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with self-identified Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population. On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by JNA with a siege of Dubrovnik that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Mili≈°iƒá. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the old town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO world heritage site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik's surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years. Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs. ICTY indictments were issued for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing. General Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his role in the attack. The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet with United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, The New York Times Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash and 33 other people.  Geography   Climate  Dubrovnik has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the K√∂ppen climate classification, since only one summer month has less than of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach , and at night drop to around . In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between and . Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare. *Air temperature average annual: average of coldest period: January, average of warmest period: August, *Sea temperature average May‚ÄìSeptember: *Salinity approximately 3.8% *Precipitation average annual: average annual rain days: 109.2 *Sunshine average annual: 2629 hours average daily hours: 7.2 hours {style=\\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin- left:auto;margin-right:auto\\" class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible\\" - !Colspan=14Climate data for Dubrovnik - !Month !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !style=\\"border-left-width:medium\\"Year - !Average sea temperature ¬∞C (¬∞F) style=\\"background:#D3D3FF;color:#000000;\\"14.1 (57.4) style=\\"background:#D4D4FF;color:#000000;\\"14.2 (57.6) style=\\"background:#D8D8FF;color:#000000;\\"14.4 (57.9) style=\\"background:#EAEAFF;color:#000000;\\"15.6 (60.1) style=\\"background:#FFDD6E;color:#000000;\\"18.7 (65.7) style=\\"background:#FF8700;color:#000000;\\"23.1 (73.6) style=\\"background:#FF5800;color:#000000;\\"25.5 (77.9) style=\\"background:#FF5A00;color:#000000;\\"25.4 (77.7) style=\\"background:#FF6F00;color:#000000;\\"24.3 (75.7) style=\\"background:#FFB600;color:#000000;\\"20.7 (69.3) style=\\"background:#FFE799;color:#000000;\\"18.2 (64.8) style=\\"background:#EBEBFF;color:#000000;\\"15.7 (60.3) style=\\"background:#FFD447;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"19.2 (66.5) - !Mean daily daylight hours style=\\"background:#E9E900;color:#000000;\\"9.0 style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\\"12.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\\"13.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\\"15.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\\"15.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\\"15.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\\"14.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\\"12.0 style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\\"10.0 style=\\"background:#E9E900;color:#000000;\\"9.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF35;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"12.2 - !Average Ultraviolet index style=\\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\\"1 style=\\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\\"2 style=\\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\\"4 style=\\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\\"5 style=\\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\\"7 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"8 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"9 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"8 style=\\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\\"6 style=\\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\\"4 style=\\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\\"2 style=\\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\\"1 style=\\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"4.8 - !Colspan=14 style=\\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font- size:95%;\\"Source: Weather Atlas } Heritage The annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club. The patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise. February 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days. The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery. In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: \\"If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.\\" In the bay of Dubrovnik is the wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach. Among the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro. By 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week. Important monuments Remote view of Dubrovnik Cathedral Few of Dubrovnik's Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city's architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector's Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its fa√ßade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much- visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, and an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters. Dubrovnik's most beloved church is St Blaise's church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint. Dubrovnik's Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city's Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection. The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Buniƒá Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Lu≈æa Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue ‚Äì now lost ‚Äì for the Franciscan church). The Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Grubaƒçeviƒá, Uti≈°enoviƒá and Radonƒçiƒá. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise's church). In 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368‚Äì1437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Lu≈æa Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to .

The walls are thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the HBO television series, Game of Thrones.

Transport Dubrovnik Airport is the third busiest airport in Croatia. Dubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near ƒåilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gru≈æ. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia's other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia. The A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Ploƒçe, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelje≈°ac Bridge whose construction is in preparation as of 2018, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik. Education Dubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology), a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Sports The city will host the 2025 World Men's Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.

This usage originated in the mid-nineteenth century. Overview The figurative use of the word is analogous to figurative uses of steamroller or battering ram to mean something overwhelming. Its ground in social behavior is similar to that of bandwagon, but with overtones of devotional sacrifice. Its British English meaning of a large heavy truck or articulated lorry dates from the second half of the twentieth century. The word is derived from the Sanskrit/Odia (Devanagari , Odia ) \\"world-lord\\", combining (\\"world\\") and (\\"lord\\"), which is one of the names of Krishna found in the Sanskrit epics. The English loanword juggernaut in the sense of \\"a huge wagon bearing an image of a Hindu god\\" is from the seventeenth century, inspired by the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, Odisha (Orissa), which has the Ratha Yatra (\\"chariot procession\\"), an annual procession of chariots carrying the murtis (statues) of JagannƒÅtha, SubhadrƒÅ, and Balabhadra. The first European description of this festival is found in a thirteenth-century account by the Franciscan monk and missionary Odoric of Pordenone, who describes Hindus, as a religious sacrifice, casting themselves under the wheels of these huge chariots and being crushed to death. Odoric's description was later taken up and elaborated upon in the popular fourteenth- century Travels of John Mandeville.Folker Reichert, Asien und Europa im Mittelalter, p. 353. Others have suggested more prosaically that the deaths, if any, were accidental and caused by the press of the crowd and the general commotion.Rath Yatra: The Chariot Festival of Puri, India The term is used in Charles Dickens's The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit, published in 1844, to describe the love-lorn sentiments of Mr. Augustus Moddle, the 'youngest gentleman' at Mrs. Todgers's: \\"He often informed Mrs. Togders that the sun had set upon him; that the billows had rolled over him; that the Car of Juggernaut had crushed him; and also that the deadly Upass tree of Java had blighted him.\\" The figurative sense of the English word, with the idea of \\"something that demands blind devotion or merciless sacrifice\\" became common in the mid-nineteenth century. For example, it was used to describe the out- of-control character Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Jane Lilienfeld \\"Review of Thomas Reed's The Transforming Draught: Jekyll and Hyde, Robert Louis Stevenson and the Victorian Alcohol debate\\", Victorian Studies, Vol. 50 Issue 1, 2007. Other notable writers to have used the word this way range from H. G. Wells and Longfellow to Joe Klein. Bill Wilson in Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous describes \\"self-sufficiency\\" in society at large as being a \\"bone- crushing juggernaut whose final achievement is ruin\\". To the contrary, Mark Twain (autobiography, vol 2), describes Juggernaut as the kindest of gods. Any pretensions to rank or caste do not exist within its temple. Many speakers and writers apply the term to a large machine, or collectively to a team or group of people working together (such as a highly successful sports team or corporation), or even a growing political movement led by a charismatic leader‚Äîand it often bears an association with being crushingly destructive.

Background Between 1714 and 1718, the Ottomans had been successful against Venice in Greece and Crete (Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War) but had been defeated at Petrovaradin (1716) by the Austrian troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy (Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì1718). An exhibition in ethno-park Tulba near Po≈æarevac showing how the treaty was signed. Terms The treaty reflected the military situation. The Ottoman Empire lost the Banat of Temeswar, southeastern Syrmia, the central part of present-day Serbia (from Belgrade to south of Kru≈°evac), and a tiny strip of northern Bosnia. Wallachia (an autonomous Ottoman vassal) ceded Lesser Wallachia (Oltenia) to the Habsburg Monarchy. Venice ceded the Morea, its last remaining outposts in Crete, and the islands of Aegina and Tinos. Venice retained only the Ionian Islands (with Ottoman-occupied Kythera added to them), and the cities of Preveza and Arta on the Epirote mainland. In Dalmatia, Venice made some small advances, taking the areas of Imotski and Vrgorac in the hinterland. Aftermath The treaty gave the Habsburgs control over the northern part of present-day Serbia, which they had temporarily occupied during the Great Turkish War between 1688 and 1690. The Habsburgs established the Kingdom of Serbia as a crown land. The Habsburgs also formed the Banat into another crown land. Austrian control lasted 21 years, until Turkish victory in the Austro-Russian‚ÄìTurkish War (1735‚Äì39). In the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottoman Empire regained northern Bosnia, Habsburg Serbia (including Belgrade), and southern parts of the Banat of Temeswar, and Lesser Wallachia (Oltenia) was returned to Wallachia.

Note: China currently is capable of targeting its nuclear forces throughout the region and most of the world, including the continental United States. Newer systems, such as the DF-31, DF-31A, and JL-2, will give China a more survivable nuclear force. The Dongfeng () series, typically abbreviated as \\"DF missiles\\", are a family of short, medium, intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles operated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (formerly the Second Artillery Corps). History After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950, the Soviet Union assisted China's military R&D; with training, technical documentation, manufacturing equipment and licensed production of Soviet weapons. In the area of ballistic missiles, the Soviets transferred R-1 (SS-1), R-2 (SS-2) and R-11F technology to China.DF-1. GlobalSecurity.org. The first Chinese ballistic missiles were based on Soviet designs. Since then, China has made many advances in its ballistic missile and rocket technology. For instance, the space launch Long March rockets have their roots in the Dongfeng missiles. Dongfeng missiles Dongfeng 1  Dongfeng 1 (SS-2) The first of the Dongfeng missiles, the DF-1 (SS-2, initially codenamed '1059', while the 'DF-1' designation was initially assigned to the project which later became DF-3), was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2 (SS-2 Sibling) short-range ballistic missile (SRBM).R-2 / SS-2 SIBLING. GlobalSecurity.org The DF-1 had a single RD-101 rocket engine, and used alcohol for fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. The missile had maximum range of 550 km and a 500 kg payload. Limited numbers of DF-1 were produced in the 1960s, and have since been retired.  Dongfeng 2 (CSS-1) Beijing military museum The DF-2 (CSS-1) is China's first medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), with a 1,250 km range and a 15-20 kt nuclear warhead. It received the western designation of CSS-1 (stands for \\"China Surface-to-Surface\\").DF-2 / CSS-1 GlobalSecurity.org It was long noted by the western observers that the DF-2 could be a copy of the Soviet R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster), as they have identical look, range, engine and payload. Now it is known that the whole documentation for R-5 had been delivered from Soviet Union to China in the late 1950s.R-5 / SS-3 SHYSTER. GlobalSecurity.org But some western authors still attribute the entire design to Chinese specialists Xie Guangxuan, Liang Sili, Liu Chuanru, Liu Yuan, Lin Shuang, and Ren Xinmin. The first DF-2 failed in its launch test in 1962, leading to the improved DF-2A. The DF-2A was used to carry out China's test of a live warhead on a rocket in 1966 (detonated in the atmosphere above Lop Nor), and was in operational service since late 1960s. All DF-2 were retired from active duty in the 1980s.DongFeng 2 (CSS-1) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile Sinodefence.com Dongfeng 3 (CSS-2) The DF-3 (CSS-2) is often considered China's first \\"domestic\\" intermediate- range ballistic missile (IRBM). The common ICBM design was greatly influenced by soviet R-14 Chusovaya missile and the first stage engine itself was a direct copy of –°.2.1100/–°.2.1150 La-350 booster engine developed by Isayev OKB-2 (NII-88). The responsibility for the development guidance has been attributed to both Tu Shou'e and Sun Jiadong, and the missile as produced at Factory 211 (Capital Astronautics Co., [È¶ñÈÉΩËà™Â§©Êú∫Ê¢∞ÂÖ¨Âè∏], also known as Capital Machine Shop, [È¶ñÈÉΩÊú∫Ê¢∞ÂéÇ]). The 2,500 km DF-3 was originally designed with 2,000 kg payload to carry an atomic (later thermonuclear) payload. A further improved DF-3A with 3,000 km range (~4,000 km with reduced payload) was developed in 1981, and exported to Saudi Arabia with conventional high- explosive warhead. Their range of 2,810 km means they fall just short of being able to target Guam, although the 2012 DOD report on China's military power states that they have a range of 3,300 km, which would be enough to target Guam. The 2013 Pentagon report on China's military power confirms the DF-3's 3,300 km range, and its maps show Guam being within the DF-3's range. All DF-3/DF-3A's were retired by the mid-2010s and replaced by the DF-21.DongFeng 3 (CSS-2) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile Sinodefence.com Dongfeng 4 (CSS-3) The DF-4 (CSS-3) \\"Chingyu\\" is China's first two-stage ballistic missile, with 5,550-7,000 km range and 2,200 kg payload (3 Mt nuclear warhead). It was developed in late 1960s to provide strike capability against Moscow and Guam. The DF-4 missile also served as basis for China's first space launch vehicle, Chang Zheng 1 (Long March 1).

The DF-5 is a silo-based, two-stage missile, and its rocket served as the basis for the space-launch vehicle Fengbao-Tempest (FB-1) used to launch satellites. The missile was developed in the 1960s, but did not enter service until 1981. An improved variant, the DF-5A, was produced in the mid 1990s with improved range (>13,000 km). Currently, an estimated 24-36 DF-5A's are in service as China's primary ICBM force. If the DF-5A is launched from the eastern part of the Qinghai province, it can reach cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco. If it is launched from the most eastern parts of Manchuria, it can cover all of the mainland of the United States. Dongfeng 11 (CSS-7) A DF-11 TEL. The DF-11 (CSS-7, also M-11 for export), is a road-mobile SRBM designed by Wang Zhenhua at the Sanjiang Missile Corporation (also known as the 066 Base) in the late 1970s. Unlike previous Chinese ballistic missiles, the DF-11 use solid fuel, which greatly reduces launch preparation time to around 15‚Äì30 minutes, while liquid- fuelled missiles such as the DF-5 require up to 2 hours of pre-launch preparation. The DF-11 has a range of 300 km and an 800 kg payload. An improved DF-11A version has increased range of >825 km. The range of the M-11 does not violate the limits set by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Estimates on the number of DF-11s in service vary between 500 and 600.DF-11 (CSS-7). GlobalSecurity.org.DongFeng 11 (CSS-7) Short-Range Ballistic Missile Sinodefence.com  Dongfeng 12 (CSS-X-15) The DF-12 (CSS-X-15) is an SRBM formerly known as the M20. The change in designation signalled a shift in fielding to the Second Artillery Corps, making it possible the missile could be armed with a tactical nuclear warhead. Images of it bear a resemblance to the Russian 9K720 Iskander missile which, although not purchased by China from Russia, could have been acquired from former Soviet states. Like the Iskander, the DF-12 reportedly has built-in countermeasures including terminal maneuverability to survive against missile defense systems. Range is officially between , but given MTCR restrictions, actual maximum range may be up to . With guidance provided by inertial navigation and Beidou, accuracy is 30 meters CEP; since the missile is controlled throughout the entire flight path, it can be re-targeted mid- flight. The DF-12 is long, in diameter, has a take-off weight of , and an warhead that can deliver cluster, high explosive fragmentation, penetration, or high-explosive incendiary payloads.

The DF-16 (CSS-11)http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/china/df-16.htm is a new-model missile that has a longer range than the DF-15 (between ). A Taiwan official announced on 16 March 2011 that Taiwan believed China had begun deploying the missiles. The DF-16 represents an increased threat to Taiwan because it is more difficult to intercept for anti-ballistic missiles systems such as the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3.

Austria was defeated by the Turks at Grocka and signed a separate treaty in Belgrade with the Ottoman Empire on August 21, probably being alarmed at the prospect of Russian military success. With the Treaty of Belgrade, the Habsburgs ceded the Kingdom of Serbia with Belgrade, the southern part of the Banat of Temeswar and northern Bosnia to the Ottomans, and Oltenia, gained by the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, to Wallachia (an Ottoman subject), and set the demarcation line to the rivers Sava and Danube.

It is mostly in northern Derbyshire, but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire, and South Yorkshire. An area of great diversity, it is usually split into the Dark Peak, where most of the moorland is found and the geology is gritstone, and the White Peak which is a limestone area, known for its valleys and gorges which cut through the limestone plateau. The Dark Peak forms an arc along the north, east and west sides while the White Peak makes up the central and southern extent of the area. The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951. With its proximity to the cities of Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Sheffield, and access by road and rail, it attracts millions of visitors every year. It is estimated that 20 million people live within one hour's journey of the Peak District. Inhabited from the Mesolithic era, evidence exists from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. Settled by the Romans and Anglo-Saxons, the area remained largely agricultural and mining grew in importance in the medieval era. Richard Arkwright built his cotton mills at the start of the Industrial Revolution. Quarrying became important as mining declined. Tourism grew after the advent of the railways, visitors attracted by the landscape, spa towns at Buxton and Matlock Bath, Castleton's show caves, and Bakewell, the national park's only town. Tourism remains important for its towns and villages and their varied attractions, country houses and heritage sites. Outside the towns, walking on the extensive network of public footpaths, cycle trails, rock climbing and caving are popular pursuits. The Friends of the Peak District's Boundary Walk is a new long-distance trail addition. Geography The Peak District is at the southern end of the Pennines and much of the area is upland above . Its high point is Kinder Scout at . Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, and is characterised mostly by rounded hills, plateaus, valleys, limestone gorges and gritstone escarpments (the \\"edges\\"). The area, mostly rural, is surrounded by conurbations and large urban areas including Manchester, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent. The national park has a formal boundary and covers most of the Dark Peak and White Peak, but the wider Peak District is less well defined. The Dark Peak is largely uninhabited moorland and gritstone escarpments in the northern Peak District and its eastern and western margins. It encloses the central and southern White Peak which is where most settlements, farmland and limestone gorges are located. Three of Natural England's National Character Areas (NCAs) include the landscape. The Dark Peak NCA includes the northern and eastern parts of the Dark Peak while the White Peak NCA covers most of the White Peak. The western margins of the Dark Peak are in the South West Peak NCA, where farmland and pastured valleys are found as well as gritstone edges and moorland. Outside the park, the wider Peak District is often considered to include the area approximately between Disley and Sterndale Moor, and some of the outer fringes and foothills, including the Churnet and lower Derwent Valleys. The region is mostly surrounded by lowlands with gritstone moorlands of the South Pennines to the north. The national park covers , including most of the region in Derbyshire and extends into Staffordshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and South and West Yorkshire. The park's northern limits are on the A62 road between Huddersfield and Oldham, and its southernmost point is on the A52 road near Ashbourne. The park boundaries were drawn to exclude built-up and industrial areas; in particular Buxton and the quarries at the end of the Peak Dale corridor are surrounded on three sides by the park. Bakewell and many villages are in the national park as is much of the rural west of Sheffield. As of 2010, it is the fifth largest national park in England and Wales. In the UK, designation as a national park means that planning and other functions are provided by a national park authority with additional planning restrictions that provide enhanced protection against inappropriate development. Land within this national park as in other UK parks is in a mix of public and private ownership. The National Trust, a charity that conserves historic and natural landscapes, owns about 12% of the land in the national park.Handbook for Members and Visitors 2004, The National Trust. Its three estates (High Peak, White Peak and Longshaw) include ecologically or geologically significant areas at Bleaklow, Derwent Edge, Hope Woodlands, Kinder Scout, the Manifold valley, Mam Tor, Dovedale, Milldale and Winnats Pass. The park authority owns around 5%, and other major landowners include several water companies. A High Peak panorama between Hayfield and Chinley Settlements Towns around the Peak District Bakewell is the largest settlement and only town in the national park, and is the location of the National Park Authority‚Äôs offices. Its five-arched bridge over the River Wye dates from the 13th century. Castleton is the centre of production of the semi-precious mineral Blue John, while the village of Eyam is known for its self-imposed quarantine during the Black Death. Edale is the southern terminus of the Pennine Way, a 268-mile national trail which transverses most of the Pennines and ends at Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish border. Other villages within the park include Flash, Hathersage, Hartington, Ilam and Tideswell. The towns of Glossop, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Buxton, Macclesfield, Leek, Ashbourne, Matlock and Chesterfield are on the fringes of the national park. The spa town of Buxton was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire as a genteel health resort in the 18th century while the spa at Matlock Bath, in the valley of the River Derwent, was popularised in the Victorian era. Hayfield is at the foot of Kinder Scout, the highest summit in the area. Other towns and villages fringing the park include Whaley Bridge, Hadfield, Tintwistle, Darley Dale and Wirksworth in Derbyshire, Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire and Marsden and Holmfirth in West Yorkshire. Rivers, reservoirs and canals alt= Several rivers have their sources on the moorland plateaux of the Dark Peak and the high ridges of the White Peak. Many rivers in the Dark Peak and outer fringes were dammed to create reservoirs for supplying drinking water. Streams were dammed to provide headwater for water driven mills; weirs were built for the same purpose. The reservoirs of the Longdendale Chain were completed in February 1877 to provide compensation water, ensuring a continuous flow along the River Etherow which was essential for local industry, and provide drinking water for Manchester. In a report for the Manchester Corporation, John Frederick Bateman wrote in 1846: The western side of the Peak District is drained by the Etherow, Goyt, and Tame, which are tributaries of the River Mersey. The north east is drained by tributaries of the River Don. Of the tributaries of the River Trent that drain the south and east, the River Derwent is the most prominent. It rises on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley where it is constrained by the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. The reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley were built from the early to mid-20th century to supply drinking water to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. The River Noe and the River Wye are its tributaries. The River Manifold and River Dove in the south west, whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor, flow into the Trent, while the River Dane flows into the River Weaver in Cheshire. The Bugsworth Basin on the Peak Forest Canal There are no canals in the national park, although the Standedge Tunnels on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal run underneath the extreme north of it. Outside the park, waters from the Dark Peak feed the Macclesfield, Ashton, and Huddersfield Narrow Canals and waters from the White Peak fed the Cromford Canal. The Peak Forest Canal brought lime from the quarries at Dove Holes for the construction industry. It terminated at Bugsworth Basin and the journey was completed using the Peak Forest Tramway. The Cromford Canal, from Cromford to the Erewash Canal, served lead mines at Wirksworth and Sir Richard Arkwright's cotton mills. The Caldon Canal from Froghall was built to transport limestone from quarries at Cauldon Low for the iron industry and flints for the pottery industry. Climate Most of the area is more than above sea level, in the centre of the country at a latitude of 53¬∞N resulting in relatively high annual rainfall, averaging in 1999, compared with the rest of England and Wales. The Dark Peak tends to receive more rainfall then the White Peak as it is higher. The higher rainfall does not affect the temperature, which averages the same as the rest of England and Wales at . During the 1970s, the Dark Peak regularly recorded more than 70 days of snowfall. Since then the number of snowfall days has decreased. The hills still see periods of long continuous snow cover in some winters. Snow in mid- December 2009 on some hill summits created snow patches that lasted in some cases until May 2010. In the same winter, the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) and A57 (Snake Pass) were closed because of lying snow for almost a month. Frost cover is seen for 20‚Äì30% of the winter on moorland in the Dark Peak and 10% in the White Peak. The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative was set up in 2008 to collect data in the area. Students investigated the interaction between people and the moorlands, and their effect on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon sink or source, based on the fact that Britain's upland areas are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat. Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered. Geology The Peak is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.Gannon, Paul, Rock Trails Peak District:A Hillwalker's Guide to the Geology and Scenery, Pesda Press, 2011, The general geological structure is that of a broad dome, whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded. Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the Derbyshire Dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins, Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between them. The southern edge of the Derbyshiredome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though they barely impinge on the National Park. The White Peak is the central and southern section where Carboniferous Limestone is found at or near the surface. The Dark Peak to the north, east and west is characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland. Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north‚Äìsouth axes. The region was raised in a north‚Äìsouth line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks. Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. The veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times. Thor's Cave seen from the Manifold Way The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years (probably the Anglian glaciation of around 450,000 years ago) as evidenced by the patches of glacial till or boulder clay that can be found across the area. It was not covered by ice during the last glacial period, which peaked around 20,000‚Äì22,000 years ago. A mix of Irish Sea and Lake District ice abutted against its western margins. Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along this margin of the district during this period.Aitkenhead, N. et al. 2002 British Regional Geology: the Pennines and adjacent areas (4th Edn) (BGS, Nottingham) Glacial meltwaters contributed to the formation and development of many caves in the limestone area. Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves. The different types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers have been able to carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor. Ecology The gritstone and shale of the Dark Peak supports heather moorland and blanket bog environments, with rough sheep pasture and grouse shooting being the main land uses, although parts of it also support farming, especially the South West Peak NCA. The limestone plateaux of the White Peak are more intensively farmed, with mainly dairy usage of improved pastures. Woodland forms around 8% of the Peak National Park. Natural broad-leaved woodland is found in the steep-sided, narrow dales of the White Peak and the deep cloughs of the Dark Peak, while reservoir margins often have coniferous plantations. Flora White Peak habitats include calcareous grassland, ash woodlands and rock outcrops suitable for lime-loving species. They include early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), dark-red helleborine (Epipactis atrorubens) and fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera), common rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium), spring cinquefoil (Helianthemum nummularium) and grass of parnassus (Parnassia palustris). Lead rakes, the spoil heaps of ancient mining activity, form another distinctive habitat in the White Peak, supporting a range of rare metallophyte plants, including the spring sandwort (Minuartia verna; also known as leadwort), alpine pennycress (Thlaspi caerulescens) and mountain pansy (Viola lutea). Two endemic vascular plants are found nowhere else in the world: Derby hawkweed (Hieracium naviense), found only in Winnats Pass, is a native perennial of limestone cliffs that was discovered by J.N. Mills in 1966 and described as a new species in 1968; and leek-coloured hawkweed (H. subprasinifolium) was believed extinct but was rediscovered on banks beside the Monsal Trail in Chee Dale in 2017. The endemic Derbyshire feather moss (Thamnobryum angustifolium) occurs in one Derbyshire limestone dale, its sole world location intentionally kept confidential; the colony covers about of a rock face with small subsidiary colonies nearby. Jacob's-ladder (Polemonium caeruleum), a relatively rare species characteristic of limestone dales in the White Peak, has been the county flower of Derbyshire since 2002. It grows in grassland, light woodland, on screes, rock ledges and by streams in Lathkill, Wolfscote, Taddington, Wye Dale and other dales. Pollen evidence from peat bogs indicates that it was widespread throughout Britain just after the last ice-age. Much planted in gardens from where it has established itself in other parts of the area, as a native it is restricted to the White Peak and the Yorkshire Dales. The Dark Peak's heathlands, bogs, gritstone edges and acid grasslands contain relatively few species, and heather (Calluna vulgaris), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and hare's-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) are dominant on the high moors. After decades of decline due to pollution, Sphagnum mosses are making a comeback, with species such as S. cuspidatum being particularly dominant.Walker, M. D. 2019. Sphagnum. Sicklebrook Press. Fauna =Mammals= Most mammals found in the Peak District are generalists and widespread across the UK, but mountain hares on heather moorland in the Dark Peak constitute the only wild population in England. They were re-introduced in the Victorian era for sporting purposes. A feral population of red-necked wallabies lived around The Roaches from the 1940s onwards but may now be extinct. Red deer herds, assumed to be derived from animals escaped from deer parks at Lyme Park and Chatsworth, are established in the upper reaches of the Goyt valley and on the moors above Baslow, and a herd on Wharncliffe Crags outside the national park north of Sheffield may derive from the hunting stock of Wharncliffe Chase. Biodiversity action plans have been prepared for mountain hare, brown hare, brown long- eared bat, dormouse, harvest mouse, hedgehog, noctule bat, otter, pine marten, polecat, soprano pipistrelle and water vole. The status of the pine marten is unclear, although confirmed sightings have occurred in recent decades in Derbyshire and north Staffordshire and a specimen from an introduced Welsh population was found dead outside the national park on a road between Ripley and Belper in 2018. =Birds= As with its mammals, many of the Peak's current bird species are widespread generalists. The moors of the Dark Peak still support breeding populations of a number of upland specialists, such as twite, short-eared owl, golden plover, dunlin, ring ouzel, northern wheatear and merlin. The populations of twite and golden plover are the southernmost confirmed breeding populations in England, and the Peak District Moors Special Protection Area (SPA) is a European designation for its populations of merlin, golden plover and short-eared owl. The Peak District lacks the concentrations of breeding waders found further north in the Pennines, although the moors and their fringes accommodate breeding curlew and lapwing as well as less noticeable wading birds including dunlin and snipe. Commercial driven grouse shooting occurs on the heather moorlands of the Dark Peak, where the red grouse population is maintained by gamekeepers employed by shooting estates. A population of black grouse became extinct in 2000, but reintroduction was attempted in 2003. Quarries and rock outcrops provide nest sites for peregrine falcon and common raven. Ravens and common buzzards are increasingly encountered as their British range expands eastwards, perhaps because of general reductions in persecution. Illegal persecution has limited populations of rare raptors such as northern goshawk, peregrine and hen harrier. Following the RSPB's publication of Peak Malpractice, a 2006 report highlighting wildlife crime, the Peak District Bird of Prey Initiative was set up in 2011 by conservationists and shooting bodies in an attempt to boost the populations of birds of prey. The park authorities expressed disappointment at the limited results and the RSPB withdrew from the partnership in January 2018. Fast- flowing rivers attract specialist species, notably grey wagtail, dipper, common sandpiper, mandarin duck and goosander. Wooded and semi-wooded areas attract redstart, pied flycatcher, wood warbler and tree pipit, and coniferous plantations house siskin and common crossbill. Upland reservoirs in the Dark Peak are generally oligotrophic and attract few birds, but lower-lying reservoirs on the southern fringes such as Carsington Water and Ogston Reservoir regularly attract rare migrants and wintering rarities such as various waders, wildfowl, gulls and terns. The area is regularly overflown by wintering populations of pink-footed geese moving between East Anglia and Morecambe Bay. Dipper, golden plover, hen harrier, merlin and short-eared owl are local biodiversity action plan priority species. Fossil records show that the Peak District was once inhabited by an eclectic mix of species, many of them no longer found in Britain, such as alpine swift, demoiselle crane and long-legged buzzard. Species lost from the Peak District due to human activities include hazel grouse, capercaillie and golden eagle. =Other taxa= Amphibians and reptiles such as common lizards, grass snakes, great crested newts and slow worms are found in the area. The eastern moors are a stronghold for adders. Native fish in the Peak District include Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, bullhead, brook lamprey and grayling. A possibly unique population of \\"wild\\" rainbow trout survives on the Derbyshire Wye, following their introduction at the turn of the 20th century. Butterflies in the region include the dingy skipper, brown argus, small blue and white- letter hairstreak. Moths include the anomalous, broom moth, dot moth, garden dart, mouse moth and white ermine. Other invertebrates include the bilberry bumblebee, broad groove-head spider, mole cricket, northern yellow splinter, shining guest ant, violet oil beetle and white-clawed crayfish. History A view of the Edale valley from Mam Tor The Peak has been inhabited from the earliest periods of human activity as evidenced by finds of Mesolithic flint artefacts and palaeoenvironmental evidence from caves in Dovedale and elsewhere. Evidence of Neolithic activity includes monumental earthworks or barrows such as that at Margery Hill. In the Bronze Age the area was well populated and farmed, and evidence of these people survives in henges such as Arbor Low near Youlgreave, or the Nine Ladies stone circle at Stanton Moor. In the same period, and into the Iron Age, hillforts such as that at Mam Tor were created. The Romans exploited the area's rich mineral veins, exporting lead from the Buxton area along well-used routes. Buxton was a Roman settlement, known as \\"Aquae Arnemetiae\\" in recognition of its spring. Theories as to the derivation of the Peak name include that it came from the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it was part of the Anglian kingdom of Mercia. Barrows from the Anglo-Saxon period are present, including at Benty Grange, where the eponymous helmet was found. Mining and quarrying In medieval and early modern times the area was mainly agricultural with sheep farming, rather than arable, the main activity in upland holdings. From the 16th century, the area's mineral and geological wealth became increasingly significant. Not only lead, but coal, fluorite, copper from Ecton Mines, zinc, iron, manganese and silver have all been mined. Celia Fiennes, describing her journey through the Peak in 1697, wrote of: Coal measures occur on the Peak's western and eastern fringes and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The coal measures in the east are at the western edge of the South Yorkshire Coalfield and those in the west are part of the Cheshire section of the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries and continued into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops where miners followed the seams deeper into the hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the east was used in lead smelting and from the west for lime burning. Lead mining peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries; high concentrations were found in the area from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining declined from the mid-19th century and the last major mine closed in 1939. Lead is a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Bell pits were sunk to access ore that lay close to the surface. Fluorite or fluorspar is called Blue John locally, its name possibly from the French bleu et jaune describing its colour. Blue John is scarce, and now only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave. Small scale mining takes place in Treak Cliff Cavern. Industrial limestone quarrying to make soda ash started around Buxton in 1874. In 1926 the operation of the Buxton lime industry became part of ICI. Large-scale limestone and gritstone quarrying flourished as lead mining declined, and is an important if contentious industry. Of the twelve large limestone quarries in operation, Tunstead is one of the largest in Europe. Total limestone output was substantial: at the 1990 peak, 8.5 million tonnes was produced. Textiles Textiles have been exported for hundreds of years. In the 14th century, the area traded in unprocessed wool. There was a number of skilled hand spinners and weavers in the area. By the 1780s, Richard Arkwright had developed machinery to produce textiles more quickly and to a higher standard. The early Arkwright mills were of light construction, narrow, about wide, and low, the ceiling height was only and were lit by daylight. The new machines were powered by water wheels. The Peak was the ideal location, with its rivers and humid atmosphere. The local pool of labour was quickly exhausted and Litton Mill and Cressbrook Mill in Millers Dale brought in children as young as four from the workhouses of London as apprentices. As technology advanced, narrow valleys proved unsuitable for larger steam-driven mills, but the Derbyshire mills remained, trading in finishing and niche products. Glossop benefitted from the textile industry. Its economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition that had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Until the First World War, Glossop had the headquarters of the largest textile printworks in the world but after the Wall Street crash, its product lines became vulnerable and the industry declined. Modern history The Kinder Trespass in 1932 was a landmark in the campaign for open access to moorland in Britain and eventually led to the formation of Britain's national parks. Before the trespass, open moorland was closed to all. Moorland estates were the private property of landed gentry who used them for only 12 days a year and were guarded by their gamekeepers. The Peak District National Park became the United Kingdom's first national park on 17 April 1951. Campaigner Ethel Haythornthwaite played an important part in the development of the national park. The first long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom was the Pennine Way, which opened in 1965 and starts at the Nags Head Inn, in Grindsbook Booth, part of Edale village. The Peak & Northern Footpaths Society (PNFS) was formed in 1894 to monitor, protect, and improve the footpath network of the Peak District and surrounding areas. The organisation is the oldest existing regional footpath society in the UK. Saddleworth Moor and Wessenden, above Meltham, gained notoriety after the Moors murders in the 1960s. Economy Tunsted Quarry Tourism is estimated to provide 500 full-time jobs, 350 part-time jobs and 100 seasonal jobs. It is a major source of employment for park residents (24%). Manufacturing industries (19%), quarrying (12%) and agriculture (12%) are also important. The cement works at Hope is the largest single employer in the park. Limestone is the most important mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement; shale is extracted for cement at Hope, and several gritstone quarries are worked for building stone. Lead mining is no longer economic, but fluorite, baryte and calcite are extracted from lead veins, and small-scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton. The springs at Buxton and Ashbourne are exploited to produce bottled mineral water, and many plantations are managed for timber. Other manufacturing industries include David Mellor's cutlery factory in Hathersage, Ferodo brake linings in Chapel-en-le-Frith and electronic equipment in Castleton. Of the approximately 2,700 farms in the national park, most covering less than , 60% of farms are run on a part-time basis where the farmer has a second job. Tourism De Mirabilibus Pecci or The Seven Wonders of the Peak by Thomas Hobbes was an early tourist description published in 1636. Much scorn was poured on the seven wonders by visitors, including Daniel Defoe who described the moors by Chatsworth as \\"a waste and houling wilderness\\" and was particularly contemptuous of Peak Cavern near Castleton which was known as the 'Devil's Arse'. Visitor numbers did not increase until the Victorian era when the advent of railways provided access and a cultural appreciation of the Picturesque and Romantic developed. John Mawe's Mineralogy of Derbyshire (1802) and William Adam's Gem of the Peak (1843) generated interest in the area's unique geology. A tradition of public access and outdoor recreation grew in the area which is natural hinterland and rural escape for the populations of industrial Manchester and Sheffield, and remains a valuable leisure resource in a largely post-industrial economy. In a 2005 survey of visitors, 85% of respondents mentioned \\"scenery and landscape\\" as a reason for visiting.\\"Landscape Character\\" Peak District National Park, retrieved 20 August 2015 Buxton Buxton Crescent and St Ann's Well Buxton developed as a spa town because of its geothermal spring which rises at a constant temperature of 28 ¬∞C. It was settled by the Romans around AD 78, when it was known as Aquae Arnemetiae, or the spa of the goddess of the grove. Bess of Hardwick and her husband the Earl of Shrewsbury, \\"took the waters\\" in 1569, and brought Mary, Queen of Scots, there in 1573. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the 5th Duke of Devonshire in style of the spa of Bath. A resurgence in the 18th century attracted Dr Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood, who were drawn by the reputed healing properties of the waters. The railway reached Buxton in 1863. Buxton's notable buildings are The Crescent (1780‚Äì1784), modelled on Bath's Royal Crescent, by John Carr, The Devonshire (1780‚Äì1789), The Natural Baths, and The Pump Room by Henry Currey. The Pavilion Gardens were opened in 1871. Buxton Opera House was designed by Frank Matcham in 1903.  Historic buildings  Historic buildings in the park include Chatsworth House, seat of the Dukes of Devonshire and among Britain's finest stately homes; the medieval Haddon Hall, seat of the Dukes of Rutland; and Lyme Park, an Elizabethan manor house transformed by an Italianate front. Other historic buildings in the park include Eyam Hall, Ilam Hall and Tissington Hall. Many villages and towns have fine parish churches, including the 14th-century Church of St John the Baptist at Tideswell, sometimes dubbed the 'Cathedral of the Peak', and the 12th- century Church of St Nicholas at High Bradfield. 'Little John's Grave' is in the churchyard at Hathersage. Peveril Castle, overlooking Castleton, was built by the Normans.  Museums and attractions  Inside the park, Eyam Museum has displays about the village's history during the Black Death. Castleton has four show caves; Peak Cavern, Blue John, Treak Cliff and Speedwell. In the outer fringes, the area's industrial heritage is represented by the mining museum at Matlock Bath with the Temple Lead Mine, the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and Brindley Water Mill at Leek. Preserved railways such as the Peak Rail, Ecclesbourne Valley and Churnet Valley lines, the National Tramway Museum at Crich and the Cromford Canal chart the area's transport history. Matlock Bath also has the show caves and mines of the Heights of Abraham which can be reached by cable car, and the Gulliver's Kingdom theme park. Buxton has an opera house and theatre, museum and art gallery and Poole's Cavern show cave. Other attractions in the fringes include the Alton Towers theme park and the Peak Wildlife Park. A well dressing at Hayfield Well dressing ceremonies are held in many villages during the spring and summer months, a tradition said to date from pagan times. Other local customs include Castleton Garland Day and Ashbourne's Royal Shrovetide Football, played annually since the 12th century. Buxton hosts two opera festivals, the Buxton Festival and the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, and the Buxton Festival Fringe, and the Peak Literary Festival is held at various locations twice a year. Peak District food specialities include the dessert Bakewell pudding, very different from the nationally available Bakewell tart, and the famous cheese Stilton and other local cheeses are produced in the village of Hartington. Activities Paragliding from Mam Tor An extensive network of public footpaths and numerous long-distance trails, over in total, and large open-access areas are available for hillwalking and hiking. The Pennine Way traverses the Dark Peak from Edale to the park's northern boundary just south of Standedge. Bridleways are used by mountain bikers, as well as horse riders. The Tissington Trail and High Peak Trail, which re-use former railway lines, are well used by walkers, horse riders and cyclists. The Peak District Boundary Walk is a circular walking trail around the national park. Sections of the former rail routes were converted to multi-purpose cycle trails. After the Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone part of the trackbed was used for the Longdendale Trail section of the Trans Pennine Trail between Hadfield and Woodhead. The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway between Rowsley and Buxton is part of the Monsal Trail. The trackbed of the Cromford and High Peak Railway is open to the public as the High Peak Trail. The Tissington Trail uses another disused rail line between Buxton and Ashbourne while the Manifold Way utilises the former line between Waterhouses and Hulme End. Local authorities run cycle hire centres at Ashbourne, Parsley Hay, Middleton Top, the Upper Derwent Valley and Hulme End. Wheelchair access is possible at several places on the former railway trails, and cycle hire centres offer vehicles adapted to wheelchair users. A project to make footpaths more accessible to less-agile walkers has replaced stiles with gates. Gritstone outcrops at Stanage Edge and The Roaches, are recognised as some of the finest rock climbing sites in the world. Limestone is more unstable but provides many testing climbs. Thor's Cave was explored in the early 1950s by Joe Brown and others. Eleven limestone routes there are listed by the BMC, ranging in grade from Very Severe to E7, and several more have been claimed since the guidebook's publication; a few routes are bolted. Caving takes place in the natural caves, potholes and old mine workings found in the limestone of the White Peak. Peak Cavern, the largest and most important cave system, is even linked to the Speedwell system at Winnats. The largest potholes are Eldon Hole and Nettle Pot. Many old mine workings were often extensions of natural cave systems. They can be found at Castleton, Winnats, Matlock, Stoney Middleton, Eyam, Monyash and Buxton. Reservoirs such as Torside Reservoir, Damflask Reservoir, Carsington Water and Rudyard Lake are centres for water sports, including sailing, fishing and canoeing. Other activities include air sports such as hang gliding and paragliding, birdwatching, fell running, off-roading, and orienteering. Transport Map showing tunnels beneath the Peak District The first roads constructed by the Romans may have followed existing tracks. The Roman network linked the settlements and forts of Aquae Arnemetiae (Buxton), Chesterfield, Ardotalia (Glossop) and Navio (Brough and Shatton), and beyond. Parts of the modern A515 and A53 roads south of Buxton are believed to follow the routes of Roman roads. Packhorse routes criss-crossed the Peak in the Medieval era, and some paved causeways such as the Long Causeway along Stanage Edge date from this period. No highways were marked on Christopher Saxton's 1579 map of Derbyshire. Bridge-building improved the transport network. Although the introduction of turnpike roads from 1731 reduced journey times, the journey from Sheffield to Manchester in 1800 still took 16 hours prompting Samuel Taylor Coleridge to remark that \\"a tortoise could outgallop us!\\" From around 1815, better quality turnpike roads were built. The Snake Pass, part of the A57, was built under the direction of Thomas Telford in 1819‚Äì21. The main roads are the A57 between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628, Woodhead Pass, between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, the Cat and Fiddle Road from Macclesfield to Buxton, and in the north, the A635 from Manchester to Barnsley. Roads and lanes are frequently congested and the availability of parking spaces in towns and villages is a significant problem, especially during summer. A congestion charge was proposed in 2005, but was rejected. The Cromford Canal opened in 1794, to carry coal, lead and iron ore to the Erewash Canal, it was abandoned in 1944. The canal turnpike roads had to compete with railways after 1825. The first railway, the Cromford and High Peak Railway from High Peak Junction to Whaley Bridge, was an industrial line, but passenger services followed, including the Woodhead Line (Sheffield to Manchester via Longdendale) and the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway. Several rail lines were closed in the 1960s as a result of the Beeching Axe. Public transport Totley Tunnel on the Manchester to Sheffield line The Peak District is accessible by public transport. Train services operate along the Hope Valley line between Sheffield and Manchester, the Derwent Valley line between Derby and Matlock, the Buxton and Glossop lines, linking them to Manchester, and the Huddersfield line from Manchester to Huddersfield. Coach services provide access to Matlock, Bakewell and Buxton from Derby, Nottingham and Manchester through TransPeak and National Express, and there are regular buses from Sheffield, Glossop, Stoke, Leek and Chesterfield. The nearest airports are Manchester, Doncaster Sheffield, and East Midlands. In rural areas, villages are served by internal transport links. Minibuses operate from the towns to smaller villages. The Hope Valley and Buxton Line trains serve stations at Hathersage, Hope and Edale. Cycle England invested ¬£1.25 million to build and improve cycle routes in the national park for leisure and commuting. Conservation issues Derwent Reservoir The proximity of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses challenges for managing the area. The park authority, the National Trust and other landowners attempt to keep the upland landscape accessible for recreation while protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors. Tension exists between the needs of the 38,000 residents, the needs of the millions of people who visit, and conservation requirements. The uneven distribution of visitors creates stresses. Dovedale alone receives about two million visitors annually. Other highly visited areas include Bakewell, Castleton and the Hope Valley, Chatsworth, Hartington and the reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley. More than 60% of visits take place between May and September, with Sunday the busiest day. Footpath users in the more popular walking areas have contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands. The use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed to have exacerbated the problem. Measures to contain the damage include the diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes via Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and surfacing moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Some rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4√ó4s and trail bikes. Campaigners have sought to reduce their impact. Large-scale limestone quarrying is contentious. Most mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s and remain legally binding. The park authority has a policy of considering applications for new quarries and licence renewal in the park in terms of the local and national need for the mineral and how unique the source is, in conjunction with the effects on traffic, residents and the environment. Some licences have not been renewed; the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill closed in 1999 and landscaped. Proposals from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re-open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor in 1999 became a test case, hotly contested by ecological protesters and residents on the grounds that the development would threaten Bronze Age remains at the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, and damage the natural landscape. In 2007, negotiations took place to relocate the development to Dale View quarry in a less sensitive area. From the 1990s onwards there has been an intensification in the management of the upland moors for driven grouse shooting. This has involved an increase in the use of rotational burning and predator control. Both practices can be controversial and have led to calls for greater controls over the activities of moorland owners. The Birds of Prey Initiative has worked to link conservation groups with landowners in order to improve the prospects for predatory birds in the Peak District. This has lead to some improvement in the numbers of breeding birds of prey, but overall numbers remain low. The grasslands of the White Peak plateau have largely been improved for intensive agricultural production in response to the desire to expand food production. The result has been that the majority of this grassland is of very little value to nature conservation with often just a single grass species present. The best areas that remain are on the steep sides of the limestone valleys. These are of international importance but are fragmented into small areas making them more vulnerable to loss. Biodiversity with in Britain's national parks has generally faired no better than that in the wider countryside with similar percentage declines in species numbers. One reason for this maybe that their powers are directed primarily at preventing intrusive development to protect the aesthetic and historic appearance of the park rather than towards land management. The upland moors of the south Pennines have suffered some of the worst ecological degradation of any extensive habitat in the UK. This is due primarily to a history of industrial pollution from the neighbouring towns during the industrial revolution made worse by wild fires and erosion. Work to restore this habitat has been underway for 20 years (2020) and while progress has been made there is more to do to restore the habitat to a sustainable fully functioning ecosystem. The significance of the habitat degradation is compounded by being a major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide which contributes to climate change through global warming. Peak District in literature and arts The landscapes of the Peak have inspired writers for centuries. Various places have been identified by Ralph Elliott and others as locations in the 14th-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Lud's Church is thought to be the Green Chapel. Chatsworth House, the setting for a recent adaptation of Pride and Prejudice Key scenes in Jane Austen's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice are set in the Peak. Peveril of the Peak (1823) by Sir Walter Scott is a historical novel set at Peveril Castle, Castleton during the reign of Charles II. William Wordsworth was a frequent visitor to Matlock; the Peak inspired several of his poems, including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House. The village of Morton in Charlotte Bront√´'s 1847 novel Jane Eyre is based on Hathersage, where Bront√´ stayed in 1845, and Thornfield Hall might have been inspired by nearby North Lees Hall. Snowfield in George Eliot's first novel Adam Bede (1859) is believed to be based on Wirksworth, where her uncle managed a mill; Ellastone (as Hayslope) and Ashbourne (as Oakbourne) also feature. Beatrix Potter, the author of Peter Rabbit, visited her uncle Edmund Potter at his printworks in Dinting Vale. She copied cloth samples from his pattern book to dress her characters. Mrs Tiggywinkle's shawl, in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, is based on pattern number 222714. Children's author Alison Uttley (1884‚Äì1976) was born at Cromford; her novel A Traveller in Time, set in Dethick, recounts the Babington Plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from imprisonment. Crichton Porteous (1901‚Äì91) set several books in locations in the Peak; Toad Hole, Lucky Columbell and Broken River are set in the Derwent Valley. Geraldine Brooks's first novel, Year of Wonders (2001), blends fact and fiction to tell the story of the plague village of Eyam. Eyam also inspired Children of Winter by children's novelist Berlie Doherty who has set several other works in the Peak, including Deep Secret, based on the drowning of the villages of Derwent and Ashopton by the Ladybower Reservoir, and Blue John, inspired by the cavern at Castleton. Ladybower Reservoir in the Upper Derwent Valley, set location for The Dam BustersMany works of crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859‚Äì1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the kidnapping of a child in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many horror stories by local author Robert Murray Gilchrist feature Peak settings. Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor. Other writers and poets who lived in or visited the Peak include Samuel Johnson, William Congreve, Anna Seward, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, Richard Furness, D. H. Lawrence, Vera Brittain, Richmal Crompton and Nat Gould. The landscapes and historic houses are popular settings for film and television. The classic 1955 film The Dam Busters was filmed at the Upper Derwent Valley reservoirs, where practice flights for the bombing raids on the Ruhr dams had been made during the Second World War. In adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, Longnor has featured as Lambton, and Lyme Park and Chatsworth House have stood in for Pemberley. Haddon Hall doubled as Thornfield Hall in two different adaptations of Jane Eyre and has appeared in several films including Elizabeth, The Princess Bride and The Other Boleyn Girl. The television medical drama Peak Practice set in the fictional village of Cardale was filmed in Crich, Matlock and other Peak locations. The world's longest-running sitcom, Last of the Summer Wine, was filmed in Holmfirth and the surrounding Holme Valley.

He is known best as the co-founder, leader, principal theorist and chief apologist of surrealism.Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.1 (Facts on File, 2005): 84. His writings include the first Surrealist Manifesto (Manifeste du surr√©alisme) of 1924, in which he defined surrealism as \\"pure psychic automatism\\". Along his role as leader of the surrealist movement he is the author of celebrated books such as \\"Nadja\\" and \\"L'Amour fou\\". Those activities combined with his critical and theoretical work for writing and the plastic arts, made Andr√© Breton a major figure in twentieth-century French art and literature. Biography Andr√© Breton was the only son born to a family of modest means in Tinchebray (Orne) in Normandy, France. His father, Louis-Justin Breton, was a policeman, tolerant, good-natured, and atheistic, and his mother, Marguerite-Marie-Eug√©nie Le Gougu√®s, was a former seamstress, cold, domineering, inclined to self- righteous bigotry, and a strict disciplinarian. Breton attended medical school, where he developed a particular interest in mental illness. His education was interrupted when he was conscripted for World War I. During World War I, he worked in a neurological ward in Nantes, where he met the devotee of Alfred Jarry, Jacques Vach√©, whose anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition influenced Breton considerably. Vach√© committed suicide when aged 24, and his war-time letters to Breton and others were published in a volume entitled Lettres de guerre (1919), for which Breton wrote four introductory essays. Breton married his first wife, Simone Kahn, on 15 September 1921. The couple relocated to rue Fontaine 42 in Paris on 1 January 1922. The apartment on rue Fontaine (in the Pigalle district) became home to Breton's collection of more than 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art. Like his father, he was an atheist.Reviewing Mark Polizzotti's Revolution of the Mind: The Life of Andr√© Breton Douglas F. Smith called him, \\"[a] cynical atheist, the poet, critic, and artist harbored an irrepressible streak of romanticism.\\"\\"To speak of God, to think of God, is in every respect to show what one is made of.... I have always wagered against God and I regard the little that I have won in this world as simply the outcome of this bet. However paltry may have been the stake (my life) I am conscious of having won to the full. Everything that is doddering, squint-eyed, vile, polluted and grotesque is summoned up for me in that one word: God!\\" - Andr√© Breton, taking from a footnote from his book, Surrealism and Painting. Quotations by the poet: Andre Breton From Dada to Surrealism Breton launched the review Litt√©rature in 1919, with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. He also associated with Dadaist Tristan Tzara. In 1924, he was instrumental in the founding of the Bureau of Surrealist Research. In Les Champs Magn√©tiques (The Magnetic Fields), a collaboration with Soupault, he implemented the principle of automatic writing. He published the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, and was editor of the magazine La R√©volution surr√©aliste from that year on. A group of writers became associated with him: Soupault, Louis Aragon, Paul √âluard, Ren√© Crevel, Michel Leiris, Benjamin P√©ret, Antonin Artaud, and Robert Desnos. Anxious to combine the themes of personal transformation found in the works of Arthur Rimbaud with the politics of Karl Marx, Breton joined the French Communist Party in 1927, from which he was expelled in 1933. Nadja, a novel about his encounter with an imaginative woman who later became mentally ill, was published in 1928. Breton celebrated the concept of Mad Love, and many women joined the surrealist group over the years. Toyen was a good friend. During this time, he survived mostly by the sale of paintings from his art gallery. In 1930, Un Cadavre, a pamphlet, was written and released by several members of the surrealist movement who were insulted by Breton or had otherwise disbelieved in his leadership. The pamphlet criticized Breton's oversight and influence over the movement. It marked a divide amidst the early surrealists. In 1935, there was a conflict between Breton and the Soviet writer and journalist Ilya Ehrenburg during the first International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, which opened in Paris in June. Breton had been insulted by Ehrenburg‚Äîalong with all fellow surrealists‚Äîin a pamphlet which said, among other things, that surrealists were \\"pederasts\\". Breton slapped Ehrenburg several times on the street, which resulted in surrealists being expelled from the Congress. Ren√© Crevel, who according to Salvador Dal√≠ was \\"the only serious communist among surrealists\\", was isolated from Breton and other surrealists, who were unhappy with Crevel because of his bisexuality and annoyed with communists in general. In 1938, Breton accepted a cultural commission from the French government to travel to Mexico. After a conference at the National Autonomous University of Mexico about surrealism, Breton stated after getting lost in Mexico City (as no one was waiting for him at the airport) \\"I don't know why I came here. Mexico is the most surrealist country in the world\\". However, visiting Mexico provided the opportunity to meet Leon Trotsky. Breton and other surrealists traveled via a long boat ride from Patzcuaro to the town of Erongar√≠cuaro. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were among the visitors to the hidden community of intellectuals and artists. Together, Breton and Trotsky wrote the Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art (published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera) calling for \\"complete freedom of art\\", which was becoming increasingly difficult with the world situation of the time. World War II and exile Breton was again in the medical corps of the French Army at the start of World War II. The Vichy government banned his writings as \\"the very negation of the national revolution\\"Franklin Rosemont Andr√© Breton and the First Principles of Surrealism, 1978, . and Breton escaped, with the help of the American Varian Fry and Hiram \\"Harry\\" Bingham IV, to the United States and the Caribbean during 1941. He emigrated to New York City and lived there for a few years. In 1942, Breton organized a groundbreaking surrealist exhibition at Yale University. In 1942,Andr√© Breton, Fata Morgana. Buenos Aires: √âditions des lettres fran√ßaises, Sur, 1942. Breton collaborated with artist Wifredo Lam on the publication of Breton's poem \\"Fata Morgana\\", which was illustrated by Lam. Breton got to know Martinican writer Aim√© C√©saire, and later composed the introduction to the 1947 edition of C√©saire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal. During his exile in New York City he met Elisa Bindhoff, the Chilean woman who would become his third wife. In 1944, he and Elisa traveled to the Gasp√© Peninsula in Qu√©bec, where he wrote Arcane 17, a book which expresses his fears of World War II, describes the marvels of the Perc√© Rock and the extreme northeastern part of North America, and celebrates his new romance with Elisa. During his visit to Haiti in 1945‚Äì46, he sought to connect surrealist politics and automatist practices with the legacies of the Haitian Revolution and the ritual practices of Vodou possession. Recent developments in Haitian painting were central to his efforts, as can be seen from a comment that Breton left in the visitors' book at the Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince: \\"Haitian painting will drink the blood of the phoenix. And, with the epaulets of [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines, it will ventilate the world.\\" Breton was specifically referring to the work of painter and Vodou priest Hector Hyppolite, whom he identified as the first artist to directly depict Vodou scenes and the lwa (Vodou deities), as opposed to hiding them in chromolithographs of Catholic saints or invoking them through impermanent vev√© (abstracted forms drawn with powder during rituals). Breton's writings on Hyppolite were undeniably central to the artist's international status from the late 1940s on, but the surrealist readily admitted that his understanding of Hyppolite's art was inhibited by their lack of a common language. Returning to France with multiple paintings by Hyppolite, Breton integrated this artwork into the increased surrealist focus on the occult, myth, and magic. Later life Breton in the 1960s Breton returned to Paris in 1946, where he opposed French colonialism (for example as a signatory of the Manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War) and continued, until his death, to foster a second group of surrealists in the form of expositions or reviews (La Br√®che, 1961‚Äì65). In 1959, he organized an exhibit in Paris. By the end of World War II, Andr√© Breton decided to embrace anarchism explicitly. In 1952, Breton wrote \\"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\\" Breton consistently supported the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists around founder and Secretary General Georges Fontenis transformed the FA into the F√©d√©ration communiste libertaire. Like a small number of intellectuals during the time of the Algerian War, he continued to support the FCL when it was forced to go underground, even providing shelter to Fontenis (who was in hiding). He refused to take sides in the politically divided French anarchist movement, even though both he (along with P√©ret) expressed solidarity to the new Anarchist Federation rebuilt by a group of synthesist anarchists. He also worked with the FA in the Anti-Fascist Committees in the 1960s. Death Andr√© Breton died at the age of 70 in 1966, and was buried in the Cimeti√®re des Batignolles in Paris. Legacy Breton as a collector Breton was an avid collector of art, ethnographic material, and unusual trinkets. He was particularly interested in materials from the northwest coast of North America. During a financial crisis he experienced in 1931, most of his collection (along with that of his friend Paul √âluard) was auctioned. He subsequently rebuilt the collection in his studio and home at 42 rue Fontaine. The collection grew to over 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art.Andr√© Breton, 42, rue Fontaine: tableaux modernes, sculptures, estampes, tableaux anciens. Paris: CalmelsCohen, 2003. French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss, in an interview in 1971, spoke about Breton's skill in determining the authenticity of objects. Strauss even described their friendship while the two were living in New York: \\"We lived in New York between 1941 and 1945 in a great friendship, running museums and antiquarians together. I owe him a lot about the knowledge and appreciation of objects. I've never seen him [Breton] doing a mistake on exotic and unusual objects. When I say a mistake, I mean about its authenticity but also its quality. He [Breton] had a sense, almost of divination.\\" After Breton's death on 28 September 1966, his third wife, Elisa, and his daughter, Aube, allowed students and researchers access to his archive and collection. After thirty- six years, when attempts to establish a surrealist foundation to protect the collection were opposed, the collection was auctioned by Calmels Cohen at Drouot-Richelieu. A wall of the apartment is preserved at the Centre Georges Pompidou.\\"Surrealist Art\\", Centre Pompidou - Art Culture Mus. 11 March 2010. centrepompidou.fr Nine previously unpublished manuscripts, including the Manifeste du surr√©alisme, were auctioned by Sotheby's in May 2008.
