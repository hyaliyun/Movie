For nearly three decades, Iran and Sudan enjoyed a close relationship. However, Sudan decided to expel all Iranian groups just hours before joining a Saudi military operation in Yemen in March 2015http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/03/26/Sudan-closes- offices-of-all-Iranian-missions-and-groups.html. as the Sudanese President is said to be calculating in favour of his fragile economy in addition to the trauma and horror which struck the Sudanese society when seeing its best and brightest joining the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) this March, generating a huge public alarm about regional security.

On January 4, 2016 Sudan cut off all diplomatic relations with Iran due to tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/bahrain-cuts-ties-with-tehran-as- crisis-widens-in-saudi-iran- split/2016/01/04/145c8824-b271-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html. As a result, the bond between both countries has severely soured. Once allies, both countries are listed by the United States as \\"State Sponsors of Terrorism\\" although Sudan began improving relations with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia while Iran remains hostile to its adversary since 1979. History Sudan maintained good relations with the Shah's Iran, securing a number of loans during the period prior to the Iranian revolution. Following the revolution, Sudan, led by pro-West Gaafar Nimeiry, supported Iraq in its war with Iran, in line with Arab League policy. Sudan's Prime Minister Sadiq al Mahdi made an official visit to Tehran in the late 1980s thus establishing ties with the Islamic Republic. Following the Islamist-supported military coup led by Omar al- Bashir, Sudan sought close relations with Iran. The growing ties help continue the Islamisation of Sudan.Iran, Sudan and Islam https://www.jstor.org/pss/40396511 In the post-Cold War era, Sudan remains Iran's closest ally in Africa. Sudan was for years the only African state ruled by Islamists. The two states, despite the \\"Sunni-Shiite divide\\" quickly became close allies. Sudan had a long, if inconsistent, relationship with Iran, which deteriorated when Sudan supported Iraq during the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War but began to improve by the mid-1990s. In 1991, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani made an official visit to Khartoum, accompanied by more than 150 Iranian officials.\\" He declared the \\"Islamic Revolution of Sudan, alongside Iran's pioneer revolution, can doubtless be the source of movement and revolution throughout the Islamic world.\\" Sudanese‚ÄìIranian interaction increased significantly in 2004. The two countries signed a memorandum on security cooperation, and Sudan stressed Iran‚Äôs right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. During the eighth session of the Iran‚ÄìSudan joint economic commission, the two sides agreed to increase technical, educational, and research cooperation in the agricultural sector. Iranian president Muhammad Khatami, during a visit to Sudan in October 2004, supported Khartoum‚Äôs controversial handling of the Darfur crisis and signed bilateral cooperation agreements on economic, agricultural, and banking issues. As Iran became an increasingly important actor in the Middle East, Sudan increased its interaction with Tehran. Al-Bashir visited Iran in April 2006. Sudan‚Äôs defense minister discussed Iranian weapons sales and training for Khartoum‚Äôs security forces during a visit to Tehran in January 2007. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Khartoum in February 2007, when he voiced strong support for Sudan and signed seven agreements. There continued to be high-level contact between Sudan and Iran. Sunni Sudan did not find forging close relations with Shia Iran an insuperable difficulty, and as of 2011 Sudan was arguably Iran‚Äôs closest friend in Africa. Economic relations In 1991, evidence of increasing economic and military links between Sudan and Iran was revealed. High-level Iranian leaders have made numerous visits to Sudan, during which a trade agreement between the two countries have been established. Economic bilateral relations continue to be a focus area of the Iran‚ÄìSudan relationship.http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/sudan-government.htm Sudan Government, Politics, Foreign affairs ‚Äì Relations with Egypt, Libya, Iran and USA. Iran is suspected of supplying Sudan with one million tons of oil each year. Military relations In November 1993, Iran was reported to have financed Sudan's purchase of some 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft. Iran pledged 17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government, and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese army.A Deadly Love Triangle http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/401vcvba.asp It was reported that Iran sent up to 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards to Sudan. Iranian Defense Minister Ali Akbar Torkan met with the commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces to negotiate further military assistance. Sudan has since modeled its army after Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who had trained them. In 1995, a military delegation from Iran visited Khartoum to assess Sudan's military needs. Iran provided Sudan with armored cars, heavy artillery, and radar equipment. In the following year, the two countries signed an agreement to broaden the scope of their cooperation. In April 1996 the Government was reported to be granting the Iranian navy the use of marine facilities in exchange for financial assistance for the purchase of arms although, in response to a Sudanese request for military aid in 1997, Iran provided assistance only with military maintenance. The West has expressed deep concern over the growing military ties between Sudan and Iran. Sudan has been implicated in training at least 10 paramilitary camps in collaboration with the Iranian military and Iran-backed terrorist groups. By 1993, the U.S. Department of State named Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism. Overview of State Sponsored Terrorism In 2008, Sudan and Iran signed a military cooperation agreement. The agreement was signed by Iran's Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar and his Sudanese counterpart Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein.Sudan, Iran sign military cooperation agreement During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Western intelligence agencies reported Iran's Quds Force stole dozens of Russian-made surface-to-air missiles from Libya and smuggled them across the border into Sudan. According to the reports, the weapons included SA-24 missiles, which were sold to Libya in 2004. Intelligence officials also believe that other weapons were seized from Gaddafi and are now held at a secret facility run by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in Northern Darfur.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8782103/Iran- steals-surface-to-air-missiles-from-Libya.html Iran 'steals surface-to-air missiles from Libya' In a leaked document from summer 2014, the ties between Iran and Sudan are described as being ‚Äústrategic‚Äù, ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù and ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù.

The center of pressure is the point on a body where the total sum of a pressure field acts, causing a force and no moment about that point. The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point.Chapman (1994), Piloting Seamanship & Small Boat Handling, 61st Edition, Hearst Marine Books, New York. The relationship of the aerodynamic center of pressure on the sails of a sailboat to the hydrodynamic center of lateral resistance on the hull determines the behavior of the sailboat in the wind. This behavior is known as the \\"helm\\" and is either a Weather helm or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both from the standpoint of the \\"feel\\" of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails and pointing into oncoming waves. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm. The fundamental cause of \\"helm\\", be it weather or lee, is the relationship of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, the result is a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel to want to turn into the wind. If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull, a \\"lee\\" helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous. Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience.  Other boats  Other boats, including kayaks, are subject to the same phenomena. To counter this, they use a rudder or skeg.

Johnson received his PhD at Iowa State in 1945 under the supervision of Theodore Schultz.http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/13996/ In the mid-1940s, a group of agricultural economists led by Schultz and Johnson moved to the University of Chicago. Johnson served as department chair from 1971-1975 and 1980-1984 and was president of the American Economics Association in 1999. Their research in farm and agricultural economics was widely influential and attracted funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to the agricultural economics program at the University. Among the graduate students and faculty affiliated with the pair in the 1940s and 1950s were Clifford Hardin, Zvi Griliches, Marc Nerlove, and George S. Tolley.Sumner, Daniel A.

The Three Crowned rulers, or the Three Glorified by Heaven or World of the Three, primarily known as Moovendhar, refers to the triumvirate of Chera, Chola and Pandya who dominated the politics of the ancient Tamil country, Tamilakam, from their three Nadu (countries) of Chola Nadu, Pandya Nadu (present day Madurai and Tirunelveli) and Chera Nadu (present day Karur in Tamil Nadu and Kerala) in southern India. They signalled a time of integration and political identity for the Tamil people. They would frequently wage war against one another under a period of instability until the Imperial period of Rajaraja I who united Tamilakam under one leadership.  Origins  The etymology of the Tamil word for the three kings ‚Äì Moovendhar (pronounced M≈´vƒìntar) ‚Äì comes from and , so strictly should be translated as 'Lord' (lesser-king) as opposed to 'King' which in Tamil is ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ©‡Øç (K≈çn). They are mentioned by Megasthenes and the Edicts of Ashoka, and first in Tolkappiyam among Tamil literature who was the first to call them Three Glorified by Heaven (). Ptolemy and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mention three kingdoms ruling Tamilakam.  Pandyas  The seats of Muvendhas lie in the modern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu The Pandyas were the earliest of the Muvendhar and were of high antiquity being mentioned by KƒÅtyƒÅyana and Valmiki. However the establishment of a Pandya territory is not known until the sixth century under King Kadungon who liberated the Pandya country from the Kalabhras. Xuanzang reports that Jainism was flourishing while Buddhism was declining during this period. They were famous for being patrons of the Tamil Sangams which were held in their capital, Madurai. Pliny mentions the Pandya country and its capital. The large number of Roman coins from Emperor Augustus to Emperor Zeno found in Madurai shows that trade flourished among Rome, Greece and Tamilakam. Two embassies sent from the Pandya dynasty to Emperor Augustus were recorded. The Roman and Greek writers praise Korkai (now called Tuticorin or Thoothukudi) as the seaport of the Pandyas.  Literature  The Silappatikaram alludes to the solar ancestry of the Cholas and the lunar ancestry of the Pandyas. It does not mention anything about the ancestry of the Cheras. The 15th century Tamil Mahabharata of Villiputtur Alvar describes the Chera king as from the fire dynasty, retaining the solar and lunar origins for the Chola and the Pandya kings respectively. The Tiruvilayatar Puranam (or Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam), possibly from the 17th century, also states that when Brahma re-created the world after a deluge, he created the Chera, Chola and the Pandya kings as descendants of the fire, the sun and the moon respectively. Chola Purva Patayam (\\"Ancient Chola Record\\"), a Tamil language manuscript of uncertain date, contains a legend about the divine origin of the three crowned kings. According to it, the Shramana king Shalivahana (also known as Bhoja in this story) defeated Vikramaditya, and started persecuting the worshipers of Shiva and Vishnu. After failing to kill Shalivahana with a rain of fire, Shiva created three kings: Vira Cholan (Chola), Ula Cheran (Chera), and Vajranga Pandiyan (Pandya). The three kings came to bathe together at the triveni sangam (three-river confluence) in Thirumukkoodal, and formed an alliance against Shalivahana. Next, they went through a number of adventures at various places, including Kashi and Kanchi. With the blessings of Durga, they found treasure and inscriptions of Hindu kings from the age of Shantanu to Vikramaditya. They then reached Cudatturiyur (possibly Uraiyur), where Vira Cholan wrote letters to all those who worshipped Shiva and Vishnu, seeking their help against Shalivahana. A number of people assembled at Cudatturiyur to support the three kings' campaign. When Shalivahana heard of this preparation, he marched towards the south and took possession of the strong citadel at Tiruchirappalli. The three kings sent their envoy to Shalivahana, asking him to surrender and renounce his faith. When he refused, they and their allies assembled an army at Thiruvanaikaval. From an inscription that they had earlier found at Kanchi, they realised that there was a subterranean entrance into the Tiruchirappalli fort. They sent a few soldiers who entered the fort and opened its Chintamani gate. Their forces then entered the fortress, and defeated Shalivahana. Chola Purva Patayam dates Shalivahana's defeat to the year 1443 of an uncertain calendar era (possibly from the beginning of Kali Yuga).

History NARSS is an outgrowth of Remote Sensing Center, established in 1971 as an American-Egyptian joint project, they were affiliated with the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology. In 1994 the authority was established as an organization under the State Ministry of Scientific Research to promote the use of state of the art space technology for the development of the country and introducing High Tech capabilities to regional planning and other applications. NARSS includes two major sectors: Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. The sector of remote sensing works on the use of data provided by earth observation satellites and various airborne sensors to produce maps and spatial data for the evaluation and monitoring of natural resources, natural hazards and management environmental. The sector of space sciences is concerned with the development of sensors for earth observation to be mounted on satellites and with all the problems involved with monitoring communication with satellites and retrieving the information for processing, and ultimately on launching an Egyptian remote sensing satellite. Facilities Both the headquarters and the New Cairo space control station are located in Cairo. The receiving station is located in Aswan. Satellites EgyptSat 1 was a remote sensing satellite that was launched on 17 April 2007 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. Control and communication was lost July 2010.The satellite weighed 100 kg and contained a multi-spectral imager for Earth observations.

Closing out an eventful decade, in which the centuries-old institution of monarchy Nepal was replaced by an elected government, Shakya connects the history of Nepal to the current economic situation, and its implications.  Origins  Shakya is a Neoliberal management consultant who had been publishing a popular column with the pseudonym Artha Beed in the Nepali Times and is currently a weekly columnist for the local newspaper The Kathmandu Post. He writes the book from the perspective of a globally experienced private sector person with deep knowledge and experience of the Nepali economy. The foreword by Gurucharan Das links the inspiration of the book to the 2000 India Unbound. Ashraf Ghani, now President of Afghanistan, has written the introduction to the book.  Overview  The past decade has been an eventful one for Nepal. It has featured thwarted attempts at democracy, a royal massacre and a coup, and finally Maoist guerrillas coming over ground, winning a popular electoral mandate and decisively ending the centuries-old institution of monarchy. Unleashing Nepal has been written at a time when many fundamental questions on economic rights are being raised by an ever more assertive citizenry. It narrates the chequered history of Nepal's economy- from the time of unification, through decades of autocracy, mixed economy and foreign aid dependence, to the 'conflictonomics' of the Maoist guerrilla war and a remittance economy driven by the labour of Nepali diaspora. Unleashing Nepal will also tell the stories of figures who are a crucial part of Nepal's economic life‚Äîthe night watchman in India or Dubai, the selfish aristocrat of the past, the foreign aid worker and the modestly venal government servant. More unusually, the reader will read about Nepali youth with global desires and resourceful village communities who manage electricity while Kathmandu is plunged in darkness. The revised edition has a new Afterword that talks about the last 4 years, since the book was written in 2009. The changes that have taken place, and the changes that continue to take place. The four years could not have been more eventful as Nepal moves into another phase of electing a new Constituent Assembly, deciding on its federal structure, its form of government and the level of economic empowerment. The afterword talks about that and much more.

She is the author or co-author of eight nonfiction books including the oral history Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years, a New York Times bestseller for 113 weeks according to its archives. Departing from her non- fiction work, Hearth wrote her first novel, Miss Dreamsville and the Collier County Women's Literary Society, in 2011. It was published on October 2, 2012. Hearth's most recent book, published January 2, 2018, is Streetcar to Justice: How Elizabeth Jennings Won the Right to Ride in New York. Written for middle- grade to adult readers, and published by HarperCollins/Greenwillow Books, the book is the first biography of civil rights pioneer Elizabeth Jennings Graham.Hearth, Amy Hill. Streetcar to Justice: How Elizabeth Jennings Won the Right to Ride in New York. New York: HarperCollins/Greenwillow Books, 2018. Life and career Amy Hearth spent her childhood in Columbia, South Carolina, and her young adult years in Florida. She is a thirteenth-generation American whose ancestors fought for independence in the Revolutionary War. She has some Native American (Lenni-Lenape) ancestry as well, and was given the Native name \\"Smiling Songbird Woman\\" by the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Indians in a tribal ceremony in 2010 in honor of her oral history about their tribal matriarch, Strong Medicine Speaks: A Native American Elder Has Her Say. She attended the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, majoring in Sociology, then transferred to the University of Tampa, Florida editing the college newspaper and earning a B.A. in Writing. Her first newspaper job was assistant arts and entertainment editor at The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and her first full-time reporting job was at the Daytona Beach News-Journal in Florida. She met her future husband, a native of Naples, Florida, when she interviewed him for a story. Hearth relocated to the New York area, and subsequently wrote eighty-eight bylined news and feature stories for The New York Times. This included her article on the Delany Sisters, \\"Two Maiden Ladies with Stories to Tell\\". Hearth is a college lecturer. In January 2012, for example, she was a visiting author at the University of Tampa, her alma mater. She and author Michael Connelly appeared together at what was billed by the university as its \\"Official Opening Reading\\" of the university's newly launched Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program. She and her husband live in the greater New York area. Having Our Say Among Hearth's New York Times stories was a September 22, 1991, feature on a then-unknown pair of a centenarian sisters, Sadie Delany and Bessie Delany, with the headline, \\"Two 'Maiden Ladies' With Century-Old Stories to Tell\\". In an interview in the October‚ÄìNovember 2007 issue of Book Women magazine, Hearth said that her interest in telling people's stories was the reason she tracked down the reclusive Delany sisters and asked for an interview. When she finally met them, they were reluctant to be interviewed. In a New York Times story published on April 2, 1995, she recalled: > They didn't think they were important enough. I had to convince them and > gave this little impromptu speech - that I thought it was very important > that people from their generation be represented, especially black women who > hadn't had much opportunity. I guess my enthusiasm rubbed off. Following the article's publication, Hearth was asked by Kodansha America, a book publisher, to expand it into a full-length biography. She decided, instead, to create an oral history and worked with the Delany sisters for almost two years to gather material for the book. The book was published in 1993. It became a New York Times Bestseller for 113 weeks and was also on the bestseller lists of The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today and Publishers Weekly. Reflecting on her early career as a journalist, she said: \\"I did the hard stuff. I've been in a police car going 130 miles per hour chasing someone...but I always loved finding a feature where I could really get into someone's life story.\\" The Dallas Morning News, in its review of Having Our Say, wrote that Hearth: \\"worked carefully to preserve the speech patterns and personalities of each sister in the text so the stories unfold as complementary harmonies of the same melody. With Hearth's contributions‚Äîshe was credited as an advisor and production consultant‚Äîthe books were adapted to the Broadway stage in 1995 and for film in 1999. The film version features the actress Amy Madigan playing the role of Hearth. For her work on the film, Hearth received a George Foster Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting. Hearth was one of two authors whose work was the subject of extensive analysis in the academic book, Women Co-Authors Author Holly A. Larid notes that the tone of Having Our Say is set when: \\"Hearth writes in her preface, 'Their story, as the Delany sisters like to say, is not meant as \\"black\\" history or \\"women's\\" history but American history.'\\" Other works In the 2009 Contemporary Authors feature on Hearth's career, she explained her writing process: > To me, the first step in the creation of an oral history is developing a > relationship of trust with my subject. Then it is a matter of complete > immersion in my subject's world, listening with an almost other-worldly > intensity, asking the perfect questions, and being extremely sensitive to > the nuances of what the person is telling me. While it goes without saying > that I do scrupulous research and fact-checking for each project, what makes > my books special, I think, is that I have an ear for capturing the authentic > voice of my subject.

He ranks among the best known German portrayers of the 20th Century. Rittner's portraits of Ludwig Erhard as well as of Kurt Georg Kiesinger are the foundation of the Gallery of Chancellors, established in 1976 by former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in the Bundeskanzleramt in Berlin. Self-portrait of G√ºnter Rittner 1997 Life Rittner, as early as six years old, had already created portraits of his grandparents. In 1939 he painted the injured as well as ordinary soldiers in a military hospital located in the Giant Mountains. In the same year he started attending evening classes in scenery painting at the Breslau School of Fine Arts, where he met his friend and colleague Hans-Ulrich Buchwald, painter and illustrator. In 1943, his first self-portrait (oil on canvas) won the first prize in a rural competition. His father urged him to become an art-teacher, but that did not suit him. In 1944 Rittner received his military-draft and one year later he got in captivity as a prisoner of war, where at first he drew portraits of his fellow prisoners on toilet-paper by use of a borrowed pencil. Later on he painted the onsite security force and finally the camp commander, who from now on provided material and paint. After his release the same year, he financed his further studies in Fine Arts by portraying members of the American occupation force in Germany, hence improving his talent. In 1948 he settled in Munich, his second home, where he attended the Munich Academy of Fine Arts until 1953. His taskmasters were the professors Josef Hillerbrand as well as Walther Teutsch. The immediate impressions of the war time, including human suffering and dying, now came to the surface. His ideals Ernst Barlach and K√§the Kollwitz inspired him in similar ways as did C√©zanne, van Gogh, Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec. In 1953 Rittner started working as a freelancer. In the following years he travelled to Italy, France and England on educational journeys, where he created numerous paintings of cities and landscapes. In 1966 his works were exhibited publicly for the first time in the Munich Deutsches Theatermuseum. Many orders from the world of politics, business and science followed, among them those of former Chancellors Ludwig Erhard and Kurt Georg Kiesinger 1974‚Äì1976, as well as the portrait of the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Walter Scheel in 1975 for the Scheel-Foundation. Rittner travelled to Greece for further studies in 1978 and in the following year he managed to participate in an exhibition of the Kasseler Kunstverein (member based art society with exhibition space). In 1980 Rittner married and moved with his family first to Mallorca, then to Gran Canaria. Rittner got divorced however. He is father of a son. In 1989 Rittner was awarded the German Federal Cross of Merit. As honorary citizen of the city of Solingen, Walter Scheel was portrayed a second time by the painter in 1996. Rittner then donated the honorarium of DM 23000 to the Diesterweg-Foundation for learning-disabled children. Nowadays Rittner lives on Gran Canaria in the wintertime; he states however: \\"I will never give up on Munich, since the city inspires me.\\" Work Therese Giehse (1966) Hans Jochen Vogel (1977) Press Room Foyer and Gallery of the Chancellors In 1950 Rittner portrayed Princess Pilar of Bavaria. She turned out to be very helpful for him, since being a painter herself, she appreciated Fine Arts very much. Furthermore, as President of the German-American Ladies Club, she was in a position to pave many ways for him. Yet in the same year he was hired to portray George N. Shuster, then U.S. Land Commissioner for Bavaria, as well as eight leading actors of the Oberammergau Passion Play. In 1952 he created outlines of Werner Krau√ü, Will Quadflieg and Hermine K√∂rner at the German Theatre in Hamburg. In 1954 and 1955 he painted the movie director Paul Verhoeven, as well as the actors Luise Ullrich, Winnie Markus, Carola H√∂hn and Bertl Schultes. In 1964 paintings of Curd J√ºrgens followed as well as in 1965 portraits of Paul Dahlke. Furthermore, Rittner had meanwhile painted former Bavarian Prime Ministers Fritz Sch√§ffer, Wilhelm Hoegner and Alfons Goppel by order of the Bavarian State Chancellery. In October 1964 Sch√§ffer made a comment concerning the portrait of him ‚ÄûRittner's painting forces people to cogitate on me though ‚Äì this flatters me.‚Äú Among the important scientists portrayed by the painter are Feodor Lynen, Munich Biochemist (1964 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine) as well as Werner Leibbrand, Medical Historian. The co-operation with Pianist Elly Ney was of major significance to Rittner, since the interactive influence made him paint in an astonishing expressive way. A formerly unknown universe had opened. He described it as follows: ‚Äû[...] The mental interchange was so immense and full of joy, I was able to live on it for years. [...] The artist enthused people by her dedication to music, her humanness rising from her gentle heart and last but not least her virtuosity.‚Äú In 1966, Rittner created the expressive and perfect in form portrait of Therese Giehse, giving the main character of Mother Courage in Berthold Brecht‚Äôs play Mother Courage and Her Children. Upon the recommendation of Herbert Hohenemser, Municipal Consultant for Fine Arts of Munich, Rittner began creating a gallery of prominent members of the Munich Kammerspiele Theatre. Among them are Peter L√ºhr, Rudolf Vogel and Robert Graf, as well as Gertrud K√ºckelmann, Rolf Boysen and in 1967 Fritz Kortner. Furthermore, in 1967 he portrayed ingeniously smirking satirist Werner Finck, founder and head of the legendary Berlin cabaret Die Katakombe, as well as he painted Joseph Keilberth, Conductor and General-music-director. He donated the Keilberth to the Bavarian State Opera. Baritone vocalist Karl Schmitt-Walter and chamber singer Hans-Hermann Nissen were also portrayed then. In 1968 he created drawings of Heinz R√ºhmann, who shortly before his death in 1994 had signed them. Important ecclesiastic dignitaries may also be found in Rittner‚Äôs work. In 1967 the artist painted Martin Niem√∂ller, former President of the Evangelic Church of Hessen and Nassau. In 1968 he portrayed Cardinal Julius D√∂pfner in an austere way, rich in ideas. In 1998 he created the portrait of Cardinal Friedrich Wetter for the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising Since 1970 numerous orders from the world of business have been concluded. He has painted Otto Braun, manufacturer of pharmacies in Melsungen, Willy Messerschmitt and Ludwig B√∂lkow, aircraft designers (formerly MBB, now EADS), as well as Max Schmidheiny, Fritz Berg and Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern. In 1975 Rittner portrayed Franz Josef Strauss, Chairman of the CSU and Prime Minister of Bavaria by order of the CSU-faction in Bonn. In 1977 he painted Hans-Jochen Vogel, Lord Mayor of Munich (1960‚Äì1972) by order of the Bavarian State Capital, as well as in 1996 Hans Zehetmair, Secretary for Cultural Affairs. Impressionism turned out to be the most appropriate way to paint characteristically. Classical music has always been a major inspiration for the artist. Whilst portraying Senta Berger he listened to Mozart. Among his favorite composers are Bach and Beethoven. When painting Therese Ghiese, he listened to Anton Bruckner's 9. Symphony. When painting landscapes and architectural structures, he expressed immense cheeriness, keen on bright colours. In 1962 alone, he created 18 paintings of the city of Venice. Some of them still exist. Rittner painted the Munich Hofgarten, Viktualienmarkt as well as the Chinese Tower in the English Garden and the famous Oktoberfest. Since that turned out to be not of further interest to the artist, with advanced age, he developed his second profound period: religious topics. He had painted the sufferings of Christ before in deep black which was the idiom of extensive expressivity. Finally this is how the artist who knew how to find the strong and weak sides of men reflects upon his life: ‚Äû[...] While constantly being at work in my studio, without knowing what time it was outside, I didn't notice having been standing at the easel for more than ten hours. So I got lost in time and space, until my eyes and hands started to work autonomously. [...] Sometimes it's like after a prayer or a meditation; the sensation of catharsis comes to your mind.‚Äú External links * Official homepage of G√ºnter Rittner * The Presidents of the Bavarian State Parliament since 1946 * Portraits of the Chancellors since 1949 1927 births Living people 20th-century German painters German male painters 21st-century German painters 21st-century male artists Artists from Wroc≈Çaw German illustrators People from the Province of Lower Silesia Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"G√ºnter Rittner"},{"id":"34284147","text":"Savient pharmaceuticals was a New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company.

Founded on 29 January 1949 they traced their origin back to 1919 and the establishment of I. SSK Maribor (, ), an association football club founded by Slovenian youth which ceased all operations due to World War II. NK Branik was disbanded on 11 August 1960 due to the food poisoning affair before their promotional qualifications match for the Yugoslav Second League against Karlovac. The club colours were black and white. History Origins Similarly to other Slovenian towns (Ljubljana, Celje, Trbovlje) after World War I football boomed in Maribor with the establishment of new clubs, most notably I. SSK Maribor, which was founded in 1919 by Slovenian youth. Together with athletics and tennis, football was one of the main sports departments of the club and in 1920 they received their first football field at the Ljudski vrt area. During the interwar period, I. SSK Maribor was one of the best Slovenian clubs and during the 1930s the club has won three titles in the Slovenian Republic Football League (highest football league in Slovenia within the Yugoslav football system). After the outbreak of World War II Maribor came under the occupation of Nazi Germany and the Nazi regime immediately disbanded all Slovene cultural and sports societies. I. SSK Maribor was particularly affected with dozens of arrests and deportations of their members. The club ceased all operations and many of their members joined in the fight for their fatherland and a total of 51 perished while fighting the Germans between 1941 and 1945. After the war on 19 July 1945 a new club, under the name FD Maribor ('), was established and stepped in as the successor of the I. SSK Maribor. FD Maribor was later renamed several times and finally became known as S≈†D Polet (') on 20 September 1948. Establishment Due to the difficult situation after World War II several sports departments within S≈†D Polet started to organize as individual entities. In late 1940s an initiative led to the establishment of NK Branik. The initiators of the idea wanted to establish an association football club which would become the flagship of the new sport organization, with other sports departments to follow afterwards. Couple of months later, on 29 January 1949, NK Branik was established and in 1951 they became part of the new sport organization, M≈†D Branik ('). Black and white were chosen as official colours of the organization, the same as the colours worn by members of I. SSK Maribor. During their first years of operation in early 1950s the club focused all of their efforts in the renovation of the Ljudski vrt area which was devastated during World War II. There the club received their new stadium, opened on 12 July 1952. During their history NK Branik played in the Slovenian Republic Football League. The club has won two titles in the Republic league and was the runner-up on two other occasions. Dissolution and aftermath In 1960, during the promotional qualifications for the Yugoslav Second League, NK Branik was involved in the food poisoning affair before their match against NK Karlovac. As a direct consequence, the club was disbanded on 11 August 1960. Karlovac has won the first leg 2‚Äì0, however, one week later in Maribor during their stay in hotel Orel, the whole squad was hospitalised with a severe case of diarrhoea, the players being poisoned ahead of the game: someone had put something in their pancakes. The Croatians returned home before the second leg would be played, leaving 10,000 Branik fans on the stadium waiting in vain for the start of the return match. How did Karlovac players got sick is unclear to this day. At first the suspects were some of the Branik fans, however, they were acquitted of any guilt by the District court in Maribor. The food testing by the Maribor hygienic institute established that the food served in hotel Orel was not corrupted in any way. Following the procedure at the District court in Maribor, where 40 witnesses from Maribor and Karlovac were questioned, it was established that it was not possible to determine who were responsible for the food poisoning and if it even occurred. At the end, the District Court has acquitted NK Branik of all guilt. Although the true culprit remains unknown to this day ‚Äì the hosts were disgraced, the club disqualified and disbanded. The officials of NK Branik later established a new club, under the same name, which competed with minor success in the lower Yugoslav leagues and was eventually dissolved in the late 1970s. After the disbandment of NK Branik the city of Maribor was left without an association football club that would play on a professional level, which was one of the reasons why NK Maribor was established on 12 December 1960. NK Maribor eventually became the most successful club in history of Slovenian football and joined M≈†D Branik organization in 1988. Although the club uses only the name NK Maribor in domestic and international competitions it is officially registered as NK Maribor Branik to this day.

As of 2011 more than 36 genes have been found that contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. All of these genes together still only account for 10% of the total genetic component of the disease. There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene (known as monogenic forms of diabetes). These include maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), Donohue syndrome, and Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome, among others. Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1‚Äì5% of all cases of diabetes in young people. Polygenic Genetic cause and mechanism of type 2 diabetes is largely unknown. However, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is one of many mechanisms that leads to increased risk for type 2 diabetes. To locate genes and loci that are responsible for the risk of type 2 diabetes, genome wide association studies (GWAS) was utilized to compare the genomes of diabetic patient group and the non-diabetic control group. The diabetic patients‚Äô genome sequences differ from the controls' genome in specific loci along and around numerous genes, and these differences in the nucleotide sequences alter phenotypic traits that exhibit increased susceptibility to the diabetes. GWAS has revealed 65 different loci (where single nucleotide sequences differ from the patient and control group's genomes), and genes associated with type 2 diabetes, including TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, HHEX, DGKB, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, KCNQ1, HNF1A, HNF1B MC4R, GIPR, HNF4A, MTNR1B, PARG6, ZBED3, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, GLIS3, GCK, GCKR, among others.KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), encodes the islet ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir6.2, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7‚Äìlike 2) regulates proglucagon gene expression and thus the production of glucagon-like peptide-1. In addition, there is also a mutation to the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide gene that results in an earlier onset, more severe, form of diabetes. However, this is not a comprehensive list of genes that affects the proneness to the diabetes. SNP rs7873784 located in the 3‚Ä≤-untranslated region (3‚Ä≤-UTR) of TLR4 gene and associated with the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus. PU.1 binding to the minor C allele of rs7873784 may be responsible for elevated TLR4 expression in the monocytes of affected individuals, contributing to an inflammation-prone environment that predisposes minor allele carriers to development of certain pathologies with an inflammatory component. rs7873784 was also associated with the abnormal metabolic phenotype accompanying T2DM (levels of fasting insulin and triglycerides, abnormal low- density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels). However, there is growing evidence that T2DM is not only a purely metabolic, but also an inflammatory disorder. The link between certain TLR4 SNPs alleles and T2DM may be directly related to elevated TLR4 expression since its signaling can regulate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and, therefore, influence the pathogenesis of T2DM. TLR4 expression is elevated in adipose tissue of obese mice and its activation triggered insulin resistance in adipocytes. LPS- mediated TLR4 activation can suppress glucose-induced insulin secretion by Œ≤-cells. Monocytes from T2DM patients demonstrate increased TLR4 expression, NFŒ∫B activity, and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A number of endogenous TLR4 ligands are elevated in patients with diabetes. Oxidized LDL upregulates TLR4 expression in macrophages and provokes TLR4-dependent inflammation in the arterial wall, further TLR4 activation results in a strong inhibition of cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The hepatic secretory glycoprotein fetuin-A correlates with increased risk of developing T2DM and may promote lipid-induced insulin resistance via TLR4 activation, resulting in production of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, mice with deficiencies in TLR4 signaling were protected from insulin resistance caused by high-fat diet and from secondary complications of T2DM such as atherosclerosis. Most SNPs that increase the risk of diabetes reside in noncoding regions of the genes, making the SNP‚Äôs mechanism for increasing susceptibility largely unknown. However, they are thought to influence the susceptibility by altering the regulation of those gene expressions. Only few genes (PARG6, KCNJ11-ABCC8, SLC30A8, and GCKR) have SNPs in the open reading frame (ORF). These SNPs in ORFs result in altering of the protein function, and the altered function and therefore compromise the performances of the protein product causes increased susceptibility to the type 2 diabetes. One of the examples of gene regulation in non-ORF SNPs that influences susceptibility is the changes in nucleotide sequence in microRNA (miRNA) binding site. miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the target mRNAs and physically block translation. SNPs on the miRNA-binding site can result in faulty levels of gene expression as miRNA fails to bind to the corresponding mRNA effectively, leading to excess amount of protein product overall. Although the protein structure of the genes with SNPs are identical to that of the normal gene product, due to their faulty level of expressions, those genes increase risk. Genes such as CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and HNF1B exhibit increase the risk phenotype with SNPs in their 3' UTR miRNA binding sites. As CDKN2A and B regulate the pancreatic beta-cell replication, and HNF1B is homeodomain containing transcription factor that regulates other genes, faulty regulations of those genes increase the risk of diabetes. Another example of faulty gene regulation that influence the susceptibility is the SNPs in promoter regions of the genes. Gene like APOM and APM1 increase the risk of type 2 diabetes when there are SNPs in their proximal promoter regions. Promoters are sequences of DNA that allows proteins such as transcription factors to bind for gene expression, and when the sequences are modified, the proteins no longer bind as effectively, resulting in depressed level of gene expression. APOM is partly responsible for producing pre beta-high-density lipoprotein and cholesterol, and APM1 is responsible for regulating glucose level in blood and fatty acid. Decreasing the level these gene products reduce the body's ability to handle glucose, which leads to the increased risk of diabetes. It is important to note that those discovered genes do not determine susceptibility to diabetes for all people or cases. As the risk of diabetes is combination of the gene regulations and the interplay between those gene products, certain genes may not pose a threat to increase the susceptibility. TCF7L2 is one of the well-studied genes for diabetes susceptibility in most populations. However, SNPs in TCF7L2 that would normally increase the risk of diabetes does not affect the susceptibility for Pima Indians. However, this gene is associated with regulating the BMI for Pima Indian population. Various hereditary conditions may feature diabetes, for example myotonic dystrophy and Friedreich's ataxia. Wolfram's syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that first becomes evident in childhood. It consists of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness, hence the acronym DIDMOAD. While obesity is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes that may be linked to lifestyle, obesity is also a trait that may be strongly inherited. Other research also shows that type 2 diabetes can cause obesity as an effect of the changes in metabolism and other deranged cell behavior attendant on insulin resistance. However, environmental factors (almost certainly diet and weight) play a large part in the development of type 2 diabetes in addition to any genetic component. Genetic risk for type 2 diabetes changes as humans first began migrating around the world, implying a strong environmental component has affected the genetic- basis of type 2 diabetes. This can be seen from the adoption of the type 2 diabetes epidemiological pattern in those who have moved to a different environment as compared to the same genetic pool who have not. Immigrants to Western developed countries, for instance, may be more prone to diabetes as compared to its lower incidence in their countries of origins.Cotran, Kumar, Collins; Robbins Pathologic Basis of DiseaseSaunders Sixth Edition, 1999; 913-926. Such developments can also be found in environments which have had a recent increase in social wealth, increasingly common throughout Asia.

The Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) is a division of DLA Disposition Services, a subordinate command of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in the United States. LESO is responsible for operating the 1033 Program or LESO Program, which transfers excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies. The program legally requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to make various items of equipment available to local law enforcement. The modern program arose during the H. W. Bush administration, in Section 1208 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, which allowed surplus DOD equipment, weapons, and tactical vehicles to be transferred to law enforcement for use in drug enforcement. During the Clinton administration, usage was expanded into other areas, including counter- terrorism. Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 amended to allow the military to transfer \\"property... including small arms and ammunition... suitable for use by the agencies in law enforcement activities, including counter-drug and counter-terrorism activities\\".. Precedent legislation of the same concept has existed since the end of World War II. , 8,200 local law enforcement agencies participated in the program that has transferred $5.1 billion in military material from DOD to law enforcement agencies since 1997. According to the DLA, material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone. Some of the most commonly requested items include ammunition, cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags, flashlights and electrical wiring. Small arms and vehicles such as aircraft, watercraft, and armored vehicles have also been obtained. The program has been criticized over the years by local media, by the DOD Inspector General in 2003, and by the GAO which found waste, fraud, and abuse. It was not until media coverage of police during the 2014 Ferguson unrest that the program drew nationwide public attention; the Ferguson Police Department had used equipment obtained through the 1033 Program. The ACLU and the NAACP have raised concerns about what they call the militarization of police forces in the United States. President Obama signed Executive Order 13688 in May 2015 limiting and prohibiting certain types of equipment; On 28 August 2017, President Trump rolled back the Executive Order. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the move at the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) convention in Nashville, and said the president would do so by executive order. At the same time, Sessions and the director of the FOP pointed out that equipment obtained through the program can be used for lifesaving purposes, dismissing criticism of the program as \\"superficial concerns\\". The FOP also pointed out that the armored vehicles were not tanks. History Predecessor, 1943‚Äì1949 In 1944, the Surplus Property Act provided for the disposal of surplus government property, and spawned numerous short lived agencies like the Surplus War Property Administration (SWPA), in the Office of War Mobilization (OWM, February‚ÄìOctober 1944), the Surplus Property Board (SPB), in the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion (OWMR, October 1944 ‚Äì September 1945), the Surplus Property Administration and also corporations like the Petroleum Reserves Corporation (PRC) and the War Assets Corporation to deal with it. The War Assets Administration was the latest to operate and was abolished in 1949. 1990‚Äì2014 The \\"National Defense Authorization Act of 1990\\", section 1208 authorized transfer of military hardware from the Department of Defense broadly to \\"federal and state agencies\\", but specifically \\"for use in counter-drug activities\\". as this legislation was passed in the context of the War on Drugs. Until 1997, it was called the 1208 program and run by the Department of Defense from the Pentagon and its regional offices. In 1995, the \\"Law Enforcement Support Office\\" was created within the DLA to work exclusively with law enforcement. With passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, the 1208 program was expanded to the 1033 program allowing \\"all law enforcement agencies to acquire property for bona fide law enforcement purposes that assist in their arrest and apprehension mission\\", and that \\"Preference is given to counter-drug and counter-terrorism requests\\". It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on 23 September 1996. In October the DLA Disposition Services first released information about the equipment distribution by county. An inflection point occurred in the fall 2014 after several events brought increasing public scrutiny, and the eventual release of Federal records on the movement of military goods to civilian police forces was made public on 21 November 2014. Description The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLA) helps the DOD dispose of its \\"excess property... from air conditioners to vehicles, clothing to computers\\" via \\"transfer to other federal agencies, or donation to state and local governments and other qualified organizations\\", as well as by \\"sale of surplus property\\". Availability of surplus equipment has been facilitated by the reduced American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 1033 program is designed to specifically work with law enforcement agencies, such as local police forces, school district police and others. Material donated From 1997 until 2014, $5.1 billion in military hardware were transferred from DOD to local American law enforcement agencies, according to LESO, and material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone. About a third of the equipment is new. The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition. Other most commonly requested items include cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags, flashlights, and electrical wiring. The DLA also offers tactical armored vehicles, weapons, watercraft, and aircraft. Police departments , 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participate in the reutilization program. Police departments are responsible for paying for shipment and storage of material acquired, but do not pay for the donation. The largest number of requests for material comes from small to mid-sized police departments who are unable to afford extra clothing, vehicles and weapons. The program gives smaller police departments access to material that larger police departments are usually able to afford without federal assistance. A memorandum of agreement between the DLA and the states participating in 1033 requires that local police forces either utilize the military equipment within one year or return it. The rules allow police to dispose of or sell some goods after at least one year of usage. School districts more than twenty school district police agencies received military-grade equipment through the program. The San Diego school district planned to return a military surplus vehicle after negative public reaction. The Los Angeles School Police Department has also received excess military equipment, including 61 assault rifles, three grenade launchers, and an MRAP vehicle. Ten School Police Departments in Texas also participate in the 1033 program, in total acquiring 25 automatic pistols, 64 M16 assault rifles, 18 M14 battle rifles, 15 vehicles and tactical vests. As of 2014, at least 117 colleges and universities in the United States have used the 1033 program to acquire military-grade equipment through their campus police departments. Higher education institutions that participate in the program include local community colleges, state universities, and Ivy Leagues, ranging from Hinds Community College, University of Central Florida, University of California, Columbia University, and Yale. In 2012, the University of California at Berkeley attempted to use the federal program to acquire an Armored Response Counter Attack Truck, also referred to as a Lenco BearCat, to deal with possible campus shootings, but public outcry forced UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgenau to reverse procurement of the eight-ton armored truck. In 2013, Ohio State University acquired an MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle, becoming the first campus in the U.S. to integrate this kind of military-grade equipment into their campus police department. Florida State University used the program to acquire a Humvee, which campus police say is only to be used in the case of an active shooter, not a civil disturbance. Central Washington University has also received an armored truck through the program, claiming the truck is used to train for active-shooter scenarios. The most popular military equipment acquired by colleges and universities through the 1033 program is the M16. Campus police at the Arizona State University currently hold the most M16's with a total of 70, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland, which both carry 50 M16's. The Department of Defense has provided a variety of military and police equipment to both private and public universities across the country. Equipment allocated has ranged from gauze, trousers, and other basic supplies, to armored vehicles, grenade launchers, and M-16 assault rifles. Many spokespersons for colleges and universities that received this military equipment have cited cost efficiency as the main motivation for engaging in this partnership, including University of Florida's dean of students Jen Day Shaw, who stated that the program \\"is a cost savings for taxpayers.\\" Participating campus departments pay only for delivery and maintenance of allocated military supplies, paying a mere $507.43 for as many as 12 M-16 rifles (University of Louisiana at Monroe). If colleges and universities seek to acquire material not obtainable directly through the 1033 program, like other local law enforcement agencies, they may purchase said equipment through federal grants allocated by the DOD. Another justification for involvement in the 1033 program is the epidemic of school shootings on U.S. campuses, with many college and university representatives citing the Virginia Tech shooting as reason for concern and increased militarization of campus police departments. In instances where campus police departments fail to or do not directly attempt to acquire excess military material from the 1033 program, partnership with local and regional law enforcement through mutual aid allows colleges and universities to indirectly benefit from the program by utilizing military equipment obtained by law enforcement agencies in the surrounding area. Where police jurisdiction overlaps between college and universities and the municipal area they inhabit, the acquisition of material such as an MRAP by a municipal law enforcement agency can substitute acquisition by a campus police department, as was the case between the city of Davis, CA and the University of California at Davis in 2014. Oversight Law enforcement agencies must declare the intended use for each item, maintain an audit trail for each item and conduct inventory checks for DLA. Firearms, certain vehicles and other equipment must be returned to the Defense Department after use. \\"For security reasons [1033 program record] information is not subject to public review\\", per DLA. A state coordinating agency in each U.S. state, except for Hawaii, headed by a state coordinator that is appointed by the state governor must approve an application, and is supposed to function as oversight after dispersion of equipment. The state coordinating agency is housed within a state agency that varies from state to state, for example in the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Alaska Department of Public Safety and so on. The fact that in Arizona a Payson, Arizona Police Department Detective, was appointed as the state coordinator, made it easier for Paul Babeu, Sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona to amass \\"more than $7 million worth of Humvees, fire trucks, firearms, defibrillators, barber chairs, underwear, thermal-imaging scopes, computers, motor scooters and other in 2010‚Äì2012, which he told county supervisors he would auction off to balance his budget. This is because the detective had appointed an office grants administrator in the Pinal County Sheriff Office to help him \\"oversee and authorize military- surplus requisitions\\". The Sheriff's speaker described it as chance to cherry- pick, \\"as we can start approving our own requests\\". After the Arizona Republic newspaper expose the DLA \\"announced agency-wide reforms, and Sheriff Paul Babeu was directed to retrieve vehicles and other equipment his office distributed to non-police organizations\\" and \\"about the same time, weapons requisitions were temporarily suspended and audited nationwide. In 2003, a Defense Department Inspector General audit found incorrect or inadequate documentation in about three-quarters of the transactions analyzed, declaring 1033 Program records unreliable. In 2005, the Government Accountability Office found that the Pentagon \\"does not have management controls in place\\" to avert waste, abuse and fraud in the program. Investigators identified \\"hundreds of millions of dollars in reported lost, damaged, or stolen excess property ... which contributed to reutilization program waste and inefficiency.\\"  Political responses  In August 2014, the militarized response to civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri led to increased criticism of the 1033 program: *U.S. senator Rand Paul, a Republican, stated that the American government \\"has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts and helped municipal governments build what are essentially small armies.\\" *Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat, drafted legislation proposing to curb, but not end the 1033 program, urged legislative armed services committee to suspend the transfer of some equipment. *President Obama ordered a review of the program. In September 2014, Senator Claire McCaskill organized the Senate's first hearing on the program, and federal officials faced bipartisan criticism: *Brian Kamoie, assistant administrator for grant programs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, stated that officials are conducting a review to determine if police forces deployed in Ferguson improperly used equipment purchased with the grants for riot suppression, which is not allowed. It was inconclusive from the questioning, how many times equipment was purchased with funds used to combat terrorism. *Rear Admiral John Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon, argued that the program has aided law enforcement across the US in counter-terrorism and counter-narcotic operation, and to protect civilians. He stated that the Pentagon was diligent in deciding what equipment was sent to specific police departments. *Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that mass shootings could occur anywhere in the United States, even in small towns, and that the equipment obtained from the 1033 program is being used to protect civilians and law enforcement. *Congressman Buck McKeon scheduled a United States House Committee on Armed Services subcommittee \\"Oversight and Investigations\\" hearing to examine the program, which was postponed. *The House Judiciary Committee declined to review the program, stating that any review would follow an investigation by the Obama administration. In October 2014, *Congressman Hank Johnson urged the heads of the Armed Services Committees to adopt a moratorium on the transfer of certain items and to eliminate a section of the House version of the 2015 Defense bill, passed earlier in 2014, that would expand equipment transfers to border security, the nation's largest law enforcement agency. In November 2014, *Rand Paul's second Ferguson op-ed in Time did not mention the demilitarization of the police, which had been subject of his first op-ed, . *Steve Rabinovich, a police officer writing for police website PoliceOne.com, defended the 1033 program as necessary for protecting police officers from violent or deadly assaults by individuals or anti-government groups viewing police as scapegoats. *The House Committee on Armed Services reviewed the program, interviewed four witnesses, including the president of the Police Foundation, the director of the National Tactical Officers Association, and two employees of the Department of Defense and their heads, Reps. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) and Adam Smith (D-Wash.) are working on a compromise of the 2015 defense authorization bill, instead of a moratorium. *Senator McCaskill suggested that \\"Congress would seek to better train police to use transferred equipment\\". *The White House had not released results of its review, promised in September, when National Guard of the United States was deployed to Ferguson and further unrest occurred after the grand jury decision in Ferguson. Police lobbying efforts, and the elections had rendered Congress lame duck, and the support for ending or changing the 1033 program dwindled. In May 2015, following the 2015 Baltimore protests, Obama announced reviews of the use of military equipment, stating \\"We've seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them,\\" and \\"Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments.\\"h Other criticism Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the ACLU, wrote that the federal government is deliberately militarizing local law enforcement agencies. According to a study by social scientist Dr. Casey Delehanty and colleagues, larger 1033 transfers are associated with increased killings by police. Following the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in spring 2020, a number of news media have written critically on the topic of police and the militarization of police attitudes and behavior that typically comes along with the procurement of military equipment from the Federal government. Police department suspensions DLA public-affairs chief Kenneth MacNevin stated in 2012, that \\"more than 30 Arizona police agencies have been suspended or terminated for failing to meet program standards and nine remain under suspension\\". One of them was the Maricopa County, Arizona law enforcement after failing to account for 20 of the 200 military weapons it had received. The suspension did not affect police acquisition of high powered weaponry due to anti-racketeering or confiscated drug funds, according to Maricopa's Sheriff. In North Carolina, law officials are working to reinstate the 1033 program through more rigorous inventory management, after the state was suspended for failing to account for some transferred equipment. North Carolina officials state that 3,303 out of the 4,227 pieces of equipment obtained through the program are tactical items including automatic weapons and military vehicles and the remainder is not used in combat, and includes cots, containers and generators. Fusion reported in August 2014 that a total of 184 state and local police departments had been suspended from the program for missing weapons and failure to comply with guidelines. Missing items included M14 and M16 assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, and two Humvee vehicles. Investigative journalist Susan Katz Keating reported in October 2017 that certain elements of the program were restored despite the compliance issues.

Population: History The original Nivkh name of the Tymy river comes from the words Tymy (smoke), which means a depression at the bottom of the river where fish spawns, and \\"and\\" is the river. Therefore, the name of the river can be translated as \\"spawning river.\\" It was founded in 1880 by Anton Derbin as Derbinskoye, as a place of exile for prisoners in the Russian Empire. The writer Anton Chekhov visited Derbinskoye in 1890 during his travel through Sakhalin and described it in his book, Sakhalin Island. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, the area around Derbinskoye was occupied by Japanese troops, and then again after the October Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks did not regain control over northern Sakhalin until May 1925. Derbinskoye became the administrative center of Rykovsky District in 1928.

Jones became the first woman to hold a chair at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the first woman to become a department chair at the medical school. She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. She was also president of the Association of Medical School Departments of Biochemistry, president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and president of the American Association of University Professors. The New York Times called her a \\"crucial researcher on DNA\\" and said that her studies laid the foundation for basic cancer research. She died of cancer on August 23, 1996.  Early life  Jones was born in La Grange Park, Illinois, on December 12, 1922. Her parents were Elmer and Laura Klein Jones.  Education  Jones pursued her bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the University of Chicago. While an undergraduate, she began to work part-time for Armour and Company. Upon her graduation in 1944, having paucity of funds to pursue graduate school, she continued to work for Armour, where she collaborated with Paul Munson, the director of the research laboratory. Their research led to Munson and Jones publishing two papers on androsterone and monopalmitin in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. After marrying Munson in 1948, Jones moved to Yale University to pursue her Ph.D. in biochemistry, while Munson became an assistant professor in pharmacology. Under the direction of Joseph S. Fruton, Jones' dissertation research involved the catalytic properties of cathepsin C, a type of protease. Her doctorate was entitled: Transamidation reactions catalyzed by cathepsin C.Jones, Mary Ellen. Transamidation Reactions Catalyzed by Cathepsin C. Yale University, 1952. Jones completed her studies in three years receiving her doctorate in 1951. Upon receiving her Ph.D., Jones moved to Boston, where she did a postdoctoral fellowship with Fritz Lipmann in the Chemical Research Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. When the Department of Biochemistry was established at Brandeis University was established in 1957, she joined the faculty as an assistant professor, and was later promoted to associate professor. In 1966, Jones joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry, and in 1968 was appointed professor in the Department of Zoology. She left UNC Chapel Hill in 1971 for the University of Southern California and was a professor of biochemistry there until 1978. She then returned to the University of North Carolina as a professor and chair of Department of Biochemistry and was named a Kenan Professor in 1980. Jones was the first female scientist to hold an endowed chair at the University of North Carolina and the first woman to become a department chair at the medical school. She resigned as chairwoman in 1989, but remained active in research and teaching until early in 1995. Academic work Although Jones had started out as a bacteriologist at Armour, she eventually found her passion to be research chemistry and enzymology. She pursued these interests by studying androsterone and monopalmitin at Armour, and cathepsin C at Yale. Jones worked as postdoctoral fellow under Fritz Lipmann at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1951 to 1957. During this time, in 1953, Lipmann was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her work with Lipmann and Leonard Spector included the novel demonstration of ATP being involved in a reaction to activate Coenzyme A and produce pyrophosphate, and the discovery of carbamoyl phosphate, a key component of nucleotides which are essential to energy transfer within cells. By the time Jones joined Brandeis as a faculty member, she had published 13 papers: two from when she was a technician at Armour, two more from her graduate work at Yale, plus another nine papers from her work in the Lipmann laboratory. She continued her prolific work at Brandeis while collaborating with Leonard Spector. The two continued to work on carbamoyl phosphate, identifying carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as the source for the initial activation step for carbamoyl phosphate formation. Jones also suspected that there were two separate carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase isozymes. In 1966, fellow chemist Sally E. Hager and Jones published their work identifying a key enzyme that required glutamine for the synthesis of orotate. Jones and Hager were able to find a way to stabilize the enzyme so that it could be studied further. In addition to studying amino acid metabolism, Jones was also active in studying pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism. She was one of the first researchers to study multi-functional proteins, including working with the enzymes dihydroorotate synthase and uridine monophosphate synthase. When Jones moved to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1966 as an associate professor, space in the biochemistry department was limited. She had to make do with room the basement of the zoology department. In 1997, Mary Ellen Jones was recognized for her many contributions to UNC as a \\"scientist, humanist, and warrior in the struggle for gender equality in science\\" when the university chose to name a building after her. \\"Mary Ellen was a paragon whose personal and scientific leadership shaped much of the basic research education at this institution,\\" according to Dr. Stuart Bondurant. Overall, her research into DNA, RNA, and mechanisms of metabolic pathways helped people to understand how cells divide and differentiate, which in turn helped researchers to understand the action of cancer cells.  Personal life  Mary Ellen Jones married Paul Munson in 1948 and divorced in 1971. They had two children: Ethan V. Munson (born 1956), currently an associate professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and Catherine Munson (born 1960), currently a psychiatrist in Charlotte, North Carolina. She retired in 1995, soon after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer. She died in Waltham, Massachusetts, on August 23, 1996.

Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women. A number of dietary factors such as sugar sweetened drinks and the type of fat in the diet appear to play a role. In one study, those who had high levels of physical activity, a healthy diet, did not smoke, and consumed alcohol in moderation had an 82% lower rate of diabetes. When a normal weight was included, the rate was 89% lower. In this study, a healthy diet was defined as one high in fiber, with a high polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, lower trans fats consumption, and a lower mean glycemic index. Dietary The composition of dietary fat intake is linked to diabetes risk; decreasing consumption of saturated fats and trans fatty acids while replacing them with unsaturated fats may decrease the risk. Sugar sweetened drinks appear to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes both through their role in obesity and potentially through a direct effect. A higher proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in a large ten year study published in 2019. Obesity Obesity has been found to contribute to approximately 55% of cases of type 2 diabetes; chronic obesity leads to increased insulin resistance that can develop into type 2 diabetes, most likely because adipose tissue (especially that in the abdomen around internal organs) is a source of several chemical signals, hormones and cytokines, to other tissues. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNFŒ± may activate the NF-Œ∫B pathway which has been linked to the development of insulin resistance. Gene expression promoted by a diet of fat and glucose, as well as high levels of inflammation related cytokines found in the obese, can result in cells that \\"produce fewer and smaller mitochondria than is normal,\\" and are thus prone to insulin resistance. Fat tissue has also been shown to be involved in managing much of the body's response to insulin and control of uptake of sugar. It secretes RBP4 which increases insulin resistance by blocking the action of insulin in muscle and liver. Fat cells also secrete adiponectin which acts in an opposite way to RBP4 by improving the action of insulin, however, engorged fat cells secrete it in lower amount than normal fat cells. The obese therefore may have higher level of RBP4 but lower level of adiponectin, both of which increase the risk of developing diabetes. However, different fat tissues behave differently. Visceral fat, which is found around organs such as the intestines and liver, releases signalling molecules directly into blood heading into the liver where glucose is absorbed and processed, while subcutaneous fat under the skin is much less metabolically active. The visceral fat is located in the abdomen in the waist region, large waist circumference and high waist-to-hip ratio are therefore often used as indications of an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The increased rate of childhood obesity between the 1960s and 2000s is believed to have led to the increase in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. Sleep Studies have shown that a reduction in sleep is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This could account for the increased incidence of diabetes in developed countries in the last decades, since \\"the causes of this pandemic are not fully explained by changes in traditional lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity\\", and \\"one behavior that seems to have developed during the past few decades and has become highly prevalent, particularly amongst Americans, is sleep curtailment\\". In addition, it has been shown that certain minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders or American Indians/Alaska Natives, report higher rates of suboptimal sleep, potentially leading to higher rates of type 2 diabetes. Prenatal environment Research also suggests intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or prenatal undernutrition (macro- and micronutrient) as another probable factor. Studies of those who were small or disproportionately thin or short at birth, or suffered prenatal exposure during period of famine such as the Dutch Hunger Winter (1944‚Äì1945) during World War II, have shown that they are prone to higher rates of diabetes. Other Environmental toxins may contribute to recent increases in the rate of type 2 diabetes. A weak positive correlation has been found between the concentration in the urine of bisphenol A, a constituent of some plastics, and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

It was signed on 1 or 2 September 1192 CE (20th of Sha'ban 588 AH) between the Muslim ruler Saladin and Richard the Lionheart, King of England, shortly after the July‚ÄìAugust 1192 Battle of Jaffa. The treaty, negotiated with the help of Balian of Ibelin, guaranteed a three-year truce between the two armies. This treaty ended the Third Crusade. Provisions The treaty mainly addressed two issues: the status of Jerusalem and pilgrimage rights for Christians, and the extent of sovereignty of the Crusader state in the Holy Land. In the first regard, the treaty guaranteed safe passage of Christians and Muslims through Palestine, stating that Jerusalem would remain under Islamic control, while it would be open to Christian pilgrimages. In the second issue, it stated that the Christians would hold the coast from Tyre to Jaffa, practically reducing the Latin kingdom, which had lost almost all of its territory in 1187, to a geopolitical coastal strip that extended between these two cities. Ascalon's fortifications were to be demolished and the town returned to Saladin. Neither Saladin nor King Richard were fond of the overall accord, but had little other choice. The Islamic ruler had been weakened by the trials and expense of war and King Richard had to deal with threats to his kingdom at home. Richard left Acre on 9 October 1192. Attempted treaties After the Siege of Acre, King Richard and Saladin had a series of conversations about concluding the Third Crusade. These letters usually contained arguments about religious ownership and who had the right to ownership of Jerusalem. None of these attempts actually resulted in an actual truce. This, of course, was until the Treaty of Jaffa was created due to King Richard Lionheart's need to return to his country, which was inevitably falling apart with his absence. Distinction from 1229 treaty In 1229 a somewhat similar double treaty was signed, one in Tell el-Ajjul and one in Jaffa, which together brought to an end the Sixth Crusade. The treaties of Tell Ajjul and Jaffa settled the territorial disputes between the competing Ayyubid rulers of Egypt, Syria and various smaller principalities, allowing to Sultan Al-Kamil of Egypt to close a diplomatic deal with the leader of the Sixth Crusade, Emperor Frederick II.

Montrealais was sold three times between 1962 and 2012, when the freighter was acquired by Algoma Central Corp. and renamed Algoma Montrealais. The bulk carrier continued in service until 2015, when the vessel was renamed Mont and sold for scrap. Mont was taken to Aliaƒüa, Turkey and broken up beginning on 10 July 2015. Description Montrealais was long overall and between perpendiculars. The vessel had a beam of and was powered by one steam turbine. The lake freighter had a maximum speed of . The vessel had a gross register tonnage of and a deadweight tonnage of . Service history Montrealais was constructed in two sections, with the forepart of the ship built by G T Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec. The forepart was launched on 15 November 1961. The aft section was constructed by Canadian Vickers at their yard in Montreal, Quebec, and named Montrealer. The aft section was launched in November 1961. The sections were joined and the vessel was completed as Montrealais in April 1962. When completed, she was the largest Canadian freighter on the Great Lakes. Initially owned by Canadian Vickers and registered in Montreal, Montrealais was sold to Papachristidis Co Ltd in 1964. The new owners retained the ship's name and registry in Montreal. The bulk carrier was sold again in 1972 to Jackes Shipping Ltd which kept the vessel's name, but changed Montrealais registry to Toronto, Ontario. Jackes Shipping transferred ownership of Montrealais to Leitch Tpt Ltd in 1975. In 1976 Upper Lakes Shipping acquired Montrealais. On 25 June 1980 Montrealais collided with Algobay in the St. Clair River in dense fog at 05:08 while transiting in opposite directions. Both ships suffered severe damaged to their bows as a result of the collision. No crewmembers were injured in the collision, but some oil was spilled into the St. Clair River. As a result, the shipping channel was closed until 07:30. Montrealais required over $1.5 million CAD in repairs. The ship's captain was issued the ceremonial top hat traditionally issued to the captain of the first vessel to set out to transit the St. Lawrence Seaway, in 1963 and 2009. In 2012, Upper Lakes Shipping's fleet was sold to Algoma Central Corp. The vessel was renamed Algoma Montrealais and operated by Algoma Central. Algoma Montrealais wintered in Montreal in 2014, laying up for the winter on 30 December 2014. The winter of 2013‚Äì2014 was a hard winter on the Great Lakes, and to provide additional tonnage to help ease the back-log, Algoma Montrealais was activated for the 2014 season.

Biography Early life and education Norstad was born in Valhalla, New York, the youngest of four children to Magnus Norstad, a Norwegian American commercial artist who painted magazine covers and oils of western scenes, and Lillian Rosland, a Swedish American miniature dried flower artist. Magnus and Lillian met in Portland, Oregon where they both worked at an advertising agency. During World War II Norstad was drafted into the Army Air Forces and served in Egypt. Following the war, he moved with his parents to San Bernardino County in Southern California. In 1951 Norstad enrolled at the University of Oregon on the GI Bill where he met Ruth Luebke, a creative writing major. In 1953 Norstad and Luebke were wed. Norstad graduated with a degree in architecture with a minor in ceramics. In 1955 their first of four children was born. Career Post graduation Norstad was offered work as a draftsman at Harmon, Prey, and Detrich, an architecture firm in Seattle Washington. In order to subsidize his career as an aspiring architect Norstad began making stoneware pottery. In 1957 Norstad was the recipient of a The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant, which enabled him to build a small kiln and set up a pottery operation from their home. Many of Norstad's early patrons were fellow architects, artists, and classmates. Norstad started as a kitchen potter making mugs, jugs, bowls and plates. In the late 1950s Norstad began judging state fairs and pottery shows and teaching workshops through the Association of Clay and Glass Artists of California. In 1959, Norstad moved his growing family to Marin County, California. He built a kiln in the basement of their new home and began selling pots at street fairs and at word of mouth home pottery sales. In 1960 Norstad was asked to join architects Warren Callister and Jack Payne as an architect at their firm Callister and Payne in Tiburon, California. Norstad worked on multiple residential projects in Northern California while continuing to make ceramics on the side. Soon Callister and other architects began commissioning unique ceramic pieces from Norstad such as fireplace fronts, chimney pots, large planter pots, and decorative relief murals. In 1962, Norstad left Callister and Payne, and opened Norstad Pottery building a larger kiln on their property. Norstad credits much of his success to the right time and place. The 1960s American craft movement was taking off and individual artists were able to make a living. With business booming Norstad hired other potters to help with production, including Toru Hasegawa, Jack Sears, and Michael Campbell to help with production. Jury at California State Fair. In 1975, Norstad Pottery moved to a 3,000 square foot studio in Sausalito, California. In 1976 Ruth Norstad opened a retail storefront on Bridgeway Avenue with an emphasis on the basins. The line of pottery continued to expand with stoneware kitchen and bathroom sinks proving very popular. Later they opened a store in Carmel, California. In 1982, Norstad designed an 8,000 square foot pottery which was built in Richmond, California with the help of his three sons, his son in-law, and their friends. Norstad Pottery operated from the Richmond location until Eric Norstad retired in 1998. Early Eric Norstad stoneware container circa 1963 Influences and techniques Norstad credits artists Peter Voulkos, Bernard Leach, and his parents as influences, as well as clean, functional Scandinavian design of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The stoneware clay that Norstad Pottery mixed was a combination of Kentucky ball clay, California fire clay, and grog- a sand like material. When fired the pieces vitrified into an extremely hard, dense, non- porous material. The mixture was thrown into an old commercial dough mixer with water and the finished batch turned out into plaster trays to age and lose moisture. The clay was then driven through a pug mill, which compresses it and extrudes long plugs of finished clay that is thrown into pots on a wheel. Some clay is rolled into slabs and draped over plaster molds. This treatment, called \\"jiggering\\" is a time honored method of producing many pots that are identical. Norstad pots were most noted by their distinctive glazes, often with markings in a Japanese style Sumi-e brushwork. In earlier pieces relief features or decorated carvings were added to the pots. Fired to 2500 ¬∞F for 24 hours with high-fire glazes resulted in a smooth, impervious, and very durable finish, resistant to scratching, chipping, and cracks. Norstad pottery is recognizable by several design elements: a strong lip, or rim; graceful, symmetrical shapes and glazes, mostly earth tones, that are accented by brushwork of stylized fish or other animals, leafy stencils, and abstract glazed patterns. Although some of his work, such as his porcelain, is extremely light and graceful, most of it is sturdy and utilitarian: dinnerware, vases, lamp bases and sinks. Norstad ceramic sinks were tested and approved under the Uniform Plumbing Code by the International Association of Plumbing Officials. The basins were hand thrown inside spinning plaster molds which insured a good degree of uniformity. The mold formed the outside of the basin and the inside is hand crafted.  Patrons and exhibits Eric Norstad commissioned drinking fountain in Sausalito California, in remembrance of \\"Sally Stanford\\".The City of Sausalito commissioned Norstad to make a large drinking fountain in honor of former San Francisco Madam and Sausalito Mayor Sally Stanford. The unusual historic landmark is on the waterfront between the Hotel Sausalito and the Sausalito Yacht Club. It is inscribed with \\"Have a drink on Sally\\" and has a runoff for the water leading to a long knee level basin that reads \\"Have a drink on Leland\\" in honor of Stanford's beloved dog. Harrah's Lake Tahoe Hotel commissioned a huge relief mural of Sierra Nevada scenery. A New Mexico hotel commissioned 695 lamp bases. The City of San Francisco commissioned a ceramic plaque honoring Mary Ellen Pleasant who ran the San Francisco terminus of The Underground Railway and was also a madam. Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, California commissioned hundreds of serving platters and plates. Norstad pots are in the permanent collection at the Portland Art Museum. Norstad's first one-man show was held in 1954 at the Contemporary Crafts Gallery in Portland, Oregon. Oakland Museum of California has an Eric Norstad decorative plate in their collection.

Career After university, Wiese practised law at the Cape Bar for some years before working as a Director at Pepkor, the discount clothing chain that his parents helped to found. Under his leadership, Shoprite started out as a chain of eight supermarkets in Cape Town that was purchased for 1 million rand (equivalent to $122,000 USD) which grew into a multibillion-dollar business due to various acquisitions and expansion strategies made in the first 30 years of operations. After playing a role in helping Shoprite acquire distributor Senta, Wiese started expanding his business into franchising new locations for Shoprite department stores. He also purchased the struggling OK Bazaars from South African Breweries for one rand in 1997; inserting 157 supermarkets and 146 furniture stores to the company and adding jobs to the area. In 2011, Wiese's Shoprite stores were considered to be the sixth overall favourite brand, with a third-most valued brand in terms of community upliftment in South Africa. In addition to Shoprite, Wiese owns more than 1,200 corporate outlets under various names. Shares of Shoprite rose by 50% on the South African stock market from March 2011 to March 2012, with Wiese making a $1.5 billion profit.

Since 1976 all doctrinal decisions have been made by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, a group of elders at the denomination's headquarters. These teachings are disseminated through The Watchtower magazine and other publications of Jehovah's Witnesses, and at conventions and congregation meetings.Keep Yourselves in God‚Äôs Love, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2008, page 43, \\"The Governing Body of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses represents the slave class. ... elders today receive instructions and counsel from the Governing Body, either directly or through its representatives, such as traveling overseers.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses teach that the present world order, which they perceive as being under the control of Satan, will be ended by a direct intervention of Jehovah (God), who will use Jesus Christ to fully establish his heavenly government over earth, destroying existing human governments and non-Witnesses,\\"Remaining Organized for Survival Into the Millennium\\", The Watchtower, September 1, 1989, page 19, \\"Only Jehovah's Witnesses, those of the anointed remnant and the 'great crowd,' as a united organization under the protection of the Supreme Organizer, have any Scriptural hope of surviving the impending end of this doomed system dominated by Satan the Devil.\\"Worship the Only True God, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2002, page 179. and creating a cleansed society of true worshippers who will live forever.

Jehovah's Witnesses are directed to welcome doctrinal changes, regarding such \\"adjustments\\" as \\"new light\\" or \\"new understanding\\" from God.Osamu Muramoto, \\"Bioethics of the Refusal of Blood by Jehovah's Witnesses, Part 1\\", Journal of Medical Ethics, August 1998, Vol 24, Issue 4, pp. 223-230.\\"The Path of the Righteous Does Keep Getting Brighter\\", The Watchtower, December 1, 1981, pp. 26-31. The view is based on their interpretation of Proverbs 4:18, which they believe refers to a continuous progressive advancement in doctrinal knowledge and scriptural understanding for \\"righteous ones\\", with the holy spirit helping \\"responsible representatives of 'the faithful and discreet slave' at world headquarters to discern deep truths that were not previously understood\\".\\"The Spirit Searches into the Deep Things of God\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 2010, p. 23, \\"When the time comes to clarify a spiritual matter in our day, holy spirit helps responsible representatives of 'the faithful and discreet slave' at world headquarters to discern deep truths that were not previously understood.

Robert Crompton, author of a book on Watch Tower eschatology, has noted that it is difficult to trace the development of doctrines because explicit changes are often not identified in Jehovah's Witness literature, leaving readers to assume which details have been superseded. The leadership makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses are expected to abide by the doctrines and organizational requirements as determined by the Governing Body. Watch Tower Society publications strongly discourage Witnesses from formulating doctrines and \\"private ideas\\" reached through independent Bible research.\\"Questions From Readers\\", The Watchtower April 1, 1986 pp. 30-31.\\"Make Your Advancement Manifest\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 2001, page 14, \\"Since oneness is to be observed, a mature Christian must be in unity and full harmony with fellow believers as far as faith and knowledge are concerned.

Witnesses undergoing baptism are required to publicly confirm that they are associating themselves \\"with God's spirit-directed organization\\", thereby submitting themselves to its direction and judicial system. Watch Tower Society publications urge Witnesses to demonstrate loyalty to the organization without dissent,\\"Meeting the Challenge of Loyalty\\", The Watchtower, March 15, 1996, page 16.\\"Building Disciples Having the Quality of Endurance\\", The Watchtower, April 1, 1970, page 213. even at the cost of family ties.\\"Do Not Resist Jehovah‚Äôs Counsel\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 1965, page 435.

Disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's concept of God's organization figured prominently in events that led to a 1980 purge of high-level members at the group's Brooklyn headquarters. A summary by a Governing Body committee of \\"wrong teachings\\" being promoted as \\"new understandings\\" included the suggestion that God did not have an organization on earth. Former Governing Body member Raymond Franz, who was expelled as part of the purge, subsequently criticized the Watch Tower concept of organization, claiming the concept‚Äîwhich posits that God does not deal with individuals apart from an organization‚Äîhas no scriptural support and serves only to reinforce the group's authority structure, with its strong emphasis on human authority. He also claimed that The Watchtower has repeatedly blurred discussions of both Jesus Christ's loyalty to God and the apostles' loyalty to Christ to promote the view that Witnesses should be loyal to the Watch Tower Society. Sociologist Andrew Holden has observed that Witnesses see no distinction between loyalty to Jehovah and to the movement itself, and other researchers have claimed that challenging the views of those higher up the hierarchical ladder is regarded as tantamount to challenging God himself. Restorationism Witnesses believe that after the death of the apostles, the Church embarked on a \\"Great Apostasy\\", diverging from the original teachings of Jesus on several major points. Influenced by Restorationism in the 19th century, Charles Taze Russell and his associates formed a Bible study group in the 1870s in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, developing teachings that they considered to be a revival of \\"the great truths taught by Jesus and the Apostles\\".Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, December 1, 1916, R6010: page 371. Watch Tower publications claim both the Great Apostasy and Russell's subsequent \\"restoration\\" of original Christianity\\"Religion‚Äôs Future in View of Its Past\\", Awake!, October 22, 1989, p. 17. were a fulfilment of Jesus' parable of the wheat and the weeds at Matthew 13:24-30,36-43.\\"Is religion at the root of Mankind's problem?\\", The Watchtower, February 15, 2004, page 5. Although many of their eschatological teachings have changed over the years, Jehovah's Witnesses have consistently claimed to be the only true religion.Reasoning from the Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 203. Based on their interpretation of Revelation 18:2-24, Jehovah's Witnesses believe all other religions are part of \\"Babylon the Great\\", a \\"world empire of false religion\\" under the control of Satan; consequently, they refuse all ecumenical relations with other religious denominations. Bible Jehovah's Witnesses prefer to use the New World Translation of the Bible. The entire Protestant canon of scripture is seen as the inspired, inerrant word of God. Jehovah's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliableAll Scripture is Inspired of God, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1990, page 336. and interpret much of it literally, while also accepting it contains much symbolism.\\"Obedience to the Good News a Way of Life\\", The Watchtower, October 15, 1977, page 618. Jehovah's Witnesses base all of their beliefs on the Bible, as interpreted by the Governing Body.Reasoning From The Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 199-208. They use the terms Hebrew and Christian Greek Scriptures rather than Old and New Testament to avoid implication that the Old Testament is outdated or inferior.\\"Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures‚ÄîWhich?\\", The Watchtower March 1, 1995, p. 19. They believe that the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) contain prophecy that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ,\\"We Have Found the Messiah\\"!, The Watchtower, October 1, 1992, p. 10. and that the books of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) are primarily directed to the 144,000 chosen by God for life in heaven.United In Worship of the Only True God, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1983, p. 111. The Watch Tower Society's New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures--the main translation used by Jehovah's Witnesses--renders the name of God as Jehovah, rather than ' or ' as found in English translations such as the King James Version. God Jehovah's Witnesses believe God is the Creator and Supreme Being.; Witnesses reject the Trinity doctrine, which they consider unscriptural. They view God as the Father, an invisible spirit \\"person\\" separate from the Son, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is described as God's \\"active force\\", rather than the third part of the Trinity.Should You Believe in the Trinity?, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, pages 14, 20. They believe God is \\"infinite, but approachable\\"; he is not omnipresent, but has a location in heaven; it is possible to have a personal relationship with him as a friend; he is kind and merciful, and would not eternally \\"torture\\" wicked people. Being respectful of the principle of free will, he does not force his sovereignty on people, choosing to save only those who want to serve him, even though the course of mankind in general may lead them to harm. Witnesses teach that God must be distinguished by his personal name--Jehovah. The name is a common modern Latinized form of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, or four-letter name, transliterated as YHWH. The use of his personal name is regarded as vital for true worship, and Witnesses usually preface the term God with the name Jehovah. The title, ' (Greek: Kyrios), is rarely used by Witnesses when speaking about God. Because no other religion uses the name Jehovah with the same prevalence, they believe that only Jehovah's Witnesses are making God's name known. Jesus Christ Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God's \\"only-begotten Son\\", and that his life began in heaven.Insight On The Scriptures volume 2, p. 52 Jesus Christ He is described as God's first creation and the \\"exact representation of God\\",Worship the Only True God, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2002, p. 184 but is believed to be a separate entity and not part of a Trinity. Jesus is said to have been used by God in the creation of all other things.\\"What Do the Scriptures Say About 'the Divinity of Christ'?, The Watchtower January 15, 1992 p. 20-23. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Archangel Michael, \\"the Word\\" of John 1:1, and wisdom personified in Proverbs 8 refer to Jesus in his pre-human existence and that he resumed these identities after his ascension to heaven following his death and resurrection. They also identify him with the \\"rider of the white horse\\" at Revelation 6 and 19.\\"Jehovah‚Äôs Word Is Alive Highlights From the Book of Revelation\\", The Watchtower, February 15, 2009 p. 3. His birth on earth was accomplished when he willingly allowed himself to be transferred, by God, from heaven to the womb of the virgin, Mary.Jesus? The Ruler \\"Whose Origin Is From Early Times\\", The Watchtower, June 15, 1998, p. 22. While on earth, Jesus was executed as a sacrifice to atone for mankind's sins, becoming the \\"eternal father\\" to the human family.Worldwide Security Under the ‚ÄúPrince of Peace‚Äù, chap. 20 p. 163 par. 8 A Happy Human Family Under a New Fatherhood They believe that after his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples, convinced them of his resurrection, and then ascended into heaven to sit at Jehovah's right hand until he would become the promised king of God's heavenly kingdom. Jesus acts as the mediator of a \\"new covenant\\"\\"Appreciate Jesus‚Äô Unique Role in God‚Äôs Purpose\\", pages 13-14, The Watchtower, December 15, 2008, \\"The original-language word translated ‚Äúmediator‚Äù is a legal term. It refers to Jesus as a legal Mediator (or, in a sense, an attorney) of the new covenant... What about those who are not in the new covenant, those who hope to live forever on earth, not in heaven? While not participants in the new covenant, these are beneficiaries of it. ... Whether we have a heavenly hope or an earthly hope, each one of us has good reason to appreciate Jesus‚Äô role as the Mediator of the new covenant.\\" referred to in Jeremiah 31:31, Luke 22:20, and Hebrews 9:15; 12:24, directly mediating only for those going to heaven (the 144,000). Those with an earthly hope are said to be beneficiaries of that covenant.Insight on the Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, Vol 2, page 360.Questions From Readers, The Watchtower, August 15, 1989, p. 30. Even as king of God's kingdom, Jesus remains subordinate to God. Witnesses reject the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, who they believe bore more children after Jesus.Jesus' Family--Who Were They? The Watchtower December 15, 2003, p. 3 Cross The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society used the Cross and Crown symbol on tombstones, and on its publications until 1931. Since 1936, Jehovah's Witnesses have rejected the idea that Jesus died on a cross, and instead teach that he died on a single wooden stake (crux simplex), asserting that the Koine Greek word \\"œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ\\" (stauros) refers to a single upright post. They consider the cross to be of pagan origins and an object of idol worship. Some Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted or killed for not bowing down to or kissing a cross. Satan Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Satan was originally a perfect angel who developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship that belonged to God. Satan persuaded Adam and Eve to obey him rather than God, raising the issue--often referred to as a \\"controversy\\"-- of whether people, having been granted free will, would obey God under both temptation and persecution. The issue is said to be whether God can rightfully claim to be sovereign of the universe. Instead of destroying Satan, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind and to prove to the rest of creation that Satan was a liar.\\"Declaration and resolution\\", The Watchtower, December 1, 1973, page 724. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Satan is God's chief adversary and the invisible ruler of the world. They believe that demons were originally angels who rebelled against God and took Satan's side in the controversy. Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Satan lives in Hell or that he has been given responsibility to punish the wicked. Satan and his demons are said to have been cast down from heaven to the earth in 1914, marking the beginning of the \\"last days\\". Witnesses believe that Satan and his demons influence individuals, organizations and nations, and that they are the cause of human suffering. At Armageddon, Satan is to be bound for 1,000 years, and then given a brief opportunity to mislead perfect humanity before being destroyed.The Watchtower, 15 March 2009, p. 15, ‚ÄúBe Vigilant‚Äù Writers including James Beckford and former members James Penton and Barbara Grizzuti Harrison have stated that Jehovah's Witnesses' have a fear of demons, which Penton says is \\"sometimes so extreme that it becomes quite superstitious\\". However, Penton also notes that avoidance of \\"demonistic practices\\" has released many people in Africa and Latin America from fear of spirits.Havor Montague, \\"The Pessimistic Sect's Influence on the Mental Health of Its Members\\", Social Compass, 1977/1, page 144. Watch Tower Society publications state that Witnesses need not harbor dread or superstitious fear of demons, because their power over humans is limited.\\"Angels-How They Affect Us\\", The Watchtower, January 15, 2006 pg. 7, \\"Demons are dangerous, but we do not dread them.\\"\\"True Religion Dispels Fear‚ÄìHow?\\" The Watchtower, November 1, 1987, pg. 6, \\"True, demons are powerful.

Bible writer James further says: \\"Subject yourselves, therefore, to God; but oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you.\\" (James 4:7) Your superstitious fear will likewise flee.\\" God's Messianic Kingdom Publications of Jehovah's Witnesses teach that God's kingdom is a literal government in heaven, established in 1914,\\"What Has God‚Äôs Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?\\", The Watchtower, October 15, 1966, page 617. ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 humans raised to heaven.The Government That Will Bring Paradise, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1993, page 3.

The kingdom is said to have been the focus of Jesus' ministry.\\"God‚Äôs Kingdom‚ÄîEarth‚Äôs New Rulership\\", The Watchtower, October 15, 2000, page 10. Death Witnesses regard the soul as mortal, based on the statement at Ezekiel 18:4 that \\"the soul that sins, it shall die\\" (MKJV)You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 77. and thus believe the soul does not continue to live after one dies.\\"Is There LIFE After Death?\\", The Watchtower July 15, 2001. Death is considered a state of non-existence, based on their understanding of Ecclesiastes 9:5: \\"For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.\\" Witnesses believe that the only hope for life after death is in the resurrection, which they say involves re-creation by God of the same individual with a new body.Reasoning From The Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 333. They believe that 144,000 people will be resurrected to life as spirit creatures in heaven to be priestly rulers under Christ, but the vast majority, to physical life on earth.\\"The Only Remedy!\\", The Watchtower March 15, 2006, p. 6. Watch Tower publications teach that hell (hades or sheol) is not a place of fiery torment, but rather the \\"common grave of mankind\\", a place of unconscious non-existence.\\"Hell--Eternal Torture or Common Grave?\\" The Watchtower, April 15, 1993, p. 6.

They reason that complete destruction does not allow for literal \\"torture\\" of the wicked, as the deceased person is not conscious.Insight On The Scriptures, Vol 1, p. 906. Based on this, they believe that parables such as that of \\"the rich man and Lazarus\\" should not be interpreted literally, and that such references are speaking of symbolic death, not the physical death of actual individuals.\\"The Dead Who Are in Line for Resurrection\\", The Watchtower, February 1, 1965, p.76.

According to Watch Tower Society theology, salvation requires Christ's mediation as part of God's purpose to grant humans everlasting life, either in heaven (for 144,000 \\"anointed\\" Christians, or the \\"little flock\\") or on earth (for the \\"other sheep\\", the remainder of faithful humanity).The terms \\"little flock\\" and \\"other sheep\\" are drawn from Luke 12:32 and John 10:16 respectively. For anointed Witnesses, salvation is said to be achieved through their death and subsequent resurrection to heavenly life to share with Christ as a co-ruler of God's kingdom;‚ÄùKeep Your Hope of Salvation Bright!‚Äù, The Watchtower, June 1, 2000, pages 9-14. for others, it is gained by preservation through the Great Tribulation and the battle of Armageddon. Watch Tower Society publications state that salvation at Armageddon is also contingent on baptism, accurate knowledge of Bible truth, adherence to God's standards of conduct and morality, use of the divine name \\"Jehovah\\" in worship,‚ÄùSalvation ‚Äì What It Really Means,‚Äù The Watchtower, August 15, 1997, pgs 4-7. membership of God's \\"organization\\", and active support of anointed Christians.‚ÄùRejoicing in Our Hope‚Äù, The Watchtower, March 15, 2012, page 20. 144,000 anointed Based on a literal interpretation of scriptures such as Revelation 14:1‚Äì4, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that exactly 144,000 faithful Christians go to heaven as spirit creatures to rule with Christ in the kingdom of God. They believe that most of those are already in heaven, and that the \\"remnant\\" at Revelation 12:17 (KJV) refers to those remaining alive on earth who will be immediately resurrected to heaven when they die or during the Great Tribulation. The Witnesses understand Jesus‚Äô words at John 3:3‚Äî\\"except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\\"‚Äîto apply to the 144,000 who are \\"born again\\" as \\"anointed\\" sons of God in heaven.The Watchtower 11/1/96 p. 10 Look to Jehovah for Comfort: ‚ÄúOne of the main operations of God‚Äôs spirit upon first-century Christians was to anoint them as adopted spiritual sons of God and brothers of Jesus.

Only those claiming to be anointed partake of the unleavened bread and wine at the yearly commemoration of Christ's death, or Memorial. According to The Watchtower, \\"the Governing Body does not keep a list of all partakers, for it does not maintain a global network of anointed ones.\\" Other sheep Watch Tower Society literature states that Jesus' use of the term \\"other sheep\\" at John 10:16 indicates a separate class with an earthly hope.The Watchtower 2/1/98 p. 20 par. 7 The Other Sheep and the New Covenant Those of the \\"other sheep\\" who die faithful to God will receive the \\"resurrection of the righteous\\" (\\"just\\" KJV) mentioned at Acts 24:15.The Watchtower 2/15/95 p. 11 par. 12 'There Will Be a Resurrection of the Righteous: ‚ÄúMen and women of old who exercised strong faith in Jehovah and his promises and remained faithful to the death were declared righteous by Jehovah on the basis of their faith, and they will without doubt share in the ‚Äòresurrection of the righteous.‚Äô Those who die without faithfully serving God will receive the \\"resurrection of the ... unrighteous\\" (\\"unjust\\" KJV).

They assert that the Greek word parousia (translated in most English Bible translations as coming when referring to Christ) is more accurately rendered presence, perceived only by a composite \\"sign\\".\\"Maintain Your Sense of Urgency\\", The Watchtower, March 15, 2012, p. 18. As such, the Second Coming is considered an invisible presence, lasting for an extended period of time, and ending with Jesus' \\"coming\\" to separate the Sheep and the Goats.\\"Jesus‚Äô Coming or Jesus‚Äô Presence‚ÄîWhich?\\", The Watchtower, August 15, 1996, p. 12.\\"Tell Us, When Will These Things Be?\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 2013, p. 6. They believe that when Jesus became king, Satan was ousted from heaven to the earth, bringing a period of \\"woe\\" to mankind.The Watchtower, February 1, 1996, p6. Witnesses base their beliefs about the significance of 1914 on the Watch Tower Society's interpretation of biblical chronology,\\"Why do Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses say that God‚Äôs Kingdom was established in 1914?\\", Reasoning From the Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 95-96. based on their belief that the destruction of Jerusalem and the beginning of the Babylonian captivity both occurred in 607 BCE. (The secularly accepted date for the fall of Jerusalem is within a year of 587 BCE; exiles were taken in various years, with most Jews exiled to Babylon following the siege of Jerusalem of 597 BCE.) They believe that Daniel chapter 4 prophesied a period of 2,520 years starting with 607 BCE and ending at 1914 CE.Let Your Kingdom Come, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 1981, pp. 186-189 Appendix to Chapter 14. They equate this period with the \\"Gentile Times\\" or \\"the appointed times of the nations\\", a phrase taken from Luke 21:24. They believe that when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem, the line of kings descended from David was interrupted, and that God's throne was \\"trampled on\\" from then until Jesus began ruling in October 1914.What Does The Bible Really Teach?, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, pp. 217-218. Witnesses believe their doctrine is confirmed by world events since 1914, including wars, famine, earthquakes and increasing lawlessness, which they see as fulfillment of the \\"sign\\" of Christ's presence.The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1981, pg 86.True Peace and Security--How Can You Find It?, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1986, pp 81-84. They believe that their preaching is also part of that sign, citing Matthew 24:14.\\"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in all the world as a witness to all nations. And then the end shall come.\\" - Matthew 24:14.The Watchtower, October 15, 2000, p11.Awake!, October 22, 1993, p. 11. Witnesses teach that in 1918, Jesus resurrected those of the 144,000 (the \\"anointed\\") who had already died to heavenly life; since 1918, any \\"anointed\\" are individually resurrected to heavenly life at the time of their death to serve as kings alongside Christ in his heavenly government.Revelation--Its Grand Climax At Hand!, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, page 102-104. The current world era, or \\"system of things\\", is considered to be in its \\"last days\\",\\"Deliverance by God‚Äôs Kingdom Is at Hand!\\", The Watchtower, May 15, 2008, page 15. facing imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ, leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably. This judgment will begin with the destruction by the United Nations of false religion, which they identify as \\"Babylon the Great\\", or the \\"harlot\\", of Revelation 17.Revelation ‚Äì Its Grand Climax at Hand, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, pages 235-236. This will mark the beginning of the great tribulation.\\"Apocalypse‚ÄîWhen?\\", The Watchtower, February 15, 1986, page 6. Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon, during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's \\"sheep\\", or true followers, will be destroyed.Revelation ‚Äì Its Grand Climax at Hand, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, page 286. The Society's publications make no explicit claim about whether small children or the mentally ill will survive, but say God's judgment will be righteous and merciful.\\"Strengthening Our Confidence in God's Righteousness\\", The Watchtower, August 15, 1998 p. 20 After Armageddon, Satan will be cast into an abyss and unable to influence humanity, then God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden. Most of those who had died prior to God's intervention will gradually be resurrected to a \\"day of judgment\\" lasting for the thousand years referred to in Revelation 20.The Watchtower, May 15, 2006, p 6. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds.Insight on the Scriptures, Vol. 2, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 788. At the end of the thousand years, Christ will hand all authority back to God.Pay Attention to Daniel‚Äôs Prophecy!, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 2006, pp. 94,95. Then Satan is released for a final opportunity to mislead perfect mankind;The Watchtower, May 1, 2005, p. 20. Satan, his demons, and any who fail the test will be destroyed, leaving a fully tested, perfect human race who will live forever.The Watchtower, August 15, 2006, p. 31 Defection Watch Tower Society publications assert that members of the group are not compelled to remain part of the congregation.Questions From Readers, The Watchtower, July 1, 1984, page 31. They believe coerced worship is unacceptable to God. However, Jehovah's Witness doctrines provide no method for members to terminate membership and remain in good standing. Individuals who choose to depart and announce their decision to terminate their membership are regarded as abandoning God's organization and protection. Watch Tower publications define three different types of defection. One as becoming inactive, one as becoming disassociated, and one as becoming disfellowshipped. Individuals who are inactive discontinue their preaching work and distance themselves from the congregation. They are still visited by church elders yearly and encouraged by congregation members. Individuals who choose to publicly repudiate their association to the organization and renounce their place in the congregation are considered disassociated. Individuals who commit serious sins and are unrepentant are considered disfellowshipped. Watch Tower Society directs that both disassociated and disfellowshipped members are to be shunned by other Witnesses, including close relatives, with no social or religious contact and no greeting given.\\"Disfellowshiping‚ÄîHow to View It\\", The Watchtower, September 15, 1981, page 23. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses claim the purpose of denying fellowship to a wrongdoer safeguards the congregation‚Äôs moral and spiritual cleanliness and protects its name. They believe the congregation must ‚Äúmaintain God‚Äôs favor in order to be used by him and to represent him‚Äù or else the whole congregation would lose God‚Äôs approval. Sociologist Andrew Holden claims his research indicated many Witnesses who would otherwise defect because of disillusionment with the organization and its teachings remain affiliated out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members. Apostasy Watch Tower Society publications define apostasy as the abandonment of the worship and service of God by members of the Christian congregation, and equate it with rebellion against God.Reasoning From the Scriptures, pages 34-35. Apostate behavior is said to include the rejection of biblical teachings or requirements, the rejection of Jehovah's organization, association with or support for another religious groupQuestions From Readers, The Watchtower, July 15, 1985, page 31, \\"Such ones willfully abandoning the Christian congregation thereby become part of the ‚Äòantichrist.‚Äô A person who had willfully and formally disassociated himself from the congregation would have matched that description. By deliberately repudiating God‚Äôs congregation and by renouncing the Christian way, he would have made himself an apostate. A loyal Christian would not have wanted to fellowship with an apostate ... Scripturally, a person who repudiated God‚Äôs congregation became more reprehensible than those in the world.\\" and celebration of religious holidays.Pay Attention To Yourselves and to All the Flock, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, pages 94-95. It is grounds for expulsion from the group and subsequent shunning. Promotion of personal doctrinal views that deviate from official teachings is also regarded as apostasy. The \\"identifying marks\\" of apostates are said to include attempts to gain followers, disregard for the Witnesses‚Äô preaching activity, rejection of God's visible organization, public criticism of other Witnesses and attempts to hinder their work. Other identifying behavior is said to include deviation from the truth, twisted, empty speech, hypocrisy and involvement in deeper forms of ungodliness.\\"Remain Solid in the Faith\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1980, pages 17-21. Watch Tower Society literature says apostates are motivated by vitriolic bitterness and that their writings are poisonous, distorted and false, display the characteristics of \\"cunning, contrived error, prideful intelligence, lack of love and dishonesty\\" and are designed to undermine the faith of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses.\\"At Which Table Are You Feeding\\", The Watchtower, July 1, 1994, pages 11-12. Apostates are described as proud, independent, ungrateful and presumptuous, mentally diseased,\\"Will You Heed Jehovah's Clear Warnings?\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 2011, page 16.Jerome Taylor, \\"War of words breaks out among Jehovah's Witnesses\\", The Independent, September 27, 2011. displaying jealousy, fits of anger and other unchristian conduct and are said to often fall victim to drunken bouts, loose conduct and fornication. Apostates are said to have become part of the antichrist and are regarded as more reprehensible than non-Witnesses. They are described as \\"anti-God\\" and doomed to destruction.\\"Why So Many Christian Sects?\\" The Watchtower, March 15, 1975, page 167. Witnesses are told they must loathe and hate in the \\"biblical sense of the word\\" those who are defined as apostates and show no curiosity about their ideas,\\"Search Through Me, Oh God,\\" The Watchtower, October 1, 1993, page 19. and that apostates' \\"whole purpose is to tear down God's people and to distort the truth.\\" Apostates must be shunned and Witnesses are warned that those who greet one become \\"a sharer in his wicked works\\". Education Jehovah's Witnesses are directed to study the Bible using Watch Tower Society publications Jehovah's Witnesses regard secular education as fundamental, but they emphasize their preaching work as the top priority in their life. Therefore, they promote moral and spiritual education over secular education. Higher education is discouraged, based on their belief that it is futile to plan for secular advancement in a world that faces imminent destruction, as well as fears about succumbing to greed, corruption, and materialism. There are concerns that those who seek high education will become distracted from their preaching work by material advancement and success.\\"Repudiate Valueless Things\\", The Watchtower, April 15, 2008, page 4.\\"Parents‚ÄîWhat Future Do You Want for Your Children?\\", The Watchtower, October 1, 2005, pages 26-29. Because evangelistic activities take priority over educational success, young Witnesses rarely progress to college or university, which Holden describes as a source of regret in subsequent years among those who are raised in the organization and later choose to leave. Watch Tower Society publications advise parents to recommend alternatives to university education for their children, suggesting associate degrees from community or technical colleges or short courses in subjects. They urge young Witnesses to pursue higher education only to gain skills to obtain a reasonable living while maintaining flexibility to pursue their \\"true\\" vocation, serving God.\\"Parents‚ÄîWhat Future Do You Want for Your Children?\\", The Watchtower, October 1, 2005, p. 26-31. Author James Penton's major study of the Witnesses, Apocalypse Delayed, noted that of those Witnesses who do progress to university, few are likely to take studies in such areas as the humanities and the social sciences, \\"disciplines that are most threatening to the Witness world-view\\". Jehovah's Witnesses provide religious training programs for their members, focusing on improving skills for their ministry. These include literacy classes, Pioneer Service School, School for Kingdom Evangelizers and Gilead School. Some of these programs are by invitation only.\\"Some Educational Opportunities Available\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, October 2011, Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc., pages 5-6 References Bibliography  External links *What Do Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses Believe?

It does not grant independence to Namibia, but rather recognises the Republic of Namibia as \\"a sovereign and independent state\\". The act relinquishes any and all South African authority over Namibia, and provides that, as far as South Africa is concerned, South African laws no longer have effect in Namibia. (The Constitution of Namibia, however, provides for the laws in force in Namibia prior to independence to continue in force subject to amendment.) The act also contains a savings clause providing that it does not recognise \\"the validity of any provision of the Constitution of Namibia which purports to derogate from the sovereignty of the Republic over its territory.\\" This is a reference to the Orange River border dispute; South Africa claims that its border with Namibia runs along the north bank of the Orange River, while Namibia claims that it runs along the middle and included a provision to that effect in its constitution. The act was subsequently followed by the South African Citizenship at Attainment of Independence by Namibia Regulation Act, 1990, which provided for the loss or retention of South African citizenship by residents of Namibia, and by two Application of Certain Laws to Namibia Abolition Acts and several General Law Amendment Acts which repealed laws specific to South West Africa and amended laws to remove references to the former territory.

Early history 1941 Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo Eight coupe (B-body) Along with Oldsmobile, Pontiac had the distinction of having all three of General Motors' mainstream platforms in 1940, but this would last only one more year. In 1940 Pontiac introduced its first B-bodied car, the Deluxe Series 28 Eight. Also in 1940, Pontiac introduced the Torpedo on the C-body. The new C-body featured cutting-edge \\"torpedo\\" styling. Shoulder and hip room was over wider, running boards were eliminated and the exterior was streamlined and lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the Cadillac Sixty Special. In 1941 the A-body and B-body were similarly redesigned. Consequently, Pontiac renamed its entire line-up \\"Torpedo\\", with models ranging from the low-end A-bodied Deluxe Torpedo (with a wheelbase), the mid-level B-bodied Streamliner Torpedo (with a wheelbase up from the previous year), and the high-end C-bodied Custom Torpedo (with the same wheelbase as the previous year). 1941 was the last year Pontiac offered a model with the GM C-body until the big \\"Clamshell\\" tailgate Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari station wagons of 1971-76. For 1942, the Torpedo name was assigned to the A-bodied Pontiac while the Streamliner became the B-bodied Pontiac.  1942-1948  1947 Pontiac Streamliner Station Wagon Streamliners used the larger B-body and, except for the station wagons, used fastback styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended back to the front doors, eliminating the cowl. The grille, bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the vertical side grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem in the middle of the upper main surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six- cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime \\"blackout\\" trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey. 1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe coupe 1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe coupe With the end of the C-body Pontiac Custom Torpedo, station wagon production was transferred to the new Streamliner line. The final body work continued to be done at either the Hercules Body Company or at Ionia Manufacturing. The Streamliner station wagon ranged from $1265 for a base Six to $1340 for a Chieftain Eight, making it Pontiac's most expensive model. At in overall length the 1942 Pontiac Streamliner station wagon also set a record for the longest Pontiac, this would not be exceeded until the 1959 Pontiac Star Chief and Bonneville. The first postwar Pontiac available (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which remained the sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps. Streamliners could be identified by straight back Indian moldings on the rear hood ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the \\"speedline\\" fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the \\"speedlines\\" identified Eights. Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth. Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used imitation leather upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware. Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model. A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs. In 1947 the \\"Silver Streak\\" styling theme was continued, now with five bands of chrome on hoods. All Pontiacs had new grilles with four broad gently bowed horizontal bars. Hoods and fenders were protected by an inverted steer's horn shaped bar incorporating a die cast plate with indianhead relief. Interiors for sedans and coupes were redesigned with Berwicke beige panels for dashboard and windows. Windshield, door and garnish moldings were finished in Autumn Brown with dado stripe border moldings. All coupes and sedans were fastbacks with full-loop around window moldings. Streamliner station wagons ranged in price from $1992 for a standard Six to $2111 for a Deluxe Eight, again making them Pontiac's most expensive model. Sales of Streamliners totaled 128,660 in 1947, or nearly 56% of all Pontiacs sold. In 1948 a new Pontiac styling included triple \\"Silver Streaks,\\" a horizontal grille theme with vertical shaft, and round taillights. The word \\"Silver Streak\\" was carried on the sides of the hood with eights having an \\"8\\" placed between the two words. Streamliners were again larger and more expensive than other Pontiacs. All Streamliners, be they 2-door or 4-door fastbacks, or station wagons, now came standard or Deluxe. Deluxe models were distinguished by spear moldings on front fender, bright gravel guards, and chrome plated wheel discs on all cars except wagons. Deluxe interiors had two tone trims with pillow-and-tuft seatbacks, quarter sawed mahogany dash and window trim, electric glovebox door clocks, Deluxe steering wheels and other rich appointments. Standard Streamliner station wagons had tan imitation leather seats and Deluxe wagons had red upholstery of the same type. Station wagon prices ranged from $2364 for a standard Six to $2490 for a Deluxe Eight, making them Pontiac's most expensive model. In 1948 160,857 Streamliners were sold, accounting for nearly 66% of all Pontiacs. Perhaps the biggest story of 1948 for Pontiac was the addition of Hydramatic automatic transmission as an option. As of 1948 only General Motors sold cars with fully automatic transmissions and the only other way to get one was to buy a higher priced Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. Chevrolet would not introduce Powerglide until 1950, Ford FordoMatic until 1951 (Lincoln would start buying Hydramatics from GM in 1949), and Chrysler, PowerFlite on Imperials, until 1953. Hydramatic proved very popular with a total of 171,946 Pontiacs sold with it, or about 71% of all Pontiacs, and with 122,327 Streamliners equipped with it, or about 76% of all Streamliners, in its first year. Since Hydramatic was still only optional on Cadillac and Oldsmobile, and Dynaflow optional on Buick Roadmaster, given the total sales of Cadillac (50,619), Oldsmobile (173,661) and Buick Roadmaster (80,071), and the fact that Dynaflow was only introduced in the middle of the model year, this implies that probably over 40% of all cars sold with automatic transmissions in 1948 were Pontiacs.  1949-1951  Silver-Streak Eight engine The 1949 Pontiacs featured low sleek envelope bodies. Streamliner coupes and sedans utilized the fastback B-body shell. Station wagons continued to be part of the Streamliner line. All of these cars came as standards or Deluxes. All station wagons and other standard models had small hubcaps. Standard coupes, sedans, and wagons were characterized by an absence of beltline trim along with use of rubber gravel guards and painted headlight rims. Deluxes had beltline moldings, chrome gravel guards and bright plated headlight doors. Silver Streak styling was seen again. Silver Streak lettering was placed above front fender spears on Deluxes and high on the fenders of standards. Eights had the number \\"8\\" between the two words. Most standard models had gray striped pattern cloth upholstery. Most Deluxes used dark gray broadcloth trims. Wagons were trimmed as before except imitation leather was only used on standard wagons. 1949 was the last year for wood- bodied station wagons, as production shifted to all-metal station wagons with woodgrain trim during the model year. Streamliner station wagons continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model, ranging in price from $2543 for a standard Six to $2690 for a Deluxe Eight. The 1950 Pontiacs utilized the popular 1949 envelope bodies with revisions to trim and appointments. The horizontal center grille bar now wrapped around the corners of the body. Deluxes had a chrome body strip, chrome wheel rings, chrome headlight rings and stainless steel gravel guards. Eights had an \\"8\\" between the words. Streamliners (except for station wagons and sedan delivery trucks) had fastback styling. The price of Streamliner station wagons fell to a range of $2264 for standard Sixes to $2411 for Deluxe Eights due to the fact all-metal construction did not require final work be done at Hercules Body Company or Iona Manufacturing. Nevertheless, the Streamliner station wagon remained the most expensive Pontiac model. The 1951 \\"Silver Anniversary\\" Pontiacs reflected 25 years of advanced engineering. A wing shaped grille was seen and a Silver Streak theme continued. Streamliners again used the B-body shell with sloping fastbacks on coupes. Deluxes had chrome body strip, bright gravel guards, and headlight rings. Belt line moldings on all Deluxe passenger cars (not station wagons) had a dip behind the doors. Standard belt moldings were straight. A script plate reading Pontiac was used on Series 25 Sixes and on Series 27 Eights a different script read Pontiac Eight. In its final year, the Streamliner station wagon continued to be Pontiac's most expensive model, ranging in price from $2470 for a standard Six to $2629 for a Deluxe Eight. Pontiac's headquarter operations at the Pontiac, Michigan plant was responsible for 49.2% of all Pontiacs built in 1951. With the demise of the Streamliner, 1951 would be the last time Pontiac offered a B-bodied car until 1959.

It is the Japanese derivative of the Chinese Gu magic. To create kodoku, sorcerers would mix several insects in a jar, and let them kill one another until only one survived. The fluids of the insect that survived would be used to poison an individual with a curse that would control them, cause them misfortune, or kill them. The remaining insect could also be used as a sort of \\"luck charm\\" granting the one who performed the ritual great wealth. In return the owner is supposed to feed the bug. Neglecting to do so would enrage the insect, if the owner does not equivalently repay the insect by placing all his or her riches beside a road, plus interest in gold and silver, the insect would devour the home owner. Therefore, this ritual could also be used as a death curse by giving the riches to an ignorant individual.

The film stars Joan Blondell, Glenda Farrell, and Hugh Herbert. The film was based on the short story of the same name by Frederick Hazlitt Brennan in the Collier's magazine. It was released by Warner Bros. on December 14, 1935. Two stranded showgirls in California enter a beauty contest \\"Miss Pacific Fleet\\" to win the fare back home to New York City. This is one of a series of five movies by Warner Bros. through the early 1930s, where Blondell and Farrell were paired as blonde bombshell comedy duo. The other films in the series are Havana Widows (1933), Kansas City Princess (1934), Traveling Saleslady (1935) and We're in the Money (1935). Four of the five movies were directed by Ray Enright. They also co-starred in other Warner Bros. films in Three on a Match (1932), I've Got Your Number (1934) and Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936). Plot Gloria Fay (Joan Blondell) and Mae O'Brien (Glenda Farrell) are two former showgirls working in an amusement park. Sailor Kewpie Wiggins (Allen Jenkins) is in love with Gloria, when he wins all their prizes with his skill at tossing rings, he learns that Gloria and Mae are broke. Kewpie suggests that Gloria enters the Miss Pacific Fleet contest to win the cash prize. Kewpie then offers to enter a boxing match in order to win 5000 votes for Gloria. He introduces Gloria and Mae to his friend Sgt.Tom Foster (Warren Hull). Tom and Gloria fall in love. During the boxing match, Kewpie is losing the match until he sees that Gloria and Tom are cuddling together in the audience. Angered, he knocks out his opponent and decides to give his 5000 votes to another contestant Virgie Matthews (Marie Wilson). However, Gloria is still slightly ahead in the contest. Sadie Freytag (Minna Gombell) who is married to August Freytag, the creator of the beauty contest is jealous of Gloria and decides to kidnap her, so the prize will go to someone else instead. When Mae learns of her plans, she alerts Kewpie, who spots the kidnappers putting a woman in a small boat. Kewpie chases them to a ship where he frees the woman who ends up to be Sadie. At the last minute, Tom and Gloria arrive at contest headquarters with enough votes for her to win the contest. Gloria and Mae now have enough money to return home to New York.

Warner Archive has released a double feature DVD collection of Miss Pacific Fleet (1935) and Traveling Saleslady (1935) on April 5, 2012. Reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times writes in his review: \\"As unimportant as a corkscrew at a W. C. T. U. convention. Miss Pacific Fleet should not have been impeded in its headlong flight for second place on a double-feature bill. Being placed alone on the Roxy's screen imposes too great a strain upon the picture and the audience, even conceding that the Roxy's faithful are ever anxious to absorb large doses of nautical comedy. This one has a complicated genealogy. The story is credited to Frederick Hazlitt Brennan; the screen play stems from Lucille Newmark and Peter Milne; there is additional dialogue by one Patsy Flick. From these no less than mountainous labors comes a mousey little photoplay about two stranded chorus girls whose only hope of getting their fare back to Broadway is by winning a popularity contest with the votes of the enlisted men of the Pacific Fleet. Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell, upon whose comic talents the Warners are placing too much emphasis, are the girls; Allen Jenkins is Kewpie Wiggins, their lobbyist in the fleet; Hugh Herbert is August Freytag, president of the Better Business Bureau sponsoring the contest. There is an allegedly humorous prizefight; there is a kidnapping; there is a comedy chase. What more can one expect of a sub-Class B picture? If the first half of the film is endurable, credit it to Mr. Herbert. If the second half is a bore, debit the Warners' recourse to the Old Familiars of Picture-Making. What Miss Pacific Fleet needs is rearmament in all departments.

Biography Pharmacy career Ludwig served his pharmacy apprenticeship at Kirchheim near Stuttgart from where he went on to work in Amsterdam, first as apothecary and later as technician in a chemical laboratory . In 1805 he responded to an advertisement in an Amsterdam newspaper and applied for a post as pharmacy assistant to a certain Stuttgart- born Dr Liesching of Cape Town. Friedrich Ludwig Liesching was a former physician to the W√ºrttemberg regiment at the Cape. Ludwig's application was accepted and he sailed for the Cape in October 1805. His qualifications as pharmacist were approved in 1807 by a body set up to scrutinise the Cape medical and apothecary fraternities. Ludwig was regarded as a physician.SA Medical Journal (June 1974) Business interests In January 1816 Ludwig married Alida Maria Burgers, widow of Carl Ferdinand Heinrich Altenstaedt. She had inherited a stately dwelling in St. George's Street, and a small but lucrative business from her husband who had been a brewer, and a tobacco and snuff merchant. The business continued to thrive and Ludwig became one of the notables of the Cape community, in 1824 helping to found the South African Literary Society. The success of the business afforded him ample leisure time, so that he could indulge in his other interest, the collection of natural history specimens. Ludwig Beil, the Cape Town organist, accompanied him on a collecting trip to Swellendam in 1826. That same year he shipped a collection of plants and insects to the Stuttgart Royal Museum, in recognition of which he was awarded a Knighthood of the Order of the Royal Crown of W√ºrttemberg, which entitled him to place the prefix 'von' in front of his surname. He took a larger collection of plants, insects, birds and mammals with him on an 1828 visit to Germany - for this he received an honorary Ph.D from the University of T√ºbingen. Botanical garden On his return from Europe, Von Ludwig bought about 3 acres of land in Kloof Street, Cape Town, and over the next couple of years planted the groundwork of a botanic garden. Besides large numbers of trees, shrubs and bulbs from Europe, America and Australia, he also included fruit trees, vegetables and crop plants. He introduced the Jacaranda tree to South Africa. Many of the species were indigenous, some acquired from Ecklon and Zeyher. The Irish botanist, Harvey, noted his appreciation of the easy access that was provided for studying the plants. Other prominent scientists such as Charles Bunbury and Joseph Dalton Hooker visited what had become known as Ludwigsburg Garden, while Lady Jane Franklin, who explored the garden in 1836, noted that even though only 3 acres in extent 'being well laid out with numerous divisions and paths' made it appear larger. The astronomer John Herschel used a camera lucida to sketch the developing site in 1834 (see drawing above).Cape Landscapes - Sir John Herschel's Sketches 1834-1838 A certain Leibold was first superintendent of the garden from 1834‚Äì37, followed by James Bowie over the period 1838-42, and Thomas Draper 1843-47 until Ludwig's death. The botanist Ludwig Pappe, later Colonial Botanist, prepared herbarium specimens from the garden plants. Cape explorations Von Ludwig made few long journeys exploring the Cape. In 1834 he and his wife visited Oudtshoorn, the nearby Cango Caves and the coastal town of Knysna, staying with the enigmatic George Rex. Ludwig did however support the idea of exploring the interior and played an active role in the 'Cape of Good Hope Association for exploring Central Africa'. From Ecklon he acquired a collection of insects, from Andrew Smith he obtained rare birds, and plant specimens from Zeyher and Dr√®ge. His collections continued to be shipped to Stuttgart and Frankfurt, and he sent Cape bulbs and seeds to various organisations such as the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. In recognition of these contributions Curtis's Botanical Magazine dedicated an issue to him (Vol.62 of 1835) as was Harvey's 1838 Genera of South African Plants. European visit In 1836 or 1837 Von Ludwig again visited Europe and presented large collections of natural history items to various scientific organisations. T√ºbingen conferred an honorary M.D., Stuttgart granted freedom of the city, while the King of W√ºrttemberg elevated him to the nobility with the hereditary title of 'Freiherr' (Baron), Cast, F. (Ed) (1839). Historisches und genealogisches Adelsbuch des K√∂nigreichs W√ºrttemburg made him a Knight Commander of the Royal Crown of W√ºrttemberg and presented him with a snuffbox 'richly set with diamonds'. While in Stuttgart he contacted Ferdinand Krauss, who had also started his career as an apothecary's apprentice, inviting him to the Cape. Since he had corresponded with him, he also visited William Jackson Hooker in Glasgow. South African journey In February 1838 Baron von Ludwig and his daughters left Portsmouth, together with Krauss who had agreed to go to South Africa. Their boat arrived in Table Bay on 7 May 1838. Krauss stayed with Von Ludwig for seven months, preparing for his trip eastwards. The hospitality Von Ludwig displayed to passing scientists and collectors was legendary - Joseph Burke had stayed with him when he arrived at the Cape in 1840. Von Ludwig supported the cause of the Voortrekkers and on various occasions sent them boxes of vegetable seeds acquired from Germany and the Netherlands. Von Ludwig continued with his active role in Cape affairs - he joined the committee of the Cape of Good Hope Agricultural Society in 1836 and that of the South African Public Library in 1843. He played a leading part in the founding of the Natal Cotton Company, the Cape of Good Hope Gaslight Company in 1845 and erecting a gasworks. South African Mining Company Rich copper deposits were known to exist in Namaqualand since the days of Cape governor Simon van der Stel in 1685, but had received little attention because of the remoteness of the location and its severe conditions. Between 1836 and 1837 the English explorer Sir James Alexander launched an expedition to Namaqualand, sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society. A year later he attempted extraction of copper in the area but abandoned the operation due to logistical problems. Alexander‚Äôs failed attempts reawakened interest in the possibility of mining. The South African Mining Company, the country's first mining company, was founded on 21 March 1846, with Baron von Ludwig as chairman, and a total of nine directors, all leading Cape Town businessmen. The location the company intended to mine was at 28¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ S, 17¬∞ 8‚Ä≤ E. Rich copper ore was found at the site, but a general reluctance by shareholders to fund a project that was not producing immediate profit, led to the company's eventual demise. Legacy After Baron von Ludwig's death his garden was offered for sale to the Colonial Government, but the offer was declined, though a few plants were bought for the so-called official Botanic Garden which had not been developed and was in a state of neglect. Various horticulturalists, such as Thomas Draper and Carl Zeyher were employed, but either resigned or were discharged due to differences with the Botanic Garden Committee who were bent on profit. Von Ludwig is commemorated in the plant species names Restio ludwigii, Tulbaghia ludwigiana, Hibiscus ludwigii and Hypoxis ludwigii. Among birds, Ludwig's bustard and the common square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus ludwigii) carry his name. Botanical Exploration in Southern Africa - Mary Gunn & L. E. Codd (AA Balkema,1981) Coats of arms Von Ludwig used at least two coats of arms. A bookplate, identifying him as 'C.F.H. von Ludwig Phil Dr', shows the arms as a quartered shield. The first quarter shows a wheatsheaf on a golden field, the second a silver fleur de lis on a blue field, the third a crescent moon on a red field, and the fourth a rampant red lion on gold.Bradlow, F.R. (1965). Baron Von Ludwig and the Ludwigsburg garden. Evidently this bookplate dates from between 1828 (when he was awarded the doctorate) and 1837 (when he was created a baron). New arms were granted to him together with the barony in 1837. They too were quartered, the first and fourth quarters showing a golden wheatsheaf on a blue background, and the second and third a silver fleur de lis on red.

The Mk. 1 entered police service in 1911 in a .32 ACP model for the London Metropolitan Police. The .455 version was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1912 as the first automatic pistol in British service. The pistol was also adopted by the Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal Flying Corps. Its predecessor was the unsuccessful Mars Automatic Pistol. Problems The pistol's original cordite cartridge left a lot of residue in the barrel causing frequent jamming. This was resolved in 1914 with nitrocellulose instead of cordite in the .455 cartridge. This new cartridge for the Mk.1 was called the Mark Iz. Had Webley invested in more research and development of its pistol and ammunition and new technologies, the result would have been a better firearm produced more quickly. Particularly given the increasing adoption of the semi-automatic pistol by foreign armed forces and the extensive testing and development data available from previous efforts by other manufacturers. Improvements and variations The first models of the Mk. 1 had the safety on left side of the hammer. This was later moved to the left side of the frame, where it could lock the slide.

Deadline is preceded by Feed (2010) and succeeded by Blackout (2012). Set after a zombie apocalypse and written from the perspective of blog journalist Shaun Mason, Deadline delves deeper into the conspiracy unveiled during the events of Feed (2010), while depicting Shaun's attempts to deal with the loss of his sister Georgia. Deadline delves more into the origins of the zombie-causing virus, and how humanity is responding to it on societal, biological, and psychological levels. Reviews of Deadline have highlighted the book's improvements over Feed and McGuire's avoidance of the problems normally associated with the middle work of a trilogy. There is particular praise for the characterisation of Shaun and his attempts to deal with the loss of a loved one along with the ever-growing crisis. Deadline was nominated for the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Plot Deadline is set several decades after the zombie apocalypse, the Rising. Two man-made viruses (cures for cancer and the common cold) combined to form Kellis-Amberlee, a normally beneficial virus that, on the death of any host mammal over (and sometimes spontaneously, before that mammal's death), \\"goes live\\" or \\"amplifies\\", and turns them into a zombie. Most humans reside in controlled zones, with rigorous blood testing and decontamination used to stop the live KA virus from spreading. Bloggers, in this universe are respected, credentialed journalists (generally divided up as the fact-based \\"Newsies\\", the Steve Irwin-inspired \\"Irwins\\", and the entertaining \\"Fictionals\\") providing news and entertainment. A year after the events of Feed, Shaun Mason is still coming to terms with having had to kill his infected sister, Georgia, and has stepped back from his role as an Irwin to head After the End Times, in an administrative role. After returning to Oakland, California, after a field excursion with Rebecca \\"Becks\\" Atherton (Shaun's replacement as the site's top Irwin), Alaric Kwong (a Newsie), and Dave Novakowski (another Irwin), Shaun receives a visit from Dr. Kelly Connolly, a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) researcher. Kelly had faked her death using a clone after her colleagues, researching the abnormally high death rate among people with \\"reservoir conditions\\" (in whom the active virus is present but confined to one part of the host's body, a condition Georgia had while alive), began dying at a suspiciously high rate: actions possibly linked to the conspiracy uncovered in the previous book. As they discuss this, a sizable zombie outbreak occurs; Dave overrides the lockdown so the others can escape but dies when the site is firebombed. The team flees to Weed, California, where Magdalene \\"Maggie\\" Garcia, billionaire pharmaceutical company heiress and head Fictional at After the End Times, lives. They track down a non-CDC laboratory in Portland, Oregon and head there to learn more about Kelly's findings. A rogue researcher, Dr. Shannon Abbey, reveals that reservoir conditions are an immune response to the virus, and those with the conditions may fight off zombification. Shaun and Becks then head to Portland's CDC office, where they escape a zombie outbreak staged to kill them. The group next returns to Maggie's, and Shaun sends the collected data to Mahir Gowda (a British resident and the website's head Newsie), hoping he can find independent verification. A fortnight later, Mahir arrives unannounced with news that all Kellis-Amberlee substrains were lab-engineered, and people with reservoir conditions are being killed off before each new substrain appears. Armed with this information, Shaun leads Kelly, Becks, and Mahir to the CDC office in Memphis, Tennessee, to break in and confront Kelly's boss, Joseph Wynne. Dr. Wynne reveals he organised the Oakland outbreak to kill Kelly and the bloggers; he is part of a widespread conspiracy to keep people afraid and compliant while the zombie virus is stabilised. In the following struggle, Dr. Wynne is killed, and Kelly is infected with the live virus. She sacrifices herself to distract security while the others escape. The team heads back to California, driving through a hurricane and finding most of the country deserted. On reaching Maggie's, Shaun and company learn that most of the country has been locked down following massive outbreaks along the Gulf Coast: a Second Rising. Shaun figures out that the cause is not an airborne strain of live virus as most fear, but it is now being transmitted by mosquitoes. He confirms this with Dr. Abbey and receives an offer to join her in Shady Cove, Oregon. Shaun and Mahir organise the rest of the site's staff to propagate what they have learned, before those at Maggie's evacuate. Shortly before reaching Shady Cove, Shaun is attacked and bitten, and is quarantined in Abbey's lab. Despite several tests, he shows no sign of becoming a zombie. The novel's coda reveals that despite her apparent death, Georgia is somehow alive and well in an unknown CDC facility. Background and themes Without the framing device of a United States presidential election to use as in Feed (waiting for the next election would have left too much time for the characters' emotional wounds to heal), McGuire chose to focus more on the zombie virus itself: how a lab-engineered virus developed and evolved, and how humans were responding to it, on both societal and biological levels. McGuire also wanted to address the long-term impact of a zombie apocalypse on society and the associated psychological ramifications. Other themes covered in the novel include medical ethics and human responsibility. Deadline was published in May 2011. The novel was originally to be titled Blackout, but this was changed shortly before publishing to avoid confusion with Connie Willis' novel Blackout (2010), published a year earlier. Grant instead used Blackout as the title for the third Newsflesh novel. Reception In reviewing the novel for SFFWorld, Rob Bedford described the book as avoiding the pitfalls normally associated with the middle work in a trilogy and praised McGuire's strong pacing despite the novel's length. Bedford also compliments the author's treatment of the subject of medical ethics (particularly in extreme situations) as well handled and thought- provoking. Selena MacIntosh of Persephone Magazine noted several improvements over Feed, particularly tighter plotting and storytelling, along with deeper characters. However, as MacIntosh was less impressed overall with the first novel, she passes some of the credit for Deadlines success to a new editor McGuire notes was previously uninvolved. In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Brian Fitzpatrick wrote McGuire takes the \\"political intrigue of Feed and ratchets it up to 11\\" and highly praised the novel's conclusion. He also states that the use of zombies as the means of a hidden agenda make the work scarier than the straightforward \\"humans versus zombies\\" scenario in other zombie fiction. The use of the deceased Georgia as an advisory voice in the slightly unhinged Shaun's head was praised by reviewers: Bedford called it a \\"great tool to use for internal dialogue\\" and congratulated McGuire for her ability to set different tones for the two characters, while MacIntosh and Fitzpatrick identified it as a plausible and understandable reaction to the loss of a loved one.

Funded through crowdfunding website Kickstarter in 2012, the game launched in September 2013 in early access, and was fully released in August 2017.  Gameplay  In Castle Story, the player is in control of workers called \\"Bricktrons\\" which can be directed to gather resources, build castles and fight enemies. The aim is to build a castle that can withstand attacks from creatures and other players. The game takes place on massive floating islands.  Development  Castle Story was the debut game developed by Sauropod Studio, an indie game developer based in Montreal, Canada. The game was first announced in December 2011; around this time, Sauropod was a team of two people. Sauropod Studio was formally founded as a company on 24 April 2012 by Fran√ßois Alain (general director), Germain Couet (artistic director), and Beno√Æt Alain (lead programmer and chief technical officer). A crowdfunding campaign was launched through the website Kickstarter on 27 July 2012, seeking . This goal was reached and exceeded within five hours of the campaign's launch. The campaign concluded after one month, with a total of pledged. Sauropod credited Markus Persson, the creator of the game Minecraft who publicly approved of the game, with leading the Kickstarter campaign to the success it had. Beta versions of the game were later shared with backers who had pledged or more. Castle Story was made publicly available as a paid early access game through the digital distribution platform Steam on 23 September 2013. The game was fully released on 17 August 2017 for Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows, with Sauropod shifting to bugfixes and developing post- launch content. Following onto the release of Castle Story, Sauropod began production on a second game, Mirador. This game had a troubled development, frequently shuffling the designer position. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign seeking did not manage to get funded halfway and Sauropod failed to find a publisher to finance the game. Instead, the Canadian Media Fund invested . As Mirador drew closer to release, it came to the studio's employees that the money the studio had would not suffice to keep it running until the end of 2019. The game was eventually released on 26 July 2019 without prior early access availability. The idea of using early access was considered but ultimately rejected as the studio did not plan to support the game greatly post-launch. Sauropod's management assured its employees that the majority would move on to the studio's next project. However, on 23 September 2019, it was reported that, due to the forewent money mismanagement, Sauropod had laid off all of its 20 employees. Fran√ßois Alain and Couet stated in October 2019 that stated that Sauropod was still active, despite having laid off all staff.

ACARM-ng is an alert correlation software which can significantly facilitate analyses of traffic in computer networks. It is responsible for collection and correlation of alerts sent by network and host sensors, also referred to as NIDS and HIDS respectively. Correlation process aims to reduce the total number of messages that need to be viewed by a system administrator to as few as possible by merging similar events into groups representing logical pieces of malicious activity.  History  The initial version of ACARM was being developed in the frame of POSITIF European research project between 2004 and 2007. It has been written in Java as a practical proof of concept, presented in the article. Despite its poor scalability and efficiency issues, the software proved to be highly useful. At the end of 2009 it became obvious that the current design had serious shortcomings with poor performance in the first place. As a result of that the project was discontinued. Later that year, a new project nicknamed ACARM-ng was launched aiming to replace the original ACARM. ACARM-ng was to bring the alert correlation to a new dimension thank to its scalability and plug-in- based architecture. It has been actively developed since 2009 by Wroclaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing as a part of the PL-Grid project.  Features  ACARM-ng's main features include: * generic framework (system can be easily extended with plug-ins) * multi-threaded implementation * low CPU utilisation and memory footprint * implementation using state-of-art, object oriented design methods * recurrent alerts processing * real-time informing and reaction * web-based data visualisation * long correlation time windows, that do not delay reporting  Architecture  ACARM-ng consists of 3 main elements: correlation daemon, WUI and (optional) a database engine. ACARM-ng's daemon has been designed from scratch as a framework solution. It provides core system functionalities, like logging, alerts and correlated meta-alerts passing between system parts, error recovery, multi-threading, etc.. The rest of the package are plug-ins, separated into following classes: * persistency (data abstraction) * input (data gathering) * filter (data correlation and modification) * trigger (automatic reporting and reaction) Built-in software watchdog provides up-to-date information on system status. Internal architecture of ACARM-ng showing bundled plug-ins. WUI makes browsing of correlated data easy via graphical and tabular representation of gathered and correlated events. System administrator can easily see what is going on at every moment of system's lifetime. Alert time series plot showing the number of incoming messages during given time period. The alert's page showing a sample alert. The WUI and the daemon interoperate through a database. Daemon stores gathered data along with the correlation results and its runtime configuration. WUI is entitled to read and display this data. Notice that even though data base engine is not required for running daemon, it is strongly recommended to save data persistently. Rejecting to use database makes it impossible to obtain system information via WUI and leads to a loss of historical data when system is restarted. Events that are no longer processed by the daemon are discarded as well.  Preprocessor  It is often required to limit the amount of incoming data (for example: remove alerts raised periodically by cron scripts). In order to allow users to adapt system's input to their own needs a special \\"preprocessor\\" component is provided. It allows to define a chain of accept-if-match and reject-if-match rules to accept or reject incoming alerts before they enter the correlation engine.  Plugins  ACARM-ng's daemon allows addition and removal of new plug-ins without the need to recompile the core package. It makes system development and testing much easier. Each plug-in to be used, has to be configured in the main configuration file first.  Persistency  Persistency provides abstraction at the storage level. This generic interface can be used to implement any data-saving back-end, as long as transaction mechanism is provided. Recent, stable release of ACARM-ng provides following persistency implementations: * stubs (ignores all write requests - data is not saved) * postgres (uses PostgreSQL data base for storing information)  Input  An input provides an abstraction of a data gathering mechanism. The only requirement on the implementation is to output alerts in an ACARM-ng-compatible form. Recent, stable release of ACARM-ng provides following input implementations: * file (reads XML files in IDMEF format) * prelude (read alerts from Prelude-Manager data gathering point)  Filter  A filter provides an abstraction of the correlation and data update mechanism. There are no restrictions on what the filter can do with the meta-alert, though the most common use is to correlate similar alerts (specially tuned API is provided for this special case). Recent, stable release of ACARM-ng provides following filter implementations: * one to one (correlates events between a pair of hosts) * one to many (correlates events, where the source host is the same for all alerts) * many to one (correlates events, where the destination host is the same for all alerts) * many to many (correlates events, where a set of source and destination hosts of correlated alerts are similar) * DNS resolver (resolves IP addresses to DNS names, if possible) * IP black list (changes the priority of alerts with source/destination addresses belonging to suspicious networks) * same name (correlates events with the same name) * event chain (correlates events that happened in a chronological order, on next-in-line machines; such a solution is rare and may indicate \\"scan, brake-in, escalation\\" sequence) * users monitor (correlates events triggered by actions of one user) * similarity (correlates events similar to each other, above a given threshold; all data is taken into consideration during comparison of two elements) * new event (changes priority of events, that were not previously seen on the system) * python (uses user-provided Python script for event correlation)  Trigger  A trigger provides an abstraction of the reporting and reaction mechanism. Triggers by design, are not allowed to change the content of the data, but initiate a response to alerts. Typical use is real-time reporting of suspicious events to administrators (for example via e-mail) and automatic reaction to the detected thread (for example blocking malicious host on a firewall). Recent, stable release of ACARM-ng provides following trigger implementations: * informing administrator about suspicious events: ** file (creates files in IDMEF format, with correlated events) ** gg (uses Gadu-Gadu instant messenger's protocol) ** jabber (uses XMPP (formerly named Jabber) instant messenger's protocol) ** mail (sends electronic mail) * providing means of automatic reaction: ** extapp (executes external application/script, passing all correlated events as a parameter) ** python (uses user-provided Python script for event correlation) ** snort sam (reconfigures many types of firewalls using Snort's Snort Sam plug-in) Each trigger can be set independently to react to a specific threshold, correlated alerts count, or any other rule, defined the same way as daemon's main preprocessor. Such approach gives a fully configurable solution, allowing to define arbitrary complex rules, to minimize false-positives, especially when system is configured to perform autonomous reaction on the suspicious events.

The group occupied Stapleton House after receiving the keys to the building on 25 December 2011. The camp was dismantled on 13 March 2012. Timeline The protest at its original location had been going on for months, with a camp at the junction of the Grand Parade and South Mall in the city centre since summer 2011. On 15 October 2011, simultaneous protests took place in Cork and Galway regarded by local and national media as having mimicked Occupy Wall Street (New York) and Occupy Dame Street (Dublin). The protestors organised a number of demonstrations, including a 'teach-in' in AIB's branch on the South Mall; where a local schoolteacher held a maths class with primary school children in the front lobby of the bank, before the arrival of the police precipitated a 'recess'. On the evening of 3 January 2012, it was announced that a vacant six-storey NAMA-listed building on Oliver Plunkett Street had been taken over after it was gifted to the people of Cork. An anonymous donor reportedly left the keys to the building under the Christmas tree on Grand Parade on 25 December. The Garda S√≠och√°na (police) visited the occupied building, and then left again soon afterwards. The building, unused since a part-demolition and refurbishment undertaken in 2008, had been cleaned by its occupiers. The occupiers released an online video chronicling their takeover of the building. On 8 January 2012, there was a c√©il√≠ m√≥r (a \\"big\\" c√©il√≠) in the afternoon to raise funds. The Cork City Community Resource Centre intended to open in the occupied building on Monday 23 January 2012, after an open day. The facility was expected to include classrooms, a music school, health facilities, a library, a bookshop, a caf√©, a cr√®che, and a number of free initiatives for the public, including internet access, advisory and counselling services. The camp was dismantled on 13 March 2012. Responses Fine Gael politician Des Cahill described the protest as \\"attention seeking\\". Former Green Party senator and party chairman Dan Boyle described the manoeuver of 3 January as an \\"interesting development\\" and suggested that it was a legal and \\"legitimate protest\\".

For decades, various commercial uses were discussed for above and next to this central-Zurich site owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB/CFF/FFC). History The previous developments under the name HB-S√ºdwest changed to the Eurogate projects with the entrance of a new investor in October 1996 - the major Swiss bank, UBS (UBS Fund Management AG, Basel). Also at this time, the corporation HB- S√ºdwest, which had been founded in March 1995 with the task of working through the overall project for HB-S√ºdwest and the residential development for the Lagerstrasse in Zurich until start of construction, was renamed as Eurogate Z√ºrich AG. With this change, the tasks were expanded to include the developing the entire project until completion. Eurogate/HB-S√ºdwest includes two major projects in Zurich: * Development along Railway Tracks, Eurogate Zurich (Cost ca. 1.5billion Swiss Francs, planned since 1980) * Residential Development along Lagerstrasse (Study 2000, 350 der 500 Wohnungen sowie B√ºro-, Gewerbe-, Freizeitfl√§chen und Ersatzfl√§chen f√ºr SBB-Anlagen) The competition for the urban planning was won by the Zurich architectural office Ralph B√§nziger Architekten. In the 1970s, Luigi Snozzi and Mario Botta had participated in the original competition with a design for a slender bridge-construction over the tracks, but their project was not further developed. Ralph B√§nziger proposed a massive construction along the tracks. The work on both designs and the many changes to the project lasted from 1980 until 2001.

Because of increasing talk among the local population, the communist authorities first tried to block the connection between the Big Brezar Shaft and the spring with a concrete barrier.

In June 2011, the network was described by The New York Times as beginning to \\"emerge as a pivotal force\\" in Syria. , the network supported civil disobedience and opposed local armed resistance and international military intervention as methods of opposing the Syrian government. Creation The Local Coordination Committees of Syria started in March 2011 from local groups that published reports about protests during the Syrian uprising and developed into a national network involved in journalism about protests and the protests themselves. The groups had developed from informal networks of friends and colleagues involved in dissidence that had existed for many years. Prior to the uprising, Syrian activists had brought in mobile telephones, satellite modems and computers in anticipation of Arab Spring protests developing in Syria. In June 2011, The New York Times described the network as beginning to \\"emerge as a pivotal force\\" in Syrian politics, \\"earning the respect of more recognized, but long divided dissidents.\\" Structure The LCCSyria network consists of \\"overwhelmingly young\\" demonstrators of multiple religious and class backgrounds. The network is decentralized and works in secret. The first of the committees was created in the Daraya suburb of Damascus. , the most active committee was in Homs. , the network had 35 individual leaders, who tried to communicate daily. , the network had 14 local committees, one each in Daraa, Homs, Baniyas, Saraqeb, Idlib, al-Hasakah, Qamishli, Deir ez-Zor, the Syrian coast, Hama, Raqqa, as- Suwayda', Damascus and the Damascus suburbs.

Furthermore, the Office for Syrian Opposition Support, which itself was founded by the United States Department of State and Foreign and Commonwealth Office and is funded by the Friends of Syria Group, provides \\"material support\\" and \\"training assistance\\" to the LCCs. Human rights journalism Rami Nakhle, who helps LCCSyria from exile in Lebanon, said that media activities documenting protests were the network's first main activity. The Syrian human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouneh, winner of the 2011 Sakharov Prize and the 2011 Anna Politkovskaya Award, has documented human rights in Syria for the network. The network's text and photographic reports of injuries and deaths of protestors have been used by CNN, Al Jazeera English, The Guardian and The Washington Post. The network publishes reports on its own website and on Facebook. On 1 February 2012, LCCSyria criticised the international and Arab community as having been \\"unable to take any decision that contributes to stopping the cycle of violence in Syria\\". It estimated the number of deaths in the civil war is more than 100,000. Protest methods Amnesty International describes the network's methods as peaceful protests. Civil disobedience methods used by the network include nightly protests in Hama and refusal to pay water, electricity and telephone bills in the Duma suburb of Damascus. The network called for a two-day general strike on 5‚Äì6 February 2012. They also called with other non- violence groups to the Dignity Strike in Syria \\"Karamah Strike\\". Non- violence In August 2011, LCCSyria declared that it understands the calls for internal armed opposition to the Syrian government and international military intervention, but opposes both. It said that militarisation would reduce popular support for the opposition, reduce the opposition's moral superiority, and put \\"the Revolution in an arena where the regime has a distinct advantage\\".

Although Mattel designed and produced video game cartridges for their own system, the company surprised the industry by also releasing simplified versions of its games for the 2600 under the M Network label. M Network produced home ports of popular arcade games, including BurgerTime, Bump 'n' Jump and Lock 'n' Chase (all 1982) as well as original titles such as Tron: Deadly Discs (1982 ‚Äì based on the Disney movie) and Kool-Aid Man (1983), one of the earliest \\"promogames\\", originally available only via mail order by sending in UPC symbols from Kool-Aid containers. Mattel programmers (named by TV Guide as the \\"Blue Sky Rangers\\") were also encouraged to develop video game tie-ins with other Mattel properties; games such as Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man (1983), leveraging Mattel's Masters of the Universe media franchise, were released. M Network cartridges made for the 2600 were physically similar to Intellivision cartridges, but with a base designed to fit the 2600's larger cartridge slot. Most of the names were changed for the 2600 version; Astrosmash was, for example, renamed Astroblast. Although Mattel, through M Network, released cartridges for Atari consoles, they balked at allowing Atari to release cartridges for the Intellivision: in the early 1980s the company filed a lawsuit against Atari alleging that Atari had stolen Mattel's trade secrets when it hired former Mattel employees to develop a line of Intellivision-compatible cartridges.

Plot On an invitation by Mahitosh Singha Ray, Lalmohon Babu takes Feluda and Topshe to a forest near Bhutan and stays at the ancestral home of Mahitosh Singha Ray. After few days of their arrival,Mahitosh Singha Ray's assistant, Tarit dies. His deadbody is found in the forest, and police believes he has died due to a tiger attack. But later they found a blood-stained sword near his body. Meanwhile, Mahitosh gives Feluda a riddle to solve. Feluda's amazing intelligence is proved in this part. He solves it most amazingly, and at the end, chalks out that a treasure chest is hidden 55 hands away from a tree which has a hole between it, which looks like an old person's mouth without any teeth; between two Arjuna trees. While Feluda and his companion are on the way to the treasure chest, they find Tarit's spectacles and later on, his torch, which suggests that Tarit has solved the puzzle much earlier than the others, and was on his way to the treasure chest. At last, Feluda finds the treasure chest, and holds out the conclusion. Mahitosh had broke his hand due to a fall from a tree, which Feluda came to know when he was unable to hold the rifle. All the precious huntings of the tiger were done by his friend, Shashanka. On that night, while Tarit was about to leave, Shashanka too followed him quietly. On seeing a tiger feeding on Tarit's corpse, Shashanka fired his rifle, which injured the tiger's nose after Feluda found a bit of skin. Tarit's sword, as he observed, has begun acting like a magnet, which was started by a bolt of lightning striking it, which kills Tarit in the process. Thus, Tarit wasn't murdered by any villain, but only, nature was the cause of his death. Hence, Feluda is rewarded with a part of the treasure.

Description The Azov percarina is distinguished from the closely related common percarina, Percarina demidoffii, by its unique characteristics of having scaled cheeks, pigmented body back and grey flanks with numerous small dark dots, which may be fused into larger spots along base of the dorsal fins. Distribution The Azov percarina is found in the eastern and northeastern parts of the Sea of Azov, in the Gulf of Taganrog and Temryuk Bay, Bolshoi Akhtanizovski Liman, Kuban River delta, rare in Don River delta. Habitat and biology The Azov percarina is foun in coastal fresh and brackish waters, the maximum salinity they are found in is 7 ppt, and in river mouths. It is a social species which is found in shoals. Smaller fish, with a standard length of feed actively on zooplankton, especially small crustaceans, Once they attain a standard length of they switch to feeding on larger crustaceans such as copepods and mysids. From their second year they are largely piscivorous feeding on Knipowitschia longecaudata and Clupeonella cultriventis as well as benthic worms, molluscs and insect larvae. They reach sexual maturity at a year old. They are known to spawn in the least saline part of the Gulf of Taganrog during June and July. Immediately following spawning the adults migrate to the open sea. The eggs are released over mud bottom and hatch in 2 days, after which the larvae lie on bottom, moving to the surface after 4 days. Taxonomy The Azov percarina was first formally described in 1888 by I.D. Kuznetsov with the type locality given as the northeastern Sea of Azov. It is some times treated as a subspecies of the common percarina (Percarinde demidoffi) but morphological and habitat differences support its treatment as a valid species. The common percarina has been recorded from the Ukraine, Moldova and Romania.

The case concerned a contract to build a portion of a national road, into which contract an exceptional number of variations was introduced. The result was disruption. Because the contract had not lapsed, the court determined that there was no new agreement in terms of which the contractor was entitled to reasonable remuneration instead of the contract price, and there was no implied term stipulating that the owner must introduce the variations \\"at reasonable times.\\"  Facts  Alfred McAlpine & Son was the plaintiff, and the Transvaal Provincial Administration (TPA) the defendant, in the court a quo. The parties had entered into a contract in terms whereof the plaintiff had undertaken to build a portion of a national road. Certain declaratory orders were applied for on the plaintiff's behalf. During the execution of the contract, the contractor had received instructions to introduce an exceptionally large number of alterations which in certain cases had caused disruption. On McAlpine's behalf, it was alleged that, although each alteration had fallen within the scope of the contract, the cumulative effect of all the alterations was of such a nature that the original contract had lapsed and a new contract arisen impliedly through the conduct of the parties. In terms of this new contract, the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable remuneration for all the work it had done: that is, from the commencement of the execution of the contract.  Tacit terms  As Corbett AJA notes in his judgment, \\"In legal parlance the expression 'implied term' is an ambiguous one in that it is often used, without discrimination, to denote two, possibly three, distinct concepts.\\"531D. Terms may be implied, in other words, # by operation of law (ex lege); # by custom or trade usage; and # from the facts surrounding the agreement of the parties (ex consensu). The present case was concerned with whether or not that last concept should be invoked. Under South African law, a contract to do specified work for an agreed price may from its very beginning be so altered by the owner, and carried out as such by the contractor, that it may be said that for the original contract there was tacitly substituted a new agreement, in terms of which the contractor is entitled to reasonable remuneration for the work. Whether this has in fact occurred will depend on the facts. Similarly, during the execution of a contract to do work for an agreed price, the contractor may receive, and also accept, instructions to do work which cannot really be regarded as part of the original contract. The contractor is entitled to reasonable remuneration for that work on the ground of a separate tacit agreement. This will also depend on the facts.  Judgment  The court a quo had held that the variations had been envisaged in the original contract. In an appeal, the Appellate Division found that, as the plaintiff right up to the completion of the contract had still relied on the original contract, it could not possibly be said that the original contract in its entirety had been regarded by the parties as having lapsed and that a new contract had been entered into. There was, furthermore, a lack of evidence that what the plaintiff had built was not substantially the road which the contract envisaged. As to an alternative claim for an order declaring that a certain implied term had to be assumed, in terms whereof the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for the disruption which had occurred because the engineer had not introduced his variations \\"at reasonable times,\\" the court held that \\"at a reasonable time\\" was not the same as \\"within a reasonable time.\\" Such claim, the court found (Jansen JA and Corbett AJA dissenting), had rightly been rejected by the court a quo. The decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division, in Alfred McAlpine & Son (Pty.) Ltd. v Transvaal Provincial Administration,1973 (4) SA 495 (T). was thus confirmed. In the absence of a properly defined wording of an implied term which, notwithstanding the express provisions of the contract, had to be acknowledged, the court determined that it was not at that stage its duty to work out what wording such a term must have in order to satisfy the plaintiff as well as to comply with the stated requirements before the term could be acknowledged.

The story opens with the arrival of Sivaraman (Prabhu) in Chennai to dispute the denial of his company job, which he was supposed to receive several years ago. Several candidates have passed him by, with the last one being Rani, who pretends to be an influential figure in the town. She threatens Sivaraman to allow her to continue working despite his efforts to overthrow her. The company manager Venniradai Moorthy, who knows her family situation (poor and pathetic) helps her to keep the job. Sivaraman is determined to stay back in the town until he succeeds in getting his job back from Rani. During his stay, Sivaraman finds a temporary lodging in Urvasai Theatre, owned by Nambi Annan (V. K. Ramasamy), with another tenant Masha (Revathi), both of whom are unemployed and have insignificant earnings. Initially, Masha does not like the new tenant and tries to expel him from the house, but all her efforts are in vain, despite her trickery and cunning. Masha has been lying to her mother that she works in a large company based in Calcutta and that she is building them a new house in Cochin. Sivaraman finds out about this and labels Masha a fraud. But when he learns about her family situation, he sympathises and decides to sacrifice his claim on the job. That night, Sivaraman gets drunk and reveals Masha's fraud to Nambi. Masha confesses, but justifies that projecting herself as rich and employed was the only way to comfort her mother. The truth softens the hearts of both Sivaraman and Nambi and the trio decide to become friends and have fun in spite of their unending problems. This is the turning point of the movie. Sivaraman wakes up at night when he hears the phone ring. A gang leader called Pakki Ram (Vijayaraghavan) and Charan Singh (Dhritiman Chatterjee) have kidnapped the daughter of a rich businessman Sakthinathan (Jaiganesh) and are demanding a ransom of Rs. 100,000. The panicked trio realise they have no idea who Sakthinathan is. Sivaraman tries to locate Sakthinathan's number from the telephone directory, only to realise that the phone numbers of the theatre and Sakthinathan have been mistakenly transposed. Sivaraman does some quick thinking and comes up with a plan. She suggests that they act as the broker between Pakki Ram and Sakthinathan, demand a ransom of Rs. 300,000 from Sakthinathan, return his daughter to him, and earn a profit of Rs. 200,000. Fed up with their poverty, the other two agree and the plan is set into motion, but the job isn't easy to carry out while hiding from the police and keeping Pakki Ram and Sakthinathan away from each other. Finally, after a struggle, the three rescue the girl from the gang leader and hand her over to Sakthinathan. They however are forced to confess the whole game when they encounter the police. Sakthinathan tries to shoot Sivaraman, but he escapes and promises Rani that he is ready with money for her brother's eye operation and tells her to reach Sakthi Nadaga Saba by morning. Nambi and Sivaraman reach Saba earlier and find out Masha is missing, so they both call police and tell they three are involved and with much sadness, he says he loves Masha, after few minutes, Masha arrives there and rejoices for money. Nambi asks why she is late, Masha says she settled the amount, but later Masha comes to know they said to police feels what happened with fear through heart surrounds her and Masha tells she love Sivaraman, police arrive at Saba, however, Sakthinathan forgives them for having safely rescued his daughter, and instead gives them the money as a prize.

It is found in the western Pacific, in an area that ranges from northern Japan to the East China Sea, to Korea. Other common names for the fish include \\"Kawahagi\\" \\"„Ç´„ÉØ„Éè„ÇÆ\\" \\"ÁöÆÂâ•\\" (Japanese) and \\"Jwi-chi\\" (Korean). The fish grows to a maximum length of about , and consumes both plant material and small marine organisms like skeleton shrimp. S. cirrhifer is host of the parasite Peniculus minuticaudae. Some minor genetic differentiation between S. cirrhifer born in the wild and those bred in a hatchery for consumer use has been shown. The fish is edible and sold commercially for culinary purposes in many Asian countries. Taxonomy The fish was first described in 1850 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel, when it was observed along with other fauna off the coasts of Japan. They initially placed it in the genus Monacanthus, as Monacanthus cirrhifer; however, it was transferred to the genus Stephanolepis by David Starr Jordan and Henry Weed Fowler in 1903. The species name derives from the Latin word cirrhifer, which means \\"bearing fringes of hair\\". Other common names: *Japanese - Kawahagi *Korean - Jwi-chi *English - File fish, Fool fish, Porky *Russian - Small striped triggerfish (–°–ø–∏–Ω–æ—Ä–æ–≥ –º–∞–ª—ã–π –ø–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞—Ç—ã–π) Description and habitat Thread-sail filefish grow to a maximum adult length of about . The first dorsal fin is a strong retractable (folding backwards) spine. The second dorsal fin and anal fin are soft. They have comparatively small pectoral fins and truncated, fan-shaped tail fins. The dorsal and anal fins are colorless. Their second dorsal, anal and caudal fins rounded. In males, 1-3 soft dorsal fin rays extended as filaments; the first ray has a particularly long thread. The fish have a small abdominal spike. The fish are colored from light brown, to grayish- to light greenish-beige, and are slightly patterned with irregular, broken stripes that range from medium brown to blackish. Juveniles of the species usually seek shelter and safety from predators within clusters of drifting seaweed. The adult thread-sail filefish usually reside near the seabed, where the depth is around . The fish migrate wholly in ocean waters (\\"oceanodromous\\") between their feeding and spawning grounds, which can cover a range of over . The spawning season lasts from May to August. Juveniles under inhabit shallow water and feed on small crustaceans, mollusks and algae. Adult fish are mostly solitary and live among the coral and seaweeds. Ecology The thread-sail filefish is an omnivore, and can feed on plant or animal matter. Its diet includes kelp, but consists mainly of amphipods such as gammarids and skeleton shrimp, as well as the seagrass species Zostera marina. The fish also feeds upon smaller organisms, including bryozoans and some species of serpulid tube worms. Thread-sail filefish feed on fish, amphipods, isopods, cirripeds, polychaetes, pelecypods, seaweeds such as those of the genus Sargassum; and gelatinous plankton, such as the moon jellyfish Aurelia sp. and the giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai. S. cirrhifer is host of the pennellid copepod parasite Peniculus minuticaudae, which mostly infects the fins of the female fish. Prepared as sushi Uses The thread-sail filefish is cultured and sold commercially as food in Asian countries, including Korea and Japan. The demand for the fish in Korea is very high, and fisheries often employ the services of fish hatcheries for breeding more of the fish to supplement and enhance the supply of stock. This has been done to such a degree that some . As many as 95 alleles have been found to be unique to one of the populations, resulting from minor variations in certain genes that occur exclusively within either population; genetic differentiation between S. cirrhifer born in the wild and those bred in a hatchery has apparently occurred.

A butler, Liu Kunshan (Wu Gang), uses magic to scare convicts into joining the army of warlord Lei Bully (Lau Ching-wan). Lei Bully has six wives and also imprisons a girl, Liu Yin (Zhou Xun), and wants her to be his seventh wife willingly. A group of local revolutionaries want to kidnap Lei and bring back the republic. They team up with a magician, Chang Hsien (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), to entice Lei to a magic show and kidnap him during the show. It is revealed that Zhang and Liu Yin had been ex-lovers and Zhang is an apprentice of Liu's father, a magician, Liu Wanyao. Chang discovers that his former master was imprisoned by Liu Kunshan as he had wanted to extract a magic secret from Liu Wanyao. The two ex-lovers meet during Chang's magic show. Chang wants to run away with Liu Yin but she refuses to leave Lei to ensure her father's safety so that he will not be killed. Lei and Chang become close friends. Despite knowing one another's background, they pretend not to know. Chang discovers that his master was tortured by Liu Kun Shan and that he had a secret to hide and informs Lei. Lei asks Chang to investigate Liu Kunshan and subsequently discovers that Liu Kunshan is a member of the Qing Dynasty remnants and wants to bring back the Dynasty by collaborating with the Japanese. Lei discovers that Butler Liu Kunshan had an affair with his third wife and demands that they both leave. With his cover blown, Liu Kunshan and the Japanese launch an attack on Lei and his fellow warlords but Chang and Lei plan an elaborate scheme to hide that Lei and Liu Yin are dead. With the rest of the Qing Dynasty remnants, Liu Kunshan tries to raise an army by magic via Chang. However, the scheme is revealed and the Qing Dynasty remnants are killed or arrested. Lei subsequently disbands his army and gives away his riches to pursue being a weapons researcher and also pursue Liu Yin.

It is also known as an orthogonal tetrahedron since orthogonal means perpendicular. It was first studied by Simon Lhuilier in 1782, and got the name orthocentric tetrahedron by G. de Longchamps in 1890.. In an orthocentric tetrahedron the four altitudes are concurrent. This common point is called the orthocenter, and it has the property that it is the symmetric point of the center of the circumscribed sphere with respect to the centroid. Hence the orthocenter coincides with the Monge point of the tetrahedron. Characterizations All tetrahedra can be inscribed in a parallelepiped. A tetrahedron is orthocentric if and only if its circumscribed parallelepiped is a rhombohedron. Indeed, in any tetrahedron, a pair of opposite edges is perpendicular if and only if the corresponding faces of the circumscribed parallelepiped are rhombi. If four faces of a parallelepiped are rhombi, then all edges have equal lengths and all six faces are rhombi; it follows that if two pairs of opposite edges in a tetrahedron are perpendicular, then so is the third pair, and the tetrahedron is orthocentric. A tetrahedron ABCD is orthocentric if and only if the sum of the squares of opposite edges is the same for the three pairs of opposite edges:Reiman, Istv√°n, \\"International Mathematical Olympiad: 1976-1990\\", Anthem Press, 2005, pp. 175-176. :\\\\displaystyle AB^2+CD^2 = AC^2+BD^2 = AD^2+BC^2. In fact, it is enough for only two pairs of opposite edges to satisfy this condition for the tetrahedron to be orthocentric. Another necessary and sufficient condition for a tetrahedron to be orthocentric is that its three bimedians have equal length.Hazewinkel, Michiel, \\"Encyclopaedia of mathematics: Supplement, Volym 3\\", Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997, p. 468. Volume The characterization regarding the edges implies that if only four of the six edges of an orthocentric tetrahedron are known, the remaining two can be calculated as long as they are not opposite to each other. Therefore the volume of an orthocentric tetrahedron can be expressed in terms of four edges a, b, c, d. The formula isAndreescu, Titu and Gelca, Razvan, \\"Mathematical Olympiad Challenges\\", Birkh√§user, second edition, 2009, pp. 30-31, 159. :V=\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\sqrt{4(c^2+d^2)s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)-a^2b^2c^2} where c and d are opposite edges, and s=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(a+b+c).

It belongs to the genus Arius of the subfamily Ariinae, family Ariidae (ariid or fork-tailed catfishes). It should not be confused with the closely related Cephalocassis manillensis, also described by Valenciennes in 1840. Other common names of the species include kandule, dupit, kiti-kiti, tabangongo, and tauti. Description Arius manillensis reach a maximum length of (in males). Distribution and habitat Arius manillensis is endemic to the island of Luzon, Philippines. It is found in the area around Manila, Bataan, Laguna, Cavite, and Rizal; including the Pasig River and Laguna de Bay. It inhabits marine, brackish, freshwater, and benthopelagic habitats. Biology Arius manillensis are mouthbrooders. The males of the species incubate the eggs within their mouths for six to eight weeks and provide shelter for the young once they hatch. A single instance of a female carrying eggs in her mouth has also been reported. Upon hatching, the young forage for plankton in short bursts but will quickly return to the safety of the mouth of the adult if alarmed. They eventually become independent once they reach a size of .

Life Alfred Gatley was born at Kerridge, about two miles from Macclesfield in Cheshire, in 1816. As a child he learned the use of a stonemason's tools from his father, who owned and worked two quarries in the Kerridge hills. In 1837, helped by a few friends, he came to London and obtained employment in the studio of Edward Hodges Baily. He also studied in the British Museum, and two years later became a student of the Royal Academy, where he gained silver medals for modelling from the antique, and in 1841 for the first time exhibited a \\"Bust of a Gentleman\\". In 1843 Gatley left Baily and became an assistant to Musgrave Watson. That year he sent a marble bust of \\"Hebe\\" to the Royal Academy, which was purchased by the Art Union of London and reproduced in bronze. In 1844 he received the silver medal for the best model from the life, and exhibited marble busts of \\"Cupid\\" and \\"Psyche\\", and in 1846 he exhibited a bust of Marshal Espartero, and a model in bas-relief of \\"The Hours leading out the Horses of the Sun\\", which went to the library of Britwell Court, Buckinghamshire. Also in 1846, his Memorial to John Whitaker was installed in Macclesfield. In 1848 he sent to the Royal Academy a bust of John Sumner, archbishop of Canterbury, and in 1850 that of Samuel Christie-Miller, who became his close friend. About 1851 he executed a bust of Richard Hooker, now in the Temple Church. Final resting place of William Henry Miller, designed by David Rhind, with bas relief sculptures by Alfred Gatley, this on the south side depicting \\"The Song of Moses and Miriam\\" cimitero acattolico in Rome Although successful in this and other works, Gatley saw no prospect of earning an adequate income in England, and so went to Rome towards the end of 1852, where he took a studio on the Pincian Hill, and made the acquaintance of John Gibson, whose enthusiasm for Greek art he shared. Before long he completed a bust of \\"Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude\\", and began statues of \\"Echo\\" and \\"Night\\". A head in marble, \\"The Angel of Mercy\\", and a design for a mural monument were his contributions to the Royal Academy in 1853. Soon after Gatley's settlement in Rome, Samuel Christie-Miller invited him to prepare designs for the sculptural decorations of a mausoleum to be erected to the memory of William Henry Miller at Craigentinny, his estate near Edinburgh. Gatley produced a model of a large bas-relief representing \\"The Overthrow of Pharaoh in the Red Sea\\", which was highly praised by Gibson. Early in 1855 he was entrusted with the companion bas-relief, \\"The Song of Moses and Miriam\\". The Pharaoh bas-relief was finished in time for the 1862 International Exhibition, but the 'Song of Miriam' was completed only just before the sculptor's death. In the judgement of Robert Edmund Graves, Gatley's DNB biographer, \\"The two bas-reliefs are in strong contrast to each other, the idea of rejoicing being as powerfully given in the one work as is that of fear and impending destruction in the other\\". Gatley visited England for the last time in 1862, but returned to Rome depressed by his failure to dispose of the works which he had sent to the International Exhibition, where, besides the bas-relief of \\"Pharaoh\\", he exhibited his statues of \\"Echo\\" and \\"Night\\", as well as four marble statuettes of recumbent animals‚Äîlions, a lioness, and a tiger‚Äîwhich had gained for him in Rome the name of the \\"Landseer of Sculpture\\". He died from dysentery at Rome on 28 June 1863, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery there. Legacy His portrait, painted by a Portuguese artist named Da Costa, used to be in the sculptor's old home at Kerridge. His statue of \\"Echo\\" is in the Salford Museum and Art Gallery, and there also are a marble group of \\"A Boy leading a Bull to Sacrifice\\" (1861),The title given in the DNB. In the ODNB the work is titled \\"A Greek Hero leading a Bull to Sacrifice\\" and busts of Euripides and Paris copied in marble from antiques in the Vatican at Rome.

It was described by Francis Walker in 1863. It is found in Afghanistan, Nepal, north-eastern India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sumba, Sulawesi, the Philippines, Taiwan, China and Japan. Larva Description The wingspan of the male is 18‚Äì22 mm and the female is 34 mm.cycle-of-yellow-stem-borer-scirpophaga-incertulas-wlk Life cycle of Yellow stem borer Scirpophaga incertulas Wlk Adult males are smaller than the females. Males are brownish ochreous. Forewings irrorated (sprinkled) with dark scales and with the veins slightly streaked with fuscous. A black spot found at lower angle of cell. There is an oblique fuscous line runs from apex to vein 2. A marginal black specks series can be seen. Hindwings ochreous white. Female fuscous brown with pale fuscous hindwings. Ecology The larvae feed on Oryza sativa. It is considered as a major rice pest throughout India and Sri Lanka and it devastates harvests annually. They bore the stem of their host plant. Full-grown larvae are pale yellow to yellowish green with a brown head and reach a length of 20 mm. Pupation takes place in a white silk cocoon. Damage After hatching, early instars bore into the leaf sheath and causing longitudinal yellowish-white patches as a result of feeding. Then it invades the stem of the rice plant and stays in the pith to feed on the inner surface of the stem wall. These are not externally visual as symptoms. Severe feeding causes a deep circular cut through the parenchyma tissue showing deadhearts at the vegetative stages and whiteheads at the reproductive stages. Control Due to heavy damage to rice throughout the world, many controlling measures are underway. Chemical, physical, and biological controls and many traditional methods are used to control the pest at any stage of its life cycle. Numerous pest resistant paddy varieties have been genetically modified and introduced in to the fields by the local governments. In biological control, egg parasitism is high and widespread. Species of the three genera Telenomus, Tetrastichus and Trichogramma are greatly effective against eggs, larva and adult moths. Conocephalus longipennis, a bush cricket is known to consume moth eggs. Other than insect parasitoids, fungi, bacteria, viruses and mermithid nematodes are also used for Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

Sensors are often used for analytical measurements, e.g. the measurement of chemical and physical properties of liquids. Typical measured parameters are pH value, conductivity, oxygen, redox potentials, and others. Such measurements are used in the industrialized world and give vital input for process control. Sensors of analogue type were used in the past, but today more and more digital sensors are used. This article describes the difference between them and discusses the reason for the development of digital sensors. General aspects Digital sensors are the modern successors of analog sensors. Digital sensors replace analog sensors stepwise, because they overcome the traditional drawbacks of analog sensor systems (cf chapter 3) History Electronic and electrochemical sensors are typically one part of a measuring chain. A measuring chain comprises the sensor itself, a cable, and a transmitter. In the traditional analog systems, the sensor converts the measuring parameter (e.g. pH value) into an analog electrical signal. This analog electrical signal is connected to a transmitter via a cable. The transmitter transforms the electrical signal into a readable form (display, current outputs, bus data transmission, etc.). The sensor and the cable often are not connected permanently, but through electrical connectors. This classical design with connectors and transmission of small currents through a cable has four main drawbacks: a) Humidity and corrosion of the connector falsify the signal. b) The cable must be shielded and of very high quality to prevent the measuring signal from being altered by electromagnetic noise. c) The sensor can only be calibrated or adjusted when installed, because the influence of the cable (length, ohmic resistance, impedance) cannot be neglected. d) The cable length is limited. Use and design Digital sensors have been developed to overcome the traditional disadvantages of analog sensors. Digital sensors are mainly used in water and industrial processes. They measure parameters such as pH, redox potential, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, SAC, turbidity. A digital sensor system also consists of the sensor itself, a cable, and a transmitter. The differences to analog sensor systems are: a) The sensor has an electronic chip. The measuring signal is directly converted into a digital signal inside the sensor. The data transmission through the cable is also digital. This digital data transmission is not sensitive to cable length, cable resistance or impedance, and is not influenced by electromagnetic noise. Standard cables can be used. b) The connection between sensor and cable can be contactless and done by inductive coupling. Humidity and related corrosion is no longer an issue. Alternative fibre optic cables may also be an option for long or electromagnetically hostile connections. c) The sensor can be calibrated apart from the system.  References  *H.

Following the success of the Leica R3 the company, in continuing cooperation with Minolta, produced the R4-R7 series all based on the same chassis.  R4 / R4s /R4sp  The Leica R4 was made from (1980 - 1986) Based on Minolta XD-7 but with Leica developed exposure metering, mirror box, and newly designed body, the R4 followed the trend setting Olympus OM-1 and was much smaller and lighter than all earlier Leica SLR cameras. Like previous models the R4 offered selective metering and viewfinder information was comprehensive showing metering / exposure mode, shutter and aperture settings, exposure level, and flash ready. The R4S (S stood for Simplified) and the R4SP (SP stood for Simplifed Professional) were simplified versions of the R4. Five exposure / metering modes were available: * Manual exposure / selective metering * Aperture priority semi automatic exposure / selective metering with exposure lock * Aperture priority semi automatic exposure / integrated (centre weighted) metering * Shutter priority semi automatic exposure / integrated (centre weighted) metering * Program automatic exposure / integrated (centre weighted) metering A rotary dial selected the mode, changing between integrated & selective metering was effected by a small lens moving in front of the meter cell which was mounted in the camera base like previous models, but moved forward and angled towards the film plane. This was to allow the same cell to measure both selective and full field for which the secondary mirror was larger than earlier cameras. Selective metering measured from the central focussing area only, a circle about 7mm of the viewfinder image. Offered from 1983 the R4s was a lower cost model with reduced features lacking shutter priority and program modes, however incorporating some improvements to the controls. Automated flash control was not provided but flash ready was indicated in the viewfinder by suitable flash units which also selected flash synchronisation speed 1/100s. The camera was assembled by the Leica factory in Portugal. Early production R4 cameras suffered from electronic failures which marred the reputation of Leica for reliability.  R5 / RE  Introduced in 1987 the R5 offered variable program mode and, more importantly, automatic TTL flash exposure measurement for the first time in a Leica camera along with control improvements of the R4s. Flash metering required a second light receptor in the base and measured full field only off the film itself during exposure. The RE was, like the earlier R4s, a lower cost reduced feature version with final assembly in Solms, Germany. All subsequent R series cameras were assembled in Solms, however the factory in Portugal continued to produce sub assemblies and accessories.  R6 / R6.2  The Leica R6 was made from 1988‚Äì92. It used a mechanical shutter, relied on battery power only for the built-in light meter. The R6 is manual exposure only, with a Leica developed and manufactured mechanical shutter. Aimed at professional photographers and significantly more expensive than the R5, the R6 depended on batteries only for 2 functions: exposure metering and the electronic self-timer, everything else could be used without power. Meter modes were selective and integrated (centre weighted) including TTL flash exposure. Viewfinder backlighting was provided which also illuminated the aperture setting. The R6.2 was made from 1992-97 and offered a higher shutter speed (1/2000s).  R7  Introduced in 1992 the R7 offered complete flash automation. In program mode flash control was fully automatic, selected as necessary by the camera. In any mode flash ready would select flash synchronisation shutter speed. This was the first Leica microprocessor controlled camera, viewfinder display of shutter speed was digital with backlighting. Additional electronics were necessary and the R7 had a deeper base plate to accommodate the extra circuit making the camera taller than the R4/5/6 and necessitating a special taller grip for the winder and motor drive.

Satellite imagery showed a lava flow emitted by Manda Hararo. Local residents reported that no precursors to the eruption had taken place. The first sign was a sudden, heavy, cracking sound, with only a slight tremor. At 17:30, fire was seen coming from Manda Hararo, \\"lighting up the entire area.\\" Locals evacuated while the violent eruptions continued for three days. After the main eruption, lava flows continued and much of the fissure gave off strong fumarolic activity. On August 20, a team of scientists visited the area. 2009 eruption On 29 June another plume was detected from the same area. Imagery showed thermal anomalies coming from Manda Hararo. A team of field scientists reached the site on 4 July and found the eruption had produced basaltic lava flows from fissures long. The fissures were lined by scoria 'ramparts'. The eruption was possibly bigger than the 2007 eruption. By the time the scientists reached the fissure, it only emitted steam.

Early life Kilkenny attended Scoil Oilibh√©ir in Clonsilla. Hurling Kilkenny represented Dublin at underage at several levels. Despite being previously offered a place on the Dublin senior hurling panel, he chose to dedicate his time solely to football. Kilkenny does, however, still play hurling for his club, Castleknock. Football Club Kilkenny won the Dublin Minor Football Championship with Castleknock in 2011. He won the Dublin Junior Football Championship with Castleknock, his last medal before switching codes to Aussie rules.

He made his first start for the Dublin senior football team against Mayo in the 2012 All-Ireland football semi-final defeat. He scored three points in the game. Move to AFL Kilkenny was linked to a possible move to Australia as a rookie in the Australian AFL. Dublin football legend Dessie Farrell described the potential departure of Kilkenny to Australian football as \\"a huge loss\\". confirmed the signing on 29 September 2011, after had also tried to secure the 19-year-old's services. Kilkenny flew to Melbourne to visit Hawthorn officials at Waverley, and was scheduled to become the first Irishman to play at the club. Recent changes to rookie list rules had made the recruitment of Irish players more appealing, with clubs now able to count one Irish player as an international rookie, meaning the player does not take up a main rookie spot. After just four months and a return to Ireland for the Christmas, Kilkenny decided for personal reasons to remain in Ireland where he wished to pursue a career with Castleknock and Dublin. Return to Ireland Upon his return to the native soil, Kilkenny collected both the 2013 NFL title and 2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title with Dublin.

It is a small recurring anion- binding feature of both proteins and peptides. Each consists of the main chain atoms of three consecutive amino acid residues. The main chain NH groups bind the anions while the side chain atoms are often not involved. Proline residues lack NH groups so are rare in nests. About one in 12 of amino acid residues in proteins, on average, belongs to a nest. RL nest bound to an egg oxygen. carbons grey, oxygens red and nitrogens blue. Hydrogen atoms omitted. Hydrogen bonds are grey dotted lines.  Nest conformations  The conformation of a nest is such that the NH groups of the first and third amino acid residues are liable to be hydrogen bonded to a negatively charged, or partially negatively charged, atom, often an oxygen atom. The NH of the second residue may also be hydrogen bonded to the same atom but usually points somewhat away. These main chain atoms form a concavity called a nest into which an anionic atom fits. Such anionic atoms are sometimes called eggs and more than one egg may occur bound to a nest. The oxyanion hole of the intestinal serine proteases is a functional example of a nest. Another occurs at the bottom of a deep cavity in the antibiotic peptide vancomycin which binds a key carboxylate group utilized during the final stages of bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby preventing bacterial cells from multiplying. Nests are defined by the conformation of the main chain atoms, namely the phi, psi dihedral angles of the first two amino acids in the nest. For a typical (RL) nest phii=-90¬∞; psii=0¬∞; phii+1=80¬∞; psii+1=20¬∞. Nests vary in their degree of concavity. A few have so little that the concavity is lost; these peptides often bind cations via their main chain CO groups, instead of anions via their NH groups. The specificity filter of the potassium channel and the water channel of aquaporin exhibit this more linear conformation in which carbonyl groups are employed by proteins to transport molecules across membranes. This near-linear conformation is also that found in a strand of alpha sheet  Compound nests  If two nests overlap such that residue i+1 of the first nest is residue i of the second nest, a compound nest is formed. This has four NH groups instead of three. If three nests overlap such that residues i+1 and i+2 of the first nest are residue i of the second and third nest, a wider compound nest is formed with five NH groups, and so on. The main chain atoms form part of an incomplete ring with the NH groups all pointing roughly towards the centre of the ring. Because their concavities are often wider than simple nests, compound nests are commonly employed by proteins for binding multi-atom anions such as phosphates, as in the P-loop or Walker motifs, and in iron-sulphur clusters. The synthesized peptide Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Lys-Thr, designed as a minimal peptide P-loop, was shown to bind inorganic phosphate strongly at neutral pH .  Types of nest  Simple nests are of two kinds called RL and LR depending on the sign of the phi angles of the first two nest residues. R residues have negative phi values (as in right-handed alpha-helices) and L residues have positive phi values (as in the left-handed alpha helix). Eighty percent of nests are RL and 20% are LR. When two nests overlap they may be RLR or LRL. When three nests overlap they may be RLRL or LRLR, and so on. Every Schellman loop incorporates an RL nest in the last three of its six residues. The nest binds carbonyl oxygen atoms preceding it in sequence. A number of antibody proteins have RLR nests within the hairpin loops of their H-chain CDRs (complementarity determining regions) bound to a carboxylate side chain. These have been engineered to give rise to monoclonal nest-containing antibodies specific for proteins with phosphorylated serines and threonines. Most PDZ domains have an RL nest at the beginning of the first beta-strand, with the function of recognizing the carboxylate group at the C-terminus of the domain's peptide or protein ligand.

History  The diocese of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r was founded by Stephen I of Hungary in 1009. The construction of the first cathedral was begun that time, though was completed only in the end of the century, under the rule of Ladislaus I. During the same period, towards the end of the 11th century they began constructing the second cathedral. The transversal naves and the first part of the sanctuary of the present cathedral were built in Romanesque style. During the Mongol invasion of 1241, the church was destroyed. In the middle of the 13th century the cathedral was rebuilt on the old foundation, in the transitory style between Romanesque and Gothic. Not much later, in 1277, Saxons pillaged the cathedral and set it on fire. In the 15th century, the building was reconstructed. In 1439, it was again damaged after a Turkish invasion during the Ottoman‚ÄìHungarian wars. The archbishop of Esztergom and the regent-governor of Hungary, John Hunyadi contributed to the reconstruction ‚Äì this was the time when the latter one chose the cathedral of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r as a burial place. During the first part of the 16th century, the building was improved, and further parts were added to it. In 1601, during the Romanian invasion led by Michael the Brave, the cathedral was pillaged, even the tombs of the Hunyadis were damaged. In 1603, the Habsburg army, led by Giorgio Basta sieged the building. In 1658, during the next invasion of the Ottomans, the cathedral was damaged again.

He is mostly known for his work in Palestine and Japan, during the first half of the 1930s. Early life Aleksandrowicz was born in Krak√≥w in 1905 to a Jewish family. His father, Sinaj Zygmunt, the owner of a prominent paper wholesale business, was communally and philanthropically active as a member of the city council and one of the leaders of the Jewish community. His mother, Hela Rakower, was a descendant of one of the largest and long-standing Jewish families in Krak√≥w. Aleksandrowicz studied in a Hebrew primary school and in a Polish high school, after which he was sent by his family for higher education at trade schools in Vienna and Basel to prepare him for the family business. Photography career Aleksandrowicz had been attracted to photography from a young age. His aunt R√≥≈ºa, who ran a renowned art supplies business across from the Arts Academy in Krak√≥w and who was connected to the artistic and cultural circles of the city, gave him his first camera. During the 1920s he took many pictures in Poland and in other European countries, producing hundreds of photos. At the beginning of the 1930s, Aleksandrowicz acquired a couple of modern Leica 35 mm cameras, which gave him flexibility in choosing his subjects. He began to travel further afield with his camera, producing photographs in Poland, Japan, the United States, Egypt and in a considerable number of other countries. Aleksandrowicz was an active and enthusiastic supporter of the Zionist idea. Between the years of 1932 and 1935 he visited Palestine three times and took thousands of photographs, mainly in Tel Aviv and Jaffa, Haifa, Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hadera, the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan Valley. He also took portrait photographs of central figures in the Zionist movement of the time, including Hayim Nahman Bialik, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Abba Ahimeir, Haim Arlosoroff, Nahum Sokolow, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and others. In conversations with members of his family, Aleksandrowicz defined himself as an ‚Äúamateur photographer,‚Äù that is, a photographer not dependent on photography for a living and free to choose his subjects as he wishes. This attitude did not, however, prevent him from trying to have his work published. Aleksandrowicz offered his photographs to a number of Jewish and Zionist papers in Poland and the United States, which published them as photo reports in Aleksandrowicz‚Äôs name. In 1936, Aleksandrowicz married Lea Chelouche, the daughter of one of the long-standing families in the Jewish Yishuv. The couple had four children. After settling in Palestine in the same year, Aleksandrowicz stopped photographing almost completely, except for occasional photographs of close family members. The reasons for this remain unclear. Death and rediscovery Aleksandrowicz died in Tel Aviv in 1992. Eleven years after his death, a tattered leather suitcase was discovered by chance at his home, in which the fruit of his art was hidden ‚Äì more than 15,000 negatives found rolled up in rusty tin boxes. The great majority of these negatives had not been printed during his lifetime. Researchers and professionals judged the worth and value of the collection following a lengthy process of scanning and identifying of photographs by place, person, and date. It remains a wonder to his family that he had never mentioned the existence of this large negative collection, especially after receiving renewed recognition as a photographer in his final years. Since 2010 the Aleksandrowicz collection, held by the photographer's family, can be accessed on-line through a dedicated internet site of the National Library of Israel.

Facts  In 1971, the appellant, Golden Cape Fruits, decided to have a new brochure printed by photolithographic process. It ordered direct from a specialist photolithographer, the respondent, certain photolithographic plates. These the appellant passed on to the printer, who printed the required number of copies. Owing, however, to an error in the plates, the copies could not be used. Golden Cape Fruits had claimed from Fotoplate the cost of the printing of them, on the basis of either breach of contract or of negligence. Fotoplate's defence was that the contract was subject to a trade usage which in the circumstances absolved it from liability. This alleged usage was to the effect that Fotoplate would exhibit to Golden Cape Fruits some \\"rough proofs\\" of the plates (or positives) for approval, amendment or rejection. If these were approved, as they had been, Fotoplate's obligations under the agreement would be fulfilled by completing and delivering the positives in accordance with the proofs.  Evidence  The evidence disclosed the following: * that the mistake would not have been obvious even to an expert; * that checking by an expert would take considerable time; and * that neither the respondent's employees nor those of the printer had detected the error until after the copies had been printed.  Judgment  A magistrate's court having granted absolution from the instance, on appeal the Cape Provincial Division held that Fotoplate had failed to discharge the onus of establishing a trade usage to absolve it from liability for breach of contract. Specifically, it had failed to establish # that a trade usage existed in respect of the consequences of the customer's approval of proofs; # that, if there was such usage, it applied to photolithographic positives and related, without qualification, to all errors, including those occurring in aspects not clearly conveyed to the customer; and # that, if the application to photolithographic positives were accepted subject to qualification, the error in the present case was in regard to a matter clearly conveyed to the customer. The court held, therefore, that judgment should have been granted for the appellant, in the amount claimed, with costs.  Trade usages  In the area of implied terms, the case is an oft-cited authority on trade usage. To put the position at its lowest, the evidence required to establish a trade usage must be clear, convincing and consistent. It must, moreover, amount to something more than mere opinion. Instances of the usage's having been acted upon should be provided in order to establish the fact of its existence. No rule can be laid down as to the number of witnesses required. This depends very much upon the nature of the usage in question, the character and quality of the witnesses and the extent to which their evidence is placed in issue by other evidence. In the nature of things, the court would not readily act upon the evidence of a single witness, even if uncontradicted: a fortiori if there is a conflict in the evidence. The judgment of Corbett JA established the requirements for a trade usage. It must * be uniformly and universally observed; * be long established; * be reasonable, so that one would expect people in the trade to be aware of it; * be notorious; * be certain; * not be in conflict with positive law; and * not conflict with an express term of the contract.

He began his American residency at Manchester, N.H. Gagnon envisaged a national union of the French Canadians in Canada and those in the United States. He saw this union as something that would happen sooner or later and worked toward that goal. He put forth a concerted effort for a period of time toward repatriation of Franco-Americans to Quebec. This effort was largely unsuccessful. His vocation was publishing and journalism and he was involved in a number of publications starting with La Voix du peuple. This publication ceased and was replaced by L‚ÄôId√©e nouvelle. In 1869 Gagnon married and settled in Worcester, Mass. where he started the L‚Äô√âtendard national. Gagnon continued to support his view of the French Canadian √©migr√©s which was not always popular with the √©migr√©s themselves.

The system used the tracks of the Burton upon Trent Corporation Tramways from a terminus by the Town Hall in Wellington Street through Station Street, Borough Road and Guild Street before using its own infrastructure through Swadlincote to Ashby-de-la-Zouch. There was a branch from Swadlincote and Woodville to Gresley railway station at Castle Gresley which opened on 24 September 1906. The journey time from Ashby- de-la-Zouch to the terminus in Burton on Trent was a minimum of 64 minutes and a 10-minute interval service was offered, requiring 17 vehicles. One unusual feature of the line was the Swadlincote power house which was fitted with two diesel engines, rather than the more traditional steam power. The adjacent depot could accommodate a total of 24 trams but the company only ever owned 20. The Brush Electric Company of Loughborough provided the open top tramcars. Each had two Westinghouse 80 motors and capacity for 51 passengers. The livery was Crimson Lake and white with a Midland crest. When the company was taken over by the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, the cars were repainted. The system was taken over by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company when it absorbed the Midland Railway in 1923, and the system was closed on 19 February 1927. At closure, 3 cars were sold to the Tynemouth and District Electric Traction Company and the remaining 10 sold locally for domestic or rural use. Car 14 Car 14 at the Statfold Barn Railway.

Background  The noble family dates back to the days of Elector Palatine Frederick the Victorious (1425‚Äì1476). His children from his morganatic marriage with Clara Tott were not able to inherit the Wittelsbach properties, so they formed a separate noble family. After the death of Count Louis III in 1611, the family was split into two main lines, the Protestant L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Virneburg line (later Freudenberg) and the Catholic L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort line.  Life  Prince Charles Thomas was the first-born son from the marriage of Prince Dominic Constantine, Prince of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort (1762‚Äì1814) with Maria Leopoldine, Princess of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein (1761‚Äì1807). Prince Charles had six sisters and three half siblings from his father's second marriage. He and his younger brother Constantine were raised during the final years of the Holy Roman Empire. They were very aware of the privileges of the class of Imperial Princes. They were educated at court in W√ºrzburg and later at the court of Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, the Prince-Elector of Trier. Nothing is known about any higher education that Charles Thomas may have enjoyed. In 1802, he participated in a diplomatic mission of the L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg family to Paris. His father's territory was mediatized during the events following the French Revolution. The L√∂wenstein territories were divided between the newly elevated Grand Duchies of Baden and Hesse and the Kingdoms of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. Charles Thomas joined the Austrian army and fought in several battles of the Napoleonic Wars. Most recently, he served as major in the Galician Ulanes Regiment \\"Prince of Schwarzenberg\\" No. 2. In 1812 and 1813, the family lost its territory on the left bank of the Rhine, including Rochefort. This led to a name change: the House of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort changed its name to L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. In 1814, Charles Thomas's father died. He resigned from the military and took up administration of the family possessions. As a member of the high nobility, he held a seat in the First Chamber in Baden, Bavaria, Hesse and W√ºrttemberg. However, he had little interest in the political issues of those four states. Initially, his senior officials concerned themselves with the interests of the high nobility. From the early 1830s, his son Constatine did the same. After Constantine died in 1838, the senior officials took over again. Throughout his life, Charles Thomas felt a strong bond with the Austrian Empire and its ruling Habsburg dynasty. He married an Austrian wife and took up permanent residence in Vienna in the 1840s. As he grew older, he devoted more and more time to his Catholic faith and developed a devotion, which served as a model for his grandson and successor Charles Henry.  Marriage and issue  Thomas Charles married on 29 September 1799 in Ellwangen to Countess Sophie of Windisch-Gr√§tz (1784‚Äì1848), a daughter of Joseph Nicholas of Windisch-Graetz. They had the following children: * Constantine (1802‚Äì1838), married to Princess Agnes of Hohenlohe- Langenburg (1804‚Äì1835); * Marie Leopoldine, (1804‚Äì1869), married to her uncle, Prince Constantine of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg (1786‚Äì1844); * Marie Louise Adelaide Eulalia (1806‚Äì1884), married to Prince Camille of Rohan (1800‚Äì1892); * Sophia Maria Theresa (1809‚Äì1838), married to Prince Heinrich XX of Reuss-Greiz; * Maria Kreszentia Octavie (1813‚Äì1878), married to Prince Victor Alexander of Isenburg-B√ºdingen in Birnstein; * Aegidia Eulalie (1820‚Äì1895)  References  * Frank Raberg: Biographisches Handbuch der w√ºrttembergischen Landtagsabgeordneten 1815‚Äì1933, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, 2001, , p. 525 * Harald Stockert: Adel im √úbergang.

He coached all youth categories of NK Zagreb, before taking over the first team. He also coached Hrvatski Dragovoljac, Vinogradar, Segesta, Gorica and Karlovac. Managerial career After NK Zagreb sacked Zlatko Kranjƒçar in September 2003, his assistant Petraviƒá took over the first team for the next match. On 1 October 2003, he was appointed as full-time manager until the end of season. After his spell at NK Zagreb ended in March 2004 when he was replaced by Milivoj Braƒçun, Petraviƒá joined fourth-tier club Polet Bu≈°evec in the role of technical advisor before being appointed joint manager with Nino Matkoviƒá in the second part of the season. In September 2005, he resigned as manager. However, he returned to Polet again in January 2006 and the following season club achieved promotion to Treƒáa HNL. In June 2007, Petraviƒá received an offer from Vinogradar and after consultation with the club terminated his contract by mutual consent. In January 2008, he was considered to coach Croatia Sesvete but the job went to Ljupko Petroviƒá and Petraviƒá returned for the third time to Polet.

It is home to National League South club Maidstone United. Full construction of the stadium began in September 2011 and was completed in July 2012, with the stadium officially opening on 14 July 2012 when the club hosted Brighton & Hove Albion in a friendly. The stadium 3G artificial pitch Rather than the traditional choice of grass, Maidstone were the first English team to build a stadium with third generation artificial turf. The reasons for going with the synthetic turf were threefold, the first being to eliminate match postponements caused by waterlogging and freezing conditions, the second so that the pitch can be hired out, bringing in vital funds (around ¬£120,000 to ¬£150,000 profit per year), and thirdly so that the stadium can be a hub for all the club's youth and community teams. The pitch currently hosts the home matches of the club's first team, academy (under 18s), under 16s-13s and under 7s-8s. It is also used for training among a large number of the club's teams, and in addition is hired out to other organisations for wider community use. A downside of the 3G pitch is that so far the club has only gained permission to use the pitch in the Football Conference (Conference National / North & South) downwards. As a result of this, promotion to The Football League will not be possible until permission is granted from the league or the 3G turf is replaced with grass. In a bid to overcome these hurdles, Maidstone United head up a group of professional clubs looking to promote the merits of 3G surfaces called '3G4US'. However, as of the 2014‚Äì2015 competition, the FA allowed the use of 3G artificial pitches in every round of the FA Cup. The introduction of 3G pitches in the FA Cup meant that Maidstone were able to host Stevenage FC in a First Round FA Cup Replay in front of the BT Sport cameras, a game which they went on to win 2-1 and progress to the second round.http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/328698/report publisher=Sky Sports date=21 November 2014 In the summer of 2016, the club relaid the pitch ahead of the inaugural campaign in non league's top flight, the National League. =Reaction= Upon seeing his side play on the surface, former Brighton & Hove Albion manager Gus Poyet described the pitch as \\"magnificent\\" and \\"perfection\\". After taking part in a Charity match at the stadium, West Ham United legend Tony Cottee described the 3G facility as a \\"great idea\\", citing that the surface's ability to deal with adverse weather conditions meant it could be the way forward for non-league clubs. Stands There are stands on the north, east and south sides of the pitch. The west side of the stadium remains undeveloped for spectators apart from flat hard standing. Main Stand: The main stand is situated on the eastern side of the ground. It includes 750 spectator seats, a press area, media room and two executive lounges. There is a further temporary media/press area attached, but separate, to this stand. North Stand: The north stand provides a covered long and steep terrace with safe standing for up to 1768 supporters. South Stand: The south stand provides a covered long and shallow covered terrace for up to 500 supporters. Other The southeastern part of the stadium houses the main building which holds the club's office/reception, the Spitfire Lounge (clubhouse), classrooms for the club's academy side, the boardroom, changing rooms, a physio room and storage rooms. It also houses a small seated spectators area for players' guests. Turnstiles are situated at the north and south ends of the stadium. The stadium's floodlights are erected upon four pylons at each corner of the stadium. Name It was announced on 2 January 2012 that the Gallagher Group, a building, civil engineering, quarrying and property business who were the main contractors in the building of the stadium, had signed a five-year deal for the naming rights of the stadium, worth ¬£150,000. Prior to the club selling its naming rights, the stadium was known as James Whatman Way (often shortened to Whatman Way), the name of the road the stadium is on. History Pre-construction After reforming in 1992 (the original Maidstone United sold their stadium in 1988 and moved into Dartford's ground, a move that eventually saw the club go out of business), Maidstone played in the Kent County League Division 4 with their home games taking place where the original club's old training pitch had been situated, at London Road, near Allington. The club worked their way through the Kent County League and were promoted to the Kent League Premier Division in 2001; however the current ground was nowhere near Kent League standards ‚Äì so the club elected to ground share with Sittingbourne (where they remained until 2009 when they opted to ground share with Ashford before, season) while they tried to engineer a move to their preferred site for a new stadium in Maidstone at James Whatman Way. Numerous legal disputes and even a colony of Great Crested Newts on the site delayed the clubs attempts to get permission to build a ground there, however in 2004 the club finally made its first steps towards returning to their home town when an application for planning permission to build a stadium at James Whatman Way was unanimously accepted. However, no real work could begin until the lease to acquire the ground from its owners the Ministry of Defence was signed. After yet more red tape was surpassed the lease was finally signed in March 2006. Despite Maidstone now having the green light to start construction, there were questions over the clubs ability to finance the stadium and almost a year passed before some preliminary work took place in January 2007. No significant inroads were made however, and soon the site became overgrown and disused. By the summer of 2008, with no movement at Whatman Way since the initial work and Maidstone suffering financial problems, it was decided the club were unable to fund the ground themselves and a bid was placed for a ¬£1.2 million grant from the Football Foundation to build the stadium. However the bid was turned down, and after this the new stadium took a back seat as all funds were focussed on keeping the club afloat. A change of club ownership in October 2010 saw a renewed attempt to move to the stadium. A new company, named Maidstone United Ground Ltd, was formed to deal solely with stadium matters, and by the summer of 2011 ¬£1 million had been raised towards building the ground, and the lands freehold had been purchased outright from the Ministry of Defence. It was at this time it was decided to go ahead with the construction of the stadium. Construction After some preliminary work taking place throughout August 2011, full construction of the stadium began on 26 September 2011. The stadium's floodlights were fully installed by late January 2012, and at the start of February the club was informed it had secured a ¬£150,000 grant from the Football Foundation through the Football Stadia Improvement Fund to help finance the build. The terracing at the north and south ends of the ground was installed on 12 and 13 April 2012. The laying of the stadium's artificial 3G pitch began on 30 April 2012 and was completed by 2 May 2012. Within a matter of weeks the club's youth and community teams began training on the pitch whilst construction of the stadium continued. The installation of the seats in the main stand began on 29 May 2012. The stadium was fully completed on 13 July 2012. Changes and capacity increases After the finishing of the initial build in 2012, the club continued to increase the capacity with the extension of the modular terraces at both the north and south ends of the ground. In late March 2014 the owners of the stadium revealed that they were preparing to apply for planning permission to construct a brand new stand behind the goal at the north end of the ground. However, in July 2014 it was confirmed that these plans were to be put to one side for the time being and instead replaced with a project to extend the existing main stand. This ¬£500,000 scheme saw the addition of 300 seats, 50 Vice President seats and new gates/turnstiles which increased capacity to over 3,030. Work began in late May 2015 and the expansion of the Main Stand was completed on 11 August 2015 just in time for the first home league match of the season, against Ebbsfleet United. Following promotion to non league's top tier in 2016, the club relaid its 3G pitch, and once again had to look to increase the capacity of the stadium, this time to at least 4,000. In June 2016 the club announced plans for a permanent stand at the north end of the stadium, capable of housing up to 1,768 standing spectators, with the structure also being built with future conversion to seating in mind. Planning permission was granted at the start of October 2016, and work began in November 2016 with the removal of the old modular terracing.

Biography   Youth and training  At age 16, Calvez became a novitiate of the Society of Jesus on October 23, 1943. Following his religious training he completed brilliant studies at the institute of political science and the institute of international law in Paris. He also earned a degree from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. From 1953, he taught social sciences at the Jesuit academy of Chantilly. On July 31, 1957, he was ordained as a Catholic priest.  Social philosophy  Jean-Yves Calvez was not yet a priest in 1956 when he published a work that rapidly gained attention in the field of social philosophy: The Thought of Karl Marx (La Pens√©e de Karl Marx). To be interested in Marxism before the Second Vatican Council and to reveal a certain sympathy for Karl Marx was daring. However, the objectivity and depth of his work, avoiding the polemic and Communist party thinking that often attached themselves to Marx's personality, immediately gained him great esteem in the field of social philosophy. The Thought of Karl Marx has been published in many editions and is still a reference book today. A polyglot, Calvez was very interested in social, economic, and political questions, refusing to separate these three fields of study, but rather tying them together in research serving a Christian vision of the whole human being. Such was his engagement as a Jesuit priest in the Catholic Church. Calvez studied and promoted a Catholic social teaching that was less Euro-centric and more oriented toward the grave problems of underdevelopment that accompanied the wave of botched decolonizations of the 1960s. Calvez was a teacher of philosophy and social sciences in the Jesuit faculty of philosophy in Chantilly, and he was the director of the center of \\"popular action\\" (later known as the Center for Social Research and Action, CERAS). He participated in 1962 in the foundation of a socio-economic research center, the African Institute for Economic and Social Development (INADES), later known as the Center for Research and Action for Peace,L‚ÄôINADES est devenu en 2002 le Centre de recherches et d‚Äôactions pour la paix CERAP, (Abidjan). in Abidjan. He traveled a lot, particularly in Latin America, where he was close to liberation theologists with whom he would maintain strong links of esteem and friendship for the rest of his life.  Provincial Superior and General Assistant  In 1967, Calvez was named provincial superior and tasked with uniting the four Jesuit provinces of France. After finishing this work, he was called to Rome in 1971 by the Superior general of the Society of Jesus, Pedro Arrupe, as an assistant. He was a trusted advisor there. Calvez actively participated in preparation for the 32nd General Congregation of the Jesuits (1974-1975) which, in a still- famous decree, gave the Society a mission to focus on \\"the service of faith and the promotion of justice.\\" Calvez was elected General Assistant to Arrupe (that is, one of his four closest advisors). As a deputy to Arrupe, Calvez worked hard to implement in the life and works of the Society the spirit of this new \\"faith-and-justice\\" paradigm. Difficulties and misunderstandings were large, and conflicts were not lacking. Until Arrupe was stricken by a blood clot forcing him to step down from his leadership of the Society, Calvez worked with Paolo Dezza, pontifical delegate named by Pope John Paul II, and together they prepared the Society for the 33rd General Congregation that would elect the new Superior General, Peter Hans Kolvenbach.  Return to France  Back in France, Father Calvez was the director of the Center for Social Research and Action (CERAS) from 1984 to 1989, and editor-in-chief of the magazine √âtudeshttp://www.revue-etudes.com/ from 1989 to 1995. He helped with the revival of \\"social weeks\\" in France as a member of the association's administrative council from 1985 to 2000. During these years he continued to write on economic, social, and political questions and on Catholic social teaching, especially in the magazine Projet (published by CERAS), of which he was the director for many years. Faithful to the memory of Pedro Arrupe, to whom he was more a close friend than a subordinate, he made better known the profoundly religious thought and personality of this 28th Superior general of the Society of Jesus.Le p√®re Arrupe ; l‚Äô√âglise apr√®s le Concile, published in 1997, in Paris, by CERF. Calvez also presented in front of many audiences. He taught in the department of social ethics at the Jesuit faculty of S√®vres- Paris from 2002 to 2006, and, at the invitation of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, gave a series of sermons in the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., made him a member of its administrative council. Every year, Calvez went to Argentina for summer classes. Calvez died in Paris on January 11, 2010, of complications from a pulmonary edema.

He was born in Heusden in the Low Countries and guillotined in Paris on 4 Germinal, Year II (24 March 1794). De Kock was born the son of Govert Kock, mayor of Heusden and studied law to become a lawyer, developing republican principles. In 1787 he fled, with 40,000 of the free militia, when the Prussian army occupied Amsterdam at the request of Wilhemine, the stadtholder's wife and became a refugee in France with his wife, Marie-P√©tronille Merkus, and two sons. Three daughters were left with a sister. When his wife died in 1789 he married a rich widow, Anna Maria Kirsberger, with whom in 1793 he had a further son, the novelist Charles Paul de Kock. He joined the Sartorius-Shokard Bank and progressed to become Commissioner for Low Country Affairs. Still upholding his republican ideals he founded the \\"Comit√© R√©volutionnaire Batave\\" which formed and sent to the Dutch Republic a force of volunteers under General Daendels. The force was intended to assist General Dumouriez in freeing the Low Countries from Austrian rule but Dumouriez subsequently defected from the Revolutionary government to support King Louis XVI. When the French Revolution began in 1792 de Kock expressed his backing for the planned assassination of King Louis. In 1793 he met the revolutionary Jacques Ren√© H√©bert and the two became good friends. He also associated with fellow H√©bertist revolutionaries Anacharsis Cloots and Charles-Philippe Ronsin. In March 1794, having by now left the bank, he was accused by the Committee of Public Safety (the provisional government in France during the Reign of Terror), of being a agent for the British. He was arrested at his home on March 18 and taken to the Conciergerie where the public prosecutor Fouquier-Tinville charged him with having had meetings against the government and of having been the friend of the traitor Dumouriez. He appeared in court on March 24 in company with Jacques H√©bert and his H√©bertist followers and was sentenced to death along with some 20 others. They were all guillotined that same evening. His eldest son Hendrik Merkus de Kock (1779 in Heusden‚Äì1845) became a Dutch general in the Batavian Navy and Lieutenant Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He was made a baron.

Life and work A priest of the diocese of Paris and master of arts, he was denied Agr√©gation by the University of Paris in 1766. He was professor of rhetoric at the royal college of Rouen from 1 July 1762He was appointed after the expulsion of the Jesuits until 1776 and was grand vicar to the bishop of Lescar. He took a position at Br√©c√© on 16 February 1766, but resigned the next day to take another one at Ambri√®res. Alphonse-Victor Angot is unable to say if he ever actually performed any duties in this parish. In any case, he resigned from Ambri√®res on 20 May 1767, in favour of his colleague Jacques-Claude des Nos.By a deed executed in his home in the parish of Saint-Godard, Rouen He resumed his classes on rhetoric in Rouen, until 1776 when he left and established himself in Paris. He translated the Greek orators and historians, including the complete works of Demosthenes, Aeschines, Isocrates and Lysias, as well as Andocides, Antiphon, Demades, Dinarchus, Herodotus, Isaeus, Lycurgus, Thucydides, and Xenophon. He also translated the church fathers Basil of Caesarea and John Chrysostom, as well as the Orations of Cicero and the Constitution des Romains sous les rois et au temps de la R√©publique (Constitution of the Romans under the Kings and in Republican times), a ten volume work which was published posthumously in 1792. A moderate supporter of the French Revolution and admirer of Rousseau, Auger also wrote pieces on the political and educational reforms which he hoped would be carried out, principally instruction in civics and the education of women. At the time of the summoning of the √âtats g√©n√©raux, he wrote a monograph on education, titled Projet d‚Äô√©ducation g√©n√©rale pour le royaume (Project of General Education for the Kingdom). Member of the Academy of Rouen, he also became a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1781.  Anecdote  In order to illustrate the customs of the province, Stendhal reproduced in his M√©moires d‚Äôun touriste a curious article, entitled √âpisodes de la vie d‚ÄôAnathase Auger publi√©s par sa ni√®ce (Episodes in the Life of Anathase Auger, published by his niece), which describes a family reunion attended by the vicar and his bishop, the Comte de No√©. His niece writes \\"The comte de No√© was a magnificent man in size, figure and bearing. His noble and distinguished bustle, when he assumed his sacred garments, provoked the admiration of all who saw it; as for his grand vicar, he was small, meagre and very ugly.\\"Stendhal, M√©moires d‚Äôun touriste, vol. I, , Le Livre du Divan, Paris, 1929. She further describes how the two prelates danced a round with the family and how Auger agreed, for an hour only and much against his will, to refer to his bishop as tu.

He dedicated to his whole life with fungal biology, particularly in classification of fungi and dye production in fungi and lichens. Besides, his textbook on fungi called ‚ÄúDie pilze in morphologischer, physiologischer, biologischer und systematischer beziehung (Translation: The mushrooms in morphological, physiological, biological and systematic relationship)‚Äù in 1890 was also an outstanding work on the subject for many decades. Thus, his numerous contributions gave him a special status in mycological history.  Early life  Wilhelm Zopf was born in Ro√üleben in Thuringia in 1846. Before going into biological science area, he has been an elementary school teacher in Thondorf at Mansfeld when he was 21-year-old.  Education and research career  In 1874, Wilhelm Zopf decided to leave his teaching position and turned into studying natural sciences at the University of Berlin. After that, he received his PhD with a dissertation entitled ‚ÄúDie von Conidienfr√ºchte von Fumago (Translation: Conidia of Fumago)‚Äù at the University of Halle in 1878. As Wilhelm Zopf obtained his degree, simultaneously, he backed to Berlin as an adjunct professor teaching at the Agricultural College for a few years. In 1883, he was invited to be a head of the cryptogamic laboratory at the University of Halle. In the period of 1883 to 1899, he made extensive studies on Chytridiales and other small aquatic fungi parasitic in algae and small animals. Likewise, he also published an authoritative fungal textbook in which he followed a classification similar in part to that of Julius Oscar Brefeld but placed Ascomycetes last in 1890. In this group, he made them went from the simple forms, like Saccharomyces, Endomyces, Gymnoascaceae, to Pezizales. In addition, he recognized the formation of ascogonia in many ascomycetes and even the union of these in Pyronema, with club-shaped ‚Äúpollinodia‚Äù, but expressed doubt as to their real sexual function. In 1899, Wilhelm Zopf became a professor and a director of botanical garden in the University of M√ºnster. He continued the research on fungal biology and systematics. During his work on fungal biology, he became more interested in secondary chemistry of these organisms, particularly the lichens. He published on more general problems related to lichen biology, particularly in the genus Cladonia. Finally, he died in M√ºnster in 1909, and his name was commemorated by Edvard Vainio in naming of Cladonia zopfii.  Other scientific contributions  Wilhelm Zopf was the first people to carry out the chemical differences in lichens. In 1907, his book ‚ÄúDie Flechtenstoffe in chemischer, botanischer, pharmakologischer und technischer Beziehung (Translation: The lichen substances in chemical, botanical, pharmacological and technical relationship)‚Äù was published. This book contained descriptions of over 150 chemical compounds found in lichens. In other words, we can say the science of lichen chemistry started with Wilhelm Zopf‚Äôs work. Little was known about the actual structures of many of those compounds, but his work indeed gave a sounder basis for the use of chemistry in the taxonomy of lichens. Moreover, there were many fungi related to Wilhelm Zopf. For example, he circumscribed the genus of fungi Thielavia in 1876 and gave Monilia albicans its name in 1890. He also transferred Lichen chrysoleucus which was described by English botanist James Edward Smith to the genus Rhizoplaca in 1905. Although nematode-trapping fungus have been known since 1839, its predatory habit was first observed by Wilhelm Zopf as well. This recorded observation of Arthrobotrys oligospora‚Äôs behavior was attributed to him in 1888. This kind of fungi actively captures small worms, generally classified as nematodes or roundworms.

The Leicaflexes were fully mechanical cameras marketed between 1964 and 1976, in response to the rapid increase in popularity and usability of SLRs during this period. Their appeal was limited by their failure to keep pace with the state of the art in SLR design, their somewhat limited selection of accessories, and their extremely high price in comparison with their Japanese competitors. They were ultimately replaced by the R series Leicas developed by Leitz with the assistance of Minolta under a cooperation agreement between the two companies.  Development  Leitz was a reluctant entrant into the SLR market. At the beginning of the 1960s, the only still cameras manufactured by Leitz were 35mm rangefinders, a camera design that its Japanese competitors, most notably Nippon K≈çgaku (Nikon), were beginning to abandon in favor of SLR designs. The company's management continued to believe in the inherent advantages of the rangefinder design over the SLR, but in view of the steady shift in market share from rangefinders to SLRs such as the Nikon F, the Asahi Pentax and the SR-series Minolta in the early 1960s, and the increasing prominence of high quality SLR cameras among professional photographers, it had little choice but to offer an SLR of its own. To compete in this market Leitz introduced an expensive SLR, called Leicaflex. Nowadays, this first Leicaflex model is generally referred to as the Original Leicaflex or Leicaflex Standard to distinguish it from the models that followed. Colloquially it was referred to early on as the 'diesel Leica'. The Leicaflex lacked a few features present in the most advanced products of its time. It has been much criticized for omitting a through the lens (TTL) exposure meter of the type which had previously been incorporated into the Topcon RE Super and the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic, and which would soon appear in the Nikon F Photomic T, Canon Pellix and a number of other reflex cameras. It also lacked the interchangeable viewfinders offered for the Miranda, Canon Canonflex, and Nikon F. Finally, the original Leicaflex featured a finder which, while offering a very bright aerial image, was not full focusing, offering only a small focusing zone at the center. The Leicaflex did offer mirror lock-up, and shutter speeds up to 1/2000 visible in the finder. The camera introduced a new three lug bayonet mount. This mount remains substantially unchanged to the present day, although the mount has been developed in order to accommodate increased levels of automation. Leica had always offered a more limited range of reflex lenses than its Japanese rivals; at the time of the introduction of the Leicaflex, the range was limited to 35mm, 50mm, 90mm and 135mm focal lengths of moderate speed. The original Leicaflex is readily identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover on the front of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a tripod socket attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a tripod socket integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the advance lever. In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.List of serial numbers at Cameraquest.  Accessories  * Motor drive for the Leicaflex SL Mot and SL2 Mot, named Leicaflex Motor * Eveready case 14557 * Eveready bags  Leicaflex SL  The Leicaflex SL was an SLR made by Leitz from 1968 to 1974 as the second iteration of the Leicaflex series. In 1968, Leitz responded to the critics of the non-TTL meter of the original Leicaflex by introducing its successor the Leicaflex SL with a TTL meter. The SL designation in the name was an abbreviation of \\"Selective Light\\", the name chosen by Leitz for its implementation of TTL metering. This system metered a limited area represented by the viewfinder's central microprism spot. At a time when SLR manufacturers were divided between those embracing TTL metering at full aperture (such as Nikon and Konica), and those with mounts which permitted only stop-down metering (such as Pentax and Canon), Leitz chose to implement full aperture metering on the Leicaflex SL. Light measurement was by a cell mounted in the camera base pointing upwards with light directed onto it by a small secondary mirror hinged from the main mirror, the central portion of the main mirror being semi silvered. A similar arrangement was used in every successive R camera. Leitz also addressed complaints about the original Leicaflex focusing screen in the SL focusing screen, which offered a ground-glass focusing screen with a central microprism spot. This more conventional configuration did not prevent it from being very bright and comfortable. The Leicaflex SL replaced the mirror lock-up function of the original Leicaflex with a depth of field preview. The principal effect of this change was to obsolete the rangefinder- derived 21mm f/3.4 Schneider Super-Angulon lens which, due to the protrusion of the rear element into the camera body, was designed to work with the mirror locked up in conjunction with an external viewfinder. This lens cannot be mounted on the SL or its followers without mirror lockup. The original Leicaflex Super-Angulon was replaced by the retrofocus type 21mm f/4 Super- Angulon-R, which can be mounted in the conventional way. The Leicaflex SL is identifiable by the letters \\"SL\\" on the front of the prism housing, which replaced the meter window and battery cover of the original Leicaflex. It was offered in chrome as well as black finish. Black SLs initially bore a black enamel finish, which was subsequently replaced by a more durable \\"black chrome\\" finish. 70,995 serial numbers were allotted to the Leicaflex SL.List of serial numbers at Cameraquest. In 1972, for the Olympic Games in Munich, an edition of 1,000 was made in chrome with special markings (the five rings, the year 72 and a three digit number).1,000 examples: this page at KB Camera . Some Leicaflex SL for the US Navy were engraved NAVY on the bottom plate.See for example the pictures in this Chinese forum . They are reported at least in black enamel and black chrome. On occasions, you can find a dummy Leicaflex SL with a dummy 50mm f/2 Summicron standard lens. This was a display object and demonstration model for retailers, and is called 'Attrappe' in German, which means 'mockup.' They did not have a serial number. 100px  Leicaflex SL Mot  The Leicaflex SL Mot was a variant of the Leicaflex SL that could take a motor drive, and lacked the self-timer and the meter switch in the advance lever. The SL Mot was mostly produced in black enamel and later black chrome, but chrome examples do exist.See the picture of a chrome Leicaflex SL Mot in this page by Doug Herr . The motor drive was as large as the camera body itself, marked LEICAFLEX MOTOR, and was probably only made in black. 980 serial numbers were allotted to the Leicaflex SL Mot.List of serial numbers at Cameraquest. It seems that some were used by the NASA and have NASA engravings.See this page at Map Camera Museum .  Leicaflex SL lens mount modifications  While the addition of full aperture TTL metering on the Leicaflex SL was good from a usability standpoint, an unfortunate result was that Leitz had to make a slight modification to the lens mount, by adding a new cam to communicate aperture information from the lens to the body. The lenses for the original Leicaflex are therefore referred to as \\"one-cam\\" lenses, while those for the SL and the later SL2 are referred to as \\"two-cam\\" lenses. Leitz subsequently added a third cam to permit automation with the Leica R3 and later cameras, giving rise to \\"three-cam\\" lenses. All the lenses are mechanically similar and can mount on older or newer bodies, with a few exceptions, although the older lenses cannot use the full potential of the exposure metering systems and automation offered by the later bodies. To this day, however, Leica and its service agents offer a service to add the second and third cams to older lenses to permit compatibility with more recent reflex models.  Leicaflex SL2  The Leicaflex SL2 was a SLR made by Leitz from 1974 as the third iteration of the Leicaflex series.Leica Reflex Practice R5 to R3 -Andrew Matheson - 1987 - Page 14 \\"The Leicaflex SL2 was the last of the mechanical Leica reflex cameras and the most sophisticated of its kind. Its ruggedness also made it a favourite among press photographers. \\" The modifications from the Leicaflex SL were relatively minor: * split image rangefinder in viewer * addition of an aperture read-out in the finder * viewfinder illumination, with an additional battery compartment at the front of the camera * hot shoe * more sensitive exposure meter * modified mirror mechanism, to accept new wide-angle lenses that cannot be mounted on the previous bodies (16mm f/2.8 Fisheye Elmarit-R, 19mm f/2.8 Elmarit-R and 24mm f/2.8 Elmarit-R) * minor cosmetic details, like the position of the battery tester The Leicaflex SL2 was produced in chrome and in black chrome finish. 24,555 serial numbers were allotted for the SL2, but among them were some SL2 Mot.List of serial numbers at Cameraquest. Some SL2s received special Leica 50 Jahre markings in 1975, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the introduction of the first Leica. Production of the SL2 ended in 1976, at which time it was replaced by the R3, a product of the cooperation agreement between Leitz and Minolta. The R3 offered an electronic shutter and exposure automation in a camera body which shared little in common with the Leicaflex models, apart from its lens mount. The SL2 was ultimately a victim of economic reality. Although the official price of the SL2 camera body was approximately double that of the contemporary Nikon F2 Photomic (approximately $1600 vs. $830 in 1975), Leitz nevertheless lost money on each camera produced, due largely to the cost of producing the high specification shutter. Such losses were unsustainable given the financial crisis facing Leitz in the mid-1970s. The Leicaflex SL2 was the last all-mechanical Leica reflex body for several years, before the advent of the R6. It was also the last independently designed Leica SLR prior to the introduction of the R8 in 1996. This and its relative rarity compared to the SL have driven the prices quite high. In terms of usability and price, the Leicaflex SL in good condition is likely to be the best compromise among this series of cameras for today's user.  Leicaflex SL2 Mot  As with the SL, a motorized version of the SL2 called Leicaflex SL2 Mot was made, only in black, with the provision to accept a motor drive, common with the SL Mot. 1,020 serial numbers were allotted to the SL2 Mot, plus some that were made in batches allotted to the SL2.List of serial numbers at Cameraquest.

Facts  Coutts sent wool for sale to Jacobs, brokers of East London in the Eastern Cape, with the request that they should \\"do the best for me.\\" Jacobs sold odd bales, but eventually Coutts caused the remainder of the wool to be removed from Jacobs and handed to other brokers for sale, paying a sum claimed by Jacobs as brokerage on the unsold portion subject to Coutts's right to recover same. Jacobs claimed the brokerage in virtue of a custom or trade usage, whereby, if wool is removed from one broker to another by the owner, the first broker is entitled to a charge on the transfer equal to the amount of commission which would be earned on the price offered or reserved. It was shown that the custom had been observed in East London and other ports for many years, but that recently one broker had not made the charge for eighteen months. It was not shown, however, that plaintiff knew of the custom.  Judgment  The court held, on appeal, that the law of South Africa is not less favourable to a person relying upon a trade usage than the law of England, there being no difference between the two systems on this point. The custom or trade usage in question was found to be certain and reasonable. In the circumstances, in sending his wool to be disposed of by Jacobs, Coutts must be taken to have bound himself to have entrusted the wool to be dealt with by Jacobs in accordance with the usage of brokers in East London. The court held, furthermore, that the fact that one broker in East London had not observed the custom did not destroy the custom's validity.

An example of the workings of the system of patronage in the Church of England, Tenison also was a significant Whig and controversialist. Edward Tenison, portrait by John Vanderbank difference of these arms was borne by Tennyson, the family of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809‚Äì1892) (Baron Tennyson), the poet Arms of Tenison impaling Searle (or Sayer), detail from his widow's ledger stone in Canterbury Cathedral. The jessant-de-lys charges in the arms of Tenison have been misinterpreted by the stonemason as leopard's heads ducally crowned, with forked beards Early life Baptised at Norwich on 3 April 1673, he was the only surviving child of Joseph Tenison of Norwich by his wife Margaret, daughter of Edward Mileham of Burlingham in Norfolk. Philip Tenison, archdeacon of Norfolk, was his grandfather and Thomas Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury, a cousin. Thomas Browne who had married another daughter of Mileham was therefore an uncle, and Tenison was in later life on good terms with his daughter Elizabeth Lyttelton, the writer.Perdita woman: Elizabeth Lyttelton, Warwick University. After being educated at St Paul's School, London under Thomas Gale, he was admitted a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 19 February 1691. He graduated B.A. in 1694, and proceeded LL.B. in 1697 and D.D. in 1731, the last two being Lambeth degrees. Tenison was at first intended for law, and was bound apprentice to his uncle, Charles Mileham, an attorney at Great Yarmouth. Whig rector in Kent Abandoning the law for the church, he was ordained deacon and priest in 1697, and presented the same year to the rectory of Wittersham, Kent. This he resigned in 1698 on being presented to the rectory of Sundridge in the diocese of Rochester, which he held with the adjacent rectory of Chiddingstone. On 24 March 1705 he was made a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral, resigning in 1708 on being appointed archdeacon of Carmarthen, in favour of George Fage, a relation and fellow- student at Corpus.Robert Masters, The History of the College of Corpus Christi (1753), p. 400; Google Books. A Whig supporter, in the minority in Kent in a bitterly contested election, he reported on the derision those in his position endured.Robert D. Cornwall, William Gibson, Religion, Politics and Dissent, 1660‚Äì1832: essays in honour of James E. Bradley (2010), p. 137; Google Books. The memory of the Kentish Petition of 1701 endured, with David Polhill who had been a petitioner standing for election in 1710; and Tenison wrote to him in October of that year about it. Kent was also a sphere of influence of the Sackville family, Earls of Dorset, later patrons of Tenison..historyofparliamentonline.org/, Kent 1690‚Äì1715. Tenison became the chaplain to the Prince of Wales immediately after the succession of George I of Great Britain. Controversialist In 1714 Tenison inherited considerable estates from his uncle, Edward Tenison of Lambeth, who was steward to Archbishop Tenison and left ¬£12,000; but he subsequently lost most of his wealth in 1720 by investing it in the South Sea Company. In 1715 he acted as executor to his cousin the archbishop, and was in consequence involved in litigation on the question of dilapidations with Archbishop William Wake. Correspondence on the subject was published by him in 1716. The surveyor involved in estimating the dilapidations of the episcopal palaces was John James, who defended himself in print against what he called Tenison's \\"cavils and misrepresentations\\".Dictionary of National Biography, James, John (d. 1746), architect, by Bertha Porter. Published 1891. Wake asked for dilapidations of ¬£3469. The claim was referred to Peter King, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and John Bettesworth, Dean of the Arches, as arbitrators, with the Bishop of Lichfield as moderator. The arbitrators awarded Wake ¬£2800. Tenison was a supporter of Benjamin Hoadly in the Bangorian controversy. In February 1718 he clashed with George Stanhope in the lower house of Convocation; Stanhope was prolocutor of the house, and interrupted Tenison who was about to read a speech in favour of Hoadly by reading the formula proroguing the sitting. The incident led to a pamphlet war, and rebounded on Stanhope. Tenison contended that Archbishop Wake had disapproved of moves made against Hoadly; Stanhope replied, and then Thomas Herne in an anonymous pamphlet supported Tenison.Andrew Starkie, The Church of England and the Bangorian Controversy, 1716‚Äì1721 (2007), p. 83; Google Books. The Three Discourses of the Swiss theologian Samuel Werenfels, translated by Herne, were an intervention in the controversy on Hoadly's side, and were addressed to Tenison.William Gibson, Enlightenment Prelate: Benjamin Hoadly, 1676‚Äì1761 (2004), p. 193; Google Books. In Wales Tenison was archdeacon of Carmarthen until 1727. He made a survey of some of Wales on foot. He noted in 1710 that the absence of services in the Welsh language drove local people to the chapels of the Dissenters. There are surviving notes in his handwriting on parishes in the diocese of St Davids where he was given a power of deputy, between the bishops George Bull and Philip Bisse. He made two attempts to settle in Wales: first, by buying an estate in Anglesey that was in a chancery case, only to lose his deposit on it with the South Sea Bubble; and secondly by living with his family on Anglesey for a period from 1723. In the end he took a job as Proctor at Canterbury, in a deal whereby his son Thomas would become archdeacon, with the living of Chiddingstone, and John Lynch would have the living of Sundridge. In Ireland Tenison served as Bishop of Ossory in Ireland from 1730/1 to 1735. He appears to have owed this promotion to the newly appointed Lord Lieutenant, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, acting in concert with Archbishop Hugh Boulter; Tenison was the Duke's first chaplain.Paul J. DeGategno, R. Jay Stubblefield, Critical Companion to Jonathan Swift: a literary reference to his life and works (2006), p. 415; Google Books. Tenison introduced a Bill of Residence in the Irish Parliament in December 1731, and became a literary target for Jonathan Swift.Stephen E. Karian, Jonathan Swift in Print and Manuscript (2010), pp. 84‚Äì5; Google Books. Swift found Tenison's politics objectionable, and in his poem On the Irish Bishops attacked Tenison's support for the Bill of Residence, and a Bill of Division, both concerned with Irish clerical livings. The phrase \\"baboon of Kilkenny\\" in the poem is taken to be an allusion to Tenison.Shane Leslie, The Skull of Swift: an extempore exhumation (1928), p. 295; Google Books. In February 1732 the Bills passed the Irish House of Lords but were rejected by the Irish House of Commons. Swift left a manuscript giving the case against the Bill.On the Bill for the Clergy‚Äôs Residing on their Livings, Swift archive. Tenison was buried in St Mary's Church, Dublin.

Career  Antoine-Alexis Cadet de Vaux was born in Paris on 11 January 1743, the youngest of seven boys. His father was Claude Cadet, first physician of Louis XIV of France. When his father died in 1745 Monsieur de Saint- Laurent, former General Treasurer of colonies, took responsibility for the family, making sure the children were well-educated. In 1771 Cadet de Vaux succeeded his brother, Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt, as chief apothecary of the Hotel des Invalides. He then became chief pharmacist at the Val de Grace and chemistry professor at the Veterinary School of Alfort. He became head of a pharmacy, Rue Saint-Antoine, which he abandoned three years later to study science and rural economy. In 1772, he helped Parmentier to create the first free school for baking. The school was considered so useful that the pair were brought to travel through France to spread the use of good practices and new methods. Along with Antoine Parmentier, he performed experiments and published on public health, the culture of wine and agricultural economics. In 1777 he founded the Journal de Paris, which flourished under his supervision and contributions. He was friends with Benjamin Franklin, inventor, publisher, American Founding father and the United States Minister to France from 1778 to 1785. He was a member of the Academic Society of Sciences and a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of Paris from 1787. In 1778, with his friend and Agricultural Society member Antione Parmentier, he obtained the King's permission to found a newspaper, the Journal de Paris. This newspaper was under the direction of his friends Condorcet, Garat and Andr√© Ch√©nier. But until 1820, Cadet de Vaux continued to present his scientific observations. He reached Franconville in 1778, helping to provide and equip the National Guard of which he was the commander. He declared, \\"I have six brothers to all of us, we lose 60,000 livres from the recent political events, we are no less patriotic and for the return of our property, we would not see the rebirth of the old order of things.\\" In 1780 the police chief Jean-Charles-Pierre Lenoir made Cadet de Vaux the \\"salubrity inspector\\" of Paris. Cadet de Vaux used muriatic acids, combustion of smoke, efficient ventilation and other innovative methods to disinfect insanitary workshops and public places. At the time of the Revolution, Cadet de Vaux still served as Inspector General. As such, he wrote many books, and treatises on \\"mephitis\\". It led to the removal of the Cemetery of Innocents in the heart of Paris. Disappointed by political life, he devoted himself to fighting hunger and his agronomy research. He instigated the first agricultural fair. His essay honoring Jacques Philippe Martin Cels Do we not owe him the first road signs of France? was rejected by the Academy of Sciences.  Family  Father Claude Cadet was born in 1695 at Regnault (currently Renault Dawn Fresnoy), near Troyes, the son of a poor farmer. His medical talent got him admitted to the department of Surgery at H√¥tel-Dieu of Paris. Around this time, scurvy was rampant in Paris. His essay on scurvy cures gained attention. Among his cures was wine. Claude Cadet became personal physician to Louis XIV. He had 13 children, six girls and seven boys. He married Louise-Victoire Delaplace on 4 July 1773. He had known three sons - Benjamin, Charles-Antoine, and Marcellen.

But the commanders were exonerated in March 2013 by a judge of the High Court of Cali.  Trajectory  Isa√≠as Duarte Cancino was born in San Gil, Santander on February 15, 1939, in the home formed by Crisanto Duarte Pilonieta and Elisa Cancino Arenas. He was the youngest of seven siblings. He did his high school in Bucaramanga at Colegio Santander. Then he entered the seminary of Pamplona, Norte de Santander. In Rome, during the Second Session of the Second Vatican Council, he was ordained a priest by Bishop Hector Rueda Hernandez on December 1, 1963.  Returning to Colombia  Incardinated in the Archdiocese of Bucaramanga, he arrived there at the end of 1964. He was the first seminarian in the diocese who had completed his studies in Rome and was now a new presbyter. He was vicar cooperator of the Cathedral of Bucaramanga, professor in the Major Seminary of Pamplona, parish priest of the parish of the Holy Spirit in Bucaramanga, in the Cathedral of the Holy Family of Bucaramanga. Later, in the parish of San Juan de Gir√≥n and in the province of Garc√≠a Rovira in the city of M√°laga, all these places of evangelization knew of his apostolic zeal, of his cherished faith and of his concern to leave works of spiritual and social benefit. Duarte collaborated in the formation of priests as teacher and Spiritual Director, first in Pamplona and then in the nascent Major Seminary of Floridablanca. He also served as spiritual director of the candidates for the priesthood in the Seminary of Bucaramanga and simultaneously as Vicar of Pastoral in the Archdiocese of Bucaramanga. On April 10, 1985, he was named titular bishop of Germania de Numidia and Auxiliary of Bucaramanga and was consecrated on the following June 17. He was the first Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Bucaramanga, whose Ordinary was the then President of the Episcopal Conference, Monsignor H√©ctor Rueda Hern√°ndez. His particular interest in establishing a section of the Pontifical Bolivarian University of Medell√≠n in the Archdiocese of Bucaramanga deserves special mention. This was achieved almost immediately. On June 18, 1988, he was named the first bishop of the Diocese of Apartad√≥, in the department of Antioquia, at a small city tormented by war. On August 19, 1995, Pope John Paul II named him Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cali, replacing Monsignor Pedro Rubiano S√°enz. He took office on the following Saturday, September 23.  Death  Monsignor Isa√≠as Duarte Cancino was a strong critic of Colombian guerrillas such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN), as well as drug trafficking groups and associates, especially after the kidnapping of La Mar√≠a Church by the ELN, which he publicly excommunicated.Britannica¬Æ: Duarte Cancino, Isaias He was killed on 16 March 2002 by two armed men who shot him as he was leaving a religious ceremony (a collective marriage of more than 100 couples in the Buen Pastor church, Aguablanca district) in Cali. Pope John Paul II expressed his sorrow at the murder of the archbishop of Cali and urged Colombians to continue through dialogue and to reject any kind of violence, blackmail and kidnapping. His funeral rites took place on Tuesday, March 19, and were presided over by the Cardinal Pedro Rubiano S√°enz, Archbishop of Bogot√°, in the presence of more than 70 bishops from all over Latin America who traveled to the city of Cali, Colombian President Andr√©s Pastrana and his cabinet, presidential candidates, civil, ecclesiastical and military authorities from Valle del Cauca, and more than 20,000 faithful who accompanied him in Caicedo Square in front of the Cathedral. The authorities were following the lead that the perpetrators of the crime were members of the Norte del Valle cartel. Surprising statements by a man arrested for carrying illegal weapons led prosecutors to suspect the FARC guerrilla. Ten years later, the Second Specialized Criminal Court in Cali convicted the FARC's top leader, alias Timochenko and three other guerrilla commanders, alias 'Efra√≠n Guzm√°n', 'Pablo Catatumbo' and 'Iv√°n M√°rquez', as intellectual authors. However, the High Court of Cali overturned the decision because the witness refused to testify in court on the grounds that the Public Prosecutor's Office had not honoured the agreements it had made with him. Five years later, in March 2017, it became known that the Colombian state had not paid the informant the reward of a billion Colombian pesos. See also * AP / New York Times.

She was born either a deaf-mute or just deaf and mentally challenged and was very sickly. She possibly had a degenerative disease, did not survive her fourth year and died at Windsor.  Birth  Katherine was born early in the morning at Westminster Palace, Westminster, London. She was described as the most beautiful of all Henry's daughters, cites even though it was obvious something was wrong with her. Matthew Paris described her as \\"the most beautiful girl, but dumb and useless\\", although this did not matter to her parents. They adored her for her beauty and delicacy. She was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy, Katherine's maternal granduncle, who also stood as her godfather. She received the name Katherine because she was born on the feast of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. A few days after her christening, on the day of Saint Edward the Confessor's death, 5 January 1254, the King held a massive banquet, to which he invited all the nobility, including Emma le Despencer and her son, John. The provisions for this banquet included \\"fourteen wild boars, twenty-four swans, one hundred and thirty-five rabbits, two hundred and fifty partridges, fifty hares, two hundred and fifty wild ducks, sixteen hundred and fifty fowls, thirty-six female geese and sixty-one thousand eggs\\".  Life  Katherine, who possibly had a degenerative disease, was either a deaf-mute or simply deaf and mentally challenged. In any case, this ruined their parents' hopes of marriage for her and she was never betrothed to anyone. Soon after the banquet, the Queen had to leave England and join her husband in Gascony, leaving the infant Katherine at Windsor Castle. The aforementioned Emma le Despencer was appointed governess and her aides were two wet nurses, Agnes and Avisa. The next year, the King and Queen returned and the King ordered \\"gold clothes, with borders embroidered with the King's coat-of-arms\\", on 2 May 1255 for Katherine.  Death  In the autumn of 1254, Katherine became gravely ill and was sent to Emma le Despencer's house in Swallowfield. She had a few companions of her own age and, for her own amusement, the King sent one of his men into Windsor Great Park to capture a goat, for his daughter to play with. The change seemed to benefit the sickly little princess and she was not brought back, but she had a relapse in late 1256. During this time, three of Katherine's brothers died within a week due to a smallpox outbreak. By the King's command, a report of her condition was sent to him by a special messenger during his expedition to France and when he heard of her convalescence he ordered that a \\"silver image made after the likeness of a woman\\" should be placed in Westminster Abbey as a votive offering, and the bearer of the news was given \\"a good robe\\". Katherine died on , after she was urgently brought back to Windsor Castle.  Burial and legacy  The King presented the nurses with a present equal to ¬£100 of our money. There was a magnificent funeral, which cost ¬£51-12s‚Äì4d. Katherine was buried in the ambulatory in Westminster Abbey, in the space between the chapels of King Edward and St. Benet, close to the tomb of her uncle William de Valence. A splendid monument was raised to her memory by the King, rich with serpentine and mosaics, and surmounted by a silver image of his child, made by the King's goldsmith at the cost of 70 marks (¬£46-13s‚Äì4d). The Hermit of Charing was paid fifty shillings a year as long as he lived, that he might support a chaplain to pray daily at the Chapel of the Hermitage for the soul of Katherine. After the deaths of Katherine and her brothers, both Henry and Eleanor were heartbroken, the Queen becoming sick with grief. They did not have any further children and went on to lose their youngest child Henry later that year.

He was professor of Dogmatic Theology at the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Louvain and author of several works in the field of Theological studies. Biography Born in Brussels to Catholic parents who were open to ideas of plurality, G√©sch√© went to school at the Coll√®ge Saint-Pi√®rre in Uccle. At 18, he enrolled at Saint-Louis University in Brussels where he obtained a degree in Philosophy and Arts two years later. In 1949, after having completed his military service, he decided to take holy orders. He studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical Philology at the Catholic University of Louvain which, from 1951 onwards, became intermingled with his studies in Theology at the Seminary of Malines. Ordained priest in 1955, he continued his studies in Theology at Louvain and finally earned a doctorate and was conferred the title of \\"ma√Ætre-agr√©g√©\\" in Theology (1962). He then took up a career in teaching, first at the Seminary of Malines (1962-1969), and then at the Catholic University of Louvain where he was elected a full professor in 1969. He was the founding member of the managing committee of the Revue th√©ologique de Louvain (1970). The figure of this emeritus professor remains as one of the most influential ones of the Theology faculty of Louvain-la-Neuve, marked by his supervision of generations of students from Europe, America, and Africa. Aware of the position of Christianity in the modern world and the negative connotation of professing faith in God, he chose to dedicate his entire career in formulating and in helping to understand the rapport between faith and contemporary culture in the best possible terms. His most significant writings encompassing a wide array of subjects were put together for the most part in the collection Dieu pour penser. The biannual symposium (\\"Colloque G√©sch√©\\") which he instituted, from 1991 onwards in Louvain-la-Neuve in collaboration with Paul Scolas, aims to create a space for dialogue between Theology and other domains. Recipient of many awards and prizes, he served on the commission \\"Religion and Theology\\" for the National Fund for Scientific Research (Belgium) and in the European Association for Catholic Theology (T√ºbingen). In 1992, he was appointed by the Holy See to the International Theological Commission (1992-2002). In 1993, he was awarded the Prix du Cardinal Mercier by the Institut Sup√©rieur de Philosophie. In 1997, he received the Scriptores christiani award for the ensemble of his works, and in the following year, the Grand prix de philosophie from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in Paris. He was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium and received the honorary title of the Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown. On the occasion of his 75th birthday, he said: \\"God has been my passion. I could not put it otherwise.\\" Not as an intellectual cut off from his society, but with a deep pastoral concern he always tried to engage in an active and profound way into the concerns and preoccupations of the men and women of our society, both believers and non- believers. This is what constitutes the intellectual legacy that he has left behind. He is buried in the Cemetery of Blocry in Ottignies, not far from Louvain-la-Neuve.

To join the church, members had to sign a pledge that committed them to a vegetarian diet and abstention from alcohol. Followers of Cowherd's ideas were commonly known as Bible Christians or \\"Cowherdites.\\" Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society founded in 1847.; Gregory, James (2007) Of Victorians and Vegetarians. London: I. B. Tauris pp. 30‚Äì35. Bible Christians put great emphasis on independence of mind and freedom of belief, stating that they did not presume \\"to exercise any dominion over the faith or conscience of men.\\" They believed in free will and had a Pelagian approach. They argued that religion when properly understood reveals the same truth to all men. There was no emphasis on original sin or conversion. Man was not saved by faith alone but by his actions and the value of his life as a whole. Vegetarianism formed part of this belief. Salford and Manchester Bible Christians William Cowherd founded the Bible Christian Church following a split from the Swedenborgians. Their first chapel was known as Christ Church and located in King Street, Salford, Greater Manchester. The church later moved to new premises in Cross Lane. Further chapels were also established in Hulme and Every Street, Ancoats. One distinctive feature of the Bible Christians was a belief in a meat-free \\"vegetable diet\\", known today as ovo-lacto vegetarianism, as a form of temperance. In 1816, William Cowherd died and Joseph Brotherton was appointed his successor. Brotherton held the position for 40 years until his death in 1857. By 1930, unable to attract enough vegetarian members, the English Bible Christians merged into the Pendleton Unitarians. Philadelphia Bible Christians The church's message was later preached in the United States, as about 40 members under the leadership of the Reverend William Metcalfe and the Reverend James Clark crossed the Atlantic in 1817 and formed the Philadelphia Bible Christian Church. These members subsequently provided a nucleus for the American vegetarian movement. References Further reading * William E.A.

According to Istv√°n Hont, his Political Essay upon Commerce was the most widely available defense of in France in the early 18th century. Writings Melon was a close associate of John Law. Melon sought to adapt Colbertiste ideas with the views of English mercantilist economists. Melon followed John Law on monetary theory and defended paper currency. Melon was a contemporary of Montesquieu, and belonged to the same Bordeaux coterie. His Political Essay upon Commerce followed Montesquieu's argument in Considerations on the Causes of the Grandeur and Decadence of the Romans and Universal Monarchy. Melon and Montesquieu defended luxury against those who believed that decadence had been the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, and who suggested parallels with the policies of Jean-Baptiste Colbert and Louis XIV. In a novel evoking Montesquieu's Persian Letters, Melon presented a parable of military and peaceful means by which a country might achieve national greatness through the example of an Afghan ruler who conquered Persia and the Punjab. Political Essay upon Commerce In his Political Essay upon Commerce, Melon argued that states follow either a \\"spirit of conquest\\" or a \\"spirit of preservation\\". To provide a modern illustration of this distinction, Melon proposed three models of commercial policy. He used these models to demonstrate that war against a country with a commercial monopoly was just‚Äîsignificant for the reason that England was regarded as a commercial monopolist in France in this period, and that a country with a commercial monopoly in food would defeat a country without such a monopoly. Melon did not desire a monopolistic empire for France, however, and preferred that countries become self-sufficient in food. Instead, Melon proposed that France seek a commercial monopoly and establish hegemony over Europe. Melon's political economy was founded on a three-stages theory, in which basic necessities were followed by manufactured goods, which were in turn followed by luxuries. Progression from necessities to luxuries was only possible with a surplus in goods of each kind. Like the physiocrats, Melon believed that agriculture was the foundation of a nation's economy, but believed that manufactured goods were the source of a nation's greatness. Melon argued in favour of free trade in grain and inflationary monetary policies to improve France's balance of trade. Melon presented arguments against those who opposed luxury, which they associated with decadence and the decay of civic virtue‚Äîa view popularised by the writings of Fran√ßois F√©nelon‚Äîadvocated sumptuary laws to correct the French balance of trade. For Melon, luxury was a promoter of trade, and represented a \\"spur for the multitude\\" present in every \\"well-governed society\\". Melon popularised Bernard Mandeville's defense of luxury in The Fable of the Bees in France.

Levet worked in the French consular service in his late twenties, but in his early twenties he was only a couple of years older than the more famous poet Leon- Paul Fargue, and they knew each other as young men in the caf√© scene in Paris. Fargue related that Levet loved maps, compasses, and wore beautifully cut English-style suits. He was always willing to help out those with less money. In order to indulge his eagerness to travel, Levet joined the consular service and served in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and finally in Argentina. He sent his charming verses home to be published in popular journals. In the introduction to the French edition of Levet‚Äôs Po√®mes (Maison des Amis des Livres, Paris, 1921; Gallimard 2000), the great French poet Valery Larbaud relates that he read and memorized Levet‚Äôs verses, and hoped to meet him when he came back to France on leave. Levet came home sooner than expected with a disease that left him unable to speak. He tried to recuperate on the Riviera, but his strength left him and he died soon after. Fargue and Larbaud made a literary pilgrimage to Levet‚Äôs parents‚Äô home in Montbrison (a small city between Italy and Nice), some five years after Levet‚Äôs demise. Larbaud commented that if one is too late to meet someone, one can be met instead by a pale featureless head on blind white stone. Nevertheless, he felt that something of Levet remained in his parents‚Äô house, especially in the room set aside for memorabilia. There were photographs from Maharajas with dedications in English, and a flag from a nearly unknown country. Fargue and Larbaud considered Levet to be the next important link in the chain of modernism that runs from Walt Whitman to Arthur Rimbaud to Jules Laforgue. Larbaud wrote, ‚ÄòI dreamed of a poet, a fantasist, sensitive to the diversity of race, peoples, countries, for whom everything or nothing would be exotic (it amounts to the same thing), very ‚Äòinternational,‚Äô a humorist, capable of doing Whitman tongue-in-cheek, giving a comic note of joyous irresponsibility, which was lacking in Whitman. At bottom, I was looking for a successor to Laforgue, Rimbaud, and Whitman. And here I seem to have found him ... Henry J.-M. Levet.‚Äô Globe-trotting cosmopolitan poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Paul Morand, or so says the Larousse Dictionary of Contemporary Poetry, ‚Äòcannot hide what they owe him.‚Äô Even the surrealists, particularly Philippe Soupault and Paul Eluard, seem to have taken a cue from Levet. Levet wrote a novel called The Benares Express, but it was withheld from publication by his parents, and is now presumably lost, aside from a few mentions in the letters and writings of the period. Other than that novel, what is all the more astonishing about Levet‚Äôs influence is that, aside from a few garbled pages of juvenilia along symbolist lines, Levet‚Äôs mature work amounts to 11 pages. Those 11 pages, known as ‚ÄòCartes Postales‚Äô, or ‚ÄòPostcards‚Äô, were all published here in Jacket 18 magazine for the first time in English in their entirety by Kirby Olson. They are in the same order that they were originally published by Maison des Amis des Livres in 1921.

In addition to his classes, he gave many conferences throughout Europe, the United States and Latin America . Influenced not only by Freud but also by Ludwig Binswanger and by the Greek and German philosophies, Jacques Schotte continued the work of L√©opold Szondi, whose genetic approach has given way to the instinctual approach. On the basis of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, Binswanger's Daseinsanalyse and Szondi's fate analysis, he has developed a new approach to the mentally ill man, he called \\"pathoanalysis. He imagined the development of an autological psychiatry, refocused on its proper human foundations: The anthropopsychiatry. Far from being only an outstanding theoretician, he always wanted to anchor his work in practical clinical experience, made of human encounters, in all their complexity and richness. In his book, Un parcours (A journey), published in June 2006, he recounts his life as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. He met all the greatest figures of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in the second half of the twentieth century. He was a close friend of the philosopher of art, Henri Maldiney, and of the Swiss psychiatrist, Roland Kuhn. He was very close to Jacques Lacan too and attended his Seminars. He is also the one who introduced the theory of mediation in Belgium, creating lasting relationships between the Catholic University of Louvain and Rennes 2 University.

Biography  Michelangelo Ricci was born on 30 January 1619 in Rome, then capital of the Papal States, to a family of low social standing that originated in Bergamo. He studied theology and law in Rome, where he was a contemporary of Ren√©-Fran√ßois de Sluse. He also studied mathematics under Benedetto Castelli who himself had been a student of Galileo Galilei. He was a friend of Evangelista Torricelli, kept close links with contemporary scientific culture, and played an important role in the development of the Galilean school. Like de Sluze, he spent his entire career in the Roman Catholic Church and served the pope in various roles on several occasions. A trained theologian, he acted as consultant to various Congregations of the Roman Curia. Having suffered from epilepsy since his birth, he was (according to canon law of the time) disqualified from ordination. Nonetheless, he was created a Cardinal-Deacon in the Consistory of 1 September 1681 by Pope Innocent XI, with the title 'Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Aquiro'. His position in the church was very useful for protecting his friends and fellow scientists in their controversies with the opposing scholastic school. He played a significant part in the theoretical debates and experiments that led up to Torricelli's discovery of atmospheric pressure and invention of the mercury barometer. In particular he followed the experiments in this field by Gasparo Berti, in Rome. There is an unpublished manuscript by Ricci, devoted to algebra, in the library of the Mathematical Institute of Genoa. It shows that by 1640 he was familiar with the 'New Algebra' of Fran√ßois Vi√®te. In this book he provides a critique of the solutions given by the geometer Marino Ghetaldi of Ragusa in his De Resolutione et Compositione Matematica to the problems posed by Apollonius of Perga.Ronald Calinger : Vita mathematica: historical research and integration with teaching His published mathematical work is summarised in a treatise of nineteen pages, Exercitatio geometrica, de maximis et minimis (1666) in which he studies the maxima of functions of the form x^m(a - x)^n and tangents to curves with equation y^m = kx^n, using methods that are an early form of induction. This treatise was much admired by his contemporaries and has recently been republished as an appendix to Mercator's 'Logarithmo-Technia' (1688). He also studied spirals (1644) and cycloids (1674) and recognised that the study of tangents and the calculation of areas are reciprocal operations. Ricci is also known for his correspondence with Torricelli, Vincenzo Viviani, Rene de Sluze and Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, founder of the Accademia del Cimento. These letters give his thoughts on paraboloids and hyperboloids when cut by parallel planes, on the surface of a ring, and on the properties of the vacuum. It was Ricci who welcomed Marin Mersenne, when he came to Italy to present the work of Ren√© Descartes. In optics he studied the magnifying effect of lenses. With Giovanni Battista Baliani he discussed the Galilean revolution. Ricci was also a close associate of Antonio Nardi, another mathematician in Rome. He collaborated with Nardi on his Scene, an unpublished manuscript that circulated among Torricelli and others, in which Ricci included some of the material that would later appear in his 1666 Geometrica Exercitatio. Following the death of Torricelli and the disappearance of Bonaventura Cavalieri, he was requested to collate and publish his correspondence with these two men. However he declined the invitation, leading to Torricelli's work being forgotten for some time. He endeavored to defend Francesco Redi against Cardinal Leopold when Redi published his Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degl'Insetti, arguing against the spontaneous generation of insects. Ricci was also the backer of Abbot Francisco Nazzari in the publication of the first review of Italian literature, the Giornale de' Letterati (1668-1683). He died in Rome, age 63, on 12 May 1682.

Over the span of his career, he published a variety of works, including ‚Äúa fantastic profusion of novels, short stories, essays, plays, poems and erotica of a particularly distinguished vulgarity that created genuine excitement in the most blase connoisseur‚Äù.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-louis- calaferte-1433763.html This writing style resulted in a variety of literary prizes, including the Prix de l‚ÄôAcademie Fran√ßaise for Ebauche d‚Äôun autoportrait in 1983; for a collection of poems, Londoniennes in 1985; and for a collection of short stories, Promenades dans un parc in 1987. Calaferte died in Dijon, France on 2 May 1994.  Early life  In his early teens, Calaferte worked as an errand boy in a battery factory and later began work as a general laborer. During this time, he enjoyed reading books; subsequently, in 1947 he moved to Paris, where he got a job at Od√©on - Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe (formerly the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôOd√©on) as a theatre extra. It was then and there that he wrote his first plays. One of them was performed at a preview performance at Th√©√¢tre d'Angers, earning him a standing ovation at the age of twenty.  Career  With the support of his ‚Äúliterary hero‚Äù Joseph Kessel, he had Requiem des innocents published by √âditions Julliard in 1952. This work was a culmination of childhood memories in which Calaferte‚Äôs rebellious writing style began to emerge. This first book had great success and was soon followed by the publication of Partage des vivants (The Lot of the Living) in 1953. These two youthful works would be severely criticized by the author twenty five years later.Le spectateur immobile, 1 November 1978, Carnets 1978-1979, published in 1990, p. 147 He is quoted as saying : ‚ÄúIf I had to name two of my books that I loathe, it would be the first two; I would gladly see them disappear‚Äù. In 1956, he moved to Mornant in the Monts du Lyonnais, where he wrote Septentrion, a work accused of being pornographic, and which was consequently censored and banned from being sold. It was reprinted only twenty years later, on the initiative of G√©rard Bourgadier at √âditions Deno√´l, a French publishing house. In this largely autobiographical and erotic novel, Calaferte uses first-person narrative to recount the wanderings of a novice writer, his time spent secretly reading while working as a laborer (as a child, the protagonist would hide in public toilets, reading there very happily),http://nplusonemag.com/french-sex-nove and his encounters with women. The most important female figure in the novel is without a doubt Nora, a Dutch woman who represents female emancipation and social success. Calaferte continued to regularly publish collections of poems and stories of an intimate and sensual nature; some of these were dreamlike and strange, and they were often linked to childhood. His plays explored the theme of family relations, using both a humorous and troubling tone. According to director Patrick Pelloquet, ‚Äú Louis Calaferte‚Äôs characters are more of a stereotype for certain behavior than characters in the strictest sense of the word‚Äù.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9zejr_entretien-avec-patrick- pelloquet-au_creation Until 1974, Calaferte worked for a Lyon radio station and at ORTF (Office de Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise). He spent the last years of his life near Dijon, in the village of Blaisy-Bas with his wife.http://www.bienpublic.com/region-dijonnaise/2011/11/08/pour-que-la- memoire-de-louis-calaferte-perdure Among his friends, he was closest to writer Georges Pirou√©http://editionshesse.com/?page_id=33&category;=22 and theatre director Jean-Pierre Miquel.http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/mon-ami- calaferte_613780.html Miquel described Calaferte‚Äôs work as ‚Äúhonest, harsh and capable of crazy rhetoric, [while] never straying away from the psychological reality of its characters.‚Äù He added that it was ‚Äúa well-rounded work - perfect, precise, deeply moving and amusing.‚Äù Miquel said his friend Calaferte was a private and friendly person, someone who always spoke his mind and whose work was distinguished by its harshness. Calaferte‚Äôs notebooks also present his audience with another aspect of the author‚Äôs artistic personality, demonstrating his passion for painting and his literary inspiration, which derives from the works of numerous established thinkers, including Paul L√©autaud and Franz Kafka. Despite being often overlooked by his peers,http://horizonovipare.blogspot.ca/2011/04/louis-calaferte.html Louis Calaferte produced powerful and personal works. Among them was The Way It Works with Women (1992) (La m√©chanique des femmes), an unclassifiable short novelhttp://www.ccenghien.com/2013/02/09/la-m%C3%A9canique-des-femmes/ he published two years before his death, which was adapted for the screen in 2000 by J√©r√¥me de Missolz ; however, it did not experience great success.http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=19617.html Calaferte reflected on his life as an author, saying: > ‚ÄúFor having written so much between the ages of thirteen and twenty, having > presented two plays in Paris, and having my first book published at age of > twenty-two, I deem myself to be talented beyond my years...The development > of my thoughts and my ability to understand only flourished as I gradually > matured over the years.‚Äù Over the course of his career, Calaferte produced hundreds of works, mainly poetry and short story collections, as well as plays and notebooks. Louis Calaferte died on 2 May 1994 in Dijon, France. His wife, Guillemette, has proposed to the municipality her willingness to donate Calaferte‚Äôs work to the city, provided that there is a place dedicated to him. She has continued to publish the previously unseen volumes of his notebooks.

Born at Montevarchi, he studied at Florence, and, having taken his vows, moved to Rome, following Cardinal Sacchetti. In 1636, he began to work at the Vatican Library. A pupil of Castelli in Rome, in 1638 he was Castelli's tip to Galileo as the candidate for the chair of Mathematics at Pisa. Well at home in the scientific community in the Papal city, Magiotti actively participated in Roman scientific debates, on which he provided detailed information to Galileo, with whom he was often in touch. During his life, Magiotti published only one work, entitled Renitenza dell‚Äôacqua alla compressione (Water's Resistance to Compression), which came out in 1648. The text was the first report of the practical resistance to compression - which Magiotti mistakenly claimed to be absolute - of water at constant temperature, as well as the expansion and contraction of fluid media (water and air) subjected to changes in temperature. In addition to descriptions of various thermometers, the work also presents an illustration of the bell-jar divers, or \\"Cartesian devils\\", the discovery of which would then be attributed to the Tuscan scientist. Magiotti played a role in the context of experimentation which preceded, and to a large extent, prepared the way, for the torricellian barometric experiments. He assisted - giving full descriptions in various letters - in the syphon experiments performed by Gasparo Berti around 1640. In a letter to Mersenne from 1648, he recalled that happy experimental period, and revealed that he had told Torricelli about the tests performed by Berti. He also suggested the use of sea-water, which is more dense than fresh water, thus making possible the decisive choice of mercury in barometric experiments. He died of the plague in 1656.

Portrayed by Kristolyn Lloyd, the character was introduced by head writer Bradley Bell on October 7, 2010. Lloyd played the character as a recurring guest role for a short period of time, until she was promoted to contract status and became a series regular. Dayzee was initially a poor young woman, working and living on the streets of Skid Row, Los Angeles. She soon started a friendship with the show's matriarch Stephanie Forrester, who was diagnosed with lung cancer at the time. Dayzee gave her the incentive she needed to undergo treatment, and she survived. Bell was highly involved in the making of the character and the Skid Row storyline, and Lloyd had a background knowledge of it because of her charity work in Los Angeles and overseas. Dayzee was introduced to give everyone a new take on the world and a \\"new set of glasses\\". Since then, Dayzee has used her newfound power in the Forrester family to become an advocate for poverty with the help of Stephanie. She has also had romances with Thomas and Marcus Forrester, to whom she was later married. The Skid Row storyline which Dayzee was an integral part of garnered positive reviews. Akash Nikolas of Zap2it noted that while she was involved with Thomas, his sister Steffy Forrester highly disapproved of Dayzee because of her background, and said that the show was \\"playing around\\" with the race issue. Casting Actress Kristolyn Lloyd first appeared in the role of Dayzee Leigh on October 7, 2010. Previously, Lloyd worked primarily on stage productions, such as the musicals Romeo and Juliet and As You Like It. She most recently had parts in the high-production musicals Rent and Hairspray, while also making an appearance in the medical drama series ER. The show's head writer and executive producer, Bradley Bell was in attendance during Lloyd's audition for the series. She said, \\"Brad is so hands-on with this storyline. During my audition, I didn‚Äôt even know Brad was the executive producer because they rarely show up at auditions, but that‚Äôs how involved he is.\\" On October 28, 2010, it was announced by the show's head writer and executive, Bradley Bell that she was moved from recurring to a contract status. Of Lloyd being a regular cast member, Bell stated: \\"Kristolyn is a gifted young actress and I‚Äôm happy to have her as a permanent member of the B&B; family. As we moved forward in telling the story of the plight of the homeless, I realized that the character of ‚ÄòDayzee‚Äô had so much more to offer and needed to stick around to make sure that everyone kept their ‚Äònew set of glasses‚Äô on.\\"  Development  Susan Flannery played corporate executive Stephanie, whom Dayzee influenced to get treatment for her cancer. Characterization In September 2010, the show's control-freak matriarch Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery) was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Initially, she refused to have treatment. Dayzee was introduced to show her a new lease on life. She became the key person who encouraged Stephanie to undergo treatment, which had ultimately saved her life. The show's official website describes Dayzee as: \\"Once a resident of Los Angeles‚Äô most impoverished neighborhood of Skid Row, Dayzee still serves as a guardian angel to the community she once called home.\\" Romantically and optimistically, Dayzee can be flirtatious and allows everyone she comes across to view the world with \\"a new set of glasses\\". In October 19, 2011, it was announced that Gina Rodriguez would join the show as an unprivileged friend of Dayzee's, Beverly. Beverly is the first non-core character whom Dayzee has interacted with on the show. On November 11, 2011 a special episode dedicated to war veterans aired. Dayzee honored them at her coffee shop. Dayzee has stood by Stephanie since the start of their friendship. Even when Stephanie schemed to break up Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Ridge Forrester (Ron Moss), Dayzee pushed her to do the right thing. They are considered friends for life. Although Stephanie survived, in October 2012 the cancer came back, and she died on November 26, 2012. Skid Row storyline The character was introduced to bring awareness for the homeless situation and people living in Skid row. Lloyd said: \\"I offered my insight more than research.\\" On how he came up with it, Bradley Bell said: \\"Every day I drive into work, and I see all these homeless people who may have mental health issues like ADHD etc.\\" Additionally, he said: \\"It feels like the show is where I want it to be. We‚Äôre bringing in a lot of reality to the show along with romance and some fantasy.\\" Real homeless people were brought in to shoot scenes. Lloyd said that: \\"Brad is so hands-on with this storyline\\", having shown up to her audition, which not many producers do. She stated that she had experience with homeless people: \\"Another reason why this is great is because after I did missionary work in Indonesia last year, it led me to doing some work on Skid Row every Saturday.\\"Lloyd noted that the character was completely different prior to her audition; but after seeing her, Bell based Dayzee around her. The hardships of skid row is first introduced when Stephanie meets Dayzee there. In one episode, she states: \\"This is my town I live 20 minutes away yet it seems 1,000 miles away. I promised I'd make a difference, yet when I see them I turn away. What is my burden compared to theirs?\\" In another episode, Flannery did unscripted interviews with homeless people while still as Stephanie. The storyline raised awareness; Flannery stated the Union Rescue Mission website following the episodes. According to Christina Hoag of the Omaha World-Herald: \\"Skid Row residents involved in the production said they were pleased they were portrayed with dignity, as people getting their lives together instead of being down and out, and that the show has continued relationships with them.\\" Community activist General Jeff said that the show had organized for the real homeless people to be cared for. He praised the show, stating: \\"They weren't just pushing their fluff story, they're adding the human element,\\" he said. \\"It's great for our community to be respected as individual human beings, not like we're homeless and hopeless.\\" During an interview with TV Guide's Michael Logan, Bell noted that several people featured in the storyline had been in jail and addicted to drugs. After the awareness plot was slowly coming to a close, Bell said that Stephanie's friendship with Dayzee would continue, as would her outreach to the mission and the people of Skid Row. Relationships Dayzee's first major love interest was Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory). Although she was a poor black girl, he was a rich white guy. The relationship is approved by all, except for Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) Thomas' sister. According to Akash Nikolas of Zap2it, the show was \\"dancing around the race issue.\\" Steffy thought that Dayzee wasn't beautiful, educated or sophisticated enough for her brother. Nikolas called the show out for not going further into the race issue, and accused the writers of playing with it, but not addressing it fully. He wrote: \\"no one else calls Steffy on it or even suggests that race might be the issue, which is even more absurd The show wants you to get it (wink wink) without actually acknowledging race and racism.\\" It was unknown if Thomas actually had feelings for Dayzee, or if he was using her to get over his step-mother, Brooke, to whom he was previously attracted to. Jillian Bowe of Zap2It commented that she liked the romance between Thomas and Dayzee: \\"Not for nothing, but I am enjoying Thomas going after Dayzee. It did come out of nowhere, but I'd like to see it grow into something more.\\" Bowe also discussed the race issue: \\"Maybe viewers can discover it is just more than Dayzee's social status that Steffy hates. Just sayin.\\" The couple split up. Soon, Dayzee is in love with Marcus Forrester (Texas Battle); they had previously flirted before she had a relationship with Thomas, after feeling an \\"Instant connection.\\" This was evident onscreen. In July 2012, Dayzee and Marcus were married at the Forrester mansion in Bel Air. Stephanie and Eric invited the media, family and friends to the event. Tommy Garret of Highlight Hollywood noted how far both character have come, writing: \\"Dayzee‚Äôs life is different now, since her days on the streets of skidrow in Los Angeles, the beautiful young lady is now a WeHo based business owner, and Marcus is adopted into the famed Forrester family.\\" Storylines Backstory Skid Row, Los Angeles; this is where Dayzee's story began. Dayzee has lived in Los Angeles her entire life, despite not experiencing the rich or lavish side the Forrester Family have been in. Dayzee's mother suffered a drug addiction and practically lived in rehab, and she is now dead. Dayzee had an extremely rough childhood and teenage years. She lived without good nutrition for large amounts of time while living on the street. 2010‚Äì13 Dayzee was introduced when she had found Stephanie's expensive scarf which had flown off, but refused to give it back. Stephanie snapped at her, so Dayzee threatened to hurt her with a broken bottle. After calming down, Stephanie saw that the scarf was needed to nurture an infant child at the homeless skid row. Dayzee was temporarily looking after the baby because her mother was in rehab. Although bitter at first, she began telling Stephanie about the life on the other side of Los Angeles. Stephanie was deeply touched, and shared with Dayzee the news about her lung cancer. They become friends, and Dayzee encouraged Stephanie to have treatment. Stephanie, inspired to do something with her life by helping heal poverty, fought her cancer and recovered. She gave Dayzee the pool house on the Forrester property to live in. She met several local pillars and socialites of the community. With financial support from the Forresters, she began advocating for people still suffering on skid row. She became an apprentice at skid row's Union Rescue Mission and donated large amounts of money. Stephanie, also, became highly involved in Dayzee's humanitarian projects. Stephanie bought C.J. Garrison's (Mick Cain) Insomnia, a coffee shop, and gave it to Dayzee as a gesture of friendship. Dayzee had a huge opening of the revamped store and hired several homeless people from the streets to work for her. At the same time, she developed a romance with Thomas, Stephanie's grandson. His sister, Steffy did not like Dayzee because of where she came from. The relationship ended after his part in Stephanie's orchestration of breaking up Ridge and Brooke so he could be reunited with Thomas' mother Dr. Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). Disgusted, she dumped Thomas. She then began romancing Marcus, the Forrester's adopted son. Marcus had a child with Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) as a result of a one night stand. Amber tried to break up Dayzee and Marcus, but eventually gave up. Marcus proposed to Dayzee and they were married months later. Happy with Marcus, Dayzee focuses on her coffeehouse and hires an aspiring actress named Maya to work there and lets her rent out the apartment above the coffeehouse. Rick, who starts volunteering there, meets Maya and feels a strong connection with her. Dayzee, out of concern for Maya, as well as Rick's girlfriend Caroline Spencer try to keep the two apart but to no avail. Dayzee, meanwhile, starts to get annoyed with Caroline because of her constant complaining about Rick and Maya. She later moves to Africa with Marcus. Reception The Skid Row storyline which Dayzee was an integral part of was extremely well received by critics, and it earned the show a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. Christina Hoag of the Omaha World- Herald noted it as a departure for a show which revolves: \\"around a plush Beverly Hills mansion where characters who look like magazine models manipulate and machinate for love and money.\\" Dayzee hired homeless people from Skid Row to work at her caf√©; Hoag praised the storyline for its real- world impact. She reported that viewers had \\"flooded\\" the show's official facebook page with comments of support, and the show received over 800 emails including donations of $5 an upwards. Michael Logan of TV Guide called it: \\"pretty damn remarkable that The Bold and the Beautiful went down to L.A.'s Skid Row and hired some 25 real-life homeless people to tell their life stories on camera.\\" Lloyd received a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series nomination of her portrayal of Dayzee.

Originating from a tropical disturbance over the Philippine Sea on August 19, Iris tracked west-northwestward towards Luzon. Quickly developing into a typhoon by August 21, a northwestward turn kept the center of Iris offshore Luzon. On August 22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a barometric pressure of 966 mbar (hPa; 28.53 inHg). Subsequently, Iris weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall near Kao-Chi, China. Once onshore, the storm rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated on August 23\\\\. In the Philippines, rough seas associated with the typhoon caused multiple shipwrecks that killed at least 100 people. Across southeastern China, at least 720 people are known to have been killed by the storm; however, estimates range as high as 2,334. Meteorological history In mid-August, a tropical disturbance developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the Philippine Sea. By August 19, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as a tropical depression. Additionally, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical storm. Initially, a strong ridge over Southeast Asia caused the storm to track slowly west-northwestward; however, the ridge gradually weakened over the following days. The cyclone gradually strengthened to typhoon status on August 21, by which time it had developed a 32 km (20 mi) wide eye. Upon becoming a typhoon, the JTWC named the system Iris. Later that day, Iris turned northwestward as the ridge weakened and brushed the northeastern tip of Luzon. On August 22, Iris attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Later that day, United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and recorded a barometric pressure of 966 mbar (hPa; 28.53 inHg), the lowest in relation to the storm. After passing roughly 75 km (45 mi) south of Taiwan, known as Formosa at the time, Iris started weakening. Late on August 22, Iris made landfall near Kao- Chi, China as a strong tropical storm. The storm then rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over China before dissipating late on August 23. Impact On August 21, Typhoon Iris brushed the northern coast of Luzon; however, there were no known reports of casualties or damage on land. Offshore, large swells produced by the storm were blamed on at least two shipwrecks. Following the incidents, the United States Seventh Fleet were sent to search for survivors. Near Palawan Island, at least 100 people drowned after a ferry sank; only 11 passengers were rescued. Five more people went missing near Quezon Province after their motorboat capsized. Heavy rains from the typhoon spread across Taiwan on August 22, triggering significant flash flooding. Along the Haifenglun River, a railroad bridge was washed away. Across the Pescadore Islands, approximately 1,000 people were left homeless. Across Fujian Province, torrential rains from the typhoon led to catastrophic flooding that killed at least 720 people, injured 618 and left 996 others missing; however, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the death toll may be as high as 2,334.

Taxonomy The French botanist Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines described the bonaree in 1818 as Heterodendrum oleifolium, and it was reclassified in the genus Alectryon in 1987. The species name is derived from the resemblance of its leaves to those of an olive tree. It is known by a variety of common names, including western rosewood, inland rosewood, bullock bush, cattle bush, jiggo, boonery, boneree, bush minga, applebush, and red heart. Three subspecies are recognised: subspecies elongatus is a taller plant with greener longer leaves found in more easterly parts of western New South Wales. It grows on heavier soils. Subspecies canescens has greyer foliage and is found on limestone-sand soils and is more prone to suckering. Subspecies oleifolius is found in the more northern parts of Western Australia. Alectryon oleifolius foliage Description Alectryon oleifolius grows as a large shrub to medium-size tree to 9 m (30 ft) high, with drooping branches. The trunk has deeply furrowed grey to brown bark. The stiff long narrow leaves are greyish green and measure 3.5‚Äì14 cm long and 0.6‚Äì1.2 mm wide. Distribution and habitat The range is across all states of inland Australia. In New South Wales it is found throughout the dryer parts of interior and west of the state, most commonly on sandy soils with limestone associated with belah (Casuarina cristata). Ecology and toxicity Alectryon oleifolius sheds leaves, more commonly over the summer months. Although palatable and formerly lopped for drought fodder, Alectryon oleifolius is toxic to livestock (particularly ruminants), as it contains cyanogenic glycosides which are converted to hydrogen cyanide when digested. Poisoning is much more likely to occur with starving stock, and when new growth is consumed. At other times, the foliage has been eaten without ill-effects. Some populations of Alectryon oleifolius reproduce by suckering, forming small stands of clonal plants.

He wrote numerous works on the subjects of Rock music, the 1960s, and the Beat literary movement in the United States. Dister worked for the French magazines Rock & Folk and Connaissance des arts. He was a chronicler of the emerging Rock scene in America who wrote articles and books, and published photographs of musicians and groups such as Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Cure, Johnny Hallyday, and Grateful Dead. Career Alain Dister was born in Lyon on 25 December 1941. He was among the first European photographers to join the Haight Ashbury scene in San Francisco in the mid-1960s (sexual liberation, drugs, psychedelic music, etc.) and chronicled the Summer of Love. He lived with key Beat Generation authors and artists, including Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso, the subject of his book La Beat Generation: La r√©volution hallucin√©e (1997). In Oh, hippie days! (2001), he wrote about the American counter-culture at the end of the 1960s. Maintaining an interest in popular culture, he followed the emerging Punk scene in Japan in the 1990s. As a photographer, Dister was best known for his photographs of the world of Rock and Roll in the United States in the 1960s. In the summer of 1966, he lived in New York for a while and was a regular at the Caf√© Wha? when Jimi Hendrix was playing there with his band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. After publishing his first article in issue #4 of Rock & Folk, Dister was sent to London in February 1977 by the head of Atlantic Records' French subsidiary, to interview Hendrix and take photographs. When Hendrix traveled to Paris the following month to promote his first singles, Barclay Records appointed Dister to act as facilitator and take photographs, which would later feature on the covers of the French & Benelux releases of \\"Hey Joe\\" / \\"Stone Free\\", \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" / \\"Highway Chile\\", and the album Electric Ladyland. Dister's photographic work has been exhibited in various museums and galleries around the world. He was a promoter of French culture and an art critic for the journal Connaissance des arts. His view of the attitudes and aesthetics of Rock, of Punk, and of other genres ignored by academics (especially in France) made him a witness of the counter-culture in America. He resided and worked in Paris and Burgundy, and died after a long illness on 2 July 2008.

His colleague in office was the future dictator Sulla. Biography The son of the Quintus Pompeius who was Plebeian Tribune in 132 BC, Rufus was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 99 BC. He, alongside Marcus Porcius Cato Salonianus, put forward a bill to recall Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus from exile, but it was vetoed by Publius Furius. In 91 BC, Pompeius was elected Praetor urbanus, followed by his election as consul in 88 BC, alongside Lucius Cornelius Sulla. The outbreak of the First Mithridatic War during their consulship saw the command of the war given to Sulla. This was opposed by the former consul and general Gaius Marius, who had a tribune of the Plebs, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, firstly bring forward a law which would enrol the Italian allies who had just received Roman citizenship across all of the Roman tribes, thereby giving Marius a large enough body of voters to pass a law to strip Sulla of his command. This was opposed by Pompeius and Sulla who declared a Justitium, during which no laws could be passed. During the riots which followed, Sulla fled, Pompeius‚Äôs son was killed, and the consuls were forced to withdraw the Justitium. The people then passed the law which stripped Sulla of his command. Pompeius continued his attempts to support Sulla in Rome; however, Publius Sulpicius then had Pompeius stripped of his consulship, forcing him to flee to Nola, where Pompeius met up with Sulla and his army. Pompeius accompanied Sulla on his march on Rome, and gave him his complete support in his actions against Sulpicius and the occupation of Rome. Together, the consuls passed a series of laws, including the exile of Marius and his supporters, a limiting of some of the powers of the tribunes, the expansion of the senate by adding some 300 additional senators, and the provision that all laws were to be reviewed by the Senate before being submitted to an assembly of the people. Most important of all was the provision that laws could now only be carried in the Centuriate Assembly. Sulla was soon put back in charge of the war against Mithridates, leaving Pompeius in charge of Italy. The Senate then gave Pompeius the proconsular command of the ongoing Social War, with specific instructions to take over the armies of Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, who was still in charge of the theatre of war against the Marsi tribe. Unwilling to give over his command, he incited a mutiny during which Pompeius Rufus was killed. Pompeius had at least one child, his son Quintus Pompeius Rufus, who married Sulla‚Äôs first daughter Cornelia Sulla. Pompeius was the brother of the tribune Aulus Pompeius. He appears to be the first in his family to bear the cognomen Rufus. However, the origins of him gaining this cognomen are unknown - although it may simply be that he was red-haired. Cicero states that Pompeius was among the orators he had heard in his youth. Pompeius also possibly held the position of Decemviri Sacris Faciundis until his death. Fiction Pompeius is a character in the Colleen McCullough novel The Grass Crown. In it, Pompeius is murdered after Sulla writes to Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, asking Strabo to have Pompeius killed, as Pompeius was unhappy with Sulla's actions in his march on Rome. Notes Sources * T.

From 1946 until his retirement in 1957, he was an extraordinary professor in Nijmegen and professor of psychology in Utrecht, although he had never studied psychology. [1] In his younger years, acquaintance with Max Scheler, Hans Driesch and Helmuth Plessner (with whom he became friends) had a considerable influence on Buytendijk. He corresponded with many great philosophers, such as Binswanger, Guardini, Merleau-Ponty and with Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. [2] Frederik (Frits) Buytendijk got his inspiration and method from different sources: the experiences he had since 1918 as an animal psychologist, and after the Second World War as a human psychologist, and from phenomenology, the doctrine that makes the phenomena speak for themselves. In his General Theory of Human Posture and Movement (1949), Buytendijk succeeded in emphasizing a combination of body and mind. In 1937 the originally reformed Buytendijk became a Catholic. He was, among other things, chairman of the Catholic Association for Mental Health and from the end of the 1950s he was editor-in-chief of the Aula series, the popular scientific paperback series of publishing house Het Spectrum.

Glasier initiated a new interest in falconry in both the UK and the United States of America. He spent much of his life involved with the conservation and breeding of raptors and bringing them to public attention through the foundation of the Falconry Centre (now the International Centre for Birds of Prey), Newent, Gloucestershire, as well as through books, lectures and public demonstrations. He founded the Hawk Trust (now the Hawk and Owl Trust) and the Raptor Breeders' Association. Daily Telegraph As The Falcon Her Bells, Phillip Glasier, Futura Publications Ltd., London. 1978, . Early life Glasier was born in Southfields in south-west London, where his father was a land agent. Around 1920 the family moved to Kent and later to Suffolk where he spent his childhood. A great influence on his life at that time was a step-uncle, Captain Charles Knight, a respected ornithologist and falconer who encouraged the young Glasier's interest in nature and wildlife. Charles Knight lived a short distance from Glasier's home outside Sevenoaks. As a child and teenager Glasier spent much time with his uncle learning about wildlife and in particular birds of prey. With his cousin, the actor Esmond Knight, he took part in a number of amateur films made by Charles Knight. Such was his skill at handling birds that when his uncle went away on an expedition he left his young nephew in charge of an African hawk-eagle. On leaving school Glasier went to work in his father's land agency business. New York Times Second World War During WWII Glasier was an instructor in the Royal Armoured Corp. He was stationed initially at Bovington Camp in Dorset, and while waiting for a commission he became an instructor for arms and then tanks. He finally went to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as a gunnery instructor. Glasier was demobilised in 1950 after 6 years' service. Middle years His father had died during his period of military service and he was unable to return to his former employment. He set up as a press photographer in London but found it unsatisfactory and moved to Salisbury, where he set up a photography shop specialising in bird photographs. At this time Peter Scott was starting the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) and Glasier sent him a photograph of a mallard, hoping that Scott might buy it. He not only bought it but commissioned Glasier to take more photographs at the Wildfowl Trust, something he did on annual visits. In 1953 Glasier took a minor part as the 'Royal Falconer' in a film called The Sword and the Rose. His role involved flying falcons to add authenticity to the drama.IMDB This film starred James Robertson Justice who was later to invite Glasier to be his personal falconer. He was also responsible for the flying of falcons for the film Knights of the Round Table starring Ava Gardner and Robert Taylor. Shortly after this Glasier and his family moved to Black Isle, Inverness, Scotland to take up James Robertson Justice's offer of employment. Further falconry work was provided for an episode of a 1959 TV series called Three Golden Nobles. Later he returned to Melbury Osmond in Dorset, south-west England, returning annually to Scotland for the shooting season to fly his birds for, among others, Prince Philip and Charles, Prince of Wales. In 1963 he undertook an overland trek to the Middle East and India in search of Hodgson's hawk eagles (Nisaetus nipalense). The trip was undertaken with his friend Peter Combe in an ancient Austin Gypsy.A Hawk in the Hand, Phillip Glasier, Robinson Publishing, London, 1990, In 1963 Glasier wrote the autobiographical As The Falcon Her Bells (title from Shakespeare's As You Like It, act III, scene iii.) recalling his early life and his influential uncle. In 1965 Glasier went to the Royal Navy Air Station in Lossiemouth, Scotland to demonstrate how trained raptors could be used to prevent bird strikes on planes by clearing the runways of seagulls and other birds. This was the first time that falcons had been used in this way. Later years In 1966 Glasier moved from Dorset to Gloucester, opening the Falconry Centre in May 1967International Centre for Birds of Prey His intention was that the public would have close access to raptors, witness their handling through flying displays and be more aware of their ecological value. At that time there was a general feeling that many raptors were destructive pests. The centre grew and developed a successful breeding program of many birds that had not previously been bred in captivity. In 1982 Glasier retired to Scotland to escape the newly passed Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981: he continued to fly his birds and also wrote another autobiographical book, A Hawk in the Hand. He later returned to Gorsley in Gloucestershire. Family Phillip Glasier's first marriage to Valerie Pedler, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, was dissolved. His second marriage was in 1949, to \\"Bill\\" Lees. She died in 1998. They had three daughters and a son, Jemima, Anna, Dinah and Nicholas.

Its base, and studio complex operated from the historic Garrison Hall in Dowling Street. Until 2010 Garrison Hall was occupied by NHNZ which has since moved to a larger facility in Melville Street. Garrison Hall remains a television production hub to this day, it is now home to Animation Research, Taylormade Media, The Video Factory and Kahawai Productions. Garrison Hall, Dunedin in 2011 History Broadcasting to Dunedin began on 31 July 1962. This followed successful start ups in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Initially there was no networking between the four stations, imported programmes and news footage needed to be physically sent between the different centres meaning differing transmission dates. The first network news was read by Dougal Stevenson on 5 November 1969. Initially, DNTV2 was broadcast from a transmitter at Highcliff. Coverage was extended to South Otago and Southland in 1964 with the commissioning of relay stations at Kuriwao and Mount Hedgehope. The Mount Cargill transmitter was commissioned in 1970 to replace the Highcliff transmitter. Following expansion in the 1960s, news, administration and production staff moved to other locations nearby including Orbell Chambers and the Methodist Central Mission, both in Stuart Street. The set construction unit moved to Fryatt Street in the city's wharf area. This left the Garrison Hall facility as studios, transmission control, wardrobe, make-up and dressing rooms. On 1 April 1975, DNTV2 was folded, along with Wellington-based WNTV1 into Television One. The newly created network would have two production facilities, those being Garrison Hall and the newly opened Avalon Television Centre. Although the Avalon facility was larger and purpose built, at times the production output from the Dunedin operation exceeded that of Avalon. In 1980 Television One was combined with Television Two to create a combined Television New Zealand. The Dunedin operation becoming one of four TVNZ production sites along with Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch. Although it was the smallest of the production centres, its share of output to the national networks stood at around 30% before TVNZ began cutbacks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In effort to stave off competition from the soon to launch TV3, TVNZ production was scaled back nationwide and centralised in a new facility in Auckland. While TVNZ was scaling back production, one exception was the Natural History Unit, which continued to thrive and was eventually sold off by TVNZ as a going concern as NHNZ. Other offshoot production companies were born out of TVNZ's retreat from Dunedin. Notable companies being Animation Research, Taylormade Productions, and Kids TV.

The film received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Plot The film opens up with an armored truck coming across a car accident in the middle of a road. The driver finds this suspicious and prepares to drive off, but the truck is suddenly attacked by masked robbers. The driver tries to make a break for it, but his partner is revealed to be in on the heist. They execute the driver when an alarm in the truck goes off, and then his partner when he questions the lead robber's motives. After the heist, local law enforcement have created road blocks in search of the robbers. The four robbers, Marek, his girlfriend Arielle, Losada, and getaway driver Evers know that they fit the profile of the robbers and so, to prevent themselves from being caught, hide the $4 million in a tent bag belonging to a family of four who are on a camping trip. They manage to hide the bag full of money in the family's camping gear on top of their Land Rover while the family uses restrooms at a small gas station. Both the robbers and the family drive off and arrive at the road blockade. The robbers are immediately pulled over by the police and their vehicle is searched. As it is, the family passes through the blockade with no trouble. Aside from a police scanner belonging to Marek, the police are unable to find any incriminating evidence against them and let them go. The robbers catch up to the family in their black Chevelle. The father, Nate (Jim Caviezel) notices the Chevelle coming up behind him very fast. He tries to outrun the vehicle, but a police car detects his speed and pulls him over. The robbers manage to get away because Arielle detected the cruiser with the scanner. Nate tries to tell the officer the Chevelle was chasing him, but the patrolman insists because they were following him at great speed, it allowed them to get away with it. Because of Louisiana state law, Nate is given a misdemeanor for reckless driving. Nate pleads with the officer not to give him the ticket because it will violate his parole, having spent the last 18 months in jail because of real estate fraud he committed. When he innocently begs the patrolman further, he is arrested and taken to the police station. Meanwhile, his wife Robyn (Elisabeth Rohm) and his two sons Shane (Sterling Knight) and Kenny (Jake Cherry) drive to a motel to spend the night while await Nate's release. Nate is put in a cell block for the night. Back at the motel, the robbers invade Robyn's motel room and attack her. She locks herself in the bathroom door, then escapes through the bathroom window. The robbers are forced to leave when they learn the police are on their way. Marek is frustrated they didn't find the money in Robyn's room and gets angered further when Evers revealed the family had two motel rooms, insisting the bag must have been in the other room. The police arrive on scene, and bring Nate along once learning of the attack on his family. They decide to reduce the charges against Nate and give the family an escort out of town. Robyn and Shane demand to return home, but along with Kenny, Nate insists they need the trip in order to repair their relationship as a family and have family memories. The next morning, they leave the motel for the campgrounds. A police cruiser escorts them a few miles down the road before turning back and racing to another emergency. Meanwhile, the robbers spot the family Land Rover and head on after it. As they keep driving, one of the straps holding the camping gear comes loose and so the family pulls over to fix it. As Nate and Robyn unload the camping gear, he hands her the sleeping bag full of money. When she opens it, her face turns white. She tells the boys to get back into the car before lashing out at Nate. Robyn believes Nate actually stole the money from members of a laundering scheme that exposed his real-estate fraud and threw him in jail, and that they were the ones who attacked her at the motel, and insists the camping trip was nothing but a ruse for them to \\"start over\\". Nate is confused by her allegations and pleads with her he didn't do anything wrong. She throws the bag at Nate and drives off with the two boys, leaving him stranded. When he looks into the bag, he realizes that the money belongs to the robbers. Shane and Kenny plead their mother to turn the car around to get Nate, but they are attacked by the robbers in their Chevelle. They drive them off the road and cause them to crash into a log. Marek demands to know where the money is, and Robyn tells him her husband has it. Marek and Arielle drive off with the family while Losada and Evers remain in the Chevelle in-tow. Meanwhile, Nate walks on-foot, first down the road and then through the swamp adjacent to it. He hears a motorboat pass by and shouts for help. The driver of the boat spots Nate for a split second, but continues on and doesn't stop. Nate hides the money in a tree trunk and returns to the road. As soon as he does, the Land Rover speeds pass him. He chases after it, but is too late to stop it. Suddenly, the Chevelle appears and Losada and Evers apprehend him. They take him captive and drive off after the others. Losada informs Marek they have Nate and the two cars intersect. Marek demands Nate to hand over the money, but Nate says he'll get it once his family is let go. Marek refuses to negotiate and holds Nate at gun point to show him where the money is hidden. They return to the spot with the tree trunk, where to his horror, Nate discovers the money is missing. He doesn't tell the robbers this and returns, stating once his family is set free he'll give them the money (he keeps eye contact with Losada while saying this). This angers Marek again, who says he's in charge and makes the rules, however this angers Losada who claims he should be in charge instead. Nate manipulates the two into a brawl, which allows him to run off. Arielle sees this and tells him not to do anything stupid, unknowingly allowing Robyn and the boys to escape. She drives off, but Arielle clings onto the back of the Land Rover but the boys manage to knock her out. Nate runs up to the road and Robyn slows down the car to let him get in. They speed off, but turn around after Nate tells them the next town is 40 miles away and so they're better off returning to the town with the motel. The family manages to flag down the same patrolman that arrested Nate, but he doesn't believe their wild stories of anyone chasing them. Suddenly, he's hit by the robbers and the family flees again. Marek steals the cop car and tries to gun them down. As the Chevelle and cruiser try to box the Land Rover, Nate notices gas leaking from the tank of the cruiser. Nate swerves the Land Rover into the cruiser, which ignites the fuel, causing the cruiser to spin out of control and crash into a ditch. Evers and Losada retrieve Marek and several weapons from the cruiser. Marek tells a wounded Arielle \\"he won't lose to this man.\\" Fed up with Arielle slowing them down, Losada and Evers turn on him who insist on killing her. Marek turns the tables and holds them at gunpoint, but surprises them when he shoots Arielle in the back of the head. Meanwhile, the family tries to escape by boat but Nate uses it to distract the robbers' attention so that they can escape. Unfortunately, this backfires as the robbers take the boat to track the family down. Robyn, Kenny and Shane come across the small headquarters of Gator Trax, the owner of the boat, located in a cabin in the swamps. They find the bag of money locked inside, and a cb radio and manage to contact someone for help, who says the police will be there in 30 minutes. Shane says that's not enough time. Nate hides in the bushes as Marek searches for the family. A snake however causes Nate to be spotted and forces him to run, however Marek shoots him down, demanding him to reveal the location of the money, and then his family. Meanwhile, Robyn, Shane and Kenny find the money and several loaded guns inside a locked up closet in the cabin, finally proving their father's innocence. Suddenly, they spot Evers and Losada outside. Robyn hides the kids in the closet and shoots Losada just as he breaks down the door. Evers retrieves him and a gunfight breaks out. When the firing stops, Shane sets fire to several portions of the money and throws them out the window, threatening to burn all of it if they don't let them go. Marek and Nate arrive. Marek threatens to execute Nate if they don't bring out the money. When Shane brings it out, Losada refuses to give him back his dad and is about to shoot him, however he is shot again and killed by Robyn. Shane flees back into the house with the money. Marek and Evers try to level the cabin by firing bullets at it. This allows Nate to grab Losada's gun and shoot Marek in the shoulder. He quickly grabs his machine gun and fires at Evers, whose last words to Nate are \\"watch your back\\". Nate turns around and sees Marek swing a machete at him, wounding his chest. Nate seemingly falls into the swamp as Marek takes several swings at him. Marek then enters the cabin and attacks Shane, but Robyn threatens to burn the money. Marek says she has nowhere to run, but she burns the money anyway. Marek knocks her out cold. Nate appears and tackles Marek, and the two engage in a brutal fight. The two of them try to choke each other, however Nate slams Marek's head into a nail on a wooden deck outside the cabin, finally killing him. Robyn, Shane and Kenny mend to him, and the four of them reconcile. In the last scene, a revving car engine is heard as well as the application of brakes. A shot of Nate's wedding ring lies covered in blood on the road (Losada chopped Nate's ring finger when he found him on the side of the road) and a hand, presumably Nate's, picks it up before the screen goes black.

Acceleration time to was reduced from 35 to 23 seconds compared to the standard version, and the top speed increased from to . =Tigr-M= During the 2010 Interpolitex exhibition, the Multi-purpose Armored Vehicle (Ru:–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—è –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ü–µ–ª–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è (–ê–ú–ù)) AMS 233 114 Tigr-M was presented by the Military Industrial Company. It featured a new YaMZ-534 diesel engine, a new armored hood, air filter installation, an increase in the number of rear passenger seats (from 8 to 9) and the replacement of the bicuspid rear hatch with a large square hatch. Currently, the Tigr-M is mass-produced and supplied to the Russian Army, including with the new Arbalet-DM remote control weapons station which is composed of 12.7mm Kord or 7.62mm PKTM machine guns. The upgraded Tigr 4x4 armoured vehicle with increased protection displayed at the Army 2018 defence show in Kubinka, near Moscow, on 21‚Äì26 August. The upgrade is based on combat experience gained during operations in Syria and designated the ASN 233115 Tigr-M SpN.

Based on the SPM-2, the SPV is designed for combat officer transport. It has a four-door station wagon body with increased GOST 6A armor protection (heavy mine protection and special shock-absorbing seats/footrests which are not attached to the floor). As of November 2012, tests are being conducted. The roof of the car has a large rotating hatch with folding a folding lid and two brackets for mounting weapons. Firing from the personal weapons of the crew and the assault group carried out through open armored glass in the doors and on the sides of the vehicle. There are places for stowage of ammunition, rocket-propelled grenade launchers such as the RPG-26, a radio station and a radio-controlled explosive devices blocker.

Kats (born July 14, 1959) is an American businessman, environmentalist, and thought leader in the green economy sector. He is President of Capital E, a national clean energy advisory and venture capital firm. Previously, Kats served as a Managing Director at Good Energies,[2] a billion-dollar global clean energy investor, and Director of Financing for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).[3] Work Kats has played lead roles in developing the energy efficiency and green building industries, and is a long-time thought leader, innovator, and investor in the transition to a low carbon economy. A pioneer in the space, Kats led the creation of the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP); served as a key driver in the creation of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification and subsequent updates; and co-founded the country's first green bank. He is President of Capital E, which works with cities, corporations, and financial institutions to design, scale, and implement clean energy and low carbon strategies. Capital E invests in early-stage clean tech and green firms. Kats is presently a driver in the campaign to revise LEED standards to require meaningful minimum carbon reductions for each level of LEED certification ‚Äì both for new LEED buildings and for LEED rating renewals. In 2018, he served as the lead author of a major report on the opportunity that cities have to invest in \\"smart surface technologies\\" as a means of both improving public health and delivering financial benefits. Kats chairs the Congressionally established committee guiding the greening of 430,000 federal buildings, serves on the Mayor's Green Ribbon Committee guiding the greening of the District of Columbia, and served on the CO2toEE project steering committee. He is the author of Greening Our Built World, which was translated into Portuguese, and has published several dozen reports and articles in global journals and outlets (see Publications below). Kats has served on the boards of a dozen clean energy companies including Blue Planet, which produces the first man-made carbon sequestering commercial product which was deployed in the build-out of San Francisco International Airport. He regularly testifies on clean energy green building and financial issues. From 2005 to 2010, Kats was Managing Director of Good Energies,https://cap-e.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/02/Greg-KatsCV2014.pdf a multibillion-dollar global clean energy PE/VC fund, where he led investments in smart grid, energy efficiency, green materials, and green building. He then served as a partner in Clean Feet, which funds innovative green energy and agricultural projects. Kats also served on a National Academy of Sciences board on strengthening U.S. global competitiveness. He was the Director of Financing for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy for five years under President Bill Clinton.  Federal Clean Energy Financing  In response to Congressional investigations in 2011 and 2012, Kats testified three times to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on issues directly related to controversial political issues, including green jobs, federal clean energy strategy, and the DOE loan guarantee controversies, which became issues for candidates in the 2012 United States Presidential Election. His congressional testimony highlighted the cost-effectiveness of clean energy stimulus funding and noted that the final loan default rate of the U.S. clean energy loan program would be less than half what the Office of Management and Budget had projected and budgeted for. Kats' analysis indicated that the default rate on the $16.1 billion Energy Department loan portfolio is less than 3.6 percent, well below the Office of Management and Budget forecast of 12.85 percent, and he determined that the actual default rate will not get out of single digits. Citing the financial objectives and successes of the program to date, as well as the related employment and national security benefits, Kats concluded that the largest risk is that the DOE slows its loan guarantee program.  Energy and Green Design Standards  While at the U.S. Department of Energy, Kats recognized the challenge associated with enabling energy efficiency to become a more substantial industry. He played a lead role in developing and served as the Founding Chair of IPMVP. During his tenure, he built it into the international energy and water efficiency design and verification standard for more than $50 billion in building efficiency upgrades to date. It's the design measurement verification basis for the modern energy efficiency industry and is required for all federal building efficiency upgrades. Kats was a founder of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). He was the Principal Advisor in designing and establishing Enterprise Green Communities, the national low-income green design standard that has served as the design basis for over 50,000 housing units to date. He recently helped design the World Bank's large new green building financing program. Kats served as a leader in the creation of LEED and served on its steering committee for the first six years. During his tenure on the steering committee, he led the effort to establish minimum energy performance and subsequently led the push to reweight LEED around climate change. He also chaired the LEED Energy and Atmosphere Technical Advisory Group for its first five years and served as the founding chair of the national USGBC chapter.  Resilient Cities  For almost a decade, Kats has been driving the conversation about making the built environment ‚Äì particularly in cities ‚Äì resilient. He recently co-authored the report, ‚ÄúDelivering Urban Resilience,‚Äù which concluded that an investment in ‚Äúsmart surface technologies‚Äù would result in an estimated half a trillion dollars in net financial benefits nationally. The report was launched in partnership with the USGBC, National League of Cities, and American Institute of Architects, among others, and has received national attention. In 2014, Kats testified before the Israeli Cabinet about the opportunity for Israel to make large financial savings with health, security and strategic benefits by greening their buildings and infrastructure.[14]  Awards  Kats has been widely recognized for his contributions to the green economy. In 2011, he was the recipient of the first U.S. Green Building Council President's Award, a lifetime achievement honor. Kats also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alliance to Save Energy in 2018.  Education  Kats earned an MBA from Stanford University and, concurrently, an MPA from Princeton University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. He received his BA from the University of North Carolina with highest honors as a Morehead Scholar.  Personal  Kats lives with his wife and two of his three children in Washington, DC. A solar PV system powers his home and an electric hybrid car.

Annex C of the circular addresses matters concerning the review of police injury pensions. In January 2012 the circular was deemed to be unlawful in part by His Honour Judge Behrens, sitting at Leeds High Court. A further judicial review hearing, before His Honour Justice Supperstone at Leeds High Court in February 2012 held that part of Home Office circular 46/2004, concerning \\"Review of Injury Pensions once Officers reach 65\\", and paragraph 20 of section 5 of the Home Office 'Guidance on Medical Appeals under the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 and the Police (Injury Benefit) Regulations 2006' are inconsistent with the Police (Injury Benefits) Regulations 2006 and therefore unlawful. An application for judicial review arising from further dispute over the legality of the Home Office guidance was settled by consent order in February 2014. The case to be heard was Regina on the application of John Slater v Secretaty of State for Home Department and The Chief Constable of Derbyshire, case number 16873/2013. The Home Office agreed to withdraw a further part of the guidance contained in Annex C to Home Office circular 46/2004. Subsequently, on 21 February 2014, the Home Office withdrew the entirely of the Annex C guidance, and also similar guidance which formed part of a publication entitled, Guidance on Medical Appeals. This article sets out a brief history of the circular. Legislation Police injury pensions in England and Wales are governed by the Police (Injury Benefit) Regulations 2006. The Regulations are made under provision of the Police Pensions Act 1976. Police officers who are injured on duty may be required to retire if the injury is such that it is likely to be permanent and prevents the individual from performing the ordinary duties of a constable. An injury pension may then be granted, and is payable for life. The amount of pension paid depends on the officer's average pensionable pay, years of service and degree of disablement. Degree of disablement is determined by reference to the degree to which his/her earning capacity has been affected as a result of an injury received without his own default in the execution of his duty as a member of a police force. Earning capacity has been defined by the High Court to be, '. . . what the [injured person] is capable of doing and thus capable of earning. It is not a labour market assessment, or an assessment of whether somebody would actually pay him to do what he is capable of doing, whether or not in competition with other workers.' A Police Authority may review the injury pension from time to time, at such intervals as may be suitable, and if it is found that there has been a substantial alteration in degree of disablement the pension shall be revised accordingly. The Home Office The Home Office is a UK Government Department for policies in various areas, including policing, and includes agencies, non-departmental public bodies and inspectorates. It issues guidance and information to these, often in the form of Circulars. Circulars are official Home Office documents that provide updates and details on policy and procedures. The Home Office states, They are useful to people who work for, or with, the Home Office or who need to know the latest policy updates. Home Office guidance is advice only. It has no element of compulsion, and recipients may disregard the advice, providing that in so doing they do not disregard the law. On 9 August 2004 the Home Office issued Circular 46/2004. It is entitled The Police Pension Scheme - Police Medical Appeal Boards/Role of Selected Medical Practitioner/British Transport Police Transfers. The originating Department at the Home Office was the Police Personnel Unit within the Crime Reduction and Community Safety Group. It was issued by a civil servant, John Gilbert, who was then the Head of the Police Pensions and Retirement Policy Section. The Home Secretary at the time (8 June 2001 ‚Äì 15 December 2004) was David Blunkett . The Minister of State for Crime Reduction, Policing, Community Safety and Counter-Terrorism at the time (2003‚Äì2005) was Hazel Blears. Home Office circular 46/2004 was addressed to Chief Police Officers in England and Wales, with copies to the Clerks to the Police Authorities. Annex C Annex C to the guidance is entitled, Home Office Guidance For Forces On Reviews Of Injury Awards. The introduction to Annex C states: :This Guidance is being issued to help ensure a fairer, more cohesive approach to the payment of injury benefits to ill-health retired officers who have reached the compulsory retirement age with their Force. A recent survey found that practice in this area was diverse. Some forces automatically reduced degree of disablement benefits to the lowest banding when this age had been reached - others continued to pay benefits at the same rate until the death of the Officer concerned. It is clear that a more standardised approach is needed to safeguard the rights of the Officer and ensure fair treatment across Forces. The guidance went on to advise: Review of Injury Pensions once Officers reach Compulsory Retirement Age :Once a former officer receiving an injury pension reaches what would have been his compulsory retirement age under the Police Pensions Regulations (55, 57, 60 or 65 depending on the person‚Äôs force and rank at the point of leaving the police service) the force should consider a review of the award payable, since it is no longer appropriate to use the former officer‚Äôs police pay scale as the basis for his or her pre-injury earning capacity. :In the absence of a cogent reason for a higher or lower outside earnings level, it is suggested that the new basis for the person‚Äôs earning capacity, had there been no injury, should be the National Average Earnings (NAE) at the time of the review. The NAE figure taken should be the average for the population overall. Separate figures for males and females, and regional fluctuations should not be considered. The loss of earning capacity for the purpose of establishing Degree of Disablement should therefore be assessed by reference to the % proportion the person‚Äôs actual earning capacity bears to NAE. :This procedure should help to ensure that former officers are treated in a consistent way across forces. They will be placed on an equal financial footing with others in the employment market at a time when they could not have been assumed to be earning a police salary. :After a review at compulsory retirement age a force should determine the need and date for the next review. In some cases there may be particular circumstances which make it undesirable to conduct a further review. Review of Injury Pensions once Officers reach Age 65 :Once a former officer receiving an injury pension reaches the age of 65 they will have reached their State Pension Age irrespective of whether they are male or female. The force then has the discretion, in the absence of a cogent reason otherwise, to advise the SMP to place the former officer in the lowest band of Degree of Disablement. At such a point the former officer would normally no longer be expected to be earning a salary in the employment market. : :A review at age 65 will normally be the last unless there are exceptional circumstances which require there to be a further review. Reaction Around 17 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales began to implement the guidance from the circular when conducting reviews of police injury pensions. Doubts were raised concerning the validity of the Home Office guidance by The National Association of Retired Police Officers (NARPO) and other organisations and individuals. In 2005 134 Members of Parliament signed early day motion no. 1102 - Police Injury Retirement Pensions. The motion stated: > That this House notes that a number of retired police officers who have been > receiving injury awards face having those awards cut when they reach > statutory retirement age; further notes that many of those officers believed > that the awards would be paid to them for life; further notes that awards of > this kind were normally made to officers injured while engaged in protecting > the interests of the public; and calls on the Government to investigate > whether officers have been misled about the rules that would apply to their > awards. A number of cases were successfully brought before the Administrative Court by former police officers who believed that their injury pensions had been unlawfully reduced under the influence of the Home Office guidance. Other former officers successfully took their cases to the Pensions Ombudsman or won a restoration of their pension by appeal to a Police Medical Appeal Board. On 11 September 2009 the then Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, David Hanson announced at the annual conference of the National Association of Retired Police Officers (NARPO) that he had ordered a review of the guidance. Eric Evans the President of NARPO said, :We are pleased to see that the Minister appears to accept that the Home Office Circular 46/2004 is in need of amendment. Our view is that the circular and pressure from the Home Office has created a situation where some forces are guilty of maladministration of the injury benefit system to the detriment of significant numbers of our members. We have been working hard to get this view across to the Home Office. We are very pleased to accept the Minister's offer of a meeting to discuss this issue and others of interest to our members in the very near future. The promised review did not appear and on 10 March 2010 John Gilbert, Head of the Police Pensions Section at the Home Office wrote to all Chief Officers of Police and all Chairs of Police Authorities in England and Wales. He reported, :Good progress has been made on the review of this guidance and it is intended that this should result in revised and expanded guidance being produced in due course. However further development of revised guidance is currently constrained by the fact that a legal issue which is central to the final shape the guidance will take, is currently awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeal. Mr. Gilbert advised that any planned reviews should be deferred until the Court had announced its decision. Relevant Cases The case Mr. Gilbert referenced but did not name was that of Belinda LAWS, a former Metropolitan Police officer who is in receipt of an injury pension. It is referenced as Neutral Citation No. [2009] EWHC 1867 (Admin) CO/10892/2009. She successfully challenged the decision of the Police Medical Appeal Board, dated 17 March 2009, to reject her appeal against a decision of the Selected Medical Practitioner, that her degree of disablement for the purposes of her police injury pension should be reduced from 85 per cent to 25 per cent. The case was first heard on 12 November 2009 at the High Court of Justice before the Administrative Court, Queens Bench Division, Mrs Justice Cox presiding. The decision was upheld at appeal on 13 October 2010. The case of CROCKER was heard in 2003 (Thus pre-dating issue of HOC 46/2004). It is referenced as Neutral Citation Number [2003] EWHC 3115 (Admin) CO/505/2003. The brief background is that the claimant, the South Wales Police Authority, sought to quash a decision of the defendant Medical Referee that Mr Crocker the interested party, a police officer who was retired on 3 March 2002, had lost all earning capacity as a result of an injury received in the execution of his duty. Mr Crocker won his case. The case of POLLARD was heard in February 2009. It is referenced as Neutral Citation No. [2009] EWHC 403 (Admin) CO/853/2008. The brief background is that Barbara Pollard, a former West Yorkshire police officer, successfully sought an order quashing the decision made by a Police Medical Appeal Board which held that her degree of disablement was assessed at nil per cent as her current disability was not causally related to the index incident in 1974. The case of TURNER was held in July 2009. It is referenced as Neutral Citation No. [2009] EWHC 403 (Admin) CO/853/2008. The brief background is that the claimant, Stephen Turner, a former officer with the Metropolitan Police had his injury pension reviewed in October 2007. The Selected Medical Practitioner did a new review of the jobs she felt Mr Turner could do and decided to reduce Mr Turner‚Äôs injury pension from Band 2 to Band 1. He successfully brought the issue to judicial review. The Pension Ombudsman made a determination in the case of AYRE in August 2009. Mr. Ayre is a former Humberside officer and his injury pension was reviewed under the Home Office guidance inspired 'age 65' concept that the pension could be reduced to band one simply because a pensioner had reached state retirement age. The Ombudsman determined, . . . Mr Ayre is right when he says that the Guidance cannot override the relevant Regulations. Mr Ayre won his case and Humberside Police Authority was directed to reconsider its decision, taking into account the Ombudsman's comments. The case of CRUDACE was held in January 2012. It is referenced as Neutral Citation No. (2012) EWHC 112 (Admin) CO/2417/2011. His Honour Judge Behrens released a judgement quashing the decision of the Northumbria police to reduce Mr Crudace‚Äôs pension when the former Inspector reached the age of 65. He decided the Home Office guidance was unlawful because it was inconsistent with the statutory scheme under which the pensions were paid. Judge Behrens also confirmed former police officers who have had their pensions reduced in this way are entitled to apply to the police authority for the decisions to be reversed and for their pensions to be restored. The case of SIMPSON was held in February 2012. It is referenced as Neutral Citation No. (2012) EWHC 808 (Admin) CO/475/2011. His Honour Judge Supperstone held that part of the Home Office guidance contained in circular 46/2004 was unlawful, as was similar guidance contained in Part 5 of the Home Office's Guidance on Medical Appeals. At Paragraph 42 of the decision Mr Justice Supperstone opined: 'In my judgment, the appropriate relief to grant in the circumstances of this case is a declaration that the section in the Guidance headed \\"Review of Injury Pensions Once Officers Reach Age 65\\" and paragraph 20 of the Guidance on Medical Appeals are inconsistent with the Regulations and unlawful. There is no justification for adopting a different approach to regulation 37(1) in respect of a former officer who reaches the age of 65 than in the case of a review for former officers of a younger age.' The Home Office has since released circular 007/2012 which advises recipients that parts of the guidance on police injury award reviews, as specified below, are cancelled. The relevant parts are: (i) Home Office Circular 46/2004: in Annex C the section entitled 'Review of injury pensions once officers reach age 65' (ii) Guidance on medical appeals: paragraph 20 of section 5, entitled 'Degree of disablement after age 65' The Home Office Policing Directorate wrote to all Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners in February 2014 advising withdrawal of Annex C of Home Office circular 46/2004. The letter stated: The case of Simpson (2012) found that the part of Home Office Circular 46/2004 dealing with reviews of injury benefit at state pension age (SPA) was unlawful. The section of the guidance was withdrawn by Home Office Circular 007/2012. A further section of the guidance, relating to reviews at compulsory retirement age (CRA), was not explicitly withdrawn at that point. An application for a judicial review has recently been made claiming that a further section of Circular 46/2004 in respect of CRA is also unlawful. It is clear the judgement in the SImpson case would apply to CRA as well as SPA and the Home Office has undertaken to withdraw Annex C of Home Office Circular 46/2004. This has been publicised on the Home Office website and this letter is formal notification to you of the withdrawal of Annex C of Home Office Circular 46/2004. The Home Office is also withdrawing paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of Guidance on Medical Appeals which refer to CRA. Current Situation To date no revised guidance has been issued. Reviews of police injury pensions remain mostly suspended. Mr Peter Spreadbury, Head of the Police Pensions and Retirement Policy Section within the Home Office, gave evidence in the Simpson case and stated, \\"Should it appear that repeated legal challenges and uncertainty are likely to continue in this area, one possible option is the withdrawal of the relevant guidance and the abandonment of any attempt to give central guidance on the topic.\\" References * The Police (Injury Benefit Regulations) 2006 External links * Home Office Circulars * National Association of Retired Police Officers Law enforcement in England and Wales Pensions in the United Kingdom Retirement in the United Kingdom Home Office (United Kingdom) 2004 in the United Kingdom ","title":"Home Office Circular 46/2004"},{"id":"34288241","text":"The Washington State Department of Early Learning, or DEL, was a Washington state agency responsible for early childhood education.

Life Walsh was born and raised in Dublin. Painting from an early age, the teenage artist was encouraged to develop his art by his father, the artist Owen Walsh, with whom he was reunited at sixteen following thirteen years of estrangement. He first exhibited work at seventeen whilst living in the Netherlands, shortly after which followed a series of one-man exhibitions in Dublin.Irish Times, 25 November 1978 Walsh continued traveling, exhibiting and living throughout Europe during the eighties, using Dublin as his base until, following a brief marriage to a Canadian artist, he relocated to Toronto in 1990 and became a citizen in 1994. He now divides his time between Ireland and Canada. Career Walsh graduated early from NCAD in 1984, having been skipped two years due to a number of previously well- regarded exhibitions in Dublin and the Netherlands that received support from the poet Edward James. During his time at college he was tutored by the artist Sean Scully. Between 1984 and 1988 Walsh was closely involved with Temple Bar Gallery and Studios and Project Arts Centre in Dublin, exhibiting at both and locating his studio at the former. In 1987 he was elected Chairman of Independent Artists, founded by his father in 1959 as an alternative to the more conservative Royal Hibernian Academy. In 1987 he also organized art classes and exhibitions with the Simon Community for the homeless.'Simon Artists on Show,' Irish Times, 18 June 1988 During the late eighties Walsh exhibited with \\"Le Nouveau Crie Artists Association\\" at Le Centre Culturel et Aerospatiale in Toulouse, France and in Ghent, Belgium. During this time he also exhibited at the Project Arts Centre in Dublin. In 1988 Walsh was chosen to represent Ireland at Art Junction in Nice, France. Walsh held several exhibitions in the nineties, primarily in North America, including shows at the Jadite Galleries in New York and at Bond Latin Art in San Francisco. He also exhibited in Toronto and in Taylor Galleries in Dublin.Art in America, October 1996 Walsh has also taught art in Canada over several years. Art Red Sea, oil on canvas, 1985 Walsh first exhibited paintings at the age of seventeen, drawing attention both from the Irish Times and the Irish Independent.Irish Times, 25 November 1978 His early work, primarily landscapes with people, possessed the lyrical, semi-abstract, slightly Surrealist aesthetic that could then be seen in the contemporary work of older Irish artists such as Patrick Collins, Louis le Brocquy and Walsh's own father, the artist Owen Walsh. Subsequent to graduating from NCAD, the setting and the aesthetic of the paintings begins to change. The semi-abstract, pastoral landscapes are replaced with more figurative depictions of urban settings; the early romantic lyricism gives way to a harder-edged Expressionist style articulated through thick, heavily textured paintwork and the utilization of found objects. At this time, 'his handling of paint is raw, his approach is physical and aggressive,'Ronan Walsh: Painter, Catalogue, Arts Council Ireland, 1986 But Walsh's style was not traditionally Expressionist: 'actually there is very little of the archetypal German Expressionist about Walsh, his use of colour is more comparable to the French.'Ronan Walsh: Paintings, Arts Council Ireland, 1985, p.1 Towards the end of the eighties, Walsh becomes affiliated critically with the Neo-expressionist and Transavantgarde movements in Europe. The shift from abstraction \\"towards figuration https://www.ronanwalsh.com/ and greater realism becomes most pronounced in the 1990s, a decade in which Walsh also shifts his focus from the urban to a more natural setting of forests and beaches. This concentration on natural settings and subject matter has continued in Walsh's post-millennial work, in which the figure of the Camargue horse and the West of Ireland feature both as sources of inspiration and as thematic motifs. The turn of the century has also seen a return towards the abstraction that had characterized some of his earlier work.

Background March St. Baptist Church (Toronto; 1832) At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Baptist life in Ontario was little more than embryonic. There were fourteen churches in all with at total membership of around 400. These first Regular Baptist churches in Ontario were linked together in two fledgling associations: the Thurlow Association (later called the Haldimand Association) consisting mostly of churches between Cobourg and Kingston and the Clinton Conference made up of four churches‚ÄîCharlotteville, Townsend, Clinton, and Oxford. Theologically, these two associations were Calvinistic Baptists in 19th Century Ontario. http://www.campbellbaptist.org/institute/baptist_history_week_10.pdf and amillennial in doctrine.Whan, R. Lloyd, \\"Premillienialism in Canadian Baptist History\\" (1945). Open Access Dissertations and Theses. Paper 5825.http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/5825 The germ of the Baptist church in Toronto was planted in 1827, at which time a few people of this faith met in an upper room on Colborne Street, although there was no permanency until 1840. In the minutes of the old St. George's Masonic Lodge, No. 9, there is a reference which shows there was a Baptist organization in that year. In the minutes of this lodge of July 6, 1827, it is stated that \\"Bros. Rose and Watson be authorized to rent the lodge room to the Baptist congregation at 7s, 6d. currency per month if they choose to accept on these terms.\\" On October 3 of the same year the following report was read : \\"We, Walter Rose and Richard Watson, being fully empowered by St. George's Lodge, No. 9, to rent the lodge room for the sole use and benefit of a Sunday meeting, and none other, and that the said David Paterson have the free use of the said room on the Sabbath days for a period of six months, and the same be delivered to him in a clean state at 7s. 6d. provincial currency, monthly. He shall keep the house in careful and clean state, and deliver it in such state when the congregation leaves off the use of it.\\" The house here referred to was a two-storey frame building on Colborne street. The first meeting of which there is any official record was held on October 16, 1829, when the late Joseph Wenhlam, of the Bank of Upper Canada, was appointed to keep a regular account of the transactions of the church. It would seem from incidental allusions in the minutes that one or more meetings had been held before, but there is no record of what was said or done at those supposed meetings. The old church records are very meagre, being confined to dry statements of facts or resolutions. No list of the members has been preserved in the church books, so that it is doubtful whether anyone knows with certainty who were the real constituent members of the church; only a few names appearing regularly in the minutes. Alexander Stewart was the first \\"president\\" or pastor of the little church. In 1832, the first chapel was built (later called the Newsboys Home) on what was then known as March, (later, Stanley, but now Lombard street). At that time the street had been laid out, but there were scarcely any buildings on it, and it was thought it might become one of the best streets in the city. The chapel itself was far from being attractive, besides being very small, its seating capacity being about one hundred and sixty. Unfortunately the street became known as one of the rougher parts of town with local residents making church services very difficult even requiring police officers to patrol the streets to keep the peace during evening worship services. Church life was difficult with leadership difficulties included. The congregation on March Street was officially organized on October 31, 1840 the previous congregations having become defunct. William McMaster a prominent Toronto businessman and an immigrant from County Tyrone, Ireland during the month of May 1848, united with the church by experience. History Bond Street (Toronto; 1861) After meeting in temporary facilities on present day Colborne and Lombard Streets a building which became known as Bond Street Baptist Church Toronto, Ontario was built (located on the property of the current St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto) on Bond St., w. side, between Queen & Shuter Sts.). It opened for worship in June 1848http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMDC- PICTURES-R-3509&R;=DC-PICTURES-R-3509 and enlarged through 1852 and served until 1875 when it was superseded by Jarvis Street Baptist Church. It was built by members of the earlier Lombard St. Baptist grouping. It was separate and distinct from the earlier African American congregation known as First Baptist Church (Toronto). See http://fbctoronto.ca/ During this era the church held morning services at 11, evening services at 6 and Sabbath school (Sunday school) at 2:30 in the afternoon.The Canada Directory 1851. p. 415 The building on Bond St. was sold and used in 1892 by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who operated the Notre Dame des Anges, a boarding house for working women which later became St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto). Outreach Parliament St. Baptist Church (Toronto; late 1800s) Bond Street also helped to sponsor a work known as Alexander Street Baptist Church in 1867 located on the south side of Alexander Street between Yonge and Church streets. The Yorkville Baptist Church began also as an outreach (see Yorkminster Park Baptist Church (Toronto)) and was organized in 1872. Parliament Street Baptist Church was started as an outreach and had a missionary pastor in 1871. It was located at the corner of St. David St. (now a small park in the Regent Park neighbourhood of Toronto (formerly Cabbagetown, Toronto)). The Bond St. congregation was also active in a work which was continued at Jarvis Street which later became Beverley Street Baptist Church. As a participant in the greater outreach of Baptists in Toronto there was involvement also in the work that became College Street Baptist Church. Pastors Pastors in the timeline include: *Washington Christian, an African American Baptist minister who undoubtedly had some influence on the early meetings in the St. George's Masonic Lodge building and later the Lombard St. building and eventually helped form First Baptist Church (Toronto). see http://fbctoronto.ca/ *Alexander Stewart (originally from Perth, Ontario) pastored during the 1830s until 1836. He was considered a wandering missionary among the early Baptists. From 1836-1840 there was no regular pastor except for a J. E. Maxwell. *Thomas Ford Caldicott (b. March 21, 1803 Long Buckby, Northamptonshire, England - d. July 9, 1869 Toronto, Ontario) was one of the founding elders (ordained in 1834 at Chinguacousy and a year later moved to the U.S.) was officially established as pastor in October 1860 continuing until his death in July 1869. The question of systematic benevolence was always strongly promoted by Dr. Caldicott, and the Weekly offertory was adopted during the last weeks of his life.Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 11 -- John Lightfoot. \\"Caldicott, Thomas Ford\\" *W. H. Combes, Samuel Tapscott in 1837, James Campbell served from July 1840 to Sept. 1844. *Robert Alexander Fyfe (1816‚Äì1878) became pastor in 1844 until July 1848 and later from October 1855 to 1860. In 1844 membership stood around 60 but grew greatly affording the need of a new building during his first tenure. In 1860 he left to become the first principal at Woodstock College (then Canadian Literary Institute) from 1860‚Äì1878. Under Fyfe's leadership mission services were begun in the western part of the city. This mission eventually grew into the Beverley Street Baptist Church. *James Pyper (1807‚Äì1884) (from Michigan) pastored from 1848 to July 1855. Pyper served on the board of The Regular Baptist Missionary Society of Canada from its beginning in 1851. He was co-editor with John Inglis (from London, Ontario) for the Christian Messenger from 1851‚Äì1853 and espoused the newer premillennial view. Pyper had been influenced by the Millerism viewpoint. Pyper also had a few sermons on baptism published in 1851. Pyper was a good friend to Alexander Campbell (clergyman) who also preached in the pulpit during his visit to Toronto in 1856.British Millenial Harbinger July 1856 p. 16 *William Boyd Stewart (1835‚Äì1912) was called to be assistant pastor in 1869 but assumed the full pastorate upon the death of T. F. Caldicott. In 1871 he was living at 80 Bond St. which may have been a parsonage. Stewart served until May 1872. Stewart later served from 1894 to 1911 in various offices of the Toronto Bible Training Institute including being the first Principal. *John Harvard Castle (1830‚Äì1890) (from Philadelphia), became pastor in February 1873 and transferred to the new building at Jarvis Street in 1875.

The Ottoman Porte selected and appointed a new patriarch at the Serbian Patriarchal seat in Peƒá, the Greek Joannicius, from their trusted Phanariotes. The Austrian government continued to recognize Arsenije IV as the Serbian Patriarch and gave him administrative authority of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, the church body of the Habsburg Serbs, a position in which he had difficulties maintaining Serb privileges. Treaty of Belgrade Confirmation of Serbian Privileges, issued by Maria Theresa in 1743 With the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade which ended the Austro-Turkish War (1737‚Äì1739), the Kingdom of Serbia ceased to exist. The Ottoman sultan deposed the pro-Serbian Patriarch of Peƒá Arsenije IV and in his place appointed the Greek Joannicius, who took the title of Archbishop of Peƒá and Patriarch of the Serbs. The entry of Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá into Belgrade was symbolic of many things in the minds of simple folk (the transformation of man into an ideal, into an example, etc.). The entry celebrated the long-awaited arrival of Arsenije IV, the Patriarch of Peƒá, into Belgrade to take up the position of spiritual leader of the Orthodox faithful in Austria. Arsenije IV commissioned Pavle Nenadoviƒá, a clergyman and poet from the town of Karlovci, to compose a heraldic handbook, Stemmatographia (meaning \\"the drawing of ancestry\\" in Greek). This heraldic album was modelled after a book of the same title on Slavonic heraldic bearings, engraved in 1701 by Croatian poet Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá (who modelled his Stemmatographia after an older version of Slavic heraldry composed by Mavro Orbini). Arsenije IV's Stemmatographia was perceived by some as an illustrated political programme that was supposed to act both as a verification of the Serbian historical past and as a clear geo-political statement of the lands belonging to the Serbs in the Balkans. His intention, however, was educational, and for this work he hired three people: Hristofor Zhefarovich originally from Dojran as an artist; German-born Thomas Mesmer as an engraver; and clergyman Pavle Nenadoviƒá as a poet. Arsenije IV was well aware of the power of communuication that printed imagery had in those early days of the printing press and the art of engraving. His Stemmatographia was widely distributed among the Serbian villages and towns in the then Habsburg- occupied Serbian lands, and in Imperial Russia where Serbian colonies existed. (The letter from Arsenije IV, written and dated 19 June 1743, demanding a wide distribution is kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives Sremski Karlovci under the presswork B-1743-68). The previous Patriarch Arsenije IV moved north to the Habsburg Monarchy along with many Serbs, in what is known as the Second Serbian Migration. Arsenije IV became Metropolitan of Karlovci, maintaining however deep connections with the Serbs who remained in the Ottoman Empire, particularly the Kosovo Vilayet, now under the Phanariote jurisdiction of Joannicius. Joannicius remained Patriarch of Peƒá until 1746, when, burdened with debts due to his high-living, he was forced to sell the title to pay his creditors. He was succeeded by Atanasije II (Gavriloviƒá). Academy of Painting The artistic and cultural reforms commenced in Sremski Karlovci under the auspices and blessing of Metropolitan Vikentije Jovanoviƒá, was reinforced under his successor, Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta, who opened the first official Academy of Painting at his court in the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, and put the entire production of religious art under the firm control of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1743 he made an official proclamation in which he invited all those interested in the fine arts to join his Academy of Painting at Karlovci. For that purpose he invited two painters, Jov Vasilijeviƒç and Vasilije Romanoviƒç, from Kiev to join the teaching staff at the school. The inauguration of the Academy of Painting in Karlovci would mark the beginning of a new style and artistic idiom, and even more significantly, a novel understanding of the sacred images and its functions. Title Arsenije signed himself \\"Arsenije, By the Grace of God, Archbishop of Peƒá and Patriarch of all Serbs and Bulgarians and all of Illyria\\".

He distinguished himself with his participation in the Macedonian Struggle under the nom de guerre Kapetan Rouvas (ŒöŒ±œÄŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩ Œ°ŒøœçŒ≤Œ±œÇ) in 1904‚Äì1905. An ardent Venizelist, he participated in the Movement of National Defence. After his retirement from the army with the rank of Major General, he entered politics, being elected into the Greek Parliament and the Greek Senate. He also served three times as Minister for Military Affairs and as Governor-General for Thrace (1922‚Äì1923) and for Crete (1928‚Äì1930).  Early life and military career  Georgios Katechakis was born in the village of Platanos, in then Ottoman-controlled Crete. His father was Antonios Katechakis, one of the main leaders of the Cretan Revolt of 1866‚Äì1869. The elder Katechakis also participated in the uprisings of 1878, 1889 and 1896 and was repeatedly elected to the Cretan Parliament until his death. Georgios Katechakis entered the Hellenic Army Academy and graduated in 1902, being commissioned into the Hellenic Army on 6 July 1902 with the rank of a Lieutenant of Infantry. He was one of the first officers to volunteer for the Macedonian Struggle against the Bulgarian-sponsored Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). Under the pseudonym of \\"kapetan Rouvas\\", he led an armed band in the regions of Grevena, Kastoria and Monastir. He returned to Greece in 1908, and was dispatched to Crete to assist in the establishment of a local national guard. By the time the Balkan Wars broke out in 1912, he had risen to the rank of Captain. He participated in the wars as leader of various Cretan volunteer corps, fighting both in Macedonia and in Epirus. In 1914, promoted to Major, he was assigned as chief of staff to the 11th Infantry Division in Thessaloniki. From there he participated in the Venizelist National Defence uprising in August 1916, that led to the establishment of a parallel, pro- Entente government in northern Greece under Eleftherios Venizelos. He initially served as director of personnel in the National Defence government's Ministry of Military Affairs, and in 1917 he was assigned as chief of staff to the newly raised National Defence Army Corps, which fought in the Macedonian front. Following the end of the First World War, in 1919 he was sent to Constantinople as head of the Greek military delegation there, a post he held until he was dismissed from the army, with the rank of Major General, following the electoral victory of the anti-Venizelist royalist parties in November 1920. Katechakis was recalled to active duty in September 1922, following the Greek defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign and the Venizelist-led September 1922 Revolution. He was placed by the revolutionary government as Governor-General of Thrace (where a recommencement of hostilities with the Turks was expected should peace negotiations in Lausanne fail), remaining at the post until after the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 when he retired from military service.  Political career  In the December 1923 elections, Katechakis was elected to the National Assembly representing Heraklion Prefecture. He served as Minister for Military Affairs in the short- lived Themistoklis Sofoulis cabinet (25 July ‚Äì 7 October 1924). On 10 March 1928, he was appointed to the post of Governor-General of Crete, which was raised to the rank of a cabinet minister, a post he retained until 22 December 1930 under the premierships of Alexandros Zaimis and Venizelos. In the meantime, in April 1929 Katechakis was elected to the Greek Senate. On 22 December 1930, Katechakis was appointed by Venizelos as Minister for Military Affairs, a post he held until the resignation of the Venizelos cabinet on 26 May 1932. Katechakis served for a third time as Minister for Military Affairs in the short-lived 1933 Venizelos cabinet. Georgios Katechakis died on 22 April 1939.

Other specialists involved were Wolfgang Stinnesbeck from the Faculty of Geosciences of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and Eberhard Frey and Marie-C√©line Buchy of the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, Germany. In 2001, the site was evaluated and dispersed remains were recovered. The stratum which contains pliosaur remains was identified. In 2002, a specific excavation began, supported by local people, to cleanse the sediment which contains bone remains of different sizes. Some remains were sent to the Museum of Natural History of Karlsruhe. On January 3, 2003, remains of the Monster of Aramberri arrived in Karlsruhe, boxed in 14 huge containers. The Museum of Natural History of the city of Karlsruhe was the place assigned for its reconstruction. The bones would be prepared by the specialists of the Museum in order to copy them. Copies would stay at the Museum, while originals would return to Mexico. As the Museum of Natural History of Karlsruhe could not accept any more remains because it was at its maximum capacity, new remains were sent to the Museo del Desierto in Saltillo, Coahuila, also in Mexico, where the specialist in marine reptiles, Dra.

The importance of the economics of science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth. Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the operation of scientific institutions.Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. (2008). \\"science, economics of,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Pre-publication cached ccpy. Science as a Public Good Economists consider ‚Äúscience‚Äù as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions. Knowledge can be considered a public good, due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-rivalry), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-excludable). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs. Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of research and development of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development. Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market. Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of public economics. However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls ‚Äúpriority of discovery.‚Äù Robert Merton argues that to goal of scientists is to establish ‚Äúpriority of discovery‚Äù by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledge first, and thus this sets up a winner-takes-all type of system that incentivizes producers to participate in the market of scientific knowledge. Stephen particularly notes that ‚ÄúCompensation in science is generally composed of two parts: one portion is paid regardless of the individual's success in races, the other is priority-based and reflects the value of the winner's contribution to science.‚Äù The first part that Stephens identifies corresponds to the salary that a professor in academia would expect to make over the course of his or her career; these salaries are notoriously flat, with one study noting that a full professor can expect to make only 70% more than a newly hired assistant professor. However, Stephen argues that the second part of compensation, that which is reaped when a scientist establishes priority of discovery, then the earnings profile becomes much less flat as the scientist gains prestige, journalistic citations, paid speaking invitations, and other such rewards. However, she notes that this theory had yet to be empirically tested at the time of writing. Furthermore, her analysis only applies to the world of academia, whereas industry is also a major source of scientific knowledge production. Government Interventions The field of public economics posits that should market failures occur, the government might be able to intervene to correct these market failures. When speaking about the production of scientific knowledge, the government has several options for intervening in the market to attempt to correct the failure. In the United States, two of the most historically popular and most extensively studied options are the patent system and tax incentives. The Patent System Graphical representation of the effect of patents on production of scientific knowledgeIn the United States, the Patent and Trademark Office issues patents that give the holder of the patent exclusive, defined property rights to their product for 20 years. From an economic perspective, the value of the patent is that it increases the marginal benefit of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and marginal benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing returns. For simplicity's sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (MB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&D; is at RD1. The value of the introduction of the patent system is that it allows the marginal benefit curve for the firm to shift upward to MB1 so that the private benefit to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The additional revenue is collected from society, as society now pays higher prices for the knowledge given the monopoly power of the producing firm. In practice, patent law has been correlated with increased R&D; expenditure, indicating that this form of government intervention is in fact incentivizing production. However, this type of government intervention does not allow particularly precise targeting of the optimal level of R&D; production, and several economists argue that the benefit of 20 years of monopoly power is too high. This argument has particular relevance to current debates regarding the production of life- saving pharmaceuticals. Tax Incentives Graphical representation of the effect of tax incentives on production of scientific knowledgeIn 1954, the Internal Revenue Service incorporated an exemption for research costs such that firms could have research costs deducted from their yearly taxes. From an economic perspective, the value of the tax incentive is that it decreases the marginal cost of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing rate of return. For simplicity's sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (PMB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&D; is at RD1, which is where the marginal cost curve intersects the social marginal benefit (not depicted on this graph). The value of the tax incentive is that it allows the marginal cost curve for the firm to shift downward so that the private cost to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The rest of the cost is now borne by society, in the form of the lost tax revenue. Tax incentives allow slightly more precise targeting than the patent system. However, the concern still remains that tax incentives exacerbate inequality by producing financial windfalls for firms that might already be very prosperous. Furthermore, empirical studies have been limited, although a 1996 report from the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment found that for every dollar lost in tax revenue, there was a dollar increasing in private R&D; spending.

Thus many regular regiments received reinforcements armed with nothing more than war scythes The Volunteer Army () was a military formation of the Polish Army, created at the height of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. It was formed by the Council of National Defense on July 1, 1920. Composed entirely of volunteers, the formation did not enter combat as a single entity. Instead, its regiments were attached to other armies or used to replenish the manpower of battle-weary divisions. The army was commanded by Gen. J√≥zef Haller. By the end of September 1920, 105,714 men volunteered for service. Out of them, sixteen regiments of infantry and seven of cavalry were created, in addition to other units. Out of the infantry regiments, only six took part in actual combat; the rest were used as reserves. Following the armistice, most of the volunteers were demobilised.  Background  In late May 1920, after Polish forces had entered Kiev (see Kiev Offensive (1920)), the Red Army began its offensive, which resulted in fast advancing of the Soviets and retreat of Polish forces. In June 1920 in Warsaw, the government of Leopold Skulski was dismissed, and the new cabinet of Wladyslaw Grabski was not created until June 23. The new Prime Minister, well aware of the disastrous situation, created Council of National Defense (July 1, 1920), which was authorized to take decisions regarding the war. The most important task was to mobilize the nation and its resources in defence of the Bolshevik invasion. The Council was headed by Naczelnik Panstwa (head of state) J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and its competences were limitless. On the first day of its creation, the new body, following the notion of Prime Minister, created the Volunteer Army. On July 3, the Council issued an appeal to the nation, in which all citizens of the Commonwealth were urged to join the military. The appeal was supported by all political parties, except for Communists.  Creation  On July 8, 1920, Minister of Military Affairs, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski issued Order Nr 70 29/Org., upon which General Inspectorate of the Volunteer Army was created; J√≥zef Haller became the General Inspector of the Volunteer Army. Polish society responded to the appeal with enthusiasm. By September 30, 1920, 105.714 people volunteered, with most of them, 49,8%, joining the infantry. The first volunteer division was officially formed on July 22 in Modlin, with Adam Koc as its commandant. The division consisted of 101. Reserve and 201., 202. and 205. Volunteer Regiments. Of its four regiments, three were dissolved in November 1920, while the 101. Reserve continued its existence after the Polish ‚Äì Soviet War. It was reinforced by soldiers of the volunteer regiments, and officers of the former Siberian Division, and renamed into 3rd Siberian Regiment. Altogether, the Polish Volunteer Army consisted of six infantry regiments, ten reserve infantry regiments, and seven cavalry regiments.

Background It had been 13 years since the last album recorded by the band, and was much anticipated. Reception from the public was superb with the album reaching record sales in two days, all over the country. The album, like their predecessors, addressed political issues and social criticism, with most songs also penned by band leader Jorge Gonzalez. Three months after the release, Claudio Narea left the band definitively due tensions with Gonz√°lez. This raised inquisitiveness in the media, so much so that in a press conference, Jorge Gonzalez reacted to journalists' questions hitting and knocking microphones down. Therefore, the album was released amidst tensions, little promotional work was done, and singles and video clips release was limited (videoclips were recorded only for \\"Ultra Derecha\\" and \\"San Miguel\\"). Because the band, without Narea, decided to focus on a new album and finding a replacement guitarist (√Ålvaro Henr√≠quez took the role for 4 months), this album ended up being the least known of the group's career.

He is also an author of the introductory calculus-based physics textbook \\"University Physics\\", published by McGraw-Hill in 2013 (2nd edition). Research Wolfgang Bauer obtained his Ph.D. in theoretical nuclear physics from the University of Giessen in 1987. After a post-doctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology, he joined the faculty at Michigan State University in 1988. He has worked on a large variety of topics in computational physics, from high- temperature superconductivity to supernova explosions, but has been especially interested in relativistic nuclear collisions. Nuclear physics Prof. Bauer has a dual appointment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, where he works on nuclear physics topics. He is best known for his work on phase transitions of nuclear matter in heavy ion collisions, and transport theory of heavy ion collisions, in particular as applied to interferometry, particle production, collective flow, and isospin degrees of freedom.  LON-CAPA and Textbook  Prof. Bauer has taught physics and astronomy classes on the undergraduate and graduate level since 1988. He is particularly interested in the introductory physics curriculum for engineering and science majors. For decades he has collaborated closely with his MSU colleagues Walter Benenson and Gary Westfall. They obtained NSF funding to develop novel teaching and laboratory techniques, and authored multimedia physics CDs for their students at MSU's Lyman Briggs School. Based on this work they co-authored cliXX Physik, a complete physics textbook on CD-rom. In 1992, they became early adopters of the Internet for teaching and learning by developing the first version of their online homework system. In subsequent years, they were instrumental in creating the LearningOnline Network with CAPA (LON-CAPA), which is now used at more than 70 universities and colleges in the United States and around the world. Since 2008, Bauer and Westfall have been part of a team of instructors, engineers, and physicists, who investigate the use of peer-assisted learning in the introductory physics curriculum. This project has received funding from the NSF STEM Talent Expansion Program, and its best practices have been incorporated into their textbook \\"University Physics\\", which was published in 2010 by McGraw-Hill, and which has also been translated into Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish languages. The second edition was published in 2013, and an e-book in 2015. Other research topics Prof. Bauer has worked on nonlinear dynamics and chaos, where he is best known for he work on billiards systems and their decays and for his work on buckyball fragmentation. He also worked in bio-medical physics and holds a US patent on cell-by-cell cancer detection. In recent years, he has focused much of his research and teaching on issues concerning energy, including fossil fuel resources, ways to use energy more efficiently, and, in particular, alternative and carbon-neutral energy resources.

She was a princess of Saxony by birth and by marriage a Duchess of Pomerania-Stettin.  Life  Sophie was a daughter of the Elector Christian I of Saxony (1560‚Äì1591) from his marriage to Sophie (1568‚Äì1622), the daughter of Elector John George of Brandenburg. She married on 26 August 1610 in Dresden to Duke Francis of Pomerania-Stettin (1577‚Äì1620). No children were born from this marriage. After Francis's death, Sophie received the city and district of Wolin as her wittum. She administered the district during the difficult years of the Thirty Years' War. Between 1622 and 1626, she built a new residence in Wolin, because the old Wolin Castle was rather dilapidated. After her death, the district fell back to Duke Bogislaw XIV of Pomerania. However, all movable property, such as furniture and the grain stocks, were confiscated by the Swedish army, because Sweden was at war with Saxony and the Sweden considered her a Saxon. Sophie was initially buried in the ducal crypt in Szczecin, but in 1650 her body was transferred to the Sophienkirche in Dresden.

It holds that money is created endogenously by the banking sector, rather than exogenously by central bank lending; it is a theory of endogenous money. It is also called circuitism and the circulation approach.  Contrast with mainstream theory  The key distinction from mainstream economic theories of money creation is that circuitism holds that money is created endogenously by the banking sector, rather than exogenously by the government through central bank lending: that is, the economy creates money itself (endogenously), rather than money being provided by some outside agent (exogenously). These theoretical differences lead to a number of different consequences and policy prescriptions; circuitism rejects, among other things, the money multiplier based on reserve requirements, arguing that money is created by banks lending, which only then pulls in reserves from the central bank, rather than by re- lending money pushed in by the central bank. The money multiplier arises instead from capital adequacy ratios, i.e. the ratio of its capital to its risk-weighted assets.  Circuitist model  Circuitism is easily understood in terms of familiar bank accounts and debit card or credit card transactions: bank deposits are just an entry in a bank account book (not specie ‚Äì bills and coins), and a purchase subtracts money from the buyer's account with the bank, and adds it to the seller's account with the bank.  Transactions  As with other monetary theories, circuitism distinguishes between hard money ‚Äì money that is exchangeable at a given rate for some commodity, such as gold ‚Äì and credit money. The theory considers credit money created by commercial banks as primary (at least in modern economies), rather than derived from central bank money ‚Äì credit money drives the monetary system. While it does not claim that all money is credit money ‚Äì historically money has often been a commodity, or exchangeable for such ‚Äì basic models begin by only considering credit money, adding other types of money later. In circuitism, a monetary transaction ‚Äì buying a loaf of bread, in exchange for dollars, for instance ‚Äì is not a bilateral transaction (between buyer and seller) as in a barter economy, but is rather a tripartite transaction between buyer, seller, and bank. Rather than a buyer handing over a physical good in exchange for their purchase, instead there is a debit to their account at a bank, and a corresponding credit to the seller's account. This is precisely what happens in credit card or debit card transactions, and in the circuitist account, this is how all credit money transactions occur. For example, if one purchases a loaf of bread with fiat money bills, it may appear that one is purchasing the bread in exchange for the commodity of \\"dollar bills\\", but circuitism argues that one is instead simply transferring a credit, here with the issuing central bank: as the bills are not backed by anything, they are ultimately just a physical record of a credit with the central bank, not a commodity.  Monetary creation  In circuitism, as in other theories of credit money, credit money is created by a loan being extended. Crucially, this loan need not (in principle) be backed by any central bank money: the money is created from the promise (credit) embodied in the loan, not from the lending or relending of central bank money: credit is prior to reserves. When the loan is repaid, with interest, the credit money of the loan is destroyed, but reserves (equal to the interest) are created ‚Äì the profit from the loan. Another explanation of the interest, in a simple, non-growth model is the interest enjoyed by the bank is from the spending of interest income of the bank in previous circuit. The same simple model applies for profit as well, in a simple model of non-growth non-modern-bank model composed only by entrepreneurs and the employed workers, entrepreneurs's spending on profit on previous circuit will compose the profit this group enjoy in new circuit. The failure of monetary policy during depressions ‚Äì central banks give money to commercial banks, but the commercial banks do not lend it out ‚Äì is referred to as \\"pushing on a string\\", and is cited by circuitists in favor of their model: credit money is pulled out by loans being made, not pushed out by central banks printing money and giving it to commercial banks to lend.  History  Circuitism was developed by French and Italian economists after World War II; it was officially presented by Augusto Graziani in , following an earlier outline in . The notion and terminology of a money circuit dates at least to 1903, when amateur economist Nicholas Johannsen wrote Der Kreislauf des Geldes und Mechanismus des Sozial-Lebens (The Circuit Theory of Money), under the pseudonym J.J.O. Lahn . In the interwar period, German and Austrian economists studied monetary circuits, under the term , with the term \\"circuit\\" being introduced by French economists following this usage. The main protagonists of the French approach to the monetary circuit is Alain Parguez. Today, the main defenders of the theory of the monetary circuit can be found in the work of Riccardo Realfonzo, Giuseppe Fontana and Riccardo Bellofiore in Italy; and in Canada, in the work of Marc Lavoie, Louis-Philippe Rochon and Mario Seccareccia.  Modeling difficulties  While the verbal description of circuitism has attracted interest, it has proven difficult to model mathematically. Initial efforts to model the monetary circuit proved problematic, with models exhibiting a number of unexpected and undesired properties ‚Äì money disappearing immediately, for instance. These problem go by such names as: * Losses in Circuit * Destruction of Money * Dilemma of profit  See also  * Modern Monetary Theory, another theory of endogenous money * Post-Keynesian economics Further reading   References  Circuit theory Post-Keynesian economics ","title":"Monetary circuit theory"},{"id":"34288544","text":"Emil Wahlstr√∂m (born 2 March 1987) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a centre back for GAIS.

The fictional story is set on the Isle of Man and is concerned with Victor Stowell, the Deemster's son, who commits a romantic indiscretion and then gives up on all of his principles in order to keep it a secret. However, in the face of the mounting consequences, Victor confesses publicly to his crime and is punished, but redemption comes through a woman's love. The penultimate of Caine's novels, it is romantic and moralistic, returning to his regular themes of sin, justice and atonement, whilst also addressing \\"the woman question.\\" It was adapted for a film entitled Name the Man in 1924 by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m. Genesis The central idea for the plot of The Master of Man came from a correspondence which Hall Caine had in September 1908. Following a performance of the theatrical version of his earlier novel, The Christian, Caine was identified as a likely signatory in a petition against the harsh punishment of a woman named Daisy Lord. After giving birth to a child out of wedlock the young woman had killed the child secretly but was discovered and arrested. At the trial she explained that \\"I thought I would put an end to it so that it should not have the trouble I have had.\\"Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 380 Caine signed the petition but he kept the accompanying letter as a record of its story.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, pp. 373 - 384 Hall Caine In writing about the novel for promotional purposes, however, Caine makes no mention of this English case of Daisy Lord. Instead, he attributed his inspiration to a vague story from Manx legal history:'The Master of Man' in Manx Quarterly, Douglas: S. K. Broadbent, Vol. IV, No. 27, October 1921, pp. 257 - 262 > There was [a] judicial scandal in the Isle of Man, which [...] somehow > entered into the region of the heroic, partly by reason of the part played > in it by a great and noble woman. That was the scandal whereof the main > features form the groundwork of the following story - the story of a sin, > perhaps a little or at least a natural and pardonable sin, which, being > concealed and denied at the beginning, went on and on from consequence to > consequence (as all hidden sins must), increasing like a snowball in weight > and momentum until it was in danger of submerging with an avalanche the > entire community. Described as a Roman √† clef by Caine's modern biographer, the novel also used many themes and occurrences from Caine's own life.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 383 - 384 One notable instance of this is the episode where Bessie is sent away to be educated before she would be fit to marry the educated and higher- class Victor Stowell, which clearly recalls Caine's having set up Mary Chandler in Sevenoaks in order to be educated before their own marriage.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 160 - 161 As was usual in Caine's work, he makes no acknowledgement of his main sources, instead writing that \\"while the principal incidents of the tale I have now to tell owe something to reminiscence, I have exercised so freely the storyteller's licence in telling them [...] that I can claim no better authority for my story than that of an independent creation, with a general background of fact.\\" Caine first spoke of his ideas for the novel to Bram Stoker in 1912 shortly before his death. Although Caine then began work on the novel in 1913, he put it aside in order to concentrate on writing in support of the Allies during World War I, apparently not picking it up again until one day after the Armistice, on 12 November 1918. By the autumn of 1919 the book had begun to appear in serial form in magazines in America and in the UK, although the episodes had to be later interrupted and held back due to problems with Caine's health and personal life (through strain on his marriage and also at the death of his publisher, William Heinemann). After working on the novel in St. Moritz, the Savoy Hotel in London and at his home, Greeba Castle, in the Isle of Man, the book was completed and ready for publishing in book form in July 1921. Plot Book I: The Sin Sulby Glen, the apparent location of Bessie's home Victor Stowell, the son of the Deemster (judge), was letting his talents go to waste until he met Fenella Stanley, the Lieutenant Governor's daughter, who inspires him to try to make something of himself. His progress in studying to become an advocate is halted when he learns that Fenella has become a Warden at a Lady's Settlement in London. Understanding that her seven-year contract means that she therefore cannot marry him, Victor slides into disrepute. This leads eventually to his giving into the temptation to sleep with Bessie Collister, who he meets at a dance hall in Douglas. Book II: The Reckoning Determined to marry Bessie for the sake of honour, Victor looks to prepare her for her rise in society by enrolling her at a school in Derbyhaven. The only person he tells of this to is his friend, Alick Gell, who regularly visits Bessie on Victor's behalf. Unaware of Victor's night with Bessie, Fenella unexpectedly returns to the island in order to win Victor's heart. He is able to become engaged to Fenella when Alick admits to being in love with Bessie. By this time Victor has proven himself as a uniquely gifted lawyer, both in his oration and sense of justice. In recognition of this he is put forward for the position of Deemster. Book III: The Consequence Bessie realises that she is pregnant by Victor and flees to have the baby secretly at her mother's house. However, when the baby is born she kills it by mistake as she tries to smother its cries in order to avoid discovery. When the baby's body is found, she is arrested and charged with infanticide. Alick agrees to defend her in court, believing emphatically her denial of the charges. Victor is to sit as Deemster for the first time on this case, unaware of who it concerns. Book IV: The Retribution Castle Rushen, where the trials and imprisonments of the novel take place Victor discovers that the trial is of Bessie but there is no way for him to avoid sitting on the trial. He determines to get the best judgement possible for Bessie in order to mitigate his guilt, even if it compromises justice. However, despite Victor's interfering to support Alick's defence, incontestable evidence appears which links Bessie to the murder. Bound by the law, Victor gives the necessary judgement of execution, with the expectation of the customary mitigation of punishment being issued by the Crown. Both Fenella and Alick leave the courtroom aware of Victor's true involvement with the case. Book V: The Reparation Victor visits Fenella but she tempestuously refuses to forgive him as long as Bessie is imprisoned. Victor then discovers that the Governor has not passed on his request for clemency and so Bessie is to be hanged. Convincing himself that the law is thus unjust and so correct to be overturned, Victor contrives a way of enabling Bessie to escape. He delivers Bessie to Alick, who escapes with her from the island. Book VI: The Redemption When it is discovered that Alick is missing, the Manx people begin to riot, attributing Bessie's escape to him under the tacit blessing of the authorities. The Governor responds by asking Victor to sign a warrant for Alick's arrest. However, realising the rising magnitude of the effects of his crime, Victor confesses to the Governor and asks to resign. When the Governor refuses to accept his resignation, Victor realises that he must make a public declaration of his sins to the people. Fenella realises the extent of her feelings for him and promises to stand by him. Book VII: The Resurrection Victor hands himself in to the police and admits to everything. He is sentenced to two years in the prison at Castle Rushen and is only saved from despair by Fenella's taking a job as a warder in the prison in order to be close to him. The novel concludes with their commitment to one another through marriage, the ceremony being carried out within the prison walls. Publication and Reception The advert which appeared in re-prints of Caine's other novels Whilst writing the book, Caine gave it the working title of The Manx Woman. He was convinced to change the title at the suggestion of his agent at Heinemann, Charly Evans, who wrote: \\"I am convinced that the title The Master of Man has a ring to it like the chimes of Big Ben - something that stirs one to the utmost, and arouses every element of curiosity.\\" Towards the end of its serialisation in magazines, a draft version of the completed book was sent to various friends, critics and public figures to obtain their responses for use in promotional material for the book. His good friend, Robert Leighton, responded emphatically, calling the book \\"your supreme achievement‚Ä¶ the greatest and most perfect thing you have done. It seems to me you know human nature with absolute success.\\"Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 382 However, the majority of those who received the book sent acknowledgements that were merely brief and polite. The most flattering extracts from these letters were included at the back of a limited edition of 100 copies of the book that were presented to Caine's family and friends. The book went on sale in July 1921 with an initial printing of 100,000 copies, announced in the Manx press as \\"to be immediately made available for the vast English holiday crowd that sets out on its annual vacation about the last week of July.\\" The entirety of this print run sold out within a matter of days and the book immediately topped the best-seller list. However, Caine was bemused and annoyed to find that it held the top-selling spot for only for a short space of time. The book was published in twelve translations in fifteen countries simultaneously with the British edition;'Works by Sir Hall Caine KBE' in William Cubbon, A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man Douglas: The Victoria Press, 1939 in Australia, Bohemia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Unlike previous Caine novels, this book failed to reach the top-selling spot in the United States, where the highest place it reached was third. Quotes from the press reaction to the novel, included in later editions of the book, were remarkable for drawing comparisons between Caine and Tolstoy:Critical reception of The Master of Man quoted in the 1927 Cassell & Co. edition of the book (available on the Manx Literature Flickr page (accessed December 20, 2013)) * \\"A great novel. Will stand as the English Anna Karenina.\\" (The Daily Graphic) * \\"Sir Hall Caine in The Master of Man has shown himself to be the English Tolstoy.\\" (J. Cuming Walters in the Manchester City News) * \\"It places him to the same rank, as a great world novelist, with Zola, Hugo and Tolstoy.\\" (Leeds Mercury) However, the general critical response was less positive. In the 27 years since Caine's great success of The Manxman, literary tastes had moved on and his didactic and melodramatic style was now distinctly out of fashion. This was put starkly in a review in The North American Review, where it was noted that \\"the sentiment aroused by the story depends in large measure upon an arbitrary and unreal contrast between Stowell's character and the things he does and suffers,\\" and that \\"the novel as a whole is condemned by its sham inevitableness and its reckless idealizations.\\"Book review of The Master of Man in The North American Review, Vol. 214, No. 792, Nov. 1921, pp. 716-717 Caine's modern biographer observes that even just the central plot point of Victor Stowell becoming Deemster \\"seems so unlikely as to vitiate the story at its central point.\\" Coming ten years before his death, during which time only The Woman of Knockaloe was published, this novel is considered to \\"effectively round off the Hall Caine canon.\\"Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 396 Adaptations Mae Busch, who played Bessie Collister in the 1924 film adaptation As for previous Hall Caine novels, a play adaptation was planned. However, it never materialised for The Master of Man. The film version of the book was negotiated by Caine's son, Derwent Hall Caine, who received a call on the matter directly from Samuel Goldwyn even before the book had been published. The film adaptation, released in America under the title Name the Man, initially had Maurice Tourneur as the director, having shot a film version of Caine's The Christian the previous year. However, he was replaced by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m before filming began. Sj√∂str√∂m wanted to change the leading actress, but Goldwyn Pictures was already committed to a contract with Mae Busch, who was to star as Bessie Collister.Transition and Transformation: Victor Sj√∂str√∂m in Hollywood, 1923-1930 by Bo Florin, Amsterdam University Press: Amsterdam, 2013, p. 34 The other leading actors in the film included Conrad Nagel as Victor Stowell, Hobart Bosworth as Christian Stowell (Victor's father), Creighton Hale as Alick Gell, and Patsy Ruth Miller as Fenella Stanley. After filming in Hollywood, the film was released in America on 27 January 1924.Entrance for Name the Man on iMDb The advertising for the film's release included the following notable description of the story:Name the Man promotional material available on The Silent Film Still Archive (accessed 15 December 2013) > \\"It is a bit of Reality carved right out of life itself - as real as the > face of your mother, or your own hand.

This is accurately described in the novel, and it is also clearly the model for the separate ruined church of Chapter 4, described as \\"on a lonesome spot by the sea\\" with an old Norse burial mound marked off by railing.The Master of Man by Hall Caine, London: Cassell & Company, 1927, Chapter 4, III, p. 45 * Baldromma flour mill: the home of Bessie Collister. Although it is not mentioned which glen this is located in, it is almost certainly to be understood as Sulby Glen. A mill actually named Baldromma on the Isle of Man was in fact located in Maughold. * Government House: the home of Fenella Stanley and her father. This is a genuine description of the house in Onchan which has been the home of the Lieutenant Governor since 1904. * Athol Street, Douglas: the street where Victor and Alick lodge whilst students-at-law at the Attorney-General's Office. It is also here that Alick rents a house in preparation for marrying Bessie. * Old Post Office Street, Ramsey: the location of Victor's lodgings and law practice, where he commits the crucial act of the novel with Bessie. * Castle Mona, Douglas: the place where Victor and Alick relax before they go to the dancehall where Victor encounters Bessie. This was built in 1804 as a mansion for John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl. It is evocatively described by Caine in Chapter 8 in its form as a popular destination for English tourists. * Prospect Hill, Douglas: the focal point of the uprisings that follow Bessie and Alick's escape. * Derbyhaven: the home of the Brown sisters, where Bessie is sent to be educated. * Castle Rushen: the location of the trials and imprisonments of both Bessie and Victor. Quotations * Love might be the light of life, but men and women all the world over had for one reason or other to marry without it. Millions of hearts in all ages were like old battlefields, with dead things, which nobody knew of, lying about in the dark places. And yet the world went on. [Book I, Chapter 10, p. 113] *Crime was contagious like disease, and there was an epidemic of violence in the world now. If society was to be saved from anarchy the law alone could save it. [Book II, Chapter 18, p. 192] * The memory of its great men was a nation's greatest inheritance. [Book III, Chapter 20, p. 208] * You've opened my ears to the cry of the suffering of woman, and that is the saddest sound, perhaps, that breaks on the shores of life. [Book III, Chapter 23, p. 245] * A bad man counts on a woman's silence. [Book IV, Chapter 27, III, p. 297] * With love lost and hope quenched, the soul of the world was dead, and the heavens were dark above him. [Book V, Chapter 32, p. 351] * There was something childlike in sudden joy; Paradise itself must be a place of children. [Book V, Chapter 37, II, p. 401] * Was this the mystery of sin - that it must go on and on, from consequence to consequence, deep as the sea and unsearchable as the night? [Book VI, Chapter 41, p. 432] * Resist this great temptation and peace will come to you. Do the right, and no matter how low you may fall in the eyes of men, you will look upon the face of God. [Book VI, Chapter 42, p. 440] Manx cultural references The spine of the 1924 Cassell reprint of the novel As with his other novels set in the Isle of Man, Caine uses a great many unreferenced sources for the various episodes through which he gives the novel \\"a rather thin though persuasive effect of primitiveness in the Manx environment,\\" as one American reviewer described it. The more prominent Manx references within the novel include the following: * Whilst on the Governor's boat Victor and Fenella sing two traditional Manx songs, Mylecharaine (\\"Molla-caraine\\" in the text) and \\"Kiree fo naighty\\" (\\"Sheep Under the Snow\\" in English). The latter Victor reports as having been written in Castle Rushen \\"by a poor wretch whose life had been sworn away by a vindictive woman.\\"The Master of Man by Hall Caine, London: Cassell & Company, 1927, Chapter 14, p.156 This story behind Kiree fo naighty comes from William Harrison's 1869 Mona Miscellany.'Ny kirree fo-sniaghtey' in Mona Miscellany by William Harrison, Douglas: The Manx Society, 1869, pp. 126 - 132 * Whilst on the Governor's ship Victor tells the tale of the Mauthe Dhoo of Peel Castle (Chapter 13, II). This is a well-known story on the island with many variants, but the main sources for Caine would be George Waldron's 1731 History and Description of the Isle of ManThe History and Description of the Isle of Man by George Waldron, London: W. Bickerton, 1731 and Sophia Morrison's Manx Fairy Tales.'The Moddey Doo or the Black Dog of Peel Castle' in Manx Fairy Tales by Sophia Morrison, London: David Nutt, 1911 * Whilst in Derbyhaven, Bessie visits the Oie'l Verry Manx language service on Christmas Eve. The Carvel of Bad Women that is sung, described by Caine as a \\"catalogue of all the bad women mentioned in the Bible, from Eve, the mother of mankind, who brought evil into the world, to 'that graceless wench, Salome,'\\"The Master of Man by Hall Caine, London: Cassell & Company, 1927, Chapter 19, II, p. 204 can be found in the 1873 Second Series of William Harrison's Mona Miscellany.'Carval ny Drogh Vraane' in Mona Miscellany: Second Series by William Harrison, Douglas: The Manx Society, 1873, pp. 146 - 159 * When Bessie visits the \\"witch\\" in Cregneash in order to discover her future, she notes a crosh cuirn, a cross of mountain ash, on the back of the door (Chapter 19, II). This it was a common traditional folk practice to ward off witches and fairies, mentioned in numerous sources, including A. W. Moore's 1891 The Folklore of the Isle of Man.The Folklore of the Isle of Man by A. W. Moore, Douglas: Brown & Son, 1891, Chapter 6 * The episode where Victor imagines himself being judged in the afterlife by Bessie for his sins (Chapter 32) is a clear reference to the poem, 'Catherine Kinrade', by T. E. Brown. The poem imagines Bishop Wilson being judged at heaven's gates by Catherine Kinrade who he punished severely for giving birth to a child out of wedlock, as was described by Caine in Chapter 13. 'Catherine Kinrade' by T. E. Brown, in The Collected Poems of T. E. Brown, London: Macmillan and Co., 1909 * In Chapter 25, Victor speaks to Fenella of the belief that a town lies beneath the sea off the coast of the Isle of Man. This is a reference to the story of 'The Enchanted Isle', best known from its inclusion in the 1925 edition of Manx Fairy Tales by Sophia Morrison. The story had earlier appeared in George Waldron's A Description of the Isle of Man in 1731. * In Chapter 32, Bessie's mother hears a child crying as she walks around the area where Bessie had deposited the body of her child. The crying only stops when she calls out to name the child. This story is taken directly from 'The Child Without A Name', collected by Sophia Morrison in Manx Fairy Tales. The original has the location as by Lag-ny-Killey near Eary Cushlin, with the names for the child as Juan or Joanny, rather than Caine's anglicised versions of the same names, John or Joney.'The Child Without A Name' in Manx Fairy Tales by Sophia Morrison, London: David Nutt, 1911 * When Fenella becomes a warder at Castle Rushen, the rooms allocated to her are those of \\"Charlotte de la Tremouille (Countess of Derby), when, in the absence of her husband, she held the fortress for weeks against the siege of Cromwell‚Äôs forces.\\"The Master of Man by Hall Caine, London: Cassell & Company, 1927, Chapter 45, III, p. 469 This is a reference to Charlotte Stanley (1599‚Äì1664). However, her successful repelling of Parliamentarian forces took place in Lancashire at the Siege of Lathom House; she was forced to surrender Castle Rushen to the Parliamentarians upon their arrival on the Isle of Man. Trivia * Some of Bessie's phrases and expressions are taken directly from letters that Caine had kept from correspondences with a sweetheart named Marie Lange, from back in 1877.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, pp. 52 - 53 * 'Baldromma', the name of the mill where Bessie lived with her parents, was actually the name of a farm near Maughold Head. Caine bought some land from the farm in September 1908 with the idea of erecting a 'Caine Memorial Tower' in his own memory. However, the idea never came to fruition.Hall Caine: Portrait of a Victorian Romancer by Vivian Allen, Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, p. 329 * Caine's wife was frustrated that the novel should be set in the Isle of Man, a nation that she by this time disliked, writing to him that she wished he'd drop it and \\"write another Eternal City\\" (referring to his 1901 novel set in Rome). * In Chapter 47, Parson Cowley makes the decision to marry Fenella and Victor only after considering a picture of a consumptive sailor who his wife refers to as John James. This is a reference by Caine to his own brother named John James who died of consumption in 1877. * Caine's first full-length Manx novel, The Deemster, is alluded to in Chapter 29 when he writes: \\"A man might carry his sin out to sea, and bury it in the deepest part of the deep, but some day it would come [...] to lie open and naked on the beach.\\"The Master of Man by Hall Caine, London: Cassell & Company, 1927, Chapter 29, II, p. 325 This occurs as a central event in the earlier novel, when a murdered body floats to the surface of the sea.

She was one of the accused in the famous Poison affair. It was Marie Bosse who pointed out the central figure La Voisin. Bosse, the widow of a horse trader, was one of the most successful fortune tellers in Paris. Unofficially, she was also a poisoner, who provided poison to people who wished to commit murder. By the end of 1678, Bosse attended a party held by her friend Marie Vigoreaux, the wife of a dressmaker, in the Rue Courtauvilain. During the party, she became drunk and boasted freely that she had become so wealthy by selling deadly poisons to members of the aristocracy that she would soon be able to retire. At the time, the Paris police was investigating poison sales in Paris. A guest at the party, the lawyer Maitre Perrin, reported the conversation to the police. The police sent the wife of a police officer to Bosse to ask for poison to murder her husband, and Bosse provided her with what proved to be deadly poison. On the morning 4 January 1679, Marie Bosse was arrested with her daughter Manon and her sons, Fran√ßois and Guillaume. Her older son was a soldier in the royal guard, the younger one was recently released from a working house. According to the report, when the family was arrested they were found in the only bed in the house and had committed incest. Marie Vigoreaux was arrested the same day, and was found to have close ties to the family, as she had sexual relations with all of the members of the family. Their confessions revealed that the illegal sale of poison in the capital was handled by a network of fortune tellers. This led to the arrest of the central figure La Voisin and the opening of the Poison affair. Marie Bosse confessed to having provided the poison used by Marguerite de Poulaillon in her attempted murder of her husband. Marie Vigoreux died during interrogation under torture 9 May 1679. Marie Bosse was condemned to death by burning and executed in Paris on 8 May 1679. Her children and associates were also sentenced to death.

Plot A young Italian boy, Bambino, goes on a midnight boat trip with his father Pap√† and grandfather Nonno in Genoa, Italy. After they anchor in the middle of the sea, Nonno presents Bambino with a cap similar to the ones he and Pap√† wear. The two men disagree on how Bambino should wear it, with Pap√† pulling it low over his eyes and Nonno pushing it back on his head. Pap√† sets up a long ladder for Bambino to climb so he can set an anchor on the full moon, and the three ascend to start their work of sweeping fallen stars off the lunar surface. Pap√† urges Bambino to use a pushbroom on the stars, while Nonno favors a besom broom. As they quarrel, a huge star crashes on the moon; it is far too large for any of them to move. Turning his cap backward, the way he wants to wear it, Bambino climbs onto the star and taps it with a hammer. It bursts apart into hundreds of smaller stars, and all three go to work sweeping them to one side, with Bambino choosing a rake instead of either man's broom. Once the job is done, they climb down to their boat and look up at the moon, which now displays a glowing crescent phase thanks to their efforts. The plot was inspired by Casarosa's childhood and tales by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and Italo Calvino. The style comes from Hayao Miyazaki's anime and from La Linea by the Italian cartoonist Osvaldo Cavandoli.

He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a union that gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle. Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the resulting warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154. Background and early life Following King Henry I's death in 1135, the succession was disputed between the king's nephews‚ÄîStephen and his elder brother, Theobald II, Count of Champagne‚Äîand Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after the king's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine, and secured the support of her maternal uncle, the Scottish king David I, and in 1138 also that of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I. Nobles in the Welsh Marches revolted against Stephen in 1136, but the revolt was not settled until 1138. In 1139, Matilda invaded southern England with her half-brother's support and the period of civil war began.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 71‚Äì73 Josce was the youngest son of Geoffrey de Dinan and Radegonde Orieldis, and had two older brothers, Oliver of Dinan and Alan of Becherel.Jones Family of Dinan p. 20 Josce's family was from Brittany, and he was described by the historian Marjorie Chibnall as an \\"obscure Breton adventurer\\".Quoted in Chibnall Empress Matilda p. 123 Josce moved from Devon in southern England to the Welsh Marches, the border between England and Wales, because the lords of Monmouth were also of Breton extraction. While in the Marches he joined King Stephen's household.Coplestone-Crow \\"From Foundation to the Anarchy\\" Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings p. 27 Ludlow Castle Josce was married to Sybil, the widow of Pain fitzJohn, who died in 1137. Sybil had held Ludlow Castle against Stephen in 1139, but surrendered after a siege. Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold for control of the Welsh Borders, and Stephen decided to marry Pain's widow to someone he felt was trustworthy.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 102 and footnote 55 Upon his marriage Josce also acquired control of the castle, built in the late 11th century. Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy family's holdings in southern Shropshire, but he rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king. Josce's position was so strong that when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Ludlow was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.Chibnall Empress Matilda pp. 123‚Äì124 Custody of Ludlow was contested not only by Stephen but also by Gilbert de Lacy, whose efforts to wrest the castle from Josce are the background to the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn;Coplestone-Crow \\"Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle\\" Shropshire History and Archaeology p. 181 the extant prose version dates from the 14th century, but it was originally a 13th-century poem, now lost.Burgess \\"Introduction\\" Two Medieval Outlaws p. 91 Gilbert claimed the castle through his familial link with Sybil, fitzJohn's widow, who was a member of the de Lacy family.Coplestone-Crow \\"Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle\\" Shropshire History and Archaeology p. 180 Others trying to take Ludlow were Hugh de Mortimer and Gilbert de Lacy. According to the Chronicle of Wigmore Abbey, some time after September 1148 Mortimer and Josce became embroiled in a private war, during which Josce seized Mortimer while the latter was travelling. Josce imprisoned his captive in Ludlow and demanded a ransom of 3,000 silver marks, as well as, according to the Chronicle, Mortimer's \\"plate, his horses, and his birds\\".Quoted in Coplestone-Crow \\"From Foundation to the Anarchy\\" Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings p. 32 Presumably, Mortimer met the ransom, as he is later known to have been a free man. While Josce was absent from Ludlow, Gilbert de Lacy was able to take the castle. Josce laid siege to the castle but was unsuccessful in his attempt to retake it,Pettifer English Castles p. 212 and retreated to Lambourn with his military forces. Although the exact date of this event is unknown, it appears to have been some time about 1150 or shortly before.Coplestone-Crow \\"From Foundation to the Anarchy\\" Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings p. 34 Matilda gave Josce some lands around Lambourn after Ludlow's fall as compensation.Chibnall Empress Matilda p. 125 Later he was given land in Berkshire by King Henry II (became king in 1154), Matilda's son, as further recompense for the loss of Ludlow.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 434 In 1156 Josce held lands in Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Devonshire and Somerset. These holdings included the manor of Lambourn, worth ¬£76 in income per year, as well as the manor of Stanton (now known as Stanton Fitzwarren in Wiltshire) in addition to the lands scattered in other counties.Jones Family of Dinan p. 28 Josce's grandson Fulk fitzWarin, who died in 1258, is ostensibly the hero of a lost romantic poem called Fouke le Fitz Waryn. The work survives as French prose in a loose corpus of medieval literature known as the Matter of England.Cartlidge Boundaries in Medieval Romance, pp. 29‚Äì42 However, it appears to confuse events of Fulk fitzWarin's lifetime with those of his grandfather's. Other errors in the work include transposing some of the Welsh Marcher barons of King Henry I of England's reign into nobles of William the Conqueror's time, and omitting an entire generation of fitzWarins.Hathaway, et al. \\"Introduction\\" Fouke le Fitz Warin p. xxviii Although scholars believe Fouke le Fitz Waryn draws on genuine tradition, the difficulty in separating the fitzWarin biographies makes it a problematic source.Jones Family of Dinan p. 30 Family Josce died in 1166. He was survived by two daughters: Sibil, who married Hugh de Pulgenet and died in 1212, and Hawise who married Fulk fitzWarin, who died in 1197. In 1199 his two daughters petitioned the king regarding the ownership of the town and castle of Ludlow but were turned down.Coplestone-Crow \\"End of the Anarchy to the de Genevilles\\" Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings pp. 36‚Äì37 Notes Citations References    Further reading * Anglo-Normans Norman warriors 1166 deaths 12th-century English people Year of birth unknown History of Ludlow ","title":"Josce de Dinan"},{"id":"34288895","text":"Shelekhovsky (masculine), Shelekhovskaya (feminine), or Shelekhovskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Shelekhovsky District, a district of Irkutsk Oblast, Russia *Shelekhovskoye Urban Settlement, a municipal formation which the town of Shelekhov in Shelekhovsky District of Irkutsk Oblast, Russia is incorporated as ","title":"Shelekhovsky"},{"id":"34288896","text":"Slavyansk-na-Kubani is an airport in Slavyansk-na-Kubani Krasnodar Krai Russia located on the southern outskirts of the city, 5 km from the center.

Life  Although \\"a proud Scot,\\" Kerr spent most of his eighty-eight years in South Africa. He grew up at Fort Hare University, where his father, Alexander Kerr, was the founding principal, and registered for a Bachelor of Arts at what was then known as the Rhodes University College in 1939. He completed his postgraduate degree (LLB) at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1949, and returned to Rhodes as a lecturer in the Department of Law in 1955. Promoted to senior lecturer in 1958, he attained the rank of Professor of Law on 1 October 1968, and was Head of the Department of Law from 1 June 1984 to 31 December 1987, and Dean of the Faculty from 1 June 1984, to 30 June 1990. He acted as Vice-Principal for three periods and as Principal of the University for short periods when both the Vice Principal and Principal were absent from Grahamstown. On 8 February 1993, in recognition of his services to the law of South Africa, State President FW de Klerk conferred on him letters patent, making Kerr then one of only eleven academic lawyers in South Africa to attain the honorary status of Senior Counsel. In recognition of his service to Rhodes, Kerr was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) in 1995, thus following in the footsteps of his father, who had been awarded an LLD (hc) by Rhodes in 1961. He retired in 1990 but retained an office in the faculty, remaining its most prolific author until, in 2010, the 71st year of his association with the university, he was hospitalised for heart surgery. On 27 September, Kerr sustained head injuries in a fall and died in Grahamstown. Graham Glover, Associate Professor of Law at Rhodes, and for many years Kerr's prot√©g√©, described him as \\"one of the most formidable intellects in the South African legal system\\" and \\"one of the country's leading authorities of the law of contract and customary law.\\"  Research interests  Kerr's research interests embraced contract, agency, sale, lease and customary law. His first two books were Native common law of immovable property in South Africa (1953) and The Native Law of Succession in South Africa (1961). These two works were later combined under the title The Customary Law of Immoveable Property and of Succession, which has run to three editions. In 1963, his jurisprudential work, Law and Justice, a Christian Exposition, was published. Perhaps his best-known and most influential books are The Principles of the Law of Contract, now in its sixth edition (2002); The Law of Agency, his PhD thesis, now in its third edition (1991); and The Law of Lease (1969), which has been subsumed into a larger work entitled The Law of Sale and Lease, now in its third edition (2004). Kerr also wrote a smaller, two-volume work, Introduction to the Law of Contract (1994), now in its second edition, designed for commercial law students, as well as the preliminary note to the \\"Lease\\" section of The South African Encyclopaedia of Farms and Precedents other than Court Forms. Kerr was also responsible for the chapter on \\"Customary Family Law\\" in Butterworths' Family Law Service (edited by Brigitte Clark), the contributions on Sale in The Law of South Africa (vol. XXIV, edited by Professor WA Joubert) and the re-issue of that volume, along with the contributions on lease in the First Re-issue Vol 14 (the original text having been by JG L√∂tz). Kerr published well over 100 items in leading law journals and other periodicals.

(7 episodes)  Recurring cast  Production Conception On November 8, 2011, co-creator Joe Gayton spoke of the series' origins. \\"We [Tony and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that‚Äôs great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. And then, I heard about this Hell on Wheels place and I went, 'What a great setting for a western.' So, we pitched that to Jeremy Gold [at Endemol] and ended up taking it to AMC, and they loved it,\\" he said. Hell on Wheels was created by Joe and Tony Gayton in late 2008, and Endemol USA's scripted television division, headed by senior vice president of original programming Jeremy Gold, came on board to develop the series for AMC. On May 18, 2010, AMC placed a pilot order for Hell on Wheels with Endemol USA. Joe and Tony Gayton wrote the pilot, David Von Ancken was attached to the project as director, with Jeremy Gold, Joe Gayton and Tony Gayton serving as executive producers. On July 6, 2010, Endemol USA announced that they had entered into a partnership with Entertainment One, who would serve as the production studio on the project. Part of the deal between the two companies included provisions of international distribution, with Endemol retaining rights to the series across Europe, while Entertainment One acquired rights to Hell on Wheels in all remaining territories. As a result of the deal, Entertainment One also holds global rights for DVD and Blu-ray sales, as well as video-on-demand and other digital distribution services. The Canadian production company Nomadic Pictures was brought onto the project to serve as co-producers alongside Entertainment One. The pilot was delivered to AMC executives in November 2010. On November 12, 2010 it was reported by Deadline that the executives at AMC were impressed with the pilot, and, coupled with the fact that the network had just cancelled their drama series, Rubicon, were likely to order Hell on Wheels to series. On December 15, 2010, AMC green-lighted the series with an order of 10 episodes. Along with the series pickup, AMC announced that Nomadic Pictures would again co-produce the series, as they had done for the pilot, with Mike Frislev and Chad Oakes joining the series as producers while John Shiban and David Von Ancken joined the series as executive producers; Von Ancken had previously served as director on the pilot. The network also announced that John Morayniss and Michael Rosenberg would oversee production for Entertainment One, while Joel Stillerman and Susie Fitzgerald would oversee production for AMC. Filming Filming of the first season took place in Calgary, as well as areas in central and southern Alberta, Canada. The T'suu T'ina Native Indian Reservation, an Indian reserve in southern Alberta, was the location for most of the exteriors.

Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times says the show \\"takes its cues more from the movies than from life ... Still, for all the unlikely things [the creators] make happen in order to get their characters into place, and the dogged refusal of a couple of those characters to become interesting at all, the show gathers steam as it goes on.\\"Lloyd, Robert. 'Hell on Wheels' review: It takes a while to get chugging along, Los Angeles Times, November 4, 2011. The Wall Street Journals Nancy Dewolf Smith considers the series \\"like a bag of unpolished stones ...

Brian Lowry of Variety thinks \\"while the diverse mix of characters could work to the program's advantage over the long haul, jumping to and fro among them creates a diluted, herky- jerky ride in the early going.\\"Lowry, Brian.

April 1683), was a French professional occultist and alleged sorcerer. He was one of the chief accused in the famous Poison Affair. Career Lesage came from Venoix near Caen and was originally a wool trader. He later moved to Paris and was there employed in the organisation of La Voisin, an organisation of occultists who also provided poisons, with the task to perform alleged magical rituals. In 1667, he officiated, alongside abb√© Mariette in a black mass, arranged by La Voisin for the royal mistress Madame de Montespan, where she asked for the king to love her by the help of Satan. The same year, Lesage was condemned to the galleys for having participated in black masses; he was freed in 1672 by the connections of La Voisin and resumed his position in her organisation. Lesage was the lover of La Voisin, and despite being already married, he promised to marry her if she became a widow, and persuaded her to kill her husband. She initially agreed, but changed her mind before the murder was completed and forced Lesage to abort the whole plan. Lesage's main task in the organisation was to perform magic for the customers. His most common task was to post wishes to the Devil. He asked the client to write down their wish on a piece of paper, which he embedded in a ball of wax, and then burned. Some time later, he retrieved the ball from the flames and claimed that the Devil had read it. Arrest and confession Adam Lesage was arrested 22 May 1679 as a part of the network of La Voisin during the Poison Affair in 1679. He was arrested alongside abb√© Mariotte on the order of the monarch himself, charged with having officiated at black masses. He confessed to having performed magical tasks for the organisation, but stated that they had all been cons, and that he had fooled his colleagues as well as the clients. In July-August 1680, after the execution of La Voisin on 22 February, her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin, made a full confession, revealing the client list of her mother, which included the king's mistress Madame de Montespan, and the aphrodisiacs, black masses and murder of the king ordered by Montespan. Minister Louvois now promised Lesage his freedom if he made a complete confession. The confession made by Lesage on 26 September 1680 confirmed the statement made by Marguerite Monvoisin, but it also included claims that the black masses, which were regularly attended by the ladies of the royal court, had included child sacrifice. His statement was considered so horrifying that it was not accepted as truth, but then on 30 September - 1 October, his statement about child sacrifice, as well as the statements of Montespan, were confirmed by the confession of Francoise Filastre. Already on 1 October, it was rapported to Louis XIV, who ordered the entire process to be closed. The sittings of the Chambre Ardente were suspended until 19 May 1681, and finally closed on 21 July 1682. The 9 October, Marguerite Monvoisin confirmed that the black masses had included child sacrifice, and on 10 October, it was confirmed by √âtienne Guibourg. In November, Montespan was further implicated when her chamber lady, Claude de Vin des ≈íillets, was identified by the prisoners. Later life Adam Lesage, √âtienne Guibourg, Marguerite Monvoisin and a number of others involved were never brought to trial, which would have made their testimonies public. Instead, their confessions were sealed, and they were imprisoned for life by lettre de cachet. Lesage, together with Guibourg, Louis Galet and Romani, were imprisoned at the Chateau de Besancon, while Marguerite Monvoison, together with La Pelletiere, La Poulain, La Delaporte and Catherine Leroy were incarcerated at Belle-√éle-en-Mer. In April 1683, Lesage indicated to the governor of Besancon that he had information about a plot toward the monarch. Louvois recommended that he be put on water and bread and beaten day and night to make him talk, but that he was a habitual liar. His date of death is unknown.

The element Aij of the matrix is equal to f(ri, rj): Aij = f(ri, rj).  History  Euclidean random matrices were first introduced in 1999. They studied a special case of functions f that depend only on the distances between the pairs of points: f(r, r‚Ä≤) = f(r - r‚Ä≤) and imposed an additional condition on the diagonal elements Aii, :Aij = f(ri  rj) - u Œ¥ij‚àëkf(ri  rk), motivated by the physical context in which they studied the matrix. A Euclidean distance matrix is a particular example of Euclidean random matrix with either f(ri  rj) = ri  rj2 or f(ri  rj) = ri  rj. For example, in many biological networks, the strength of interaction between two nodes depends on the physical proximity of those nodes. Spatial interactions between nodes can be modelled as a Euclidean random matrix, if nodes are placed randomly in space.  Properties  Because the positions of the points {ri} are random, the matrix elements Aij are random too. Moreover, because the N√óN elements are completely determined by only N points and, typically, one is interested in N‚â´d, strong correlations exist between different elements. Example of the probability distribution of eigenvalues Œõ of the Euclidean random matrix generated by the function f(r, r‚Ä≤) = sin(k0«Är-r‚Ä≤«Ä)/(k0«Är-r‚Ä≤«Ä), with k0 = 2œÄ/Œª0. The Marchenko-Pastur distribution (red) is compared with the result of numerical diagonalization of a set of randomly generated matrices of size N√óN. The density of points is œÅŒª03 = 0.1.  Hermitian Euclidean random matrices  Hermitian Euclidean random matrices appear in various physical contexts, including supercooled liquids, phonons in disordered systems, and waves in random media. Example 1: Consider the matrix √Ç generated by the function f(r, r‚Ä≤) = sin(k0r-r‚Ä≤)/(k0r-r‚Ä≤), with k0 = 2œÄ/Œª0. This matrix is Hermitian and its eigenvalues Œõ are real. For N points distributed randomly in a cube of side L and volume V = L3, one can show that the probability distribution of Œõ is approximately given by the Marchenko-Pastur law, if the density of points œÅ = N/V obeys œÅŒª03 ‚â§ 1 and 2.8N/(k0 L)2 < 1 (see figure). Example of the probability distribution of eigenvalues Œõ of the Euclidean random matrix generated by the function f(r, r‚Ä≤) = exp(ik0«Är-r‚Ä≤«Ä)/(k0«Är-r‚Ä≤«Ä), with k0 = 2œÄ/Œª0 and f(r= r‚Ä≤) = 0.  Non-Hermitian Euclidean random matrices  A theory for the eigenvalue density of large (N‚â´1) non-Hermitian Euclidean random matrices has been developed and has been applied to study the problem of random laser. Example 2: Consider the matrix √Ç generated by the function f(r, r‚Ä≤) = exp(ik0r-r‚Ä≤)/(k0r-r‚Ä≤), with k0 = 2œÄ/Œª0 and f(r= r‚Ä≤) = 0. This matrix is not Hermitian and its eigenvalues Œõ are complex. The probability distribution of Œõ can be found analytically if the density of point œÅ = N/V obeys œÅŒª03 ‚â§ 1 and 9N/(8k0 R)2 < 1 (see figure).

He headed the Latin America department of the Foreign Office from 1973 to 1977, before his ministerial appointment as charg√© d'affaires in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 1977 until 1980, where he monitored the disputed sovereignty of islands in the Beagle Channel, and the Falklands. This was followed by a two-year secondment to Northern Engineering Industries International Limited. From 1982 to 1985 Carless served as Ambassador to Venezuela until his retirement. He retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1985 on superannuation. Following his retirement in 1985, Carless served as Vice-Chairman of the South Atlantic Council based in London, and between 1994 and 1996 he chaired the influential series of Argentine-British Conferences which helped to re-instate full diplomatic relations between the two countries after the Falklands war. He was the executive vice-president of the philanthropic Hinduja Foundation, which awarded scholarships to students from India. During his service as First Secretary in Tehran in 1956, Carless received a telegraph from the British explorer and travel writer, Eric Newby, requesting him to accompany Newby on an expedition to the province of Nuristan in northern Afghanistan, to which Carless replied in the affirmative. This expedition was the subject of Newby's much loved travel book A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush (1958). Carless married Brazilian Rosa Maria Frontini in 1956. The couple had two sons.

It was her statement, made after the execution of her mother, that implicated the royal mistress Madame de Montespan in the process, causing Louis XIV to eventually disrupt the whole investigation and classify it as secret. Life Marie Marguerite Monvoisin was the daughter of the jeweler Antoine Monvoisin and the famous professional fortune teller La Voisin. Her mother was in fact the center of a criminal network providing poison and black masses for the aristocracy. She was not arrested with her mother on 12 March 1679, but remained with her father until his death of natural causes in May 1679.Anne Somerset - The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide, and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV (St. Martin's Press (October 12, 2003) ) On 26 January 1680, she and her two brothers were arrested and taken to Vincennes for questioning. The reason for their arrest is unknown. Testimony In July and August 1680, after the execution of her mother in February, Marguerite Monvoisin made a confession which revealed her mother's list of clients, her connection to Madame de Montespan and the attempted murder of the monarch. About the same time, Adam Lesage made his confession, which added that child sacrifice had taken place during the black masses arranged by La Voisin. On 1 October, Fran√ßoise Filastre confirmed Monvoisin's statement about Montespan and Lesage's statement about child sacrifice. The confession involved so many people of high rank that the king ordered the official investigation closed. On 9 October, Monvoisin confirmed the statement of child sacrifice made by Lesage and Filastre, followed by the confirmation of √âtienne Guibourg on 10 October. The statement of Marguerite Monvoisin was considered vital, in particular as she was not accused to have taken part in any crime personally, but was exclusively a witness. Imprisonment The remaining members of the organisation were never put on trial, but incarcerated for life by lettre de cachet, and their confessions were sealed. All the prisoners were condemned to silence and their guards informed that they tend to be habitual liars about Madame de Montespan. √âtienne Guibourg, Louis Galet, Adam Lesage and Romani were incarcerated at Ch√¢teau de Besan√ßon, and Betrand at Ch√¢teau de Salces; Marguerite Monvoisin, together with her mother's female associates La Pelleti√®re, La Poulain, Magdelaine Chapelain, Marguerite Delaporte and Catherine Leroy, were imprisoned at Belle-√éle-en-Mer. The date of her death is unknown. It was ordered that the female prisoners from the Poison Affair should be guarded by women to prevent that they use their sexuality to escape. Unlike their male accomplices, the women were not to be chained as long as they behaved well. The information about the prisoners during their internment is scarce: in a rare note, it was mentioned that in January 1687, the women at Belle-√éle-en-Mer were granted the use of braziers in midwinter, which is notable as it was one of the few times they were mentioned post trial.

It was built in 1909 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 12, 1985. It is also known locally as Co-op Block, Midwest Block, or The Broken Spur, after the business that it currently houses. Description The Co-operative Block Building is a two-story Victorian commercial edifice in Crawford at the northwest corner of 2nd and Linn Streets on lots 9, 10, 11, and 12 of block 10 of the original townsite. It was built in 1909 of reinforced concrete and has plastered exterior walls; however, the interior structure utilized a wooden infrastructure. The edifice is square in shape, at by , and has a relatively flat roof. The front (east) facade is symmetrically organized and divided into four bays, a division which is further achieved inside the building. The storefronts have been replaced since the original construction (although they still consist mainly of glass), and some of the upper-story windows have been filled in. The facade is topped by a pressed metal cornice with brackets designed to look like dentils. Although a sign inscribed with the building's name originally embellished the top of the structure, it has since been removed, along with other cornice embellishments. There is a basement entrance on the building's south side. Note: Although Bernard Soester's surname is spelled \\"Sorster\\" in this document, \\"Soester\\" is the spelling used in all other works mentioning him. History Downtown Crawford, late 1910s. Co-op Block is on the left. The Crawford Co-operative Company was founded on June 11, 1907 by William J. A. Raum, C. H. Britton, W. A. Eversull, Bernard Soester, J. H. Hulseman, and Edwin Kluman. The purpose of the organization was to be \\"the buying, selling and holding of real estate, engaging in the general merchandise business, the buying and selling of all kinds of farm products, poultry and eggs\\". The Company officially began business on July 9, 1907; its capital stock was worth $100,000. On April 14, 1908 the company approved the plans and specifications submitted by William Stanton & Sons for the construction of the present Co- operative Block Building. Although it was originally to be built with its floors and roof entirely of concrete, the interior infrastructure was ultimately built using slow-burning heavy mill construction. Erected in 1909, the Co-operative Block Building was the first building to use reinforced concrete construction in the Crawford area. The Company dissolved in 1977. The structure has been occupied by a grocery store, a funeral parlor, and Midwest Hardware. It was also used for offices, apartments, and a meeting space for the Ku Klux Klan. A 1939 fire, thought to originate in the basement, caused considerable damage to the building, although no casualties occurred. In 1978 a restaurant, O'Doherty's, was opened in the building by Tom and Donna Spence. The structure was refurbished, and a back bar from a historic saloon in Summit, South Dakota was added. Some of the new furbishing came from the Crawford's former Gate City Hotel. Later, the business was acquired by Butch and Becky Sellman, who in turn sold it to the Kreman family. The building is currently owned by the Juhlin family, and the restaurant is currently in operation as The Broken Spur Saloon, as well as housing Waning Moon Studio.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King.\\\\ The short was released on July 6, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series.. The film marks the final appearance of Cookie in an animated short. She was Buddy's girlfriend and main supporting character. Summary Cookie looks in a mirror, readying herself for the arrival of Buddy. She calls her canary out of its cage and together they sing \\"About a Quarter to Nine\\". The doorbell rings and Cookie returns her bird to its place. Buddy is at the door, dressed for the cold weather and snow. He doffs his hat, Cookie welcomes him in. With Buddy's assistance, Cookie puts on her coat, and the happy couple steps out. Just as soon as Buddy and Cookie have gone, the canary flies out of its cage and out of the open window, chirping merrily in the cold air until a mighty bluster blows it back. The same cold wind blows into Cookie's home; by the window, on a dresser stands a framed picture of Buddy. Fantastically, the gust disturbs the figure in the photograph, prompting him to attempt to close the window. The Buddy-figure reaches the window by opening a nearby book as a bridge. But the photographic figure (hereinafter referred to simply as Buddy) can not close the window. As he holds the handle, Buddy is left to flail helplessly in the wind when another gust penetrates the house. \\"Help! Help!\\" he calls. Cookie's statue of Atlas comes to life, drops his globe, and comes to the rescue, taking Buddy down from the handle, closing the window, and placing Buddy back in his picture frame. Buddy thanks Atlas, picks up his hat (blown off by the wind), and returns to his proper position. But the little canary is still outside! It pecks on the window until heard by Buddy, who awakens again to try the same technique he attempted before. The book as a bridge, he goes to the window, but instead now requires help in order to open it. He calls for Atlas, who, having changed his original position, again releases his globe and goes over to help Buddy. Atlas removes Buddy from the window and opens it. Buddy briefly steps out to fetch the freezing bird. Once inside again, Buddy dusts the snow from the poor creature's back whilst Atlas closes the window. By means of a series of pulleys on window blinds and a luminaire, Buddy hurries the canary to a small dish held aloft by a statuette, under which he places a cigarette lighter, whose heat melts the ice block around the bird's feet. Now sitting in a pool of water, the canary sneezes, splashing its rescuer, who then injoins the bird to blow its nose. Feeling quite chipper again, the bird thanks Buddy by means of a kiss, then flits about the room, eventually turning on the radio. And thus we have a reprise of \\"About a Quarter to Nine.\\" Buddy dances, and everything comes to life: the joker in a deck of playing cards, the little girl on a can of \\"Gamble's soup,\\" the pig depicted on a special ham in the icebox. An insect, rowing through the sink, ends the musical number by singing \\"Avalon\\". The insect gets sprayed by a soldier on the surface of a can of insect spray. The insect falls in the water and takes a box of suds with him, singing \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles.\\" The alarm clock sees the real Buddy and Cookie walking towards the house, and rings to signal that every object ought to return to its place, including the picture of Buddy. Cookie unlocks the door and steps inside, bidding her sweetheart good night: Buddy kisses her hand and bids her the same. Remarking \\"Isn't he a dear?,\\" Cookie takes the framed photograph and kisses it repeatedly, leaving the picture of Buddy to wink at us in conclusion. That's All Folks! At cartoon's end, Beans the Cat delivers the valedictory \\"That's all, folks!,\\" whereas in most earlier shorts featuring Buddy, Buddy himself bade the audience good-bye.

Club career Katsikokeris began his professional career with Panetolikos at the age of 17. He then played for Tilikratis and Keratsini in the Delta Ethniki, the fourth tier of the Greek football league system. In 2009, he went to Platanias, a Cretan club playing in the Greek Football League 2, where he scored 19 goals in 58 games. His good performances did not go unnoticed, and in the summer of 2011, Katsikokeris signed for Ergotelis, a fellow Cretan club playing in the Greek Superleague. Katsikokeris impressed with his performances with Ergotelis, coming straight from the third division to score 7 goals in 27 Superleague games, thus drawing the attention of struggling Greek giants AEK Athens, who bought Katsikokeris from Ergotelis in the summer of 2012 for a reported 150K euros. On 16 September 2012, he made his debut for AEK against Skoda Xanthi. After AEK was relegated at the end of the season, Katsikokeris signed at Panthrakikos on 14 August 2013. As he was not considered between his manager's primary choices, Katsikokeris left the club in 2014, and has since returned to Crete and the Gamma Ethniki, after a brief stay with Panegialios in the Football League. After a distinguished performance with Cretan club Ermis Zoniana in the 2015‚Äì16 Gamma Ethniki season, in which he scored 16 goals in 25 matches, Katsikokeris returned to Ergotelis once again in the summer of 2016, this time determined to help his former club return to top flight after being relegated to the Gamma Ethniki. He did so by scoring 18 goals in 27 matches during the 2016‚àí17 Gamma Ethniki season, finishing top-scorer of Group 4 for the second time in his career since his feats with Platanias in 2011. His stay at the club was abruptly ended due to uncertainty on whether the club would secure the required funds to actually promote to the Football League after securing the Division title, and therefore Katsikokeris chose to continue his career with Gamma Ethniki side Ethnikos Piraeus. He finished third top-scorer in the Group 6 Table with 7 goals in 18 matches, contributing to Ethnikos' first-place finish and subsequent qualification to the promotion play-offs. Katsikokeris scored an additional three goals in six games during the play-offs, but Ethnikos failed to promote to the Football League. In July 2018, Katsikokeris moved back to Crete and signed a contract with newly promoted Gamma Ethniki club Episkopi.

He is an architecture historian and urbanist, who has published widely on architecture and urban design, including the impact of tall buildings on historic cities. He has a long academic career, having been appointed to the Forbes Chair in Architecture at the University of Edinburgh at age 36.  Biography  Tavernor was born in England and studied architecture in London (BA and Dip. Arch with Distinction, 1973‚Äì79), Rome (British Prix de Rome in Architecture at the British School at Rome, 1979‚Äì80), and at the University of Cambridge (St John's College, 1980‚Äì83, doctorate awarded 1985), where his PhD thesis, Concinnitas in the Architectural Theory and Practice of Leon Battista Alberti, was supervised by Joseph Rykwert. He is a registered architect and a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (since 1985). He has held multiple academic posts in the UK. He was formerly Forbes Professor of Architecture at the University of Edinburgh (1992‚Äì95), Professor of Architecture and Head of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the University of Bath (1995‚Äì2005), LSE Professor of Architecture and Urban Design (2005‚Äì2011) and Director of the LSE Cities Programme (2005‚Äì08). He held various visiting academic posts internationally, including Visiting Professor at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA, 1998), European Union Visiting Scholar in planning and conservation at the University of Texas A&M; (2002); and Visiting Professor in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil (2004), and the University of Bath (since 2009). He founded the Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA) at Bath, and with Vaughan Hart, established a focus on Classical and Italian Renaissance architectural treatises; between them they have translated and written about the leading classical architectural theorists ‚Äì including, Vitruvius, Alberti, Serlio and Palladio. He has been a national assessor for the Architecture and the Built Environment sub-panel of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008) for the UK Higher Education Funding Council for Education (HEFCE), and a member of the Faculty of the Fine Arts of the British School at Rome. Tavernor initiated (with co-authors) a series of modern translations of the principal classical architectural treatise writers ‚Äì Vitruvius, Alberti and Palladio ‚Äì and is the sole author of parallel monographs on these subjects published by (Yale and MIT). His book on Alberti was described as \\"the last and the best of the books on Alberti on this scale in the twentieth century\\" (Chronique). He pioneered the use of the computer to visualise urban forms in architectural exhibitions, co-curating with Rykwert in 1994 the international exhibition of Alberti's work at Palazzo Te in Mantua for the computer firm Olivetti. As a consultant architect and urbanist he applies his knowledge of architectural history, design and the visual representation of buildings in advising planners and architects on the form, character, scale and massing of tall buildings in the City of London and along the south bank of the Thames. His advice on several large urban masterplan projects in London (including Battersea Power Station) led to him being invited in 2007, by former Russian Senator Gordeev, to assemble and to contribute his expertise to an international masterplanning team to re-configure the city of Perm (population of 1 million) in the southern Urals. The published masterplan led by KCAP was awarded the Grand Prix at the Moscow Architecture Biennale in May 2010.  Works  As an architectural historian and theorist, he is an expert in the foundations of Italian Renaissance architecture and the transmission of associated ideas and forms to England and America. He is the author of Palladio and Palladianism (1991 ‚Äì subsequently translated into Italian, Chinese and Korean) and On Alberti and the Art of Building (1998). He is co-translator of two English translations of architectural treatises: Leon Battista Alberti‚Äôs 16th century De re aedificatoria, as On the Art of Building in Ten Books (1988); and Andrea Palladio‚Äôs 17th century I quattro libri dell‚Äôarchitettura, as The Four Books on Architecture (1997), and co-edited and provided the introduction to Vitruvius' On Architecture (2009). Tavernor's translation works have become the standard texts in art historical scholarship, used by students and scholars throughout the world. His book Smoot‚Äôs Ear: The Measure of Humanity (2007 and 2008) pulls together much of his earlier writings and sets measures and measuring in a cultural context and shows how deeply they are connected to human experience and history. He was co-editor of Body and Building: Essays on the changing relation of Body to Architecture (2002 and 2005), a collection of essays on art and architecture dedicated to Rykwert. He founded the Alberti Group with Rykwert, which led to the 1994 international exhibition on Alberti for Olivetti. Photogrammetric drawings relating to research for the exhibition can be found on the CASA website at Bath University. Tavernor was subsequently commissioned by the Royal Academy of Arts to produce computer animated urban and architectural reconstructions through CASA for exhibitions in London and internationally, for the Sir John Soane Exhibition (1999), Aztecs Exhibition (2003), and by Tate Britain for the Sir Stanley Spencer Exhibition (2001). Robert Tavernor is currently an architectural and urban design consultant in London.

The project was coordinated by Alex Marshall (the then Chief Constable of Hampshire Police). West Yorkshire Police is the lead force and the service is coordinated from the NPAS Operations Centre, at Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Criticism There was some initial criticism from forces around the service provided by NPAS when it began operation. This was primarily due to the reduction in number of bases and aircraft available, following general cuts by the UK Home Office to police funding. This led to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducting a case study of NPAS with its conclusions made public on 30 November 2017. The report commented at some length on the governance and funding of the service provided. The report specifically stated that there was no criticism of NPAS staff or its operational delivery. HMRCFRS included the following observation in its press release:  History  Rollout NPAS became operational on 1 October 2012, and was rolled out across England and Wales in stages. The service provides nineteen helicopters and four fixed wing aircraft, operating from fourteen bases. NPAS suggested that the Police Scotland Air Support Unit join the service to reduce costs.PROTECT - CONTRACTS, Scottish Police Authority. However that did not materialise.  Base closures  In February 2015 it was announced that, due to a 14% cut in revenue over the following three years, NPAS would be closing ten bases over two years.  Fixed wing operations  In response to slashed budgets, NPAS investigated the use of fixed wing aircraft ‚Äì as they are cheaper to fly and maintain.

The hotel is designed by Atlanta-based architects Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart and Associates, Inc. and is themed after the Chettinad architecture of Tamil Nadu. With the project cost exceeding 8,000 million, the hotel was expected to open in September 2012. However, delays in construction and operation preparation have pushed its inaugural date to January 2013. History The land for the hotel was acquired from industrialist M. A. M. Ramaswamy for about 700 million. In September 2014, ESPA, a 16,000-square feet spa, was opened at the hotel. In September 2017, the hotel was purchased from the Leela Group by the American private equity fund Marigold Capital for 7,000 million. The hotel Located on 6.25 acres near Adyar Creek facing the Bay of Bengal, the 16-story hotel with a built-up area of 831,000 sq ft has 326 rooms, including 295 deluxe or premiere room and 31 suites. It features 2,601 sq m of banquet and meeting facilities, including a 1,390 sq m ballroom and a traditional landscaped courtyard, restaurants and bars, a 1,394 sq m health club/spa and a 1,060 sq m boutique retail plaza. There are a total of 6 meeting rooms in the hotel. The project will use LED lights for all its external lighting and all major internal areas and will also collect water on a major scale from rain water harvesting.

The blue brickwork spells out the names of Allah, Muhammad and Ali in square Kufic calligraphy. In Iranian architecture, banna'i (, \\"builder's technique\\" in Persian) is an architectural decorative art in which glazed tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall or to spell out sacred names or pious phrases. This technique originated in Syria and Iraq in the 8th century, and matured in the Seljuq and Timurid era, as it spread to Iran, Anatolia and Central Asia. If the brickwork design is in relief then it is referred to as hazarbaf (, compound of hazar \\"thousand\\" and baf \\"weavings\\", referring to the woven appearance of the bricks). History The walls of the Samanid Mausoleum (9th or 10th century) represent an early example of hazarbaf, a weaving-like pattern of brickwork. The earliest surviving example of decorative brick work with colored bricks is found in the city gate of Raqqa (c. 772). The earliest known example of hazƒÅrbƒÅf is found in the Ukhaydir Palace near Baghdad, built around 762. The technique appeared in Iran and central Asia more than a century later but with more sophisticated designs. The tomb of the Samanid ruler IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l (in Bukhara, Uzbekistan), had walls with protruding and recessed bricks that created a weaving pattern. Islamic brickwork grew in sophistication of its techniques over the centuries. In the 11th century, the use of multiple brick sizes, and variation in the depth of the joint between bricks formed shadow that contrasted strongly with the horizontal lines of the brick rows (for example the Arslan Jadhib Mausoleum in the Sang-Bast complex). Rows of brick were set deep inside the face of the building and raised above it, to create positive and negative spaces (for example in the Damghan minaret and Pir-e Alamdar tower). The Chehel Dokhtaran minaret in Isfahan (built 1107-1108) is one of the earliest example of brick work with triangles, squares, octagons, cruciform designs (another example, minaret of Saveh, has raised brickwork in Kufic and Nashki script). The Gunbad-i Sorkh monument in Azerbaijan (built in 1147) was made of ten different types of carved bricks in its corner columns. In the 12th century in Azerbaijan, bricks were combined with glazed tiles. Such bricks were typically cobalt blue and turquoise colored. The tomb of Timur is covered with religious inscriptions made with colored bricks. The earliest example of script set in brick work is seen on a minaret in Ghazni about 1100, spelling out the name of the ruler, the Ghaznavid ruler Massud III and his titles. This building pieces of terra cotta were inserted between the bricks to create the inscription. Later buildings used the shadows of raised bricks and others used different colored bricks to spell out words. This practice eventually led to the covering whole brick buildings in sacred writing spelling out the names of Allah, Ali and Muhammad. Square kufic, the version of the Arabic kufic calligraphy consisting of square angles only, is believed to have been an architectural adaptation of this script. Kufic writing was usually achieved using square bricks.

This was the first official outdoor NHL game, and was part of the pre-season schedule for the 1991‚Äì92 NHL season for both teams. Background Rich Rose, president of Caesars World Sports and a Rangers fan, who first proposed having an exhibition ice hockey game outdoors in Las Vegas in 1988. His idea was met with criticism and incredulity, but Steve Flatow, the NHL's marketing director in 1991, thought it was an intriguing idea. Flatow suggested approaching the Los Angeles Kings, whose roster included Wayne Gretzky. With the Kings' interest, Flatow believed the Rangers would also be interested, and the game could therefore showcase high-profile teams from the two largest markets. Rose was able to convince the Kings' executive vice-president, Roy Mlakar, and the team's owner Bruce McNall. After that, Flatow helped Rose contact the Rangers, who agreed to play, and the event was scheduled for September 27, 1991. The temporary seats and rink cost $135,000 to erect, and were ready two days prior to the event. The ice was laid down by Bob May of Ice Systems of America, under the directions of Michael Rzechula and Robert Krolak from ITI (now Ice Rink Supply). According to May, the outside ice rink in Las Vegas was \\"a big challenge\\", using three times the refrigeration equipment as one would for a regular rink. Fabric strips were laid into the ice as opposed to the usual painted stripes. The boards featured rotating and lit advertising panels, a concept using technology that was still in its infancy but later implemented in many NHL arenas. In-board advertisers included Toyota, Target, ITT Sheraton, Budweiser, Thrifty Car Rental, and Upper Deck trading cards. The game The air temperature at puck drop was around , going as high as during the course of the game, with 28% humidity, although the ice held up well. The Rangers started the game well, with goals by Tony Amonte and Doug Weight for a 2‚àí0 lead at the end of the first period. In the second period, the Kings replied with goals by Tony Granato, Brian Benning, and Sylvain Couturier to take a 3‚àí2 lead at the end of the second period. The Kings added two more goals in the third period by Jari Kurri and Wayne Gretzky for a 5‚àí2 win. The Kings were captained by Wayne Gretzky, while the Rangers had yet to name a captain for the upcoming season. The game was officiated by referee Rob Shick, with linesmen Mike Cvik and Shane Heyer. Broadcasting The game was televised live on Prime Ticket, and, due to its uniqueness, has since been repeated numerous times on other networks, such as MSG Network and the NHL Network. During the game, Kings goaltender Kelly Hrudey wore a camera mounted on his mask, and shots from his point of view were used during the broadcast. Cancelled second game A second exhibition game was scheduled between the Rangers and the Kings to take place on September 29, 1991, in Charlotte, North Carolina. The game, however, was cancelled, due to poor and unsafe ice conditions at the Charlotte Coliseum.

The company's virtual mood board function allowed community members to add products into a shared product index, and use them to create image collages called \\"Sets\\". They could also browse other users' sets for inspiration, share sets with friends and interact with people through comments and likes. Due to the visual nature of the tool Polyvore was mostly used to build sets in the fields of home decoration, beauty and fashion. Online retailers, too, could upload their product images to Polyvore and link back to their product pages or use Polyvore to encourage users to showcase their products through such activities as board creation competitions. Polyvore opened an office in New York City in August 2012. At that point the company said it had amassed 17 million active users. By the end of 2012 the company said its site was receiving 20 million unique visitors per month,http://socialmediastrategiessummit.com/blog/for-ecommerce-companies-it- pays-to-know-polyvore/ a number which continued to be used in 2016. The site was bought by SSENSE and, on April 5, 2018 it was completely shut down. Polyvore was initially funded in three rounds by six investors, including initial investors Benchmark Capital and Harrison Metal, and Matrix Partners and DAG Ventures as lead investors in later rounds. It was acquired by Yahoo on July 31, 2015. On April 5, 2018, Polyvore announced that it had been acquired by SSENSE and would cease operations immediately. Users wishing to save their account data were directed to a request form on the Polyvore blog.  History  Polyvore started as a prototype developed by Pasha Sadri in August 2006.http://www.masoninteractive.com/blog-social-shopping-site- polyvore-com-leads-in-social-commerce-retail-conversion/ While he and his wife were decorating their new house, they found themselves cutting furniture ideas and color patches out of magazines and assembling them into inspiration boards. While this tried and tested approach worked, Sadri, an engineer at Yahoo, felt that it would be better if the mood boards could be created online. He used Yahoo Pipes, one of the tools he had created, as a basis to build the first iteration of Polyvore. Soon after its creation, fellow Yahoo engineers Jianing Hu and Guangwei Yuen joined Sadri to form the founding team, which launched the first version of the website in 2007. Polyvore Inc. was formed in August of the same year. The company received US$2.5 million in series A funding from Benchmark and Harrison Metal in December 2007. In August 2009, Polyvore reached four million unique visitors, 150 million pageviews a month, and received US$5.6 million in series B funding led by Matrix Partners, alongside previous investors Benchmark Capital and Harrison Metal Capital. The New Yorker profiled Polyvore in March 2010, calling it a ‚Äúfashion democracy‚Äù and a ‚Äúworld of virtual Anna Wintours‚Äù. At the time, Polyvore received 6.6 million unique visitors. An increase in inquiries from e-commerce companies led Polyvore to experiment with ways to monetise their users through such things as affiliate marketing and sponsored board creating competitions. Polyvore reached profitability in 2011, largely through the use of affiliate links. As each item in a Polyvore set already links back to the page where it was clipped, entering into affiliate partnerships that generate revenue for the company when users click on those links was not a big step. And unlike many other affiliate sites that had to manually update links when retailers changed their site structure, Polyvore invested in software bots that rewrote links that changed and ensured that its links always pointed to the most up- to-date product page. The company's product-centric, tech-led approach, coupled with its highly engaged user base, seemed to be the key to success leading Colleen Taylor of GigaOm to state: \\"Polyvore‚Äôs product-first strategy seems to be paying off: an eighth of Polyvore‚Äôs audience comes back to the site more than 100 times per month.\\" For that same year, Polyvore was named in Entrepreneur Magazine's 100 Most Brilliant Companies list, and as number 29 of Time Magazine's 50 Best Websites. Polyvore received US$14 million in Series C funding from DAG Ventures, Goldman Sachs, Matrix, and Vivi Nevo in January 2012, bringing its total venture capital-backing to $22 million as of January 2012. Shortly afterward, in February 2012, Polyvore partnered with CoverGirl to launch \\"Polyvore Live\\", a live-streamed fashion show during Mercedes Benz Fashion Week, that showcased the collections of four alumni from the Fashion Institute of Technology, Lauren Bagliore, Vengsarkar ‚ÄúVen‚Äù Budhu, Sergio Guadarrama, and Dana-Maxx Pomerantz. The project also involved collaborations with a number of fashion and beauty bloggers, including Aimee Song of Song of Style, Nadia Sarwar of Frou Frouu, Christian Caradona of Trop Rouge, and Julie Sarinana of Sincerely Jules. That same year, Polyvore was named by Fast Company as number 28 of its 50 Most Innovative Companies of the year. In August 2012, Polyvore opened its first New York office, in SoHo, with Mayor Michael Bloomberg issuing a personal welcome: \\"By opening an office here, Polyvore is joining the growing group of tech companies who recognize that the benefits of being in New York City are irresistible, regardless of where a startup began.\\" In November 2012, the company launched its inaugural iOS app, and Polyvore's website achieved a 19 million monthly unique visitor count. By May 2014, over three million members had downloaded the Polyvore iPhone app and the company was reporting 20 million unique visitors per month; in that month, the company launched its first Android app. A year later, in April 2015, Polyvore launched its second iPhone app called Remix. Unlike the main Polyvore app, which is aimed at 'creators', users looking to assemble their own style boards, Remix helps those who want to be inspired by others' creations by using the company's wide pool of data points to allow users to discover popular items or sets, match their favourites with undiscovered pieces into complete outfits and bookmark these into favorites. On July 31, 2015, Yahoo and Polyvore announced that Yahoo would acquire Polyvore for an undisclosed amount to augment its e-commerce operations. According to Eric Jackson, manager of hedge fund SpringOwl, Yahoo purchased Polyvore for $230M, a figure also quoted by Bloomberg. Leadership Polyvore was envisioned as a product and service by Pasha Sadri in August 2006 while he and his wife were remodelling their house and were looking to create digital mood boards to help with their decorating choices. He was soon joined by Jianing Hu and Guangwei Yuen, two software engineers he had met while they all worked at Yahoo, and the trio launched of the first version of the website in 2007. In its first year of creation, Jess Lee, a product manager at Google and an early Polyvore fan and user, emailed Sadri with a set of product suggestions, and, as Sadri explained in 2013: \\"The email was unlike any feedback we‚Äôd ever gotten ... It was a two-page-long analysis, detailing 'this is broken, we can fix it this way.'\\" In a July 2013 feature in Wired, Lee described herself as an \\"obsessive user\\" prior to her recruitment, and described her interest and motivation: ‚ÄúInfluencers in fashion right now are a cliquey club in New York that‚Äôs very hard to get into,‚Äù making it hard for others to shape the trends. Lee joined the company within nine months of her first visit, would rise through the ranks to become CEO, and is now listed as a founder of the company. Lee played a role in attracting its eventual buyer, Yahoo, as she had business relations with the company's then CEO, Marissa Mayer, who had recruited her during her period at Google. At the time of its acquisition, Lee was listed as Co-Founder and CEO, Pasha Sadri as Co-Founder and Director, Arnie Gullov-Singh as COO, and Guangwei Yuan and Jianing Hu as Co-Founders.  Traffic  In August 2012 Polyvore was receiving 17 million unique monthly visitors, and as of July 2013, traffic of 20 million visitors per month. In May 2014, the company was reported to be receiving 20 million unique visitors per month. Hence, between August 2009 and May 2014, the number of monthly unique visitors increased from 4 million to 20 million.  Alternatives  Polyvore was acquired by SSENSE, a Montreal-based online retailer, and shut down in 2018. Founded in 2007, Polyvore gave users the tools to create collages of clothing, beauty, and home products, and in doing so, created a community of people getting creative and following each other's work. Now there are many alternatives to Polyvore, such as Fashmates, URSTYLE, TrendMe, ShopLook, Bantoa and Stylevore.

She belonged to a noble family in Bordeaux and was described as a charming beauty. She was arranged to marry the much older Alexander de Poulaillon, with whom she became very unhappy. Desperately in love with the adventurer Rivi√©re, who demanded money from her, she made several attempts to murder her husband, once by the use of poison acquired from Marie Bosse. Her husband was warned of her attempts, had her imprisoned in a convent in 1678 and reported her. Marguerite de Poulaillon was the first person from the upper classes to be implicated in the Poison Affair, and the case against her was expected to form a precedent against others accused of similar social status, and was therefore carefully treated. She confessed to her guilt before trial and explained herself willing to submit to the death penalty. She was initially sentenced to banishment 5 June 1679. However, according to Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, she was unsatisfied with the sentence, perhaps because she feared being put under the guardianship of her husband, and asked to be imprisoned, as she would otherwise be inclined to repeat her crimes. Her sentence was therefore changed to confinement in a work house for former prostitutes in Angers. In 1697, Marguerite de Poulaillon appealed to be transferred from the work house to a convent, but her appeal was denied by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, and she remained in the prison work house until her death.Anne Somerset - The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide, and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV (St. Martin's Press (October 12, 2003) ) The court was reportedly influenced by her beauty and by the fact that she was related to and acquainted with several members of the court. The verdict made the court lose the respect of the public. It also became a precedent, and affected the verdicts of other accused based on rank: Francoise de Dreux and Marguerite Lef√©ron, the former guilty of several murders and the latter to the murder of her husband to marry her lover, were both Parisian socialites and were both merely sentenced to exile from Paris, while the wife of court musician Philippe Rebille Philbert, who poisoned her first husband to marry Philbert, was hanged for the same crime.

A player who plays two instruments from the same family (e.g., oboe and English horn, clarinet and bass clarinet, flute and piccolo) is also often considered a woodwind doubler, but is usually paid less than a player who plays instruments from different families.Memorandum of Agreement: Denver Musicians Association, Local 20-623, AFM/Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra (April 13, 2009). Longtime classical music practice has expected the non-principal player in a section to double the common auxiliary instrument (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including Hollywood film scores and‚Äîmost notably‚ÄîBroadway musicals, the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double‚Äîbut hiring four or five proficient \\"reed doublers\\" is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; one of the most notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for West Side Story (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor and baritone saxophones.

He is known for having written various major Spanish language music singles such as \\"La Pared\\", \\"Si Dios fuera negro\\", \\"La boda de ella\\", \\"Soy Boricua\\" and others.  Early life  Angler√≥ was born in Fajardo, on Puerto Rico's eastern coast. His father Juan, an itinerant carpenter, was originally from Maricao, on the western side of the island; his mother Carmen was a seamstress. Always moving where work was available, his father moved to Barrio Obrero, one of San Juan's working- class neighborhoods when the couple separated. Plena singer Manuel Jim√©nez, ‚ÄúCanario‚Äù, lived in his same street, and Angler√≥ would attend rehearsals by Jim√©nez's group. Catalino Curet Alonso was a friend since childhood; Curet was later persuaded to become a postal worker by Angler√≥'s cousin. Angler√≥'s aunt, who lived nearby, had a small but diverse record collection, and listening to these records he was inspired to become a singer, although stage fright would sometimes prevent him from appearing in amateur programs such as Rafael Qui√±ones Vidal‚Äôs after showing up. He also became an avid baseball player and track and field athlete, and took percussion and trumpet lessons. As to dissuade Roberto from having his hobbies distract him from obtaining a trade or profession, Angler√≥‚Äôs father sent him to live with family in The Bronx in New York City in 1942. He became a mechanic, his life-long profession, but for a while he also tried his luck as a percussionist and dancer at local Latino clubs such as the Palladium, and even received drumming classes from Max Roach.  Racial discrimination  While in New York, Angler√≥ was drafted into the United States Air Force. He served four years, saw action in South Korea during the Korean War, and was eventually stationed at Air Force bases in Alabama and Texas. Angler√≥ faced multiple racial discrimination incidents while serving in the Southern United States; a particularly acrimonious one occurred in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a restaurant owner refused to serve him dinner and later called military police to have him and his Jewish- American Air Force buddy escorted out of the state. Angler√≥ recalls that, while being a proud veteran of the United States‚Äô armed forces, incidents such as this one made him become a fervent supporter of independence for Puerto Rico. These incidents also shaped his views about race relations, most of which were humorously expressed in one of his major hits, a Puerto Rican bomba song called Si Dios fuera negro (If God were black), the melody of which, he claims, came to him in a dream.  Musical career   With Orquesta Panamericana  After returning to Puerto Rico, and having overcome his stage fright issues, Angler√≥ played with a few neighborhood trios and quartets in Barrio Obrero, until he became a part of Lito Pe√±a‚Äôs Orquesta Panamericana. He sang with the orchestra, played minor percussion, and also started writing songs for the band, with the assistance of Pe√±a and his long-time pianist, H√©ctor Urdaneta, to whom he claims were instrumental for any success he has attained as a composer. He composed his best known single, ‚ÄúLa Pared‚Äù (The Wall), a bolero song that has been versioned over sixty times and whose best- known versions, besides the original one with the Panamericana (sung by Yayo El Indio), were sung by Felipe Pirela (whose version topped the charts in Pirela's native Venezuela for three months), Roberto Ledesma, Xiomara Alfaro and Armando Manzanero, Bambino  With El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico  Angler√≥ later established a long songwriting relationship with El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. He wrote a number of El Gran Combo's songs, including: Serrana (1968), Dos Copas y Un Ol√© (1969), La Salsa de Hoy (1974), La Soledad (1976), and two major hits, Aqu√≠ No Ha Pasado Nada (1978) and Las Hojas Blancas (1973). Many of these songs have been rerecorded by the band in later releases.  With Bobby Valent√≠n  For a short while, Angler√≥ became one of the singers for Bobby Valent√≠n‚Äôs orchestra. He then started one of various inceptions of his own band (Angler√≥ had to change the name of one of these, jokingly named Angler√≥ y Su Congregaci√≥n, as to not appear as blasphemous), with a young Marvin Santiago as his lead singer. Santiago later joined Valent√≠n‚Äôs band and became its first featured singer. Angler√≥ wrote various songs for Valent√≠n‚Äôs band, such as: M√≠rate al espejo, Amolador, Son Son Charar√≠, and two smash hits: the anthemic ‚ÄúSoy boricua‚Äù (a patriotic Puerto Rican song) and ‚ÄúLa boda de ella‚Äù, a huge hit for the band and then-lead singer Cano Estremera.  With Tierra Negra  Angler√≥ kept recording songs as vocalist and bandleader. His band's most famous inception, Tierra Negra, was responsible for recording ‚ÄúSi Dios fuera negro‚Äù, a humorous take on mildly racist figures of speech in Spanish where references to white and black are switched for comic effect. This song became a smash hit in various Latin American countries (particularly Puerto Rico, Colombia, Panama and Peru), and was later versioned in French and became a hit in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Another song, which has become a popular Christmas song related to Epiphany in Puerto Rico, is ‚ÄúEl Cinco de Enero‚Äù (January 5). ‚ÄúEsa enfermedad, ¬øse pega?‚Äù was a minor hit. Other songs written by Angler√≥ include ‚ÄúVas por ah√≠‚Äù by Papo Lucca‚Äôs Sonora Ponce√±a, and ‚ÄúSatisfacci√≥n‚Äù, recorded by Gilberto Santa Rosa Angler√≥ is virtually retired from the music business, but is still featured occasionally in radio talk show programs as a commenter. He was featured in a short biopic filmed by WIPR-TV in 2003. After Hurricane Mar√≠a went thru Puerto Rico in 2017, Roberto Angler√≥ moved to live with he's daughter in Kissimmee, Florida.  Death  Roberto Angler√≥ died on April 28, 2018 at 88 years of age after facing health issues in recent years. He was buried at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico.

The company was headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA and was led by CEO and President David F. Melcher. The Washington Post highlighted Exelis as a top company in the Washington, D.C. region in 2011. It was acquired by the Harris Corporation for $4.75 billion in 2015. History For more detailed company history prior to October 31, 2011, see ITT Corporation Exelis Inc. was one of three major companies that made up ITT Corporation, a company that provided numerous communications, defense and water services. ITT was founded as the small communications company Puerto Rico Telephone Company by brothers Sosthenes and Hernan Behn. Through a series of business and patent acquisitions, the company grew and was renamed International Telephone and Telegraph in 1920. ITT continued to grow before appointing Harold Geneen as CEO in 1959. Until his retirement from the position in 1977, Geneen was responsible for growing the company from a medium-sized business earning $765 million in 1961 to an international conglomerate making $17 billion in sales in 1970. The company acquired more than 350 companies during Geneen's tenure; at one point the acquisition rate reached one deal per week. Ownership extended over such notable companies as Continental Baking, maker of Wonder Bread and the Twinkie, Sheraton Hotels and Avis Rent-A-Car. For a brief period in the mid-1960s, ITT was in talks to acquire the ABC television and radio networks in the US, but that deal fell through under regulatory scrutiny. Following Geneen's retirement, ITT went through a restructuring phase under CEO Rand Araskog and was split into three companies in 1995: ITT Corporation (formerly ITT Industries), Starwood Hotels and Resorts and The Hartford Financial Services Group, an insurance company. 2011 Spin-Off On January 12, 2011, the ITT Corporation Board of Directors approved a plan to split the firm. On October 31, 2011, ITT Corporation spun off its defense and water technology businesses to form three separate, publicly traded companies: * Exelis Inc., a global aerospace, defense, information and services company headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia. * Xylem Inc., a water technology firm. * ITT Corporation, a manufacturing firm. From the spin off to Nov. 1, 2013, Exelis was known as ITT Exelis to help ease the transition of the company's brand. Exelis employed approximately 19,000 people and generated $5.5 billion in sales in 2012. 2015 Purchase In February 2015, Exelis announced that plans had been approved for the sale of the company through a cash/stock purchase to competitor Harris Corporation. The purchase price of 4.75 billion dollars was reported as being one of the highest such defense company purchases, since the Lockheed/Martin merger. When finalized in June 2015, the purchase was expected to make Harris/Exelis one of the top 10 defense contractors in the United States. Company structure Exelis had six businesses that specialize in different technologies and services. Aerostructures Located in Salt Lake City, Utah the Exelis Aerostructures business is a designer and manufacturer of lightweight composite aerospace structures, subassemblies and components.

Smooth completions exist and are unique over a perfect field. Examples An affine form of a hyperelliptic curve may be presented as y^2=P(x) where (x, y)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^2 and () has distinct roots and has degree at least 5. The Zariski closure of the affine curve in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\mathbb{P}^2 is singular at the unique infinite point added. Nonetheless, the affine curve can be embedded in a unique compact Riemann surface called its smooth completion. The projection of the Riemann surface to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\mathbb{P}^2 is 2-to-1 over the singular point at infinity if P(x) has even degree, and 1-to-1 (but ramified) otherwise. This smooth completion can also be obtained as follows. Project the affine curve to the affine line using the x-coordinate. Embed the affine line into the projective line, then take the normalization of the projective line in the function field of the affine curve. Applications A smooth connected curve over an algebraically closed field is called hyperbolic if 2g-2+r>0 where g is the genus of the smooth completion and r is the number of added points. Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, the fundamental group of X is free with 2g+r-1 generators if r>0. (Analogue of Dirichlet's unit theorem) Let X be a smooth connected curve over a finite field. Then the units of the ring of regular functions O(X) on X is a finitely generated abelian group of rank r -1. Construction Suppose the base field is perfect. Any affine curve X is isomorphic to an open subset of an integral projective (hence complete) curve. Taking the normalization (or blowing up the singularities) of the projective curve then gives a smooth completion of X. Their points correspond to the discrete valuations of the function field that are trivial on the base field. By construction, the smooth completion is a projective curve which contains the given curve as an everywhere dense open subset, and the added new points are smooth. Such a (projective) completion always exists and is unique. If the base field is not perfect, a smooth completion of a smooth affine curve doesn't always exist. But the above process always produces a regular completion if we start with a regular affine curve (smooth varieties are regular, and the converse is true over perfect fields). A regular completion is unique and, by the valuative criterion of properness, any morphism from the affine curve to a complete algebraic variety extends uniquely to the regular completion. Generalization If X is a separated algebraic variety, a theorem of Nagatahttp://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/nagatafinal.pdf says that X can be embedded as an open subset of a complete algebraic variety. If X is moreover smooth and the base field has characteristic 0, then by Hironaka's theorem X can even be embedded as an open subset of a complete smooth algebraic variety, with boundary a normal crossing divisor. If X is quasi- projective, the smooth completion can be chosen to be projective. However, contrary to the one-dimensional case, there is no uniqueness of the smooth completion, nor is it canonical.

It is produced by Edgar Wright and Nira Park, among others. The film was selected to be screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Chris (Steve Oram) is a caravan fan and aspiring writer who takes his girlfriend Tina (Alice Lowe) on a road trip, much to the chagrin of Tina's mother (Eileen Davies), who has never forgiven Tina for the death of their dog \\"Poppy\\". At their first stop, the National Tramway Museum, Chris confronts a man (Tony Way) who is littering, and the man refuses to pick up his rubbish. When they get back to their car, Chris runs him over and kills him. Chris claims that the death was an accident, but smirks after the impact, unseen by Tina. Chris tells Tina that she is his muse. They meet Janice (Monica Dolan), Ian (Jonathan Aris) and their dog Banjo (who resembles Poppy) at a caravan park and Janice reveals that Ian is a published writer, something that makes Chris jealous. The next morning Ian goes for a walk. Chris follows him, hits him in the head with a rock, steals his camera and pushes him off a cliff. Tina takes Banjo with them as they go. Tina finds photos of Ian and Janice on the camera and confronts Chris, who confesses to Ian's murder. Tina accepts this. During a walk through a National Trust park, Banjo defecates on the ground and a tourist (Richard Lumsden) tells Tina to clear up the mess. Chris arrives and encourages Tina to claim that the man tried to rape her. A row ensues, and Chris beats him to death. At the next caravan park, Chris meets Martin (Richard Glover), an engineer who is testing a mini-caravan that can be attached to the back of a bicycle. During a meal in a restaurant, Tina goes to the bathroom. When she returns, she finds Chris kissing the bride from the hen party at a nearby table as part of a bachelorette dare. Upset, Tina follows the bride outside and kills her by pushing her down a steep hill onto some rocks, observed by Chris. The next morning, instead of visiting a local tourist attraction, Chris says he is helping Martin make some modifications to his caravan. They argue, and Tina drives off alone. Upset, she calls her mother and is about to confess to the murders, when her mother hangs up. Later that night, Tina tries to seduce Chris by talking about their complicity in the murders, but he rejects her. Chris wakes up to find Tina has left him sleeping in the caravan and is speeding down the highway. He calls her and tells her to pull over. Tina notices a jogger and runs him over. Chris is upset with her chaotic approach to the murders, believing himself to be justified in his choice of victims, and they argue before hiding the body at the side of the road. They drive to a mountain, where they set up camp with the Ribblehead Viaduct in sight, the final destination on their holiday. When a hailstorm forces them back inside the caravan, Chris falls asleep and Tina looks at his notebook, finding a drawing of her and Chris standing on the viaduct, about to jump. Martin arrives, with Banjo in the mini-caravan. While Chris is outside, Tina tries to seduce Martin, who is made uncomfortable by her advances and rejects her. When Chris returns, she tells him that Martin propositioned her in a particularly implausible and repulsive manner. Martin returns to his mini-caravan, and Chris and Tina have a fight over whether the dog should be called by the name \\"Poppy\\" or \\"Banjo\\". Upset, Tina pushes Martin's mini-caravan off the cliff, with him still in it. She re-enters their caravan and tells Chris that the problem is over. He runs outside, and finds Martin's dead body. He insults Tina and they fight, which ends in them having sex. Chris sets the caravan on fire and kisses Tina. They run to the Ribblehead Viaduct and climb to the top, holding hands. Chris asks Tina if she enjoyed the holiday and she says it was brilliant. He apologises for insulting her and asks if she really wants to kill herself. Just as Chris steps off the viaduct, Tina lets go of his hand, watching as he falls to the ground and dies. Tina stares at her hand as the screen cuts to black. Cast *Steve Oram as Chris *Alice Lowe as Tina *Eileen Davies as Carol Production The characters came together seven years before the film came as a stage experience with Lowe and Oram appearing as innocent campers who slowly revealed they were serial killers. A short film was later produced and was sent to several production companies, however despite being found to be funny, the pitch kept getting turned down for being too dark. They put the short online, and it generated some buzz, and Lowe sent the link to Edgar Wright, with whom she had worked on Hot Fuzz. Wright saw potential for a feature and put them in touch with a production company, Big Talk, who, with Wright on board as an executive producer, greenlit the project. Lowe and Oram did research into horror literature and even took a caravanning holiday, in character and with a cameraman, to the locations that would go on to be featured in the film. Ben Wheatley has said that all the locations were very helpful, even after they explained the nature of the film, because they \\"tried to make sure that it was open and fair to places, and that they weren‚Äôt the butt of jokes.\\" The two were also inspired by Withnail and I. Reception Critical reception has been positive; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 7.39/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Director Ben Wheatley and writer-stars Alice Lowe and Steve Oram deliver a wicked road trip movie that successfully walks the line between dark comedy and horror.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Bradshaw reviewed the film twice for The Guardian, first after its preview at Cannes, when he suggested \\"Wheatley could be suffering from difficult third album syndrome: this is not as mysterious and interesting as Kill List; its effects are more obvious and the encounters between the naturalistically conceived antiheroes and the incidental, sketch-comedy posh characters is a little uneasy. By the end, I got the sense that in terms of character and narrative the film was running out of ideas ‚Äì just a bit.\\" However, he viewed it again on its theatrical release and admitted that \\"when I first saw it, I think I might have got out of bed the right side\\" going on to say \\"a second viewing has further revealed just how superb are the effortless performances of Steve Oram and Alice Lowe, who are the movie's writers (working with Wheatley's longtime co-writer Amy Jump), and whose creative ownership makes a purely auteurist comparison with Kill List slightly less relevant.\\" He suggests a number of parallels: \\"an obvious comparison with Mike Leigh's Nuts in May, and there are even traces of Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett, whose gentler, observational comedy is turned into something nightmarish, bringing in an exquisitely horrible Readers' Wives aesthetic\\", concluding that \\"[t]he chilling and transgressive flourishes are carried off with deadpan confidence; it's a distinctive and brutally unsettling piece of work.\\" Kim Newman wrote in Empire magazine that Sightseers is a \\"uniquely British blend of excruciating comedy of embarrassment and outright grue, not quite as disorientating in its mood shifts as Kill List but just as impressive a film.\\" The Guardian asked an editor of Caravan Magazine for his opinion and he thought the film, which he described as \\"absolutely brilliant\\", accurately captured the details of caravanning holidays. However, the praise wasn't unanimous. The Financial Times' Nigel Andrews conclusion was \\"There are a few laughs; a few wise nods. But before the end fatigue arrives and doesn‚Äôt go away.\\" The film went on to receive seven BIFA Nominations, including best supporting actress for Eileen Davies, and winning the award for Best Screenplay.

The awful sounds generated by running fingernails down the chalkboard are separately pitch-corrected, resulting in a pleasant- sounding musical instrument. In computing, scratch input is an acoustic-based method of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that takes advantage of the characteristic sound produced when a finger nail or other object is dragged over a surface, such as a table or wall. The technique is not limited to fingers; a stick or writing implements (e.g. chalk, or a pen) can also be used. The sound is often inaudible to the naked ear (i.e., silent). However, specialized microphones can digitize the sounds for interactive purposes.

The earliest application was a highly expressive musical instrument (Mann et al.) for use with mobile devices on natural objects, surfaces, or the like, as a non-synthesizing (i.e. idiophonic) musical instrument.

Retrieved on October 28, 2009. Plymouth High School is located on a campus of the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park in Wayne County. History The original Plymouth High School was built in the early 20th century on the northwest corner of Main Street and Church Street, opposite from present-day City Hall in present-day downtown Plymouth, Michigan. The district deemed the facility to be outdated by the 1960s for high school use. The facility was closed after the 1969-1970 school year. When the first new high school opened in the present-day Plymouth-Canton Educational Park, the original Plymouth High School was converted into a middle school, dubbed Central Middle School (in conjunction with the more recently constructed East and West Middle Schools). Central Middle School remains a landmark in down town and closed as a middle school after the 2014-2015 school year. When Plymouth opened it only let in Freshmen, and the next year Freshmen and Sophomores, etc. Originally planned to simply remain Plymouth High School, the school's name was changed to Plymouth-Salem High School after Canton opened. Although the school district serves much of rural Salem Township, Salem residents were not necessarily exclusive to Plymouth-Salem. Plymouth High's colors of red, white, and blue, were split up, with Plymouth-Salem retaining blue and white, and the eventual Canton High School teams taking the red with white. Opened in August 2002, and constructed southwest of Salem High School, the new Plymouth High School was designed by the architecture firm French Associates. The students selected to be Plymouth High's first senior class, the Class of 2006, were polled to come up with a new nickname for the school. Their selection, the Predators (after the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League), was met with opposition from some parents who associated it with sexual predators. As a result, the school decided to use the generic \\"Wildcats\\" nickname, while still using the saber-toothed tiger logo of the Nashville Predators. Plymouth's school colors were to be purple and white (a combo of the red and blue of Salem and Canton), but were changed to black and silver. In addition to the formal online school resources, the school's parents, coaches and boosters proudly and voluntarily contribute content related to their group and team activities . Plymouth-Salem retained their \\"Rocks\\" mascot; supposedly named in conjunction with the school's original identity (The Plymouth \\"Rocks\\"), or because of the large unmovable boulder that sits outside the school. It is tradition for students to spray paint this rock for school events and to celebrate important sports victories. The rock was moved during the renovations in 2008. Campus The campus is 305 acres (1.2 km¬≤), although much of this is athletic fields. Students may have classes in all three academic buildings, even though each student is assigned to one \\"home school\\" from which he or she is to graduate from and play sports. Students are permitted 10 minutes passing time to walk among their classes. There has been criticism that it is unsafe for students to walk through several inches of snow, but the superintendent still gives snow days as rarely as possible. State Law, however, does require that passage between buildings be halted in the event of lightning. There is one soccer and football field at Plymouth, as well as a band complex. Sports Tennis Plymouth High School boys' tennis team won their first divisional championship in 2009-10, and the second divisional championship in 2011-2012. They have been division champs for the last 5 years (2011-2016). Men's Golf Qualified for the State Finals the last 4 years (2010-2013) finishing 7th, 10th, 8th, and 2nd. Were also KLAA South division champions the last 4 years. In 2012 the men's team won its first regional championship and completed this feat again in 2013. The past two years the team has had two members receive all state recognition. Three graduates are currently playing at the collegiate level (one at NAIA and two at the Division 1 level). Volleyball The volleyball team was first to win the division. Boys Track & Field The boys track and field team joined the volleyball team in being the first to win the division. Football In 2005, their first year of having a full graduating class, the Plymouth football team made the state playoffs, losing their first ever playoff game. The team again made the playoffs in 2007 and 2008, again losing their first games in the Pre- District round. The Wildcats made the playoffs again in 2010; yet, this time they not only won their first game, but they went on to beat Canton, Detroit Catholic Central, and Rockford on their way to the Division 1 State Final where they lost to Lake Orion 21-13. Girls Soccer The 2010 Girls Soccer team won their first MHSAA Regional title in 2009-2010. They went on to beat Portage Central in the state semi-finals, earning the right to play in their first State Finals game losing 2-1 in overtime on a penalty kick to Novi High School.''' Boys Lacrosse Plymouth, Canton, and Salem high school Boys Lacrosse previously competed under the unified team the \\"PCS Warriors,\\" however they have recently split up into individual teams. Plymouth-Canton-Salem Unified Teams PCEP Debate Team The team has grown tremendously in the past two years, and is now placing in the top two places for the Wayne-Oakland Debate League.

Cloud collaboration technologies allow users to upload, comment and collaborate on documents and even amend the document itself, evolving the document. Businesses in the last few years have increasingly been switching to use of cloud collaboration. Overview Cloud computing is a marketing term for technologies that provide software, data access, and storage services that do not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services. A parallel to this concept can be drawn with the electricity grid, where end-users consume power without needing to understand the component devices or infrastructure required to utilize the technology. Collaboration refers to the ability of workers to work together simultaneously on a particular task. Document collaboration can be completed face to face. However, collaboration has become more complex, with the need to work with people all over the world in real time on a variety of different types of documents, using different devices. A 2003 report mapped out five reasons why workers are reluctant to collaborate more. These are: * People resist sharing their knowledge. * Safety issues * Users are most comfortable using e-mail as their primary electronic collaboration tool. * People do not have incentive to change their behaviour. * Teams that want to or are selected to use the software do not have strong team leaders who push for more collaboration. * Senior management is not actively involved in or does not support the team collaboration initiative. As a result, many providers created cloud collaboration tools. These include the integration of email alerts into collaboration software and the ability to see who is viewing the document at any time. All the tools a team could need are put into one piece of software so workers no longer have to rely on email. Origins Before cloud file sharing and collaboration software, most collaboration was limited to more primitive and less effective methods such as email and FTP among others. These did not work particularly well. Very early moves into cloud computing were made by Amazon Web Services who, in 2006, began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services. Cloud computing only began to come to prominence in 2007 when Google decided to move parts of its email service to a public cloud. It was not long before IBM and Microsoft followed suit with LotusLive and Business Productivity Online Standard Suite (BPOS) respectively. With an increase in cloud computing services, cloud collaboration was able to evolve. Since 2007, many firms entered the industry offering many features. Many analysts explain the rise of cloud collaboration by pointing to the increasing use by workers of non-authorised websites and online tools to do their jobs. This includes the use of instant messaging and social networks. In a survey taken in early 2011, 22% of workers admitted to having used one or more of these external non-authorised websites. Cloud collaboration packages provide the ability to collaborate on documents together in real time, making the use of non-authorised instant messaging redundant. IT managers can now properly regulate internet based collaboration with a system tailor-made for the office. It has also been noted that cloud collaboration has become more and more necessary for IT departments as workforces have become more mobile and now need access to important documents wherever they are, whether this is through an internet browser, or through newer technologies such as smartphones and tablet devices. The tech industry saw several large paradigm changes: * The mainframe computing era enabled business growth to be untethered from the number of employees needed to process transactions manually. * The personal computing era empowered business users to run their businesses based on individual data and applications on their PCs. * A decade of network computing established an unprecedented level of transparency of information across multiple groups inside a company and an amazing rate of data exchange between enterprises. Each of these revolutions brought with it new economies of scale. The cost-per-transaction, the cost of automating office and desktop processes, and finally the cost of network bandwidth fell quickly and enabled business users to apply ICT solutions more broadly to create business value. Most analysts (Forrester, Gartner, etc.) believe that cloud computing will help unleash the next wave of tech-enabled business innovation. During the mainframe era, client/server was initially viewed as a \\"toy\\" technology, not viable as a mainframe replacement. Yet, over time the client/server technology found its way into the enterprise. Similarly, when virtualization technology was first proposed, application compatibility concerns and potential vendor lock-in were cited as barriers to adoption. Yet underlying economics of 20 to 30 percent savings compelled CIOs to overcome these concerns, and adoption quickly accelerated. Recent developments Early cloud collaboration tools were quite basic with limited features. Newer packages are much more document-centric in their approach to collaboration. More sophisticated tools allow users to \\"tag\\" specific areas of a document for comments which are delivered real time to those viewing the document. In some cases, the collaboration software can even be integrated into Microsoft Office, or allow users to set up video conferences. Furthermore, the trend now is for firms to employ a single software tool to solve all their collaboration needs, rather than having to rely on multiple different techniques. Single cloud collaboration providers are now replacing a complicated tangle of instant messengers, email and FTP. Cloud collaboration today is promoted as a tool for collaboration internally between different departments within a firm, but also externally as a means for sharing documents with end-clients as receiving feedback. This makes cloud computing a very versatile tool for firms with many different applications in a business environment. The best cloud collaboration tools: * Use real-time commenting and messaging features to enhance speed of project delivery * Leverage presence indicators to identify when others are active on documents owned by another person * Allow users to set permissions and manage other users' activity profiles * Allow users to set personal activity feeds and email alert profiles to keep abreast of latest activities per file or user * Allow users to collaborate and share files with users outside the company firewall * Comply with company security and compliance framework * Ensure full auditability of files and documents shared within and outside the organization * Reduce workarounds for sharing and collaboration on large files A 2011 report by Gartner outlines a five-stage model on the maturity of firms when it comes to the uptake of cloud collaboration tools. A firm in the first stage is said to be \\"reactive\\", with only email as a collaboration platform and a culture which resists information sharing. A firm in the fifth stage is called \\"pervasive\\", and has universal access to a rich collaboration toolset and a strong collaborative culture. The article argues that most firms are in the second stage, but as cloud collaboration becomes more important, most analysts expect to see the majority of firms moving up in the model.

The name Chuanqiandian is used both for West Hmongic as a whole and for one of its branches, the Chuanqiandian cluster Hmong. Writing The Miao languages were traditionally written with various adaptations of Chinese characters. Around 1905, Samuel Pollard introduced a Romanized script, the Pollard script, for the A-Hmao language, and this came to be used for Hmong Daw (Chuanqiandian) as well.Tanya Storch Religions and missionaries around the Pacific, 1500-1900 2006 p293 \\"he invented the first script for any Miao language\\" In the United States, the Romanized Popular Alphabet is often used for White and Green Hmong (also Chuanqiandian).

In a follow-up to that paper in the same publication, Strecker broke up Bu-Nao on the basis of newly accessible data, and noted that several of the languages listed in Wang [marked \\"?\\" above] were unclassified due to lack of data, and had not been demonstrated to be West Hmongic. The other groups are then listed as unclassified within Hmongic, and not specifically West Hmongic. However, Wang (1994) identified two as varieties of Guiyang. The eight unclassified languages are all spoken in a small area of south-central Guizhou, along with Guiyang, Huishui, Mashan, and Luobo River Miao. These were later addressed by Li Yunbing (2000).

Commissioned in 1944 she served in the Battle of the Atlantic until the end of the Second World War. After the war she was sold to the Chilean Navy and renamed Esmeralda. Glace Bay was ordered as HMCS Lauzon in June 1942 as part of the 1943-1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 23 September 1943 by G T Davie Shipbuilding Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and was launched on 26 April 1944. Her name was changed to Glace Bay and she was commissioned into the RCN on 2 September 1944 at L√©vis, Quebec. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service Glace Bay worked up at Bermuda and upon her return was assigned to the Mid- Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-4. She left for Great Britain escorting a number of American submarines destined for the Russian navy. Glace Bay was used continuously as an ocean escort for convoys in the North Atlantic until June 1945, when she returned to Canada. She then spent the next few months performing various tasks along the east coast of Canada. After making a round trip to Bermuda in October, Glace Bay was paid off on 17 November 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and laid up at Shelburne. Postwar service Esmerelda in 1946 In 1946 the ship was purchased by the Chilean Navy and renamed Esmeralda. When the barquentine Esmeralda (BE-43) was launched in 1953, the frigate was renamed Baquedano and continued to serve with the Chilean Navy before being paid off in 1960 and scrapped in 1968.

A suicide bomber attacked a security checkpoint as huge crowds of pilgrims were making the journey from Nasiriyah to Kerbala for a religious holiday. At least 44 people were killed and 81 more injured in the first significant attack in the city since a blast targeted the Italian military headquarters in November 2003. Meanwhile, in Baghdad, at least three bombs exploded in Sadr City next to a group of day laborers waiting to get hired. Interior Ministry officials confirmed at least 13 died in these attacks and 32 were injured. Several hours later, two car bombs in the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad left 16 dead and 36 injured. In addition to these attacks, two people were killed and six injured in a shooting and roadside bombing in the insurgent stronghold of Mosul. On 6 February 2012, the Islamic state of Iraq claimed responsibly for the attack.
