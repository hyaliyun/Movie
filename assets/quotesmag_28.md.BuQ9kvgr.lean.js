Early life and education Razzaq was born in 1914 in the Paragram village of Nawabganj Upazila of Dhaka District. His father, Abdul Ali, was a police officer. After his matriculation from the Government Muslim High School, Dhaka and intermediate exam from Dhaka College, he was admitted to the department of political economy at the University of Dhaka in 1931. In 1936, he completed his masters and then joined as a lecturer in the same department. When the department of political economy was bisected, he chose to join the department of political science. After the second world war, he went to London to study under Harold Laski at London School of Economics. He returned home without any formal degree after Laski had died in 1950 and carried on teaching in the department of political science at the University of Dhaka until 1975. He also taught in the departments of economics and international relations. Career Razzaq's political ideas influenced anti-Ayub-government movements during the 1960s; to get rid of his influence, the Ayub regime tried to \\"dismiss him from his teaching position at the University of Dhaka on the allegation that he was not mindful of his duties as a teacher, but which the government failed to establish in the court\\". During the Bangladesh Liberation War, he witnessed the March 1971 Dhaka University massacre. The Pakistanis came to arrest him at his home, but alerted by their kicking at his door, he escaped out the back. The Yahya Khan-government sentenced him in absentia to a fourteen-year rigorous imprisonment, accusing him of treasonable acts. Abdur Razzaq (left), Ahmed Sofa (right) Though Razzaq, apart from some essays and lectures, has no published works, many intellectuals have admitted his influence on their published works. Ahmed Sofa wrote his book, Jaddapi Amar Guru (Eventhough My Teacher), on Razzaq's life. Sardar Fazlul Karim published a book, Dhaka Bisshobiddalay O Purbabangya Samaj, based on his interviews of Razzaq. Salimullah Khan wrote a book on his lecture ‘’Bangladesh: State of the Nation’’. Muntassir Mamoon, Humayun Azad and others reminisced about him. It is claimed that he had as his students more than 70 members of parliament, among whom Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the most notable. Honors To acknowledge his unique status as a teacher, the Government of Bangladesh honored him with the distinction of National Professor in 1975. In 1973, the University of Delhi awarded him an honorary D.Litt. degree.

Aydelott (July 22, 1914 - February 16, 1991), better known as \\"Gus Aydelott,\\" was an American railroad president. He headed the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad for nearly three decades.  On the Grande  Aydelott became president of the Rio Grande with the death of Judge Wilson McCarthy in 1956. He was 41 years old, and had been with the company since graduating from the University of Illinois in 1936. Judge McCarthy cast a long shadow over the property, having been one of its receivers from 1934 until it emerged from reorganization in 1947, at which point he became president of the road. Aydelott would serve as president from 1956 through 1977, at which point he was promoted to chairman of the board of directors. W.J. \\"Bill\\" Holtman succeeded Aydelott as president. Aydelott retired from the Rio Grande in 1983. Professor Don L. Hofsommer writes in Railroads in the Age of Regulation, \\"Aydelott rose through the ranks . . . learning the necessity of continually maintaining and upgrading railroad properties . . . . He completed dieselization, ordered more rolling stock, and insisted on new and heavier rail for the main routes . . . . At the same time [he] energetically sought to guard the company's frontiers - - a difficult task, given the strong railroads bracketing the Rio Grande.\\" Hofsommer quotes Aydelott as of 1963, the Rio Grande President saying \\"We are proud of what we have done as a separate road, and we think we can continue to do a better job for ourselves and our territory by staying that way.\\" To do this, Hofsommer notes, Aydelott \\"required that the Rio Grande pay special attention to the needs of customers, who had a choice not only among rail carriers, but, more importantly, also among the various modes of transportation.\\" Aydelott focused on keeping his sales forces constantly in touch with their shippers, and his operating department moving Rio Grande trains expeditiously. In these efforts he was very successful, Hofsommer noting \\"The Rio Grande . . . gained a favorable reputation among shippers by following this path.\\" Aydelott himself became one of the railroad industry's \\"most respected leaders.\\" In 1963, the company joined Trailer Train (now TTX Company), instituting trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC) service over the Rio Grande. According to a Trains magazine article in April, 1965 the company operated seven named freight trains: Rock Island Merchandise Special; Lumber Special via Denver; Red Ball Extra; Midwest Merchandiser; SP Forwarder via Pueblo; SP Forwarder via Denver; and the Advance. While the company's freight traffic continued to grow, private passenger vehicles and commercial airlines eroded the company's passenger traffic. As a result, May 28, 1967, was the last run of the Rio Grande's Prospector; July 27, 1967, was the last run of the Rio Grande's Royal Gorge, and in March 1970, the Rio Grande's portion of the California Zephyr was cut from daily to thrice-weekly service. Under Aydelott's administration the Rio Grande formed a holding company, Rio Grande Industries, in 1969, to diversify and expand into other fields. These grew to include real estate development, industrial contracting and insurance. By the time Aydelott stepped down as president, Rio Grande Industry's annual income topped $305 million, most of it derived from the railroad's freight traffic.  The Perlman influence  Gus Aydelott's early career was a who's who of mid-twentieth-century railroaders. His father, James H. Aydelott, was superintendent of transportation on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. When the Burlington was struck by vicious flooding circa 1932-3, and in an effort to repair its western lines the Northern Pacific Railway lent out Alfred E. Perlman. Perlman started as a draftsman on the NP, but quickly moved up to roadmaster positions, maintaining the railway's physical plant. Marked for advancement, the NP sent him to Harvard Business School for additional training. Shortly thereafter, he spent time with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which sent him to evaluate the state of several ailing railroads, including the Rio Grande. Leaving the RFC, he was hired by the Burlington, where his first assignment was overseeing the reconstruction of flood-damaged lines in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. This busy period in Perlman's life brought him to the attention of the Burlington's fabled president, Ralph Budd, as well as Judge Wilson McCarthy of the Rio Grande. After his short time with the Burlington, Perlman left to become chief engineer of the Rio Grande. While there, he employed future railroad presidents Gus Aydelott and John C. Kenefick. On the Rio Grande Aydelott would be Kenefick's boss as they worked on track improvement projects. Impressed by Kenefick's work ethic and can-do attitude, he promoted him to roadmaster at Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Perlman ultimately left to head up the New York Central, with Kenefick following. Kenefick, however, left the Central before its ill-starred merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad, traveling to Omaha, Nebraska, as president of the Union Pacific Railroad. Perlman's career nearly came to an end in the wake of the unsuccessful Penn Central Transportation Company merger of the New York Central and the Pennsy, which in 1970 resulted in the largest bankruptcy in the U.S. to that time. However, Perlman was brought in to resuscitate the ailing Western Pacific Railroad. The legacy of these three careers came full circle in a series of mergers. In 1983 the former owners (circa 1924) of the Rio Grande, the Western Pacific and the Missouri Pacific, were merged into Kenefick's Union Pacific. In 1988 the Rio Grande absorbed the ailing Southern Pacific Transportation Company, adopting the name of its larger rival. In 1996, the Union Pacific absorbed the Southern Pacific, creating the largest rail system in North America.  References  * Athearn, Robert G.

Goldwyn had evidently been familiar with this series of Jewish-themed stories, written by Montague Glass and mounted as a Broadway play in 1913, back when he was a glove salesman, and produced these film versions over the objections of the other Jewish moguls of Hollywood.https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/106441/Potash-and- Perlmutter/overview  Cast  * Alexander Carr as Morris Perlmutter (*or Mawlruss Perlmutter) * George Sidney as Abe Potash * Vera Gordon as Rosie Potash * Betty Blythe as Rita Sismondi * Belle Bennett as Mrs. Perlmutter * Anders Randolf as Blanchard * Peggy Shaw as Irma Potash * Charles Meredith as Sam Pemberton * Lillian Hackett as Miss O'Ryan * David Butler as Crabbe * Sidney Franklin as Film Buyer * Joseph W.

She was the last member of the aristocratic Panin family. Family background Countess Sofia Vladimirovna Panina was the daughter of Count Vladimir Viktorovich Panin and Anastasiia Sergeevna Maltsova. Her maternal grandfather, General Sergei Ivanovich Mal'tsov (1801–93) was an industrialist whose diverse enterprises once employed over 100,000 workers. Count Viktor Nikitich Panin, her paternal grandfather, was one of Russia's richest serfowners as well as Minister of Justice for over twenty five years. Panina's father died in 1872 when she was not even two years old, leaving her the principal heir of the enormous Panin fortune. Her mother, who served as trustee of her inheritance, remarried in 1882. Her second father, Ivan Petrunkevich, was one of the founders of the Russian liberal movement against the autocracy, later co-founder in 1905 of the major liberal party, the Constitutional Democrat Party (Kadets). Petrunkevich had been arrested and sent into internal exile in 1879 for his oppositionist activity, and Anastasia's marriage to him greatly alarmed the Panin family. Sofia Panina's paternal grandmother, Countess Natalia Pavlovna Panina, successfully petitioned Emperor Alexander III to remove eleven-year-old Sofia from her mother's custody, and enrolled her at the Catherine Institute in St Petersburg, one of the elite boarding schools for noble girls. Entering Petersburg society after graduation, Sofia Panina married a millionaire Alexander Polovstov in 1890. He was the homosexual son of Alexander Polovtsov by Alexander II's cousin. By 1896, however, she had divorced him and reverted to her maiden name. They had no children, and she never officially remarried. Charitable work Ligovsky People's House, Prilukskaya Street In 1891 Sofia Panina met a Petersburg schoolteacher twenty years older than herself, Aleksandra Vasil'evna Peshekhonova, to whose influence she attributed the decisive turn her life took in the 1890s, away from the world of aristocratic high society and toward progressive philanthropy. Panina and Peshekhonova first created a caféteria for poor schoolchildren in a working-class district of Saint Petersburg. They gradually added Sunday popular readings for the children's parents and older siblings, founded a library, and began offering evening courses for adults. In 1903 Panina built one central building to house all of the diverse services she and Peshekhonova had started in the 1890s, known as Ligovsky People's House (Narodnyi Dom), for working-class residents of the same impoverished district on southern outskirts of Saint Petersburg. It pursued a progressive mission to advance popular education, cultural elevation, and rational entertainment for adults and children, as part of her project to support their development as citizens. The building still operates as a community center in Saint Petersburg today, under the name of the Railroad Workers' Palace of Culture. Its evening courses and literary circles provided a meeting-place for working-class men with socialist sympathies, and during the 1905 Revolution, Panina opened Ligovsky People's House to various political groups for meetings and rallies. On 9 May 1906 Vladimir Lenin addressed his first mass meeting in Russia there. Panina also was a co-founder and major financial supporter of the Russian Society for the Protection of Women in 1900, an anti-prostitution organization. In addition to building schools and hospitals on her various estate, she also provided assistance to countless individuals. In 1901 she loaned her Crimean estate, Gaspra, to the novelist Leo Tolstoy, then suffering from a life-threatening illness; Tolstoy and his family lived at her estate for almost a year. Political career Ilya Repin's portrait of Countess Panina (1909) Although her mother had married Petrunkevitch, it was not until the February Revolution of 1917 that Sofia started playing a role in politics. She wrote in her memoirs: \\"I never belonged to any political party and my interests were concentrated on questions of education and general culture, which alone, I was deeply convinced, could provide a firm foundation for a free political order.\\" However, during the war she worked for Saint Petersburg City Duma ensuring the families of reservists called up for the war were being looked after. On International Women's Day, 1917, Panina along with some other suitable women were appointed as delegates to the Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) Duma. Their positions were confirmed in the August elections. She was elected to the Kadet Party Central Committee at the beginning of May and was soon the first woman in world history to hold a cabinet position when she became assistant minister in the newly created Ministry of State Welfare, under Minister Prince Dmitrii Shakhovskoi. Then in August she was made assistant minister of education under Sergei Oldenburg, the Minister of Education. The Kadet Party placed her on its Petrograd list of candidates for the elections to the Constituent Assembly, held in mid-November, but the party failed to gain enough votes to include her among its delegates. However, when the Kadet Party was faced with the revolution of October 1917, Sofia was to play an even more prominent role. On the night of 25 October the Duma sent her as one of three delegates to visit the Aurora in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade them to hold their fire. Following the seizure of power, her home at 23 Sergievskaia Street Liteinyi district was used for meetings of three important anti-Bolshevik groups: the Little Council (also known as the Underground Provisional Government), the Committee to Save the Fatherland and Revolution composed of Kadet and socialist Duma delegates headed by Nikolai Astrov, the Kadet mayor of Petrograd. Also the Central Committee of the Kadet Party met there. As part of the Little Council she was involved in trying to withhold finances from the various ministries from the Bolsheviks and in organising a strike by civil servants. She was arrested at her home on 28 November with Fyodor Kokoshkin, Andrei Ivanovich Shingarev and Prince Pavel Dolgorukov. They had been planning an anti-bolshevik demonstration for the next day. Trial The villa of Countess Panina in Gaspra, Crimea was built in the 1830s. She loaned it to Leo Tolstoy, among others. Sofia Panina was put on trial by the Revolutionary Tribunal of the Petrograd Soviet on 10 December 1917 in what was the first political trial organised by the Bolsheviks. She was accused of embezzling 93,000 rubles from the Ministry of Education, which she denied. It attracted both national and international attention, including the presence of John Reed and Louise Bryant. The trial was held in the Nicholas Palace. Julia Cassady has described the trial as showing \\"nascent theatricality of the Bolshevik law court.\\" The Revolutionary tribunal consisted of seven men, two soldiers and five workers, six of whom were members of the Bolshevik Party. The soldiers were in uniform, while the workers wore dark suits with high white collar shirts and ties. Panina wore a modest black suit and close fitting turban. Ivan Zhukov chaired the proceedings, citing historical precedents from the French Revolution. He announced the charge and called on someone to act as prosecutor. When no-one stepped forward, the educator whom Panina had designated as her defense, proceeded with the defense, suggesting that there was no universally recognized laws in Russia at that point of time, so the trial could only be a political affair. He identified the funds in question as being a donation to the Ministry of Education for charitable purposes. \\"You must not, before the entire world, return evil for good and violence for love\\". This received much applause from the audience. Unexpectedly, a factory worker in the audience, N. I. Ivanov, a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, asked to address the court. He gave an emotional, personal account of how he had learnt to read and write at Panina's Narodnyi Dom. This too was well received by the audience and Zhukov then asked her to return the money in question within two days. She refused explaining she had deposited the money in a bank under the name of the Constituent Assembly, and insisted that it should only be released to the Constituent Assembly. After bypassing Grigory Kramarov, a Menshevik member of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Zhukov invited a worker called Naumov to speak. He felt little need to focus on any facts, but merely identified Panina as member of the nobility and suggested that this was enough to determine her guilt, whatever her good deeds in the past. The next to testify was even less sympathetic. Rogal’skii was a representative of the Commissariat for Education, who engaged in a personal attack on Panina which claimed that the funds she took were unpaid wages owed to ministry workers called for military service. Finally Panina herself made a speech in her defense, claiming she was merely playing the role of a sentry safeguarding the funds for the people - as expressed through their legal representation, the Constituent Assembly. As the Tribunal retired to consider their verdict, the court room gave way to disorder. Sergei Oldenburg accused Rogal’skii of lying. Kramarov complained about not being allowed to speak and was removed from the building when he tried to do so on the tribunal's return. The tribunal then found her guilty of \\"opposition to the people’s authority\\" and decreed that she should give the money to the Commissariat for Education. However, in view of her previous good works, her punishment was limited to public censure. Following the trial she refused to pass over the money and was put back in prison until her friends paid the 93,000 rubles. Flight and emigration In 1918 she joined General Anton Denikin in South Russia alongside other leading Kadets, including Nikolai Ivanovich Astrov. Although they never married, Astrov and Panina lived as husband and wife until his death in 1934. She traveled with him to Paris in the summer of 1919 to represent Denikin in an attempt to get further support from allies for the White Russians. This failed and she returned to South Russia until the defeat of Denikin's Volunteer Army forced her to flee Russia forever in March 1920. Panina spent the rest of her life in emigration, first in Geneva, where she and Astrov lived from 1921 to 1924. As representatives of one of the major Russian emigre associations, Zemgor, they represented Russian refugee interests at the League of Nations High Commission for Refugees. In 1924 Panina was invited to Prague, Czechoslovakia, by the Czechoslovakian government to become the director of Russkii ochag (Russian Hearth), a community center for Russian emigres. Astrov died in 1934, and when faced with the Nazi takeover of Czechoslovakia, she left Europe in December 1938 for the United States. After living for about a year in Los Angeles, Panina settled in New York City, where she collaborated with Alexandra Lvovna Tolstaya, Leo Tolstoy's youngest daughter, in founding the Tolstoy Foundation. First created to assist Russian emigres stranded in Europe as the threat of war grew, the Tolstoy Foundation soon became an important organization for assistance to prisoners of war and displaced persons. Panina died in New York City in June 1956. Further reading * Adele Lindenmeyr.

The rebels were defeated with the support of aircraft from the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force. The map used here as a new map of provinces of Ethiopia (1943) is not correct since Eritrea was included in it. Eritrea was under Italy and then Britain.  Background  In an Imperial determination to weaken the power of the regional nobles and elites of Ethiopia, the Haile Selassie government in 1941 introduced a new regional administration. The law or edict provided for fourteen provinces, around 100 counties, and 600 districts.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\", PhD dissertation, p. 123, 2003 This then enabled Haile Sellasie to centralize his authority and in effect rendered these nobles with their administrations dependent on the central government. Historians agree that \\"the basic policy of Haile Sellasie was a centralizing one continuing the tradition of the great centralizing Emperors from 1855 onwards.\\"Clapham, Christopher, Transformation and continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia, Cambridge University press, pg. 27, 1988. The provision reduced the many provinces of Tigray into eight counties: Raya Azebo, Enderta, Tembien, Kilete Awla'lo, Agame, Adowa, Axum and Shiere along with many districts under each of the counties' jurisdictions. After the liberation of Ethiopia from Italian occupation by British forces in the East African Campaign in 1941, Ethiopia saw many rebellions break out in different parts of the empire. The Woyane uprising in Tigray seems to have arisen when administrative corruption and greed ignited a situation of existing instability and insecurity, one awash with weaponry in the wake of the Italian defeat.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power\\", p. 126. Goals Their proclamation after liberating Mekelle had five main points. * Autonomous self- administration under Ethiopian flag and unity * Administration by Tigrayan Customary laws * Appointment of one's own leaders free of domination by Shoan Imperial elite * Eradication of thieves and bandits * Objection to payment of excessive taxation and payment to appointee of the Emperor Leadership * H.E.

Throughout Enderta distinct including, Mekelle, Didibadergiajen, Hintalo, Saharti, Samre and Wajirat, Raya, Kilete-Awlaelo and Tembien, local assemblies, called \\"gerreb\\", were immediately formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the \\"shengo\\", which elected leadership and established military command system. The rebels established their headquarters at Wokro. During the rainy season of 1943, the rebels under the leadership of Fitawrari Yeebio Woldai and Dejazmach Neguise Bezabih, hailing from Enderta,Mamoka Maki, The wayyane in Tigray and the reconstruction of the Ethiopia government in the 1940s, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009, p.5. which was the heart of the woyane rebellion,Mamoka Maki, The wayyane in Tigray and the reconstruction of the Ethiopia government in the 1940s, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009, p.6. were busy organizing their forces; and after celebrating the Ethiopian New Year on September 12, they went on the besieged government garrison at Quiha. The highly equipped government forces were to meet with the poorly equipped but determined rebels' for the first time in the rebel's stronghold district of Didiba Dergiajen, Enderta in the village of Sergien; the rebels under Fitawrari Yeebio Woldai (Wedi Weldai) and Dej. Neguisie Bezabih defeated the government forces decisively; they captured countless modern weapons that helped them attract many peasants to join the rebellion; and many government soldiers deserted and joined the rebellion. In the month of September 1943, on the government's second offensive in the village of Ara, also in Enderta, the woyane rebels under Wedi Woldai scored yet a second victory over the heavily armed government forces; this time however, the rebels captured high level feudal chiefs including and killed many prominent Tigray and Amhara war lords that sided with the Emperor Haile selassie's government. The rebels under Bashay Gugsa Mengesha also captured General Essyas and many of his commanders and imperial soldiers at Quiha. The rebel forces estimated at 20,000, moved eastward from Quiha to Enda Yesus, a fort overlooking the provincial capital, Mekelle. They captured the fort and then took Mekelle. The representatives of Haileselassie's government fled. Woyane issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of Mekelle which stated, inter alia: Our governor is Jesus Christ... And our flag that of Ethiopia. Our religion is that of Yohannes IV. People of Tigray, follow the motto of Weyane.'' RAF Bristol Blenheim's helped to suppress the rebellion A similar victory was achieved by the rebels under the top leaders of the woyane movement namely Dejazmach Negussie Bezabih and Bashay Gugsa Mengesha again in the district of Hintalo and Wajerat in Enderta; the rebels defeated the heavily armed government forces numbering in thousands and aided by British air power, the rebels were able to capture and acquire yet again heavy modern armaments. By September 20 the successful Woyane rebel army was ready to turn south to face an Ethiopian force attempting to advance to Tigray. Haile Selassie had ordered his minister of war Ras Abebe Aregai, to take charge of the campaign against the rebels. The Ras rushed northward and arrived at Korem, south of Maichew, on September 17 but his way was blocked by rebels. During the next three weeks, the Weyane forces fought hard against Ras Abebe's Ethiopian troops, who were bolstered by a small contingent of British officers and specialists.Rebels and Separatists in Ethiopia, Regional Resistance to a Marxist Regime by Paul Henze, Rand corporation-- prepared for the office of the under secretary of defense for policy, p. 42, December 1985. The fighting centred on the great natural fortress of Amba Alaji. Basha Gugusa, one of the first Woyanne leaders, led the battle of Amba Alage in the month of September 1943 to victory over Imperial army which was well equipped and supported by British air power. The Woyane forces outnumbered those of the government, but their advantage in numbers was offset by artillery and British air power. The Woyane leaders precipitated the final decisive battle by launching a three-pronged attack on government positions with perhaps 10,000 men. The war is spread to Alaje in Raya, Wukro in Kilte Awlalo, and Tembien where by the rebels mostly peasants beat the huge government forces equipped with tanks and modern weapons led by Ras Abebe Aregai, General Abebe Damtew and aided by British Col. Pluck. The total annihilation of government forces heavily supported by the British army sent a signal to the Emperor, that \\"the Tigrayans weren't only brave fighters but also astute strategists\\" said Hailemariam when he gave an interview to Wegahta magazine.Blata Hailemariam Reda, Wegahta Magazine, Nos. 1, 2, and 4, 1993. Countless British officers were killed, including Col. Pluck, who was killed by a Woyane rebel. The inability to subdue the rebellion prompted the Emperor to authorize an aerial bombardment by collaborating with the British Royal Air Force based in Aden which were able to operate a number of Bristol Blenheim's. On October 6, fourteen bombs and eight days later fifty four bombs were dropped in the provincial capital Mekelle respectively. On October 7, sixteen bombs and two days later thirty two bombs were dropped in Corbetta Raya and Hintalo Enderta respectively as well, though they were devastating mainly to civilians with thousands of people killed, they did not however, crush the rebellion.Gilkes, The dying lion, p. 180. Although the rebels scattered and battle formations began to disintegrate on October 7, uncertainty still affected the Ethiopian government forces and Ras Abebe did not personally move out of Korem until October 9. He then moved systematically northward and entered Quiha and Mekelle on October 14, capturing the erstwhile rebel headquarters at Wokro on October 17. Aftermath Ras Abebe Aregai was appointed as governor of Tigray and was given authority with the pacification of that province. His pacification was brutal. The punishment for the uprising severe as it may be with the aerial bombardment, the people were obliged to pay large sums of money and their land was confiscated and distributed to loyal gentry as a punishment and deterrent to future revolt. A new taxation was imposed that 'cost the peasants five times more than they had under the Italians during the occupation.Haggain Erlich \\"British involvement and Haile Selassie's emerging absolution northern Ethiopia, 1941-1943\\", Asian and African studies 15, 2 (1981), p. 219.

Bashay Gugsa was also not allowed to return to Tigray, because the central government feared his influence. However, the central government tried to make use of his military skills and sent him with a group of soldiers to suppress other rebellions in the southern Ethiopia. Although the Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians however agree that, the Woyane rebellion had involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest, p. 121. It demonstrated considerable popular participation, and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was unequivocally and specifically directed against the central Shoan Amhara regime of Haile Selassie I, rather than the Tigrayan imperial elite.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest, p. 122.

Biography Sahardjo was born in Surakarta, Dutch East Indies on 26 June 1909. After dropping out from medical school, he went on to study law, graduating with a bachelour's degree in 1941. At first he taught at a private school, but he then became active in politics, joining and eventually leading the Indonesian Party (Partai Indonesia). He participated in framing the 1947 citizenship law and the 1953 law on public elections. Dr Sahardjo served as Minister of Justice for three periods. His first period was during the First Working Cabinet, from 10 July 1959 to 18 February 1960. His second was during the Second Working Cabinet, from 18 February 1960 to 6 March 1962, and his third was during the Third Working Cabinet, from 6 March 1962 to 13 November 1963; during the Third Working Cabinet he was also Deputy Prime Minister / Coordinator of the Interior. During Sahardjo's time as Minister of Justice, there was also \\"fierce but publicly muted\\" debate regarding legal fundamentals such as nulla poena sine lege ('no penalty without a law'). Together with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Wirjono Prodjodikoro, he argued for greater protection of the freedoms of criminals and suspects; this eventually won general support, as the populace was displeased with the poor performance of Prosecutor General Goenawan. Sahardjo and Prodjodikoro moved to civil law reform in 1962, with Sahardjo proposing that both civil and commercial codes, remnants from the colonial period, be rescinded completely. This proposal, supported by Prodjodikoro and several members of the law community, was heavily opposed by advocates and judges; the advocates and judges argued that it would increase legal uncertainty, while Prodjodikoro argued that little would change as much had already been replaced. Sahardjo's preferred legal institution would be free of the \\"discriminatory\\" remnants of colonial law and included modified adat (traditional) laws—provided that they had been brought in line with the state philosophy of Pancasila. Although Prodjodikoro eventually rescinded several articles of the code, Lev notes that practices did not change much. The following year, he chose the banyan, an old Javanese symbol for justice, to replace a blindfolded woman holding scales as the symbol of the ministry; it was inscriped with the Javanese word pengajoman, meaning \\"protection and succor\\". According to Daniel S. Lev, an American scholar on Indonesian law, the change from European to Javanese symbology represented a return to tradition and \\"quickening\\" of the evolution from Dutch to Indonesian law. He also changed the designation of prisons from penjara ('jail') to Lembaga Permasyarakatan Khusus ('Special Civics Institutions'), arguing that prisons were places for reformation and not torture. Sahardjo died on 13 November 1963 and was buried in Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. Legacy Scholar on Indonesian legal history Sebastiaan Pompe writes critically of Sahardjo, saying that he \\"actively destroyed the law in the name of prevailing revolutionary ideology, making himself obsolete in the process.\\" A street named after Sahardjo is located in Tebet, South Jakarta, running from Manggarai to Pancoran.

It was rebuilt in the early 16th century by Jurij Lamberg, who gave it corner oriel windows and surrounded it with a wall with two towers, and gave it a German name: Steinbüchel. The castle is subsequently remembered as a meeting place for Kamnik's Lutherans. During the 17th and 18th century the castle was rebuilt in Baroque style and enlarged into a more comfortable residential building. Today, the castle serves as a museum and a venue for cultural and educational events.Kamniški zbornik. (1969). Issue XII. Muzej Kamnik  Background  Zaprice Castle in 1689 from the south The castle has repeatedly changed owners; the last private proprietors were the Rechbachs until 1945, when it was nationalised and transformed into multi-residential building. Soon after, the castle became the museum's headquarters and it was renovated in the following years. The castle is surrounded by a terraced park and a wall, a dairy farm at the entrance of the complex, two pavilions, a late Gothic sign, and an open-air museum of granaries from the Tuhinj Valley. There is also an archaeological site on the east side of the castle, where the foundation of an apsidal wall, a bronze fibula, and a few fragments of an ancient glass were found. Museum collections granaries and other outbuildings of the Kamnik intermunicipal museum The Kamnik Intermunicipal Museum was opened in the castle in 1961. The castle's salon was renovated in 1997 and serves as a venue for openings, lectures, concerts, and symposia. As of 2011, the museum had five main collections: * Archaeology collection * Ethnological collection * Culture-Historical collection * History of art collection * History collection Notable exhibitions in the main castle building include a display of Thonet bentwood furniture, a display about the 19th-century middle classes of Kamnik, a display of the pastoral heritage of the Big Pasture Plateau (), and a lapidary collection.

Soon after the 1858–1859 Wintoon War was over, Indians began slaughtering cattle in the Yager Creek region. In May 1859, rancher James C.

Weisenbach went to Canada to discover whether he could find Canadian ice hockey players of German descent who were eligible to obtain a German passport and therefore would not take up one of the limited permissible spots for foreigners. Additionally, they would also be eligible for the German national team. Weisenbach flew to Toronto and contacted German clubs in Canada to make contacts. He watched a number of junior games and eventually discovered a number of young players, among them Roedger, his brother Peter, Harold Kreis, Manfred Wolf, Ralph Krueger, George Fritz, Mike Schmidt, and Karl Friesen. Weisenbach managed to convince some of them to join his club, Mannheimer ERC while others, like Friesen, later appeared in the Bundesliga and for Germany for other clubs. It marked the beginning of an influx of ethnic German Canadians, the Deutschkanadier, in German ice hockey and on the national team.Klein, p. 152 Roedger joined Mannheim, freshly promoted to the Bundesliga, and by 1980, the club won the national championship, giving credit to Weisenbach's initially belittled recruitment effort.

In the 1984–85 season, Roedger was involved in an incident in which he hit Kölner EC player Steve McNeil in the right eye with his stick. In the scene, which was repeated on German television many times, McNeil is shown to lose a lot of blood. McNeil lost up to 50 percent of his vision in the right eye and Roedger was forced to pay him compensation after an out-of-court settlement but intent was never proven and it was generally considered to be an accidental foul.Klein, p. 84–85 At the end of the 1984–85 season, Roedger left Mannheim for the Düsseldorfer EG.

In 1836 he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn; he was treasurer in 1855, and master of the library in 1856.

Lord Brougham appointed him secretary of the second Record Commission, in which capacity he bought and printed so many books, that the Commission's debt exceeded the sum voted by parliament. Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland recommended him for the post of Solicitor General when Robert Monsey Rolfe was appointed, in 1835. Cooper enjoyed a leading practice in the court of Vice-chancellor James Lewis Knight-Bruce; but they had a public quarrel, and Cooper lost his reputation.

Political candidacies Cooper played an active part in public affairs in Kent, where he resided at Denton Court, near Canterbury. He appeared as a parliamentary candidate for Lambeth in 1850, but withdrew from the contest; in 1854 he unsuccessfully contested Canterbury, and was proposed as a candidate for West Kent in 1855, but declined to stand.

Raghav manages to get Rana arrested and saves Viraj from near death. He helps Viraj regain his memory after which Viraj tries to win Sia back but Raghav decides to return him to prison. On their way, they are attacked by goons who kill Raghav. Raghav dies with Sia's name on his lips and Viraj is blamed for the murder. He tries to convince Sia but also wants her back in his life. He poisons her and tells her that he will administer the antidote only when she tells him she loves him. Sia refuses and dies telling Viraj that she only loved Raghav and that her heart will live on to ensure Viraj has to pay for his misdeeds. After Sia's death Sia's heart is donated to a TV journalist named Ananya. Aware of Sia and Viraj's story, Ananya digs deeper and discovers Viraj killed Sia. She tries to expose him but fails. Viraj finds out about the operation and is angered that anything was stolen from Sia and tries to get her heart back. Ananya discovers Viraj has been hiding Sia's dead body and finds it and takes it to be cremated. Viraj tries to stop her but she curses him and he suddenly realises how wrong he has been. Emotionally destroyed, he surrenders himself to the police and is sentenced to 14 years in prison. The story ends with Ananya's heart finally forgiving Viraj who is shown to be repenting his actions and living in prison with Sia's memories.

Systematics and taxonomy Danaus dorippus was formerly regarded as a subspecies of Danaus chrysippus, the plain tiger or African monarch. It is now regarded as a distinct species. It appears (from analysis of mtDNA sequences, which are only inherited from the mother) that the dorippus tiger is the product of an ancient lineage of Danaus hybridizing with plain tiger females.Smith et al. (2005) As the plain tiger is known to be parasitized at least occasionally by Spiroplasma bacteria which selectively kill off male hosts,Jiggins et al. (2000) a subsequent scarcity of plain tiger males might have led to this hybridization and the evolution of the dorippus tiger. From the color pattern of this species, it can be assumed that the ancient lineage had no black apex on the forewings, as this character is still absent in D. dorippus. Description Danaus dorippus is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of about . The body is black with a few white spots. The wings are tawny and have a thin border of black enclosing a series of semicircular white spots. The hindwing has three or four black spots around the center. This species is mimicked (Batesian mimicry) by the females of Hypolimnas misippus, form inaria, The study of mimicry (Batesian and Müllerian) by temperature experiments on two Tropical butterflies that has orange forewing tip with white spotting.

The scion of a prominent Nationalist legal family, Comyn was sent to England after they fell out with Éamon de Valera. Considered by many to be \\"the finest all-round advocate at the English bar\\", Comyn was appointed to the High Court of Justice in 1978, serving on the bench until his retirement in 1985.  Early life  James Comyn was born at Beaufield House, Stillorgan, County Dublin, the son of Nationalist barrister James Comyn KC and of Mary Comyn; through his father he was the nephew of the barrister Michael Comyn KC. Both his father and uncle had been political and legal advisers to Éamon de Valera, who at one point used Beaufield House as a safe house. However, the Comyn brothers fell out with de Valera shortly before he came to power in 1932, and Michael Comyn was passed over as Attorney- General of the Free State. As a result, James Comyn, who was then attending Belvedere College in Dublin, was sent by his father to attend The Oratory School in England. Comyn spent six months as a trainee at The Irish Times under the editor R. M. Smyllie, but abandoned journalism after a joke he added to an obituary was printed in the paper, leading to his demotion to the racing department. Comyn then matriculated at New College, Oxford, where he read law, graduating with second-class honours. In 1940, he defeated Roy Jenkins for the presidency of the Oxford Union, winning by four votes. After suffering the first of several breakdowns through his life, he briefly worked for the BBC's Empire Service during the war.  Career at the bar  Comyn was called to the English bar by the Inner Temple in 1942, the Irish bar in 1947, and the Hong Kong bar in 1969. In 1944, he began his pupillage with Edward Holroyd Pearce KC, later a law lord, and joined his chambers at Fountain Court. Comyn practised in London and on the Western circuit, supplementing his earnings by teaching banking, a subject of which he knew nothing. On one occasion, he rose in Lambeth County court to cross-examine a female defendant in an eviction case; just as Comyn began by saying \\"Madam\\", the defendant opened her bag, took out a dead cat, and threw it at him. The judge's reaction was to tell the defendant: \\"Madam, if you do that again, I’ll commit you\\". Comyn won the case. Comyn took silk in 1961, and acquired a large practice as a senior, appearing in many high-profile cases. In 1964, he won damages for libel for the former safe-breaker Alfie Hinds against a Scotland Yard inspector by convincing the jury that Hinds was in fact innocent. In 1970, he successfully defended the Labour MP Will Owen, who was accused of providing information to the Czechoslovak intelligence services. In 1975, he defeated the government's attempt to obtain an injunction against the publication of the diaries of former minister Richard Crossman (Attorney General v Jonathan Cape Ltd). Of his powers of advocacy, it was said that \\"Jimmy Comyn can take the stink out of everything\\". Comyn was Recorder of Andover between 1964 and 1971 (honorary life recorder from 1972), commissioner of assize for the Western Circuit in 1971, and a Recorder of the Crown Court between 1972 and 1977. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1968, and served as chairman of the Bar council from 1973 to 1974.  Judicial career  Having refused a previous invitation by Lord Hailsham to join the bench, Comyn was again nominated by Lord Elwyn-Jones in 1977, and was appointed a High Court judge in 1978, receiving the customary knighthood upon his appointment. Initially assigned to the Family Division, he did not take to the work, and was reassigned to the Queen's Bench Division in 1979. He had a reputation for leniency in sentencing, first acquired as Recorder of Andover, when he was nicknamed \\"Probation Comyn\\". In 1980–81, he presided over an unsuccessful libel action by a member of the Unification Church (colloquially known as the Moonies) against the Daily Mail, the longest libel trial in England up to that time. His Irish background made him the target of IRA action, and in 1981 the Provisional IRA burnt his house in Tara. Recurring bouts of depression led to his early retirement, on grounds of ill health, in 1985. He died on 5 January 1997 at age 75. In retirement, he divided his time between England and Ireland, whose citizenship he had retained. He wrote a number of books, including memoirs, light verse, and books on famous trials. He also bred Friesian cattle.  Family  Comyn married Anne Chaundler, a solicitor, in 1967; they had two children. Lady Comyn passed away in 2018, aged 92.

One indicates the rate of turn, or the rate of change in the aircraft's heading; the other part indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight, showing the slip or skid of the turn. The slip indicator is actually an inclinometer that at rest displays the angle of the aircraft's transverse axis with respect to horizontal, and in motion displays this angle as modified by the acceleration of the aircraft. The most commonly used units are degrees per second (deg/s) or minutes per turn (min/tr). Name The turn and slip indicator can be referred to as the turn and bank indicator, although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle. Neither does the turn coordinator, but it does respond to roll rate, which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn. Operation Graphic of a turn and slip indicator and a turn coordinator Turn indicator The turn indicator is a gyroscopic instrument that works on the principle of precession. The gyro is mounted in a gimbal. The gyro's rotational axis is in-line with the lateral (pitch) axis of the aircraft, while the gimbal has limited freedom around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the aircraft. As the aircraft yaws, a torque force is applied to the gyro around the vertical axis, due to aircraft yaw, which causes gyro precession around the roll axis. The gyro spins on an axis that is 90 degrees relative to the direction of the applied yaw torque force. The gyro and gimbal rotate (around the roll axis) with limited freedom against a calibrated spring. The torque force against the spring reaches an equilibrium and the angle that the gimbal and gyro become positioned is directly connected to the display needle, thereby indicating the rate of turn.\\"How Aircraft Instruments Work.\\" Popular Science, March 1944, pp. 117. In the turn coordinator, the gyro is canted 30 degrees from the horizontal so it responds to roll as well as yaw. The display contains hash marks for the pilot's reference during a turn. When the needle is lined up with a hash mark, the aircraft is performing a \\"standard rate turn\\" which is defined as three degrees per second, known in some countries as \\"rate one\\". This translates to two minutes per 360 degrees of turn (a complete circle). Indicators are marked as to their sensitivity, with \\"2 min turn\\" for those whose hash marks correspond to a standard rate or two-minute turn, and \\"4 min turn\\" for those, used in faster aircraft, that show a half standard rate or four-minute turn. The supersonic Concorde jet aircraft and many military jets are examples of aircraft that use 4 min. turn indicators. The hash marks are sometimes called \\"dog houses\\", because of their distinct shape on various makes of turn indicators. Under instrument flight rules, using these figures allows a pilot to perform timed turns in order to conform with the required air traffic patterns. For a change of heading of 90 degrees, a turn lasting 30 seconds would be required to perform a standard rate or \\"rate one\\" turn. Inclinometer Coordinated flight indication is obtained by using an inclinometer, which is recognized as the \\"ball in a tube\\". An inclinometer contains a ball sealed inside a curved glass tube, which also contains a liquid to act as a damping medium. The original form of the indicator is in effect a spirit level with the tube curved in the opposite direction and a bubble replacing the ball. In some early aircraft the indicator was merely a pendulum with a dashpot for damping. The ball gives an indication of whether the aircraft is slipping, skidding or in coordinated flight. The ball's movement is caused by the force of gravity and the aircraft's centripetal acceleration. When the ball is centered in the middle of the tube, the aircraft is said to be in coordinated flight. If the ball is on the inside (wing down side) of a turn, the aircraft is slipping. And finally, when the ball is on the outside (wing up side) of the turn, the aircraft is skidding. A simple alternative to the balance indicator used on gliders is a yaw string, which allows the pilot to simply view the string's movements as rudimentary indication of aircraft balance. Turn coordinator standard rate coordinated right turn. The turn coordinator (TC) is a further development of the turn and slip indicator (T/S) with the major difference being the display and the axis upon which the gimbal is mounted. The display is that of a miniature airplane as seen from behind. This looks similar to that of an attitude indicator. \\"NO PITCH INFORMATION\\" is usually written on the instrument to avoid confusion regarding the aircraft's pitch, which can be obtained from the artificial horizon instrument. In contrast to the T/S, the TC's gimbal is pitched up 30 degrees from the transverse axis. This causes the instrument to respond to roll as well as yaw. This allows the instrument to display a change more quickly as it will react to the change in roll before the aircraft has even begun to yaw. Although this instrument reacts to changes in the aircraft's roll, it does not display the roll attitude. The turn coordinator may be used as a performance instrument when the attitude indicator has failed. This is called \\"partial panel\\" operations. It can be unnecessarily difficult or even impossible if the pilot does not understand that the instrument is showing roll rates as well as turn rates. The usefulness is also impaired if the internal dashpot is worn out. In the latter case, the instrument is underdamped and in turbulence will indicate large full-scale deflections to the left and right, all of which are actually roll rate responses. Practical implications Skidding. The corrective action is to press the \\"left\\" pedal adequately. Slipping and skidding within a turn is sometimes referred to as a sloppy turn, due to the perceptive discomfort it can cause to the pilot and passengers. When the aircraft is in a balanced turn (ball is centered), passengers experience gravity directly in line with their seat (force perpendicular to seat). With a well balanced turn, passengers may not even realize the aircraft is turning unless they are viewing objects outside the aircraft. While aircraft slipping and skidding are often undesired in a usual turn that maintains altitude, slipping of the aircraft can be used for practical purposes. Intentionally putting an aircraft into a slip is used as a forward slip and a sideslip. These slips are performed by applying opposite inputs of the aileron and rudder controls. A forward slip allows a pilot to quickly drop altitude without gaining unnecessary speed, while a sideslip is one method utilized to perform a crosswind landing.

Together with Dame Sheila Sherlock, he is widely regarded as the founding father of hepatology. Hans Popper (1903–1988) Early life Popper was born to Carl and Emilie Popper in Vienna on 24 November 1903. His father was a prominent physician and, as a captain in the medical corps, was called to active army duty at the outbreak of World War I.

Career  Popper spent his five postgraduate years in anatomical pathology and established a biochemical laboratory,Schmid R, Schenker S. Hans Popper in Memoriam 1903–1988. Hepatology 1989:9;669-674 which at the time was a new field of medical research. He worked under the famous Viennese physician Professor Hans Eppinger, under whose influence he developed his interest in hepatology. One of his main achievements of this period was the creatinine clearance test to assess renal function. After Austria's Anschluß to the Third Reich in 1938, Popper (who was Jewish) narrowly escaped arrest by boarding a flight to Rotterdam, where he then boarded the SS New Amsterdam on her maiden voyage to New York. He received a research fellowship at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, and earned a PhD in pathology at the University of Illinois.

It connects Strausberg station on the Eastern Railway with the centre of Strausberg, which is located north of the Eastern Railway. The line is served by S-Bahn line S 5 at 20-minute intervals. It is also served by some freight trains, which connect to the Strausberg base of the Luftwaffe in northern Strausberg. History Main platform of Strausberg station The headquarters of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (the militarised unit of the East German police, which was transformed in 1956 into the National People's Army) was moved in June 1954 from Berlin-Adlershof to Strausberg, because Berlin had been declared a demilitarised zone by the four occupying powers. As the headquarters were in the north of the city and the closest station was in the far south, the construction of a branch line was necessary. This was opened to traffic after a short construction period on 1 January 1955. The railway separated from the Eastern Railway behind the main platform of Strausberg station and followed a shallow curve to the north. In addition to the terminus at Strausberg Nord, Strausberg Stadt station was about seven kilometres from the beginning of the line and there was a siding to the Hugo Eberlein Guard Regiment just before the terminus. It was initially operated with diesel multiple units, which were replaced on 3 June 1956 by electric S-Bahn trains. The complicated track work at Strausberg station and the unfavourable situation of the “home platform”, prevented continuous operation, so that the operation of trains between Strausberg and Strausberg Nord was irregular. Only after a continuous track connection was made on 26 May 1968 could continuous operations be started. As only one continuous track existed in Strausberg and the nearest passing place was in Strausberg Nord, however, services could only be operated at 40-minute intervals. Platform at Strausberg Stadt station Strausberg Hegermühle station was opened on 5 October 1984 about halfway between Strausberg and Strausberg Stadt in order to promote the development of the area between the two stations as well as to connect to boat trips on the nearby Herrensee. After Die Wende (the turn) there were suggestions that the line be closed and that at the same time the parallel Strausberg Railway should be upgraded. Studies revealed that passenger numbers would increase from 10,500 to only 11,700, rather than the targeted 14,200. As a further means of stimulating passenger growth individual services of Regionalbahn line RB 26 ran during peak hours between Berlin-Lichtenberg and Strausberg Nord during the 1998/99 timetable period. However, since only about 200 passengers a day used this service, it was withdrawn in 1999. Around 2000, the travel times on the S-Bahn from Berlin Alexanderplatz to Strausberg were shortened by nearly five minutes as the result of the modernisation of the fleet. Patronage on the line to Strausberg Nord increased between 1998 and 2002 alone by 24 percent. This in turn led to calls for an increase in services on the line to a frequency of 20 minutes, but the construction of a second track in the area of Hegermühle station would be necessary. The S-Bahn initially planned to implement the project by 2005. Although the state of Brandenburg approved the 20-minute cycle several years ago, Deutsche Bahn did not start planning for the extension of the line until after the state took over the planning costs of €450,000 in mid-2012. The plans were to be completed by 2014. It was planned to extend a 2.2-kilometre section between Strausberg and Hegermühle in two tracks. The estimated cost was about €7 million. The actual construction work for the construction of the 2.2-kilometre encounter section took place during an eight-week full closure until the end of September 2015. Prior to the commissioning, the bridge over Garzauer Straße was rebuilt to the south of a 187-metre long soundproof wall. The commissioning of the crossing loop and the upgrade of operations to 20-minute intervals to Strausberg Nord was made at the timetable change on 13 December 2015.

It is necessary because QM does not account for the specific measurements of observable quantities or events, in the familiar realm of Newtonian or classical physics, that we make in QM experiments. The reason that QM does not account for measurements is that the time evolution of the quantum state of a system is described probabilistically by linear superpositions of Schrödinger equations. Even if we include the quantum state of the measuring devices, and even if we include the quantum state of the surrounding universe, this gives no information about actual measurements, each of which always appears to choose a particular possible value.

The stated purposes of the Act are \\"to acknowledge within the framework of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit that the Government, all public agencies, boards and commissions and all persons in Nunavut have the responsibility to guarantee that every individual in Nunavut is afforded an equal opportunity to enjoy a full and productive life and that failure to provide equality of opportunity threatens the development and well-being of all persons in the community.\\" The Act explicitly does not affect any protections provided for by the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. A notable achievement of this legislation was to end Nunavut's status as the only jurisdiction in Canada without protections for gay, lesbian and bisexual residents against discrimination.  Provisions  The Human Rights Act 2003 makes it unlawful to discriminate in certain areas (such as employment, the provision of goods and services and tenancy) on the grounds of \\"race, colour, ancestry, ethnic origin, citizenship, place of origin, creed, religion, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, pregnancy, lawful source of income and a conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\\" The Act also makes it unlawful to harass another person on the basis of such grounds or publish any material expressing discrimination or implying discrimination against an individual or class of individuals. The Act also established Nunavut Human Rights Tribunal, located in Coral Harbour. Members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Commissioner of Nunavut in Executive Council to serve a term of four years each. Terms may be renewed by the Commissioner in Executive Council, with no term limit. Any person so aggrieved under the Act may file a notification with the Tribunal within two years of any alleged contravention of the Human Rights Act. The Tribunal may make an order in line with s. 34(3) of the Act; such orders are binding on a person as would orders of courts.  Controversy  The proposed Human Rights Act attracted criticism from both progressives and conservatives prior to its passage, with progressives dismayed that the Bill, unlike similar legislation in the Northwest Territories, did not recognise gender identity as a protected grounds, and conservative MLAs attempting to remove references to sexual orientation as a protected grounds in the Bill. The day after the passage of the law, a spokeswoman for Iqaluit Pride & Friends of Pride, an LGBT advocacy organisation, expressed disappointment that the Act did not include any reference to gender identity to protect transgender people from discrimination. While the group acknowledged that courts had already recognised transgender people as protected from discrimination under the grounds of sex, the spokeswoman pointed to similar legislation enacted in the Northwest Territories that referred to gender identity as a model. On the night the Bill was passed into law, Patterk Netser, the member for Nanulik, moved a motion to strike the words 'sexual orientation' from the list of protected grounds, as many members had concerns that the Bill would affect the status of same-sex marriage in Nunavut. According to Paul Okalik, then the Premier of Nunavut, if this motion had passed, the federal government would not have provided Nunavut's Human Rights Tribunal with the ability to adjudicate disputes - protection of gay, lesbian and bisexual Nunavummiut was a condition of the government granting this ability.

He was born at Hemma in Brøttum as a son of farmers Johannes Larsen Hemma (1831–1875) and Kristine Biskopaasen (1836–1914). He took basic education, worked three years within commerce in Kristiania, then started working at the family farm which he inherited in 1893. In Ringsaker municipal council he was elected in 1898 and served for twenty years, and he was also a member of the school board. He participated in his first parliamentary election in 1906, and was elected as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway for the Coalition Party, from the constituency Nordre Hedemarken. His running mate E. Svartshoel was not elected, so that Hemma served as a deputy for Liberal Wollert Konow (H). In the 1909 election he narrowly failed re-election as deputy. The Coalition Party was no more, but Hemma had joined the Liberal Left Party. Svartshoel had joined the Conservative Party, and they stood against Konow. Svartshoel and Hemma lost the first round; having carried the municipalities Furnes and Nes but lost Ringsaker. There was a second round of voting, but before it took place, Svartshoel died and Konow was allowed to run unnoposed. In the 1912 election Hemma stood as deputy candidate, and won the first voting round together with his running mate Axel Krogvig. In the second round however, Konow won and carried Nordre Hedemarken. From 1915 to 1918 Hemma was a central board member of the Liberal Left Party. In the 1918 election things had turned around. Wollert Konow was fielded by the Norwegian Agrarian Association with the backing from the Liberal Left and Conservative parties. Hemma stood as his deputy, and they won comfortably. In 1921 there was a new election system with ballot lists; Hemma stood as seventh ballot candidate for the Agrarian Party but without chance of election. In 1924 he was the tenth candidate, in 1927 he was the fourth candidate and was elected as second deputy, and met for some months in Parliament in 1928 and 1930.

It was established after Dorie's Well was discovered and found to have water similar to the water used by the Glen Spey distillery, which was used by Justerini & Brooks to produce malt whisky for their blends. The well's water was used to produce a test batch of whisky at Glen Spey distillery, and was approved, which led to the start of construction of the Auchroisk distillery at the site of the well in 1972 to produce whisky for the J&B; blend. Production started in 1974. The distillery produced its first single malt in 1978. The single malt was rebranded as 'The Singleton' in 1986, as the name 'Auchroisk' was perceived as too difficult for consumers outside Scotland. The name changed back to Auchroisk in 2001, when a bottling was released under the name 'Auchroisk 10 Year Old Flora & Fauna' in the Diageo Flora & Fauna range. In 2008 the name was changed again, this time to 'The Singleton of Auchroisk'. The distillery is used as a hub for vatting Auchroisk with the highland whiskies used in J&B; before being shipped off for marrying and bottling.

Until the Second World War the district was known as the Suomen Palloliiton Viipurin piiri (SPL Viipuri district). It administered football and bandy initially in and around Viipuri, later expanding to cover the southern part of the historical Finnish Karelia, and ultimately in the Lake Saimaa area. Currently it's part of the Suomen Palloliiton Kaakkois-Suomen piiri.  History  The SPL Viipuri district covered the Viipuri province The district was founded by Sudet, Reipas and IFK in early 1924 as Suomen Palloliiton Viipurin piiri. It was based in Viipuri, a major city in the Karelian Isthmus, and covered the southern part of the historical Finnish Karelia. The exact foundation date is unknown, but the Football Association accepted the district's membership on April 19.Hakuli 1974, p. 23. It was the association's third district after Helsinki and Vaasa which had been established in January 1924.Arponen 1995, p. 455–456. In its early years the district included only clubs from Viipuri, and for example clubs from Lappeenranta and the Vuoksi Valley joined in the 1930s. Clubs from Sortavala and Joensuu in northern Karelia founded their own district in 1930.Arponen 1995, p. 459–461. By the time the district was founded Viipuri already had strong ball game traditions as Sudet (originally called Wiipurin Bandy- ja Jalkapalloseura), a specialized bandy and football club, had won seven Finnish bandy championships in addition to reaching the final another three times. Also IFK and SLU had reached the final. In football Reipas had reached the championship final four times. Back then the championships were decided in cup tournaments; a league format was adopted in football in 1930 and in bandy in 1931. Another major club from Viipuri was Viipurin Palloseura (ViPS) which was founded in 1928 by younger members of Sudet fed up playing in the reserves as well as members of the multi-sports clubs Reipas and IFK.Hakuli 1974, p. 27.Hakuli 1974, p. 88–89. In the following years the new club challenged Sudet especially in bandy and won the Finnish championship in 1931 and 1936. Sudet still remained the dominant club and after the founding of the district won another seven championships, the last of which came in 1933. Other areas of the district showed progress as well with Ylä-Vuoksen Palloseura (YVPS) from Enso finishing second in 1939. In football Reipas reached the final again in 1927 and Sudet finished third in 1933 and 1937. The Viipuri district included 15 clubs in 1933, and a peak of 23 clubs was reached in 1936.Hakuli 1974, p. 92–93. In terms of clubs and registered teams and players it was the Football Association's second biggest district after Helsinki.Arponen 1995, p. 456–457. Worth noting is that several trade union clubs weren't members of the Football Association but the Workers' Sports Federation which organized its own competitions. Talikkalan Toverit from Viipuri won the Workers' Sports Federation football championship in 1931 and 1933 and the bandy championship in 1930, 1932 and 1935.Arponen 1995, p. 218–220.Arponen 1995, p. 237–239. Another successful Workers' Sports Federation ball club from Viipuri was Sorvalin Veikot whose best achievement was reaching the bandy final in 1933, 1938 and 1939. The Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union broke out in November 1939. When the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in March 1940, Viipuri was lost and only a stub of the district's region and four clubs, Simpeleen Urheilijat (SiU) from Simpele, YVPS, Etelä-Saimaan Kisa (ESK) from Lauritsala and Lappeenrannan Urheilu-Miehet (LUM) from Lappeenranta, were left.Hakuli 1974, p. 41. Because of this the district moved its headquarters to Lappeenranta, where the first general assembly was held in September 1940.Hakuli 1974, p. 42. In 1942 the assembly was held in Imatra, and in 1943 the Finnish advances in the Continuation War permitted the district to briefly return to Viipuri. Ultimately, when the war ended in September 1944, the borders drawn in 1940 were retained and the district relocated back to Lappeenranta.Hakuli 1974, p. 45. Several Viipuri-based clubs found home elsewhere in Finland and continue to operate until this day. Sudet moved to Helsinki in 1940 and to Kouvola in 1962. The evacuee club, who merged with ViPS, enjoyed some success in football during the wars and even won its first and only Finnish championship in the sport in 1940, but later on the club hasn't managed to reach the glory of the Viipuri years. Reipas went to Lahti where it won three championships in football in 1963, 1967 and 1970. Younger clubs of Viipuri included Ilves, who moved to Tampere and became known as Tampere-Viipurin Ilves-Kissat due to the city already having a club called Ilves, and Viipurin Pallokerho, who moved to Helsinki and is now known as Pallokerho-35. Ilves-Kissat won the championship in football in 1950. The district's name was changed to Suomen Palloliiton Saimaan piiri in 1945, and at the same occasion Savonlinna joined from the Savo district. Mikkeli followed suit in 1952.Hakuli 1974, p. 51. Another boost in membership took place in 1955 when the Workers' Sports Federation clubs became members of the Football Association and its districts. This completed the \\"marriage\\" which had started in 1948 with the Workers' Sports Federation clubs joining the Football Association competitions.Hakuli 1974, p. 55. When the district celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 1974 it had 46 member clubs.Hakuli 1974, p. 103. In the post-war era the district's footballing focus shifted to Mikkeli where Mikkelin Pallo-Kissat (MiPK) and Mikkelin Palloilijat (MP) played several seasons in the national top-flight. MP finished second in 1970, 1972 and 1991, third in 1990, and won the Finnish Cup in 1970 and 1971. Clubs from the other major cities of Lappenranta, Imatra and Savonlinna have never reached the top-flight in football. In bandy LUM won the championship in 1949 and Veiterä, LUM's successor in the sport, in 1951, 1955 and 1957, in addition to several second and third-place finishes. MP managed a row of first, second and third-place finishes in 1968, 1969 and 1970, respectively, and Lappeenrannan Pallo (LaPa) was second in 1966. A separate Finnish Bandy Federation was founded in 1972, and the sport hasn't been a part of the Football Association or its districts since then.Hakuli 1974, p. 78. The Saimaa district merged with the Kymenlaakso district in 1994 to form the current Suomen Palloliiton Kaakkois-Suomen piiri which includes the regions of Kymenlaakso and South Karelia as a whole and parts of the regions of Päijänne Tavastia, Southern Savonia and Uusimaa.  District champions  In addition to taking part in league play the clubs of the district competed against each other in district championship tournaments. The district organized these tournaments in several levels known as classes and also for youth teams. The following lists include the 1st class champions until the 1970s.

His father was the reigning Duke of Lorraine and his mother a member of the House of Bourbon, then ruling the Kingdom of France. He became the Hereditary Prince at his birth in 1704, but died of smallpox in 1711 at the age of seven, unmarried and without descendants. Biography He was born at the Château de Lunéville to Léopold, Duke of Lorraine and his wife Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans. Louis was the fifth child but second son born to his parents. Also, Louis was the second of the four heirs of his father: his older brother Prince Léopold, Duke of Bar (26 August 16992 April 1700) died aged eight months; his younger brother Léopold Clément Charles (25 April 17074 June 1723) died aged sixteen and his younger brother François Etienne/Stephen lived to adulthood, became the Duke of Lorraine and also, by union, became Holy Roman Emperor and founded the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Soon after his birth, on 24 June 1704, the young prince was baptised as a Roman Catholic at the Château de Lunéville. He did not see the deaths of two of his siblings: Louis, Duke of Bar (26 August 16992 April 1700) and Princess Louise Christine (13 November 170118 November 1701) both died before reaching the age of one. By the time of his birth, however, two sisters had survived. An epidemic of smallpox was going around Europe in the Spring of 1711. It had already killed people like the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I (who died on 17 April) and the Grand Dauphin, Louis (who died on 14 April). Unfortunately, against all efforts, Princess Élisabeth Charlotte of Lorraine, Louis' older sister, contracted smallpox and died on 4 May. Before this, she passed on to Louis and Princess Marie Gabrièle Charlotte. Louis died on 10 May and Marie Gabrièle Charlotte died the very next day. They were both buried in the ducal crypt at the Église Saint-François-des- Cordeliers. At Louis' death, his younger brother Léopold Clement Charles became Hereditary Prince, but he, too died of smallpox in 1723, at the age of sixteen.

It is 60 km from the city and is a popular pilgrimage centre. The uniqueness of this temple is that the prime deity Lord Karthikeya, is found together with Lord Narasimha. According to mythology, both idols are believed to have emerged from the earth. It is also an important centre in South India for worship of the Hindu deity Kethu. Special rituals are performed during Brahmarathotsava, i.e., on the day of Pushya shudda Shashti. Narasimha Jayanti is the other major festival celebrated here.  History  Ghati Subramanya has a recorded history of more than 600 years. It was first developed by the Ghorpade rulers of Sandur who ruled parts of Bellary.  Tradition  It is the belief of devotees that childless couples making vows ( ಹರಕೆ ) shall be blessed with children by the lord. A related ritual is that of installing idols of snakes (ನಾಗರ ಹಾವು). One can see thousands of such idols near the temple. Design The idol of Lord Karthikeya with a seven headed cobra is made from a single stone. It faces eastwards while the idol of Lord Narasimha faces westwards. To ensure that both deities are visible to devotees at the same time, a huge mirror was placed in the rear in the sanctum sanctorum.  Locality  Ghati Subramanya is about 60km from Bangalore. The most popular route is via Doddaballapura. If opting for a public transport, direct routes to Ghati from Bangalore are pretty less in number and one may have to change over at Doddaballapura.

He was born in Trondhjem (now Trondheim) as a son of Nicolai Bredo Stabell (1736–1817) and Karen Bolette Grøgaard (1769–1832). He was married twice. In September 1829 he married Caroline Birgitte Knudtzon (1805–1848). After her death, he married Theodora Adolphine Egidius (1827–1910) in March 1860. He edited the newspaper Morgenbladet from 1831 to 1857. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Akershus Amt in 1844, and was re-elected in 1847, 1850, 1853 and 1856. From 1848 he had served as President of the Odelsting. He co-founded Akers Sparebank in 1842, chairing it from 1846 to 1865, and in 1858 he co-founded Den norske Creditbank which he led from 1858. Morgenbladet Stabell joined Morgenbladet a year later, in 1831, the newspaper's owner, Rasmus Hviid. Stabell worked as an editor, with several exchanges, mostly anonymously, as a representative of the newspaper. Under Stabell was the newspaper within a few years more modern compared to the balance between news, commentary, debate and ads. Morgenbladet also took a clear political position of the liberal opposition, which led to the newspaper The Constitutionelle was created as a more government-friendly competitor. The two newspapers frequently disagreed, especially concerning the poets Henrik Wergeland and Johan Sebastian Welhaven, albeit the views of the two varied in the papers. Stabell's role as newspaper editor was concerned with creating an independent newspaper with clear political opinions and news. Stabell got Ludvig Kristensen Daa into newspaper employee in 1841. In the same year Morgenbladet, which had benefited from Wergeland's contribution in the newspaper, had a major dispute with him, partly because of disagreements between Wergeland and Daa. It meant that the newspaper initially refused Wergeland column space, then accused him of being unsuitable as a bishop because he was \\"\\" (\\"upset and bad-tempered\\") and claimed also that Wergeland, having written the poem \\"\\", withdrew co-operation for three years. With Daa in the newspaper Wergeland also became less directly active as a journalist. Politics Stabell was mayor of Aker in 1839 to 1843 and from 1847 to 1859. The table also made it into parliament in 1845. Table tried to put forward a proposal calling for a new system to replace the ministers, and demands that ministers should participate in Parliament, and thus accountable. This was considered very radical and was later withdrawn. In spite of that chart was relatively radical, he chose the Thrane movement a more government-friendly line. Stabell had been Odelsting president from 1848 to 1857, and in 1858 he became vice-president of the Parliament, but when Stabells house remained in Christiania for urban expansion, were Stabells constituency overwhelmingly governmentally. Thus disappeared chart of Parliament. Banking Since he also resigned from the editorial work in Morgenbladet in 1857 (but still had some ownership), he became more active in the banking system. That same year he formed The Norwegian Credit Bank, which was the first private national commercial bank in Norway. He was head of the bank from 1858. Unfortunately for table held The Norwegian Credit Bank to be destroyed already in the beginning as a result of excessive lending policies. This sapped his health, and he died in 1865. Stabell married 2 September 1829 with Caroline Birgitte Knudtzon (5 October 1805 - 5 April 1848). He remarried on 7 March with Theodora Adolphine Egidius (10 October 1827 – 10 January 1910).

Education Van Ginneken completed a bachelor's degree at the Radboud University Nijmegen, a master’s at the University of Amsterdam, followed by a brief stint at the École pratique des Hautes études en sciences sociales in Paris, and finally a Ph. D. with distinction on mass psychology and crowd psychology. He taught at various universities, ultimately as a long-time associate professor at the International School and Communication Science Department of the University of Amsterdam.Lisa Kumar, The writers dictionary, Farmington Hills, Michigan: St. James Press 2011 (26th ed.). . Early Journalism For most of the 1970s, he worked as a Paris-based newspaper correspondent and roving reporter on third world affairs for Dutch media, with isolated contributions to foreign newspapers such as the French Le Monde and the British The Guardian. In line with the spirit of May 1968 in France and widespread opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, he adhered to the unequal exchange and dependency theory, and came to sympathize with liberation movements and third world revolutions. Two of his early books then focused on the new conflicts arising from them. The rise and fall of Lin Piao (and the so-called ‘Gang of Four’) dealt with ultraleftism during the Chinese cultural revolution. The third Indochina war dealt with the subsequent confrontation between China, Vietnam and Cambodia. In the course of the early 1980s, however, Van Ginneken recognized that he had become too much of a fellow traveler, and returned to academic work in his original fields. Academic Work This covered three themes: first the history of science, second social, political and mass psychology, third media images of other cultures. On the first theme, he published a series of studies on the history of political psychology,‘Outline of a cultural history’. Ch. 1, pp. 3-22, in W. Stone & P.

He just completed a biography of Kurt Baschwitz: a Jewish- German- Dutch pioneer of communication studies and social psychology.

He succeeded to the title in 1521, when his father was killed while assisting the Earl of Surrey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in putting down a rebellion by the O'Connor and O'Carroll families.Burke's Peerage 107th Edition (2003), Vol.1 p.1240 Marriages and children  Robert married firstly Eleanor Darcy, daughter of Sir William Darcy of Platten and his first wife Margaret St Lawrence. They had at least thirteen children, most of whom survived infancy, including: *John, who died before his father leaving an only daughter, Elizabeth; *Christopher, 6th Baron of Dunsany; *Gerald, who married Catherine Eustace, daughter of Thomas Eustace, 1st Viscount Baltinglass *Richard *Ellen, who married Matthew Begg *Jenet, who married James FitzGerald *Alison, who married Christopher Plunkett *Anne, who married Simon Pettit *Mary, who married Richard Luttrell *Margaret, who married Walter, Baron Skryne; *Elizabeth, who married Sir Walter FitzGerald, a younger son of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare. Dunsany married secondly Jenet Sarsfield who had already buried two husbands and was to have six in all. They do not seem to have been married for more than two years when Dunsany died in March 1559; their two sons apparently died in infancy. Despite the brevity of the marriage Jenet took great pride in her rank as a baroness: although she made three further marriages, two of them to knights, she preferred in later life to be called Lady Dunsany and was buried under that title in a tomb of her own design.Scott, Brendan: Career Wives or Wicked Stepmothers? (2009) History Ireland Vol. 1 Issue 1 Career  During the rebellion of Silken Thomas, Dunsany, whose daughter Elizabeth was married to Thomas's uncle Walter FitzGerald, (who was later executed for his part in the Rebellion) fell under suspicion of treason, and in the autumn of 1535 he was denounced to the Crown as a ringleader of the rebellion. His enemies urged that he should be attainted; but in the event Henry VIII, having virtually destroyed the FitzGerald family, including Dunsany's son-in-law Walter, was prepared to be merciful to the other nobles of the Pale, and Dunsany escaped unscathed.Ellis, S.G Henry VIII, Rebellion and the Rule of Law (1981) Historical Journal Vol.24 p.513 His later career suggests that he had regained the Crown's trust. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in the Parliament of 1541; he was one of the nobles who confirmed the election of Sir Francis Bryan as Governor of Ireland in 1549; and in 1557 he accompanied the Lord Deputy, Sussex, on an expedition against the McDonnells of Ulster.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland Dublin 1789 p.202  References  Barons in the Peerage of Ireland 1559 deaths 16th-century Irish people Year of birth unknown ","title":"Robert Plunkett, 5th Baron of Dunsany"},{"id":"34111529","text":"The Little Theatre Group is an Indian theatre company started by Aysha Rau in 1991.

In 1998 their population was about 250,000. Location By the 1970s the Lega people were mostly living in the middle and upper Elila valley and the upper Ulindi River valley. These rivers both rise in the east of South Kivu and flow in a northwesterly direction through Maniema, joining the Lualaba downstream from Kindu. The upper Ulindi valley has a richly diverse fauna, including many monkey species, chimpanzees, leopards, buffaloes, elephants and antelopes. The valley is administratively divided into the Mwenga and Shabunda territories of South Kivu Province and the Pangi Territory of Maniema Province. The territory is covered by deep rain forest and, in the east, rugged mountains rising to or more. The climate is hot and humid year round. Average temperature is to . Annual rainfall is to . The mountains hold areas of moist woodlands as well as montane forest and grasslands. To the north and west the forest is denser and deeper. The south of the region holds mosaics of forest savannah and woodlands. All of the forest has long been inhabited by humans, who have cleared land for cultivation, then let it return to the wild. In some places the forest has not grown back but has been replaced by grassland. The forest has many plants and trees that provide food and are used for other purposes, and has abundant wildlife. Social structure This necklace may have been part of the jewelry belonging to the Bwami religious and social organization. It is made of elephant ivory The Lega people traditionally live in small village groups, with no central authority. Within a community, a chief inherits his position on a patrilineal basis, and his close relatives have highest rank. Counterbalancing this hereditary structure, the Bwami society also regulates social and political life. This society has seven levels for men and four for women and is open to all. An initiate advances through the ranks through a complex system of instruction, payment and initiation, achieving increasing status. A member of the highest level is recognized as a Kindi, a social leader with great moral authority. The Lega people are polytheistic. Their gods include Kalaga, the promiser; Kenkunga, the reassembler; Ombe, the hidden; Kaginga, the incarnation of evil. Kaginga assists sorcerers, but Bwami membership can protect an individual against the evil doings of witches. History The Lega people originated in what is today Uganda, and started to migrate from there to their present location in the 16th century. They were fierce warriors, conquering the people whose territory they entered and imposing many of their customs. By the mid-1800s the Lega were surrounded by Arab / Swahili slave posts. Although none of these posts was within the Lega territory, they were constantly threatened by slave raids. For most of the period of the Congo Free State, the Lega territory was within the area that Tippu Tip and his successors had reserved. For a period two Arab agents of the Free State, Munie Chabodu and Munie Mtoro, ruled the Lega and collected tribute in the form of rubber and ivory. They established towns at Micici on the Elila, Shabunda on the Ulindi and Mulungu in the mountains. During the 1890s the Belgians fought a series of campaigns in which they drove away the Arab slavers, and established government posts near Micici and Shabunda. They did not fully occupy the territory until the 1900s. They organized the Lega into chiefdoms, sectors and territories, changes that were neither resisted nor welcomed by the Lega. Catholic missionaries arrived in the 1910s and the first Protestant mission was founded in 1922 in Shabunda. Mining began in eastern Legaland in 1923, with further mines opened in the 1930s, employing many young Lega. Often they took a job only for a short period to earn enough money for some purpose such as Bwami initiation or marriage. In 1933 the Belgian authorities banned Bwami, and they prohibited the society again in 1948. The Bwami continued underground and was officially recognized again in 1958, but by then much of the tradition of art production had been lost. Zaire became independent in 1960. The regime of Mobutu Sese Seko was harsh and corrupt, and Mobutu was eventually ousted in the First Congo War (1996-1997). This was soon followed by the Second Congo War (1998-2003) in which rebels attempted to throw out his successor, Laurent-Désiré Kabila. The Lega territory was the scene of many violent conflicts during this period. Economy Crowd at Shabundu, May 2007, after the visit of the Japanese ambassador The Lega traditionally lived by hunting and gathering, exploiting the rich resources of the forest. When possible, they roast their food. The women are in charge of cooking. If it is not raining they will cook outside on a hearth formed from slow-burning logs that support a pot over the fire. In poor weather they cook in kitchens within the long houses. The men eat as a group in the men's house, and the women eat with the young children in or outside the kitchen. The Lega villagers were forced by the colonial administration to produce manioc, bananas, and rice to feed the miners, causing considerable disruption to their lifestyle. In more recent years the Lega have taken to panning for gold in the rivers and working in the iron ore mines of the region. Art Bwami masks and figures are symbols of the owner's rank within the Bwami society. The objects represent moral or social values, and are used during initiation rites. The Bwami works of art are often associated with proverbs, and these proverbs in conjunction with dance, poetry and song give wisdom to members of the society. Beauty, knowledge and power are intertwined. Some artwork can only be seen, handled or owned by the highest grades of the society. The objects are typically small and simple in form, and have a striking patina that derives from being handled or worn on the body. Ivory objects usually have russet or yellow patinas. The masks are fairly standardized, although the most important masks with special ritual use or symbolic meaning may have distinctive design. A typical mask will have a concave heart-shaped face. The forehead protrudes slightly, the nose is narrow, eyes are slits and the mouth is slightly open. Every time a mask is used it is rubbed with white clay, over time acquiring a white patina.

The novel tells the story of a physics professor in 1980 who begins to doubt that he is a human being. He imagines that he may have been sent from another world to rescue Earth; or perhaps to destroy it. Solving the mystery takes him far into the future. Synopsis Professor Gordon Naismith is an average man in most respects, except that he has exceptional reflexes, and he has no memory of his life prior to four years ago, when he believes he was involved in a plane crash. During one of his classes a student asks a disturbing question: “What is a zug?” The question triggers a series of violent incidents, and Naismith is framed for a murder. He learns that the student is not human, but rather an \\"Ugly\\", and that he himself is a \\"Shefth\\", a member of the warrior class from Earth's far future. In that future, a Time Barrier was constructed to keep violent aliens called Zugs in the past. The future humans supposedly want a Shefth to go kill a Zug which survived the Time Barrier. The Uglies take Naismith to the future, where Naismith learns that most humans died during a plague. The Uglies catch Naismith; he escapes onto a half-finished time machine which doesn’t go through time but oscillates through the core of the Earth before popping out the other side. Naismith is rescued by a girl who takes him to the point in time when the Time Barrier is erected; here he is expected to kill the surviving Zug. Significance The novel has been interpreted as Knight's attempt to mimic the style of A. E. Van Vogt (or to \\"out-Van Vogt Van Vogt\\", in the words of Rich Horton). This would be ironic, given Knight's famous and devastating critique of Van Vogt's work in In Search of Wonder. Robert Smithson has argued that Beyond the Barrier is an example of science fiction in which architectural examples are presented that have nothing to do with science or fiction, but instead suggest \\"a new kind of monumentality which has much in common with the aims of some of today's artists.\\" > This kind of nullification has re-created Kasimir Malevich's \\"non-objective > world,\\" where there are no more \\"likenesses of reality, no idealistic > images, nothing but a desert!\\" But for many of today's artists this \\"desert\\" > is a \\"City of the Future\\" made of null structures and surfaces. ... In Damon > Knight's Sci-fi novel, \\"Beyond the Barrier,\\" he describes in a > phenomenological manner just such surface-structures: \\"Part of the scene > before them seemed to expand. Where one of the flotation machines had been > there was a dim lattice of crystals, growing more shadowy and insubstational > as it swelled; then darkness; then a dazzle of faint prismatic light-tiny > complexes in a vast three-dimensional array, growing steadily bigger.\\" This > description has none of the \\"values\\" of the naturalistic \\"literary\\" novel, > it is crystalline, and of the mind of virtue of being outside of unconscious > action. This very well could be an inchoate concept for a work by Judd, > LeWitt, Flavin, or Insley. The novel is cited for containing a scene of \\"circular causality\\", in which a couple depart to seek a time traveler stranded in the past a moment after seeing themselves return safely with him. The novel is also notable for containing one of the few serious depictions in literature of a protagonist falling all the way through the Earth. Publication history The novel is an expanded version of \\"The Tree of Time\\", which was published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in two installments in December 1963 and January 1964. After its first hardcover publication by Doubleday in 1964, it has been reprinted several times in hard- and soft-cover editions, by Gollancz (1964), Macfadden (1965, 1970), and Hamlyn (1978).

Crowd membership is externally imposed and not a direct consequence of interaction with other members of the crowd. For adolescent friendships and social interaction in small groups, see cliques. Definition Crowds are large groups of adolescents socially connected by a shared image and reputation, especially within the setting of a single school. It is possible for a single person to belong to more than one crowd if their image matches the crowds’ criteria.Mory, M. (1994, February). \\"When people form or perceive sets, they tend to be fuzzy: The case of adolescent crowds.\\" Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego. Because membership in a crowd depends on peers' perceptions, crowds in any given peer group will correspond to the local preconceived \\"types\\" of adolescents. Specific stereotypes vary from place to place, but many remain consistent, based on peer status, socioeconomic status, residential area, activities, social characteristics, or a combination of attributes (jocks, nerds, populars, and druggies are among the most commonly observed).Arnett, J.

Crowds are very different from cliques: while cliques are relatively small, close-knit groups based on frequent interaction and collectively determined membership, members of a crowd may not even know each other. Crowd membership reflects external assessments and expectations, providing a social context for identity exploration and self-definition as adolescents internalize or reject their crowd identities. Because crowd membership is initially outwardly imposed, it is possible for an adolescent's peers to classify them as belonging to a crowd they may not consider themselves part of.Brown, B., Freeman, H., Huang, B., & Mounts, N. (1992, March). \\"'Crowd hopping': Incidence, correlates and consequences of change in crowd affiliation during adolescence.\\" Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, Washington, DC. Members of some crowds are more aware of and comfortable with their crowd designation than others; members of stigmatized or low-status groups, in particular, may resist or deny their undesirable categorization. Usually, however, adolescents embrace their crowd affiliation, using it to define themselves and advertise where they fit in their peer group's social structure.Newman, B., & Newman, P. (2001). \\"Group identity and alienation: Giving the we its due.\\" Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 30, 515–538.Brown, B.B., Lohr, M. J., & Trujillo, C. M.

New York: Random House. Crowds and identity development Crowds serve an essential purpose in adolescent identity development, shaping individual values, behavior, and personal and peer expectations. \\"[One's group] is often tantamount to one's own provisional identity;\\" the individual defines herself by the crowd she sees herself fitting into. Different crowds expose the individual to different norms. These norms encourage adolescents to interact with some people while avoiding others and reward certain behaviors while discouraging others, a process of normative social influence.Brown, B., Mory, M., & Kinney, D. (1994). \\"Casting crowds in a relational perspective: Caricature, channel, and context.\\" In R. Montemayor, G. Adams, & T. Gullotta (eds.), Advances in Adolescent Development: Vol. 5.

Steinberg (Eds.), Handbook of Adolescent Psychology (3rd ed., Vol. 2, pp. 74–103). New York: Wiley. For example, a member of a \\"preppy\\" crowd might be rewarded for dressing in a fashion for which a member of an \\"emo\\" crowd would be teased, and vice versa. Crowd effects on norms of interaction: * Norms affect how the individual interacts with others. Members of high-status (preppie, popular) groups often interact with many people, but most of these relationships are superficial and instrumental; interpersonal connections are used to establish and maintain social status.Eder, D. (1985). \\"The cycle of popularity: Interpersonal relations among female adolescents.\\" Sociology of Education, 58, 154–165.Lesko, N. (1988). Symbolizing Society: Stories, Rites, and Structures in a Catholic High School. Philadelphia: Falmer. By contrast, members of lower-caste groups (e.g., dorks, druggies) generally have fewer friends, mostly from within the crowd; however, these relationships are typically marked by greater loyalty, stability, and honesty. * Norms affect who the individual interacts with. Crowds steer the individual toward certain people, attitudes, and behaviors. There are also effects of peer perception and expectations when individuals attempt to interact across crowds: one may be interested in a cross-crowd friendship, but whether or not the target reciprocates depends on their crowd's norms as well. The adolescent's social options for friendship and romance are limited by her own crowd and by other crowds. Often crowds reinforce the behaviors that originally caused an individual to be labeled part of that crowd, which can positively or negatively influence the individual (toward academic achievement or drug use, for example). These pressures are often linked to the stereotypes members of crowds hold about themselves and members of other crowds: unity by denigration of the outgroup (see social identity theory). Racial crowds and sub-crowds Adolescents' perception of crowd differences may depend on how closely related the adolescent observer is to a particular crowd. The basic, recurring crowd divisions (jocks, geeks, partiers) have been most often studied in predominantly white high schools, but they also exist for minority students.Brown, B., & Mounts, N. (1989, April). \\"Peer group structures in single versus multiethnic high schools.\\" Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research in Child Development, Kansas City. In multiracial schools, students seem to divide along ethnic lines first, then into these archetypical crowds within their own ethnicity. However, one ethnic group may not notice the further divisions in other ethnic groups after the first, race-based split. For instance, black students see themselves as divided into jocks, geeks, emos, stoners, popular kids, and so on, but white students may see them as just one crowd defined solely by ethnicity, \\"the black kids.\\" Sometimes crowd membership transcends race, however, and adolescents are classified as \\"jocks\\" or \\"geeks\\" regardless of race.Horvat, E. M., & Lewis, K. S. (2003). \\"Reassessing the 'burden of 'acting White': The importance of peer group in managing academic success.\\" Sociology of Education, 76, 265–280.Tyson, D., Darity, W., & Castellino, D. R. (2005). \\"It's not 'a Black thing.' Understanding the burden of acting White and other dilemmas of high achievement.\\" American Sociological Review, 70, 582–605. This seems to vary and depend heavily on the context of the individual school. Stereotypes, stigma, and cross-crowd friendships While crowds are structured around prototypical caricatures of their members, real adolescents rarely match these extremes. Furthermore, not all adolescents agree on the characteristics typical of a stereotype. In other words, regular manifestation of just a few central characteristics of a crowd is a sufficient basis for classification as a member of that crowd. Thus, not all \\"jocks\\" neglect their schoolwork, though that is part of the typical jock stereotype, and a person interested in fashion could still be considered a \\"geek.\\" Often a crowd is stigmatized by one or more other crowds. This can affect adolescents' willingness to associate with members of that crowd, or even other crowds similar to it. For example, people may avoid being seen as a \\"brain,\\" a middle-status crowd, because of the similarity between brains and \\"nerds,\\" a lower-status crowd. Shared interests form the basis of many friendships, so often adolescents are drawn to members of their own crowds, especially if their crowd is defined by activities rather than more superficial characteristics such as race or socioeconomic status. However, interests can be shared across crowd divisions. Accordingly, while an adolescent's closest friends are almost always part of the same clique (i.e., they interact frequently within the same small friend group), they are not always part of the same crowd, especially if multiple crowds have similar lifestyles.Urberg, K., Degirmencioglu, S., Tolson, J., & Halliday-Scher, K. (1995). \\"The structure of adolescent peer networks.\\" Developmental Psychology, 31, 540–547. Crowd-hopping Further emphasizing the flexible nature of crowd membership, some adolescents are not stably linked to one specific crowd—some individuals are associated with multiple crowds, while others are not stably linked to any crowds and \\"float\\" among several. These appear more closely attached to individuals outside the peer group (family, dropout friends, friends from a non-school organization, etc.). Others may consciously work to change crowd affiliations to express different interests or achieve a change in social status. The crowd with which an adolescent desires to be identified is far less stable than the personal attributes by which the adolescent is likely to be categorized by peers. Accordingly, adolescents who change crowd membership (a process known as \\"crowd-hopping\\") tend to have lower self-esteem, perhaps because they have not yet found an environment and peer group that supports them. It is likely that they continue changing crowd membership until they find a fulfilling niche. The rise of crowds Crowds first emerge in middle or junior high school, when children transition from stable, self-contained classroom peer groups into larger schools, where they interact with a more varied body of peers with less adult guidance. Crowds emerge to group students by caricature and structure interactions between students of each type. Early crowds are often based on social status, especially among girls, with a small group of well-known children being \\"popular\\" and the rest \\"unpopular.\\" To maintain their own status, popular girls will avoid the overtures of less- popular children, which actually makes them disliked. Many children stop attempting to gain entry into the popular crowd and make friends with other children instead, giving rise to new crowds. The stereotypes on which crowd definitions are based change over time as adolescents shift from grouping people by abstract characteristics rather than activities (\\"geeks\\" rather than \\"the kids who read a lot\\"). With age, adolescents become more conscious of crowd divisions and the social hierarchy. Distinctions between crowds also become more nuanced, developing from simple popular/unpopular dichotomies to less hierarchical structures in which there are more than two levels of social acceptability, often with several crowds at each level.Kinney, D. (1993). \\"From nerds to normals: The recovery of identity among adolescents from middle school to high school.\\" Sociology of Education, 66, 21–40. As seen in cross- crowd friendships, some crowds interact with each other more readily than others. This transition to a more fluid social structure allows adolescents to change their status over time by changing crowds, remaining in a crowd that undergoes a change in status, or gaining the confidence and perspective to reject the assumptions of the social hierarchy. Willingness to do so reflects a growing sense of personal identity distinct from crowd membership. The decline of crowds Adolescents’ attitudes toward crowds change over time—while ninth-graders are willing to discriminate against members of other crowds, twelfth-graders are less likely to do so.Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents’ reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ‘’Developmental Psychology, 39’’ 363-371. Adolescents also develop more multifaceted self- concepts and reject crowd labels as simplistic attempts to describe an entire personality. Across the high school years, crowd significance as a basis for affiliation wanes, as does the influence of crowds on an individual's behavior. In fact, some studiesBrown, B. B., Eicher, S. A., & Petrie, S. D. (1986). The importance of peer group (\\"crowd\\") affiliation in adolescence. ‘’Journal of Adolescence, 9,’’ 73-96. indicate that the importance of crowds peaks at age 12 or 13. By the end of high school, adolescents often feel constrained by impersonal, crowd-derived identities.Larkin, R. W. (1979). ‘’Suburban youth in cultural crisis.’’ New York: Oxford. This, combined with the splintering off of romantic couples from the rest of the crowd,Kuttler, A. F., & La Greca, A. M. (2004). Linkages among adolescent girls’ romantic relationships, best friendships, and peer networks. ‘’Journal of Adolescence, 27,’’ 395-414. may account for the decline of crowd significance over time.

Given its proximity to the neighborhood of Vila Olimpia, the neighborhood essentially has the same history, because both were created and developed at the same time. It lies in the floodplain of the Rio Pinheiros, which historically inundated the region. In 1941, the Paulista Equestrian Society, an important sporting institution in the country, was established. Years later, the area became residential houses and townhouses for middle-class families. From 1980 onwards, the area went through a process of gentrification by the city council and state government.

It is the band's first release with singer Wade MacNeil, formerly of Alexisonfire, who replaced original Gallows singer Frank Carter when the latter left the band in July 2011. The EP was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Joby J. Ford of The Bronx. It includes a re-recording of the track \\"True Colours\\", previously released as a free download in August 2011. Background Frank Carter the original vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 that he would be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to go in a more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false. From the moment Wade's arrived in Britain in July Gallows started writing new material to follow up to their 2009 album Grey Britain. The ep itself was both written and recorded in a short period of time. A majority of the music featured on the extended play was written by the band before Wade had joined and that they put the finishing touches on the record with him. Lee Barratt summarises the ep as a \\"good release of anger\\" and that all the band felt \\"particularly venomous when Wade joined\\". Just a few months later in November the band made the announcement that the new extended play would be released in early December. After the band's infamous split from Warner Bros the band decided to work on an independent record label for the release, Thirty Days of Night whom they considered as \\"Gallows family\\". Themes The EP has been seen by critics simply as \\"unapologetic hardcore punk\\" and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being \\"Four songs like a kick in the teeth\\". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that \\"sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge.\\" Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying \\"If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really.\\" Music critics have described True Colours upon its release as a single as \\"the most brutal thing Gallows has done.\\" Andrew Ford of Hit The Floor Magazine considered it a \\"36 second middle finger to all those who have suggested this is the end of the road for the Watford lads.\\" Something which both critics and Wade MacNeil himself have acknowledged is his distinct tone of voice from Frank Carter even to the point in which their fan base could be divided over the decision to have Wade in the band. Wade wanted the EP and the future lyrics of Gallows records to have a much more global view. Believing that the band's second studio album Grey Britain had too much of a British perspective. Release and promotion Wade MacNeil, formerly of Alexisonfire, replaced Frank Carter as Gallows' lead singer in 2011. The band released the first song from the EP, True Colours for free download on 29 August 2011 from their band website. They then released Mondo Chaos as a digital single on 25 November. Just a few days before that on 17 November the song was leaked. Gallows completed their first tour after the release of True Colours with MacNeil as front man in the United States and Canada in November alongside Four Year Strong, Title Fight and The Swellers and Sharks. The band incorporated songs from the first two albums live set-lists. MacNeil said that he aimed to alter the songs in a way that \\"breathes some life into them\\" but also wanted to keep what \\"people love about those songs and what I love about those songs.\\" 6131 Records released the ep in North America on vinyl record. Reception Death Is Birth received positive reception from music critics. British publication Kerrang! gave the album a \\"Excellent\\" four out of five \\"K\\"s describing the EP as \\"The snarling rebirth of the UKs best punk band.\\" Vincent Danger when writing for Thrash Hits gave the album a 5 out of 6 stars giving the album a positive review praising their choice of front man to replace Carter. \\"there’s only so much one can say about 459 seconds of music. There’s enough here to prove that Lags Barnard’s songwriting skills aren’t on the wane and that Wade MacNeil is a more than able replacement for Carter.\\" Alternative Press writer Jason Pettigrew appreciated the album's short but violent writing in his 4 out of 5 star review; saying \\"the EP is steeped in impenetrable, relentless nihilism and thrashing madness that’s one part noise weapon (“True Colours”), one part circle-pit centrifuge (“Hate Hate Hate”) and two parts hateful hardcore (“Mondo Chaos” and the title track).\\" Dan Issitt, a writer for Alter The Press! gave the album a score of 4/5 in an otherwise positive review did see fault in the change of front man. \\"Some fans will undoubtedly find it hard to get past the fact that he isn’t Frank Carter, but a little scratch at the surface will reveal the same aggression and similar bile-filled lyrics you’d expect from one of Britain’s most hateful bands.\\" Track listing Personnel * Wade MacNeil – lead vocals * Laurent \\"Lags\\" Barnard – guitar, backing vocals * Steph Carter – guitar, backing vocals * Stuart Gili-Ross – bass guitar, backing vocals * Lee Barratt – drums, percussion References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography 2011 EPs Gallows (band) albums ","title":"Death Is Birth"},{"id":"34111864","text":"Christopher John Gardner (born March 30, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Houston Astros in 1991.

As bishop's chancellor in Ely, Cambridgeshire, he was charged with suppressing Christian heresy, condemning several heretics to be burnt at the stake. Biography Fuller was a native of Gloucester. He was educated at All Souls College, Oxford, where he was admitted to the Bachelor of Canon Law degree in July 1533, and became a fellow in 1536. He graduated Doctor of Canon Law in January 1546, and in the same year admitted himself a member of Doctors' Commons. In 1547 he served as rector of Hanwell, Middlesex, but resigned the charge in 1551, having in 1550 been appointed vicar-general or chancellor to Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Norwich. At about the same time he became vicar of Swaffham, and rector of East Dereham and North Creake in Norfolk. Marian Persecutions Upon Thirlby's translation to the diocese of Ely, Fuller went with him as chancellor. On 24 September 1554 Fuller was installed Thirlby's proxy in Ely Cathedral. The following November he was collated prebendary of the fifth stall. As chancellor he was also examiner of heretics, and condemned several. His judgement seldom inclined to leniency, although some of his fellow examiners condemned more than he did. For example, during the period that became known as the Marian Persecutions, two men from Wisbech, constable William Wolsey and painter Robert Pygot, were condemned by Fuller at Ely on 9 October 1555. On 16 October they were burnt at the stake, \\"probably on the Palace Green in front of Ely Cathedral\\". He was proctor for the clergy of the diocese in two convocations, and held other preferments, being rector of Wilbraham, Fen Ditton, and Hildersham, Cambridgeshire. He resided in Queens' College, Cambridge; when in London, he had rooms in Paternoster Row. He was appointed master of Jesus College, Cambridge on 23 February 1557 succeeding Pierpoint. The following May, he was elected to the prebend of Chamberlainwood in St Paul's, London. Bequests He died on 30 July 1558 and was succeeded as master by Thomas Redman. Fuller was buried, according to his directions, in the choir of Jesus College, to which institution he bequeathed one-third of his property, besides founding four fellowships. One-third he left to the poor of certain parishes, and the remainder to his cousins William and Margaret. His specific legacies included £13 6s. 8d. to All Souls' College, Oxford, and two of his best geldings to the Bishop of Ely.

After Robert Sheehan, who played Nathan Young, announced his departure, it was announced a new character called Rudy would join the show as a replacement. Casting for Rudy was announced soon after, with Gilgun cast in the role. Rudy was created as the \\"new funny man\\" of the show, a role previously held by Nathan. Rudy first appears in an online special titled \\"Vegas Baby!\\" Rudy has the ability to split into multiple personalities. While two of these personalities are originally introduced, it is later revealed that there is a third Rudy who was imprisoned prior to Rudy's introduction in the series. Casting and creation On 10 April 2011 it was confirmed that Robert Sheehan who portrays Nathan Young would not be returning to the show. To replace Nathan, it was announced a new character called Rudy would be joining the show, with casting still ongoing. It was announced that Rudy's arrival would air in an online special. On May 9, 2011 it was announced Joe Gilgun had been cast as Rudy. Gilgun said he finds Rudy \\"great\\" to play. Misfits creator Howard Overman said he created Rudy as a \\"new funny man\\" to replace Sheehan, whose character Nathan previously held the role. On Rudy as a source of humour Overman added it isn't as \\"crazy\\" as Nathan's humour. Overman said he wanted to make Rudy different from Nathan and did this by making Rudy \\"more emotional\\". Producer Petra Fried said Rudy was \\"another classic Overman creation\\". In March 2012 Gilgun confirmed he would return for Misfit's fourth series. Characterisation Joseph Gilgun (pictured) has said that Rudy is a \\"happy go lucky guy\\" who is \\"a bit of a sociopath\\". Gilgun commented on Rudy saying he was a \\"happy go lucky guy\\" and said he was a \\"rough diamond\\". Gilgun added that Rudy was \\"happy all the time\\" although he felt like Rudy was \\"a bit of a sociopath\\" because he \\"doesn't question things he says or does\\" and doesn't care what people think about him. Gilgun added that Rudy is \\"not a bad person\\" and is \\"quite endearing\\". He added that Rudy \\"doesn't question anything\\", has \\"no set motive\\" and \\"lives for the moment\\". Gilgun also added that Rudy is \\"consistently wrong\\". Gilgun added that Rudy is \\"a total plonker who gets into multiple scrapes wherever he goes - and with whoever he meets\\". MSN News described Rudy as \\"foul mouthed\\" adding he \\"seems to be a man with no interior monologue - he just says it all out loud\\". On the two sides of Rudy's personality they stated: \\"Rudy's split personality manifests itself in the power to split into two versions of himself - one endlessly confident and cheery, the other depressed and consumed with self-pity, melancholy and, watch out Simon, unrequited love for Alisha\\". Storylines Rudy lost his virginity to Alisha Daniels (Antonia Thomas) while at a party. The next day at college, she ignored him and he later attempted suicide. Some time later Rudy was caught in the storm which gave him the power to split into three Rudys with three personalities. Rudy was given community service when he had a heated argument with his ex-girlfriend and while upset, vandalised her car. Rudy flirts with Charlie (Nathalie Emmanuel) at a pub after doing his community service. Other Rudy, who is waiting outside after splitting out of Rudy, speaks to Tanya (Katie Moore) who admits her initial judgement of Rudy was wrong and he is more sensitive to others than she thought. After Tanya goes back inside the pub, she witnesses Rudy kissing Charlie. Tanya, who has the power to freeze those around her, freezes those in the pub and hits Rudy with a glass bottle before blaming Curtis Donovan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett). The next day, she freezes Rudy and pushes him down some stairs. This is witnessed by Kelly Bailey (Lauren Socha), Simon Bellamy (Iwan Rheon) and Curtis. They tell Rudy that Tanya is to blame, who freezes the group and blames them for breaking a police car window. Rudy realises the group also have powers and admits he does too. Rudy goes to Simon's flat with the group where he sees Alisha before leaving hurriedly. Rudy sets up Tanya for stealing the charity box from the community centre but after she is arrested, she escapes the police car. Rudy and Alisha meet at the pub and when Rudy splits into two other Rudy tells Alisha of Rudy's suicide attempt. Rudy and other Rudy decide to remain split off from each other. When Rudy and Charlie are together in the community centre, Tanya freezes them, stabbing Charlie and placing the blade in Rudy's hand. Rudy cradles Charlie as she dies and when Alisha comes to the community centre to speak to Rudy, Tanya freezes them putting them both in nooses while balancing on chairs, so if they fall they will hang to death. Rudy kicks Tanya who falls over Charlie's body and cracks her head open on the floor, killing her. The chair Rudy was balanced on falls and he begins to hang. Alisha tries to save him, telling him to wrap his legs around her. Alisha apologises to Rudy for her actions, admitting that she remembered Rudy and at the time did not care who she hurt. Rudy accepts her apology and lets go. Other Rudy returns before saving Rudy's life and the pair decide to no longer remain split. Rudy and the group bury the bodies before Rudy drives the group home in a stolen car, leading to them getting community service. Rudy gives Curtis in his female form, who goes by the name of Melissa (Kehinde Fadipe), oral sex although he is unaware she has been given the date rape drug. When Curtis returns to his male form, he is angry with Rudy. An alternate timeline is created when a man travels to the past to try to kill Hitler, although he accidentally gives the Nazis an advantage and they win the war. In the present day, Rudy along with Curtis and Kelly are trying to prevent the Nazis using Seth (Matthew McNulty) to steal their powers to gain more force. They help Seth escape from the Nazis and Seth gives the power of time travel to Kelly who travels back in time and stops the Nazis winning the war. Rudy meets Leah (Amy Manson) in a bar and after flirting with her, she agrees to sleep with him. She tells him she doesn't want it to be a one-night stand and wants him there when she wakes up. He leaves before she wakes angering her. Simon, who has the power of seeing the future, sees Rudy's penis fall off. Rudy realises he has contracted a form of STD caused by someone with a power which is causing his penis to erode. He tracks down Leah with the help of Simon and publicly apologises to any girl that he has used for sex in the past. Leah recognises that he feels regret and fixes his penis. Michael (Nathaniel Martello-White) arrives at the community service and Rudy, Curtis and Seth are infected with his power of an infectious greed which makes those around him desperate to get his briefcase full of money. The briefcase is handcuffed to Michael, so Rudy saws Michael's hand off to get the case. The case is later stolen. Rudy and Seth lock Curtis in the freezer to try to get him out of the way. Jess (Karla Crome) and Finn (Nathan McMullen) join community service. They rescue Curtis from the freezer, only to be locked in the freezer themselves by Rudy. Michael is locked in with them and infects them. Finn and Jess are released by Rudy's other self who tells them where the briefcase is. Finn steals it for himself. On the community centre roof, Finn is confronted by the group only for Michael to fall to his death, breaking his power over the group. Rudy's third self, who had been imprisoned after badly beating somebody up, is released from prison. He begins to stalk Jess and he pulls the two other Rudys in to his body. He plans to murder Jess but she stabs him with a pair of scissors. While dying, he asks Jess to kiss him and get over her intimacy issues and in return, he will release the two other Rudys from his body. He releases the other two Rudys and then dies. Rudy later finds out that his friend Curtis, who subsequently is also the final member of the original ASBO Five, has become a zombie and therefore decides that he must kill him. But after many failed attempts, he finally calls Curtis to ask what they are going to do. However, it seemed Curtis had already made up his mind and despite Rudy's pleas to hold it off for a few days, he kills himself.Misfits Series 4 episode 4 Rudy is then given counseling for Curtis' apparent suicide. At a party a few days later, Rudy meets Nadine, a girl who keeps running off after twelve. After finding out he is deeply in love with her, Rudy follows her and finds out she is in fact a Nun. He then visits the monastery to admit himself, only to be turned away by her fellow sisters. However, Nadine continues to see Rudy much against their wishes, so they kidnap her and keep her in containment. Rudy gathers Jess and Finn to help break her out, as they use their powers to gain access to their room. After saving her, however, it becomes apparent why the Nuns left her imprisoned as her power is unleashed after she witnessed several sinful and disturbing acts committed by the new Misfits including violence and casual sex. Her power releases the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as they attempt to slay everyone present, effectively injuring Alex, Jess's lover. Nadine sacrifices herself after Rudy and Finn confirm they'd willingly die to protect her and the Four Horsemen disappear. Rudy holds a funeral for her and buries her alongside the other bodies in the woods.Misfits Series 4 Episode 8 Reception After Rudy's first scene in Vegas Baby! entertainment site Digital Spy said they were \\"really quite excited about seeing what Joe brings to the show\\". MSN News felt Rudy was a \\"perfect replacement for gobby, irritating Nathan in the group dynamic\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent commented saying Rudy is \\"every bit as immature and funny as Nathan\\". She felt that Rudy \\"fulfills the role of the childish, sex-obsessed member of the group and has an endless stream of filth which he shares with the others much to their chagrin and disgust\\". Debnath added that Rudy is not just a \\"cheeky chap\\" replacing another but with his power he can be the \\"super-cocky bad boy\\" Rudy and the \\"timid, insecure Rudy who tried to kill himself after Alisha rejected him when they were at college\\". Debnath felt that \\"there is more to him than meets the eye and this promises to make him an interesting character\\". Rudy being an acquaintance of Alisha meant that Rudy was \\"neatly brought into the fold. He fits in well with the others and is not a complete outsider, making him less of a replacement and more an addition to the ‘Misfits’ family\\". The Guardian commented that Rudy has \\"provided some brilliant Misfits moments\\". They added that Rudy's superpower \\"is the ability to split into two sides of himself – and instead of staying with the traditional atte \\"trying to make sure that both of them aren't seen at the same time by the public\\" narrative, both sides of Rudy are played as completely different characters. On the one hand, we have a boisterous and 'have it' player; on the other hand a shy and caring man moping around the community centre. The result has been some inspired banter between Rudy's selves, including one time when he was forced into counselling\\". After the departures of three cast members, Debnath said Rudy was still there to \\"keep things interesting\\". She said that \\"comedy scenes involving Rudy are on form, possibly because Overman knows this character a lot better than his new creations\\" but she felt that a scene in which Rudy cut off a man's hand was \\"gratuitously violent\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". Simon Cocks, writing for MSN, said Rudy was the highlight of series four episode one as Gilgun is \\"on terrific form as Rudy, with numerous memorable lines in this episode. His delight at his own acting ability is particularly great\\". Cocks went on to add that Rudy is \\"incredibly funny\\" and that \\"All of his moments in this premiere were superb. He was a real success last year, although some fans persisted in comparing him unfavourably to the recently departed Nathan. Absolutely unfair, but inevitable\\". Debnath felt that a storyline involving Rudy flirting with Alley was \\"the more amusing thread in this episode\\". She explained that Rudy was \\"brilliant\\" throughout the episode and that Gilgun \\"is excellent at playing the two Rudys, he is the strongest member of the cast and is carrying the show at the moment\\". SFX journalist Jordan Farley felt that during the second episode of series four Rudy is not \\"on the best form (though he has his moments, of course)\\" but that he is \\"on hand for a bit of split personality fun\\". Claire Crick of Radio Times said it is still Gilgun as Rudy \\"who gets the lewdest, crudest gags and all the best lines\\". Crick felt that when Gilgun is \\"on screen it’s difficult to take your eyes off him – so mesmerising is he as split-personality superhero Rudy. Tonight there’s three of him cussing and wise-cracking: his evil alter ego has come back to terrorise the other two (only slightly evil) Rudys. Even by the show’s demented standards it’s beyond belief and yet Gilgun manages to make it completely convincing\\". The Metros Keith Watson felt that Gilgun \\"acts up a storm as, not content with splitting his personality in two, he now has a third alter ego to contend with – and the latest one is the most demented of the wackjob bunch. It’s a masterclass of comic acting that deserves a Bafta\\".

Playing career A central defender like his father, Brendan Place Sr., himself a colourful leading player on the League of Ireland scene, Brendan Jr. began his football career with the Dublin youth club Home Farm. In 1983, he graduated to their senior team, then playing at the top level of domestic football in Ireland. He made his debut against Derry City at the Brandywell, in Derry's first game in the League of Ireland. After catching the eye of cross channel scouts with his subsequent displays for Longford Town and Athlone Town, Place was signed by Damien Richardson for Gillingham on 21 October 1989. He made his debut two days later against Chesterfield, but a promising career with the English third division club was cut short when he incurred a serious neck injury, which kept out of the game for six years. He eventually recovered to full fitness and returned to his roots to play for Home Farm, playing at the time as Home Farm Everton. In his first season back he was awarded the club's Player of the Season. In the 2000s, after spells with Bohemians, Shelbourne, Home Farm Fingal and as player manager for Malahide United, he brought his playing career to an end. Place then returned to the top tier of Irish domestic football at 37 years of age with Monaghan United. Managing career As a coach, he has a comprehensive background, starting as development coach with the LOI/ FAI Soccer Academy in Dublin between 1999 and 2002. As a part of that time he coached the Republic of Ireland U17 that finished third in Japan in August 2004 and went on to work with the Republic of Ireland U19 that qualified for the elite Stage of the UEFA championship in Cyprus later that year. He also spent three years as high performance coach with the Elite Irish women's squad and had a spell as player-coach with Bohemians reserve squad. Having brought non-League Malahide United to promotion as player manager, Place was then appointed development youth coach for Home Farm Schoolboys before becoming player coach at Loughshinny Utd in 2005, bringing his team to the final of the Gilligan Cup. In 2008, he took over as manager at Athlone Town. One of his first signings was his brother Stephen. Place left in 2010 to concentrate on completing his UEFA pro licence. He already held a UEFA A licence and completed a sports psychology diploma. Place coached Crumlin United schoolboys and after a successful treble winning season at U16 level returned to Home Farm as head coach of U17s team for the 2012–13 season.. In 2013, Place was appointed head coach for Bohemians FC under 19s Eircom League. A return to Eircom league followed for Place in 2015-16, with Tommy Dunne and newly promoted Galway United as opposition / match analysis scout. In July 2016 Place was appointed U19s head coach at Hibernians FC .

This model, first proposed by Urie Bronfenbrenner and Stephen J. Ceci, in 1994, is an extension of Bronfenbrenner's original theoretical model of human development, called ecological systems theory. Bronfenbrenner developed the bioecological model after recognizing that the individual was overlooked in other theories of human development, which were largely focused on the context of development (e.g., the environment). The bioecological model of human development can be applied to both children and maturing adults, and is thus a lifespan approach to development. The framework emphasizes the importance of understanding bidirectional influences between individuals’ development and their surrounding environmental contexts. In the bioecological model, in contrast to his earlier models, Bronfenbrenner also includes time (known as the chronosystem in his model) as an important component in the way that people and environments change. The bioecological model proposed a new method of conducting research which was heavily influential in developmental psychology and is still considered relevant today.  The original model  Bronfenbrenner named his original model \\"ecological systems theory\\". Through this framework, Bronfenbrenner identified the need to understand individuals' development within their environments. In order to conceptualize environmental contexts, Bronfenbrenner described five ecological systems: # Microsystem: The microsystem is the innermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This context is closest to an individual and encompasses interpersonal relationships and direct interactions with immediate surroundings.Berk, L.E. (2000). Child Development (5th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, 23–28. https://openlibrary.org/books/OL35893M/Child_development For example, family members and a child's school are considered part of the microsystem. # Mesosystem: The mesosystem includes interactions between various aspects of the microsystem. A relationship between a child's family and the child's school can be considered part of the mesosystem, because these two direct influences (parts of the microsystem) may interact. # Exosystem: The exosystem does not directly affect individuals; rather, the exosystem encompasses aspects of structures within the microsystem. For example, financial difficulties within the family of origin, parental job loss, and so forth may affect a child, but do not involve the child directly. # Macrosystem: The macrosystem is the outermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This system includes social or cultural ideologies and beliefs that affect an individual's environment. For example, laws may be incorporated into the macrosystem. # Chronosystem: Bronfenbrenner suggested that individuals constantly interact with these systems. He also stated that both individuals and their environments constantly affect one another. However, in this original model, Bronfenbrenner recognized there was not enough focus on individuals’ own role in their development, and thus began further developing this model.  Evolution of Bronfenbrenner's theory  Bronfenbrenner informally discussed new ideas concerning Ecological Systems Theory throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s during lectures and presentations to the psychological community. As he examined his original theory, he began to identify the role of other key factors in development. In 1986, Bronfenbrenner published his new theory and named it Bioecological Systems Theory. One of Bronfenbrenner's main influences was Lev Vygotsky, a Russian teacher and psychologist. Vygotsky created the social learning theory of development in the 1920s and 1930s to understand how people learn in social contexts and how social environments influence the learning process (1962). Vygotsky recognized that learning always occurs and cannot be separated from a social context and that this process is integral to a child's development.Neff, L. S. (n.d.). Lev Vygotsky and social learning theories. Kurt Lewin, a German forerunner of ecological systems models and the founder of modern social psychology,Greathouse, J. (1997, May). Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Psychology History website: http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/lewin.htm pioneered the use of theory and experimentation to test hypotheses. He focused on the life space, which he defined as a person's psychological activities that occur within a kind of psychological field.Kneessi, D. F. (2002). Bioscopes: Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Kurt Lewin website: http://faculty.frostburg.edu/mbradley/psyography/bioscopes_kurtlewin.html The life space that contains all the events in the past, present, and future that shape and affect an individual. This focus on individuality led him to diagram the life space, containing arrows leading to and from possible life goals, both positive and negative. In sum, Lewin's ecological systems model emphasized situational and proximal causes. Additionally, Lewin's theory demonstrates that behavior is a function of the current person by their environment, which are all affected by past experience. Bronfenbrenner was also influenced by his colleague, Stephen J. Ceci, with whom he co-authored the article “Nature-nurture reconceptualized in developmental perspective: A bioecological theory” in 1994. Ceci is a developmental psychologist who redefined modern developmental psychology's approach to intellectual development. He focused on predicting a pattern of associations among ecological, genetic, and cognitive variables as a function of proximal processes. Together, Bronfenbrenner and Ceci published the beginnings of the bioecological model and made it an accessible framework to use in understanding developmental processes.  History  The history of bioecological systems theory is divided into two periods. The first period resulted in the publication of Bronfenbrenner's theory of ecological systems theory, titled The Ecology of Human Development, in 1979.Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by nature and design. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1–348. Bronfenbrenner described the second period as a time of criticism and evaluation of his original work. The development of ecological systems theory arose because Bronfenbrenner noted a lack of focus on the role of context in terms of development. He argued the environment in which children operate is important because development may be shaped by their interactions with the specific environment. He urged his colleagues to study development in terms of ecological contexts, that is the normal environments of children (schools, homes, daycares). Researchers heeded his advice and a great deal of research flourished in the early 1980s that focused on context. However, where prior research was ignoring context, Bronfenbrenner felt current research focused too much on context and ignored development. In his justification for a new theory, Bronfenbrenner wrote he was not pleased with the direction of research in the mid 1980s and that he felt there were other realms of development that were overlooked. In comparison to the original theory, bioecological systems theory adds more emphasis to the person in the context of development. Additionally, Bronfenbrenner chose to leave out key features of the ecological systems theory (e.g., ecological validity and ecological experiments) during his development of bioecological systems theory. As a whole, Bronfenbrenner's new theory continued to go through a series of transformations as he continuously analyzed different factors in human development. Critical components of bioecological systems theory did not emerge all at once. Instead, his ideas evolved and adapted to the research and ideas of the times. For example, the role of proximal processes, which is now recognized as a key feature of bioecological systems theory, did not emerge until the 1990s. This theory went through a series of transformations and elaborations until 2005 when Bronfenbrenner died.  Process–Person–Context–Time  Bronfenbrenner further developed the model by adding the chronosystem, which refers to how the person and environments change over time. He also placed a greater emphasis on processes and the role of the biological person. The Process–Person–Context–Time Model (PPCT) has since become the bedrock of the bioecological model. PPCT includes four concepts. The interactions between the concepts form the basis for the theory. : 1. Process – Bronfenbrenner viewed proximal processes as the primary mechanism for development, featuring them in two central propositions of the bioecological model. ::::Proposition 1: [H]uman development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the persons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a fairly regular basis over extended periods of time. Such enduring forms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred to as proximal processes. ::Proximal processes are the development processes of systematic interaction between person and environment. Bronfenbrenner identifies group and solitary activities such as playing with other children or reading as mechanisms through which children come to understand their world and formulate ideas about their place within it. However, processes function differently depending on the person and the context. ::::Proposition 2: The form, power, content, and direction of the proximal processes effecting development vary systematically as a joint function of the characteristics of the developing person; of the environment—both immediate and more remote—in which the processes are taking place; the nature of the developmental outcomes under consideration; and the social continuities and changes occurring over time through the life course and the historical period during which the person has lived. : 2. Person – Bronfenbrenner acknowledged the role that personal characteristics of individuals play in social interactions. He identified three personal characteristics that can significantly influence proximal processes across the lifespan. Demand characteristics such as age, gender or physical appearance set processes in motion, acting as “personal stimulus” characteristics. Resource characteristics are not as immediately recognizable and include mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, intelligence, and skills as well as material resources such as access to housing, education, and responsive caregivers. Force characteristics are related to variations in motivation, persistence and temperament. Bronfenbrenner notes that even when children have equivalent access to resources, their developmental courses may differ as a function of characteristics such as drive to succeed and persistence in the face of hardship. In doing this, Bronfenbrenner provides a rationale for how environments (i.e., the systems mentioned above under “The Original Model: Ecological Systems Theory”) influence personal characteristics, yet also suggests personal characteristics can change environments. : 3. Context – Context involves five interconnected systems, which are based on Bronfenbrenner’s original model, ecological systems theory. The microsystem describes environments such as home or school in which children spend significant time interacting. Mesosystems are interrelations between microsystems. The exosystem describes events that have important indirect influence on development (e.g., a parent consistently working late). The macrosystem is a feature of any group (culture, subculture) that share values and belief systems. The chronosystem describes historical circumstances that affect contexts at all other levels. : 4. Time – Time has a prominent place in this developmental model. It is constituted at three levels: micro, meso, and macro. Micro-time refers to what is happening during specific episodes of proximal processes. Meso-time refers to the extent to which the processes occur in the person’s environment, such as over the course of days, weeks or years. Macro-time (or the chronosystem) focuses on the shifting expectancies in wider culture. This functions both within and across generations and affects proximal processes across the lifespan. Thus, the bioecological model highlights the importance of understanding a person's development within environmental systems. It further explains that both the person and the environment affect one another bidirectionally. Although even Bronfenbrenner himself critiqued the falsifiability of the model, the bioecological model has real world applications for developmental research, practice, and policies (as demonstrated below).  Research implications  In addition to adding to the theoretical understanding of human development, the bioecological model lends itself to changes in the conceptualization of the research endeavor. In some of his earliest comments on the state of developmental research, Bronfenbrenner lamented that developmental research concerned itself with studying “strange behavior of children in strange situations for the briefest possible period of time”. He proposed, rather, that developmental science should take as its goal a study of children in context in order to best determine which processes are naturally “developmentally generative” (promote development) and which are naturally “developmentally disruptive” (prevent development). Bronfenbrenner set up a contrast to the traditional “confirmatory” approach to hypothesis testing (in which research is done to “confirm” that a hypothesis is correct or incorrect) when specifying the types of research needed to support the bioecological model of development. In Bronfenbrenner's view, the dynamic nature of the model calls for “primarily generative” research designs that explore interactions between proximal processes (see Proposition 1) and the developing person, environment, time, and developmental outcome (Proposition 2). Bronfenbrenner called this type of research the “discovery mode” of developmental science. To best capture such dynamic processes, developmental research designs would ideally be longitudinal (over time), rather than cross-sectional (a single point in time), and conducted in children's natural environments, rather than a laboratory. Such designs would thus occur in schools, homes, day-care centers, and other environments in which proximal processes are most likely to occur. The bioecological model also proposes that the most scientifically rich studies would include more than one distinct but theoretically related proximal process in the same design. Indeed, studies that claim to be based upon bioecological theory should include elements of process, person, context, and time, and should include explicit explanation and acknowledgement if one of the elements is lacking. Based on the interactions of proposed elements of the PPCT model, appropriate statistical analyses of PPCT data would likely include explorations of mediation and moderation effects, as well as multilevel modeling of data to account for the nesting of different components of the model. Moreover, research that includes both genetic and environmental components would capture even more of the bioecological model's elements.  Role of technology  In today's interconnected world, communication and electronic devices have a huge effect on the micro-cellular structure and complex bio-chemistry of our brains which eventually affects our personality, behavior and characteristics. A research conducted by Harvard medical school, highlighted the power of human imagination and the structural changes it causes to the human brain at the micro-cellular level thus bringing about changes in character personality or behaviour. The scientist argues that if imagination could bring about such permanent changes in the brain, the effects of digital technology on a human brain can produce behavioural changes such as shorter attention span, reduction in communication skills and abstract thinking. However, there is enough research to prove the positive effects of ‘brain-training’ computer games aimed at keeping the brain cells active. (Greenfield, 2014, #13) According to technology writer Nicholas Carr, technology has always determined the development of the brain and the way we think throughout History. As he illustrates with examples of reading and the rise in the use of internet. He observes that development of reading habits motivated our brains to be concentrate on the text and imagine, whereas the over exposure of internet reinforce our capability to scan and filter information productively and easily. (Taylor, 2012, #14) Attention is the key requisite which paves the way to all aspects of learning viz. perception, memory, language, creativity, reasoning, problem solving and decision making. Attention has been considered to be a highly malleable quality which can be influenced by the environment. Research shows that the invention of digital entertainment changed the attention span by presenting children with visual stimuli and very little need of imagination. In such an environment distraction becomes the norm and memory, focusing gets affected. This is in sharp contradiction to the children of the past who spent a great amount of their time reading, which requires deep and consistent attention, imagination, memory and which gave way to minimal distractions. (Taylor, 2012, #14) However studies have shown that a visual media improves visual-spatial capabilities (Green, Bavelier 2010, #15) and capacity to identify relevant information in text filled with hyperlinks and ads. Thus technology maybe making children viewing information differently compared to the children of yesteryear. In short children are more skilled at remembering where to find information rather than remembering information itself. Thus the brain may be allowed to be involved in higher order activities such as contemplation, critical thinking and problem solving. (Taylor, 2012, #14) Feel / ability to empathize According to a study on two groups of sixth-graders, kids who had no access to electronic devices for five days picked up on emotions and non-verbal cues better than those who used their devices during that time. (De Loatch, 2015, #16)  Ecological techno subsystem  Ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) emerged before the advent of Internet revolution and the developmental influence of then available technology (e.g., television) was conceptually situated in the child's microsystem. Johnson and Puplampu (2008) proposed the ecological techno-subsystem, a dimension of the microsystem. Ecological techno-subsystem, a refinement to Bronfenbrenner's theoretical organization of environmental influences on child development. The word ecological techno-subsystem comprises both child interaction with living (e.g., peers, parents, teachers) and non-living (e.g., hardware, gadgets) elements of communication, information, and recreation technologies in immediate or direct environments. An experimental study of 128 children from first to sixth grade was conducted to assess their cognitive development, based on their use of internet at home and socioeconomic characteristics of the family. Measures and Results Three constructs, corresponding to three ecological systems/subsystems, were measured: child cognitive development (bioecology), indices of child use of the Internet at home (techno-subsystem), and family socioeconomic characteristics (microsystem). For the chosen sample of children, both father's education and mother's employment were associated with measures of child cognitive development. Educated fathers tended to have children who scored high on three of the four cognitive measures (expressive language, visual perception, and auditory memory) as they may provide enhanced language models and stimulating learning environments to their children. Employed mothers tended to have children who had high scores on the measure of metacognitive planning as they could train their children to develop internet usage skills and effective management of information . The indices of use of internet at home accounted for more variance in their development than the indices of socioeconomic status. The ecological techno-subsystem improves our understanding of the influences of environment on child development by stressing the effect of digital technologies on cognitive growth during childhood. While Internet use during childhood has been associated with negative developmental outcomes, research increasingly suggests that the Internet provides children with more developmental advantages than disadvantages (Greenfield & Yan, 2006). The Internet, although rich in graphic display, is primarily a text-based medium; “the more a child uses the Internet, the more he/she reads” (Jackson et al., 2007, p. 188). Exposure to computer during the preschool years increased school readiness later (Li and Atkins (2004). Jackson and colleagues (2006) provided low income children with home-based Internet access and continuously recorded time online. Their findings indicated that children who used the Internet more had higher scores on standardized tests of reading achievement and higher grade point compared to those children who used the Internet less (p. 429). From a developmental perspective, Internet use stimulates cognitive processes involved in interpreting text and images (Johnson, 2006). Metacognitive processes such as planning, search strategies, and evaluation of information are exercised when navigating websites (Tarpley, 2001). DeBell and Chapman (2006) concluded that Internet use promotes cognitive development in children, “specifically in the area of visual intelligence, where certain computer activities – particularly games – may enhance the ability to monitor several visual stimuli at once, to read diagrams, recognize icons, and visualize spatial relationships” (p. 3). Comprehensive theoretical description of the developmental effect of Internet use is required. The recently proposed ecological techno-subsystem (Johnson & Puplampu, 2008) provides a conceptual framework for understanding the effect of Internet use on child development.

The sculptures are located in the Brazilian municipality of Congonhas do Campo, where they adorn the forecourt of the Santuário do Bom Jesus de Matosinhos. The Twelve Prophets Each sculpture in the series commemorates a prophet of the Hebrew Bible. The twelve sculptures do not correspond to the Twelve Minor Prophets, but include some of the Major Prophets and prophets whose works are part of the Old Testament deuterocanon. Each figure holds a scroll with a text, in Latin, from their biblical writings. Amazing spirit and power emanates from the heroic figures of the twelve prophets. ...Highly theatrical, the figures show individuality and inner greatness, held fast by the massiveness of their material - stone. It is likely that Aleijadinho himself, in his 70s when these works were completed, only carved the top half of the figures, the lower portions being executed by other carvers of his workshop. During this time in his life Aleijadinho, who suffered a debilitating disease believed to be leprosy, did all his carving behind screens in this workshop, \\"his chisel and mallet strapped to the stumps of his deformed hands.\\" It has been noted that two of the statues, Joel and Jonah, seem to have had their positions reversed. \\"[T]he direction of the gaze of these two figures appears to out of harmony with the arrangement of the others.\\" Also, if the positions of these two statues were reversed, then all of the figures would be placed in chronological order. Isaiah Isaiah A prophet of the Old Testament, Isaiah, opens the series at the staircase entrance on the left side of the Santuário. This sculpture has features characteristic of a person of advanced age, including a full beard and thick hair. He wears a short tunic, which covers his lower legs and boots sidewalks, and over which in draped a large mantle. He holds a parchment scroll from his left hand, while the right points to the text inscribed upon it. Aleijadinho's sculptures present strong evidence of anatomical errors, including a disproportion between the upper and lower body, narrow shoulders, and rigidly short arms. This may result from the figure being completed by one of the assistants in his studio. The expression on the face of Isaiah is characteristic of the genius of Aleijadinho. The expression presents that of a truly enlightened visage, thus becoming one of the most important pieces of the whole architectural complex. Jeremiah Jeremiah To the right of Isaiah and also occupying a prominent position at the entrance of the staircase, is the prophet Jeremiah, the second author of a prophetic book in the order of the Christian canon. The physical form of the sculpture is that of a middle-aged man with long whiskers on the sides of his mouth and a short beard of crisped rolls, in the Byzantine style. He wears short tunic, leaving the left leg revealed, which is draped over the right shoulder to fall downwards to the top of the feet. He secures firmly a parchment with his right hand and holds in his left a pen. Capping the head is a magnificent turban, edged with twisted flaps passing beneath the brim. Like the statue of Isaiah, Jeremiah is slightly smaller than the remaining statues. From an anatomical point of view, this statue also has deformities. However, despite the noticeable defects, there is intervention of Aleijadinho in the execution of the head, where, no doubt, is concentrated all the real power of the image. Baruch Baruch Although he is not counted among the prophets of the Hebrew Tanakh, the inclusion of Baruch in the Congonhas statuary reflects his importance as Jeremiah's scribe, and the prominence of the Book of Baruch in both the Septuagint and Vulgate Bible. Baruch holds forth a parchment whose quotations are a synthesis of several passages of his book. The sculpture, located on the pedestal that finishes off the wall alignment of the central courtyard, is a young and beardless figure, clad in short tunic, cloak, and boots. He wears a turban decorated with a brim similar to that of the prophet Jeremiah. With one hand he holds the folds of his mantle, while in the other he bears the parchment. The piece, with its squat proportions and anatomical errors evident, is one of the weakest of the set. As with the other figures, however, the strength of the image comes from the expression on his face. Ezekiel Ezekiel Standing opposite Baruch, on a pedestal of the central wall dividing the forecourt, is Ezekiel, also known as the prophet of the exile for having been banished to Babylon with the people of Israel. The inscription upon the scroll combines three successive portions of the prophet's vision: first, the four winged creatures with four faces each, then four wheels of a chariot of fire supporting a sapphire throne, and finally on the throne, the god of Israel himself. The style of face on Ezekiel is much the same as Jeremiah. He displays a mustache and short beard, with frizzled curls of long hair falling upon the neck. Instead of a short tunic, the prophet wears a tunic that is long and belted, leaving uncovered only the tip of the right foot. In place of a turban, Ezekiel's head bears a cap with a visor attached by a loop above the neck. Covering the whole back of the piece, the mantle is magnificently decorated with a plaited band. The sculpture suffered little intervention in the workshop. Its great strength of expression shows particular care by Aleijadinho in its execution. Apart from the impressive expression of the face, there is also lifelike movement suggested in the bending the right arm. Daniel  Daniel  The prophet Daniel flanks the entrance passage to the courtyard, and occupies a position both facing and corresponding to that of Hosea on the opposite side. This juxtaposition of the last of the major prophets and first of the minor prophets reveals, once again, how the series as a whole utilizes iconography in the positions of the statues within the forecourt. The face of Daniel portrays a beardless youth, as Baruch and Obadiah. However, the physiognomy of Daniel differs from theirs, especially in the carving of the eyes, the mouth and nose long, with its flared nostrils. The visage as a whole reveals a lofty and distant expression, characteristic of a hero aware of his strength. A laurel wreath adorning the miter head accentuates this aspect, and is an obvious allusion to Daniel's victory over the lions, one of whom crouches at his right foot. Like Ezekiel, Daniel wears a long robe, tied at the waist by a belt, and buttoned at the collar. In this sculpture, it seems that Aleijadinho employed no assistance from his staff. It is the largest statue of the collection, both monolithic and particularly well executed, testifying to the skill behind its creation. Hosea  Hosea  The first of the minor prophets, Hosea occupies a place in the sanctuary atop the pedestal that completes the parapet at the entrance of the forecourt. Hosea, like Ezekiel and Jeremiah, wears a short coat, buttoned to the collar bar and secured at his waist by a belt. His head is covered by a cap similar to that of Ezekiel, his legs by pants and buskin boots. He holds a pen in his right hand, whose tip is placed on the sash of the mantle, presenting an attitude of one who still is writing. The anatomy of the sculpture is correct, apart from a discrepancy between the length of the two arms. Joel  Joel  Joel, the second of the minor prophets in their traditional biblical sequence, takes his place in the churchyard to the right of Hosea, at the junction of the parapet entrance of the churchyard wall and the inner portion. The sculpture's face, like that of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea, is virile and masculine, with his beard and mustache set in Byzantine- style rolls. The garments are similar to those of Hosea, but with a higher collar. Joel's turban is similarly styled, with turned up brim, to those displayed on Jeremiah and Baruch. His head is thrust forward and his back curved. The statue exhibits virtually no anatomical imperfections. It is one of the most powerful of the whole set, and its force of expression reveals the careful attention of Aleijadinho in his execution. Obadiah  Obadiah  Obadiah stands at the very bottom of the churchyard walls, at the corner between walls of the front and left sides of the forecourt. The statue of Obadiah portrays a beardless youth, like Baruch, Daniel, and Amos, but the more slender proportions give the impression of a taller youth. Obadiah wears a tunic and mantle, supplemented only by a simple cap, but the arrangement of the folds is very well organized in a classical game of light and shadow. This statue can be seen as contrasted with the prophet Habakkuk, who occupies an equivalent position at the opposite end of the forecourt. Functioning visually as bulwarks at each side of the churchyard, the statues of both Obadiah and Habakkuk have the same attitude of arms raised, same style of clothing, as well as the same seemingly complicated texture of drapery. For the positions they occupy, both statues received special care, and since the images are anatomically perfect, it is likely that there was little assistance provided by collaborators in his studio. Amos  Amos  At the far left end of the forecourt, atop the great arc of a wall connecting the extreme front and side walls of the Santuário, stands the statue of the prophet Amos. The style of Amos differs completely from all the other prophets in the group, although these differences are most noticeable in the physical styling of his garment. His broad face is beardless with a calm expression, almost good-natured as befits a man of the field. His garments suit the vocation of a shepherd. Amos is dressed in a sort of jacket lined with sheepskin, and features a cap on his head similar to those Portuguese farmers still wear in the region. Given the great height of the wall on which is placed, the sculpture seems to have been designed to be seen form its left side. On its right side, it presents a number of deficiencies, such as the omission of the trouser leg on this side. As with the statue of Daniel, it is an almost monolithic piece, with only a small seam at the top of the cap. Jonah  Jonah  Occupying a position symmetrical to that of Joel, at the meeting point of the parapet walls that form the ingress to the left side of the forecourt, is the statue of Jonah. For this best-known of the minor prophets, Aleijadinho reserved pride of place, positioning it next to Daniel. The statue of Jonah is crafted in the same style previously used for the figures of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, and Joel. However, his countenance possesses unique features, such as an open mouth with teeth visible and his face turned upward. He holds up his left palm towards the viewer. Jonah's clothing is composed of a sort of cassock, with collar and buttoned to the waist, which is secured with a girdle. The prophet also bears a cloak thrown over his left shoulder, and the usual mitre-shaped turban, with upturned flaps. The statue seems to have received the same special care that was bestowed on Daniel, and there is no evidence of finishing work from Aleijadinho's shop. Included in this piece are two additional aspects of creative genius that display a capacity for dramatic expression. The front view of the statue is as ornamental as the back, and the sinuous silhouette of the whale, complete with toothy maw, seems to emerge as if from a Rococo fountain. Nahum  Nahum  At the right edge of the forecourt, occupying the highest position atop the arc that joins the front and side exterior walls, is the statue of Nahum, the seventh of the minor prophets. The figure of Nahum is an old, bearded man with weathered face and tottering posture. He wears a long cassock, buttoned at the waist, whose folds are gathered in his left hand. The finishing efforts of Aleijadinho's studio workers are highly evident in this piece, especially in the execution of the turban that Nahum wears on his head. Some details, such as the ornamental sash of the mantle, exhibit a general deficiency of articulation among the whole group, so that it seems possible Aleijadinho merely designed the initial features of the statue. Habakkuk  Habakkuk  Habakkuk, the eighth of the minor prophets, closes the series of prophets in Congonhas. He holds a prominent position equivalent to that of Obadiah, at the lower point of the arc that joins the front and right side walls of the forecourt. With one arm raised, he condemns the oppressor. Anew, he repeats the standard typology used previously for Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, and Jonah. Habakkuk's vestments include the same cassock worn by Nahum and Jonah, but this time with the addition of a collar whose corners are adorned with tassels. The prophet sports the most complicated headgear of the whole series, which has a high, flat top divided into four rounded sections, topped by a pendent tassel. The statue received special care in its execution from Aleijadinho because of to its location, with minimal collaboration evident from his studio. Political interpretations Detail of one of the prophets: Hosea Some analysts have proposed that the prophets at Congonhas are a call for political freedom, both for the many African slaves who worked in the region's mines and for the native Brazilians who wanted independence from Portugal, as was reflected in the Inconfidência Mineira revolt a few years earlier.

It was carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation, apparently in retaliation for the Provisional IRA bombing attack on the Times Bar on York Road, in which two Protestant civilians were killed. In the Chlorane attack, five men were killed; three Catholics and two Protestants. The gunmen were from the UVF Belfast Brigade's Shankill Road battalion. The assault was a joint operation by the platoons based at the Brown Bear and the Windsor Bar, drinking haunts in the Shankill Road district frequented by UVF members. The attack Buildup to the shootings A hijacked black taxi, similar to the model shown here, was used to transport the UVF gunmen to the Chlorane Bar On 5 June 1976, a bomb exploded at the door of the Times Bar on York Road, killing two Protestants. The pub was frequented by members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a legal loyalist paramilitary group.\\"Two die in Ulster bombings\\". The Star-News, 6 June 1976. Irish republicans were blamed for the bombing. Shortly after, the UVF Brigade Staff (its Shankill Road-based leadership) decided to hit back by attacking the Chlorane Bar. It was a hastily arranged operation devised by its military commander (whom investigative journalist Martin Dillon refers to as \\"Mr F\\"). The Chlorane Bar was located at 23 Gresham Street in Belfast's city centre, near Smithfield Market. Its clientele was mixed (Protestant and Catholic), which was unusual during The Troubles.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. p. 125 On 17 August 1973, the Chlorane Bar had been firebombed; however, nobody was injured as the pub was closed at the time of the attack. Later that same month, the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) claimed responsibility for a car bomb which exploded in Gresham Street. Although there were no human casualties, a pet shop located near the bomb's epicentre was damaged in the blast and a number of animals inside the building were either killed or injured.The Troubles: A Chronology of the Northern Ireland Conflict. Glenravel Publications. Issue #23, July- August 1973. pp. 62,72; retrieved 14 February 2012. The attack was planned and executed by the UVF platoons based at the Brown Bear and the Windsor Bar respectively. These were two pubs located on the Shankill Road and regularly frequented by UVF members.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 131 Dillon has referred to the former platoon as the \\"Brown Bear Team\\" because the members generally met at that particular pub, which faced Shankill Library on the corner of Mountjoy Street.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, p. 164 To carry out the attack, along with the procuring of weapons and masks, a black taxi was hijacked by two young men outside the Long Bar on the Shankill to transport the gunmen to the Chlorane. Taxi driver Mark Hagan and a passenger were held hostage at the Windsor Bar.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 126 Dillon suggests the Chlorane Bar was chosen for its nearness to the Shankill Road, affording the attackers a speedy getaway. Dillon devotes several pages to the Chlorane Bar attack in his book The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. There was not much of a security presence that evening in the area.Dillon, p. 132 The driver of the taxi, with four specifically chosen armed men seated in the rear of the vehicle in the manner of genuine passengers, made his way from the Shankill Road to North Street and turned south into Gresham Street. Upon arrival outside the Chlorane Bar, the four gunmen donned their masks, devised from yellow money bags, and exited the taxi. The shootings Gresham Street in 2007. The carpark in the foreground was the site of the Chlorane Bar. At 10:00 pm, the four masked gunmen stormed through Chlorane Bar's front door leading to the public bar. There were about 16 customers inside the pub at the time;Ryder, Chris (1990). The RUC: a force under fire. p. 180 a survivor had described the atmosphere as having been \\"happy\\".Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 126 One of the four gunmen was Robert \\"Basher\\" Bates, a member of the violent Shankill Butchers gang led by Lenny Murphy, who was in police custody at the time the attack against the Chlorane took place.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, pp. 131-34 Bates was the only one of the four to have been from the \\"Brown Bear Team\\". The hit squad was commanded by a \\"Mr G\\", leader of the Windsor Bar UVF platoon, with \\"Mr D\\" as his second-in-command and \\"Mr C\\" completing the team. Entering the bar in single file, \\"Mr G\\" ordered everybody to stand up, and then asked the startled customers whether there were any \\"Prods\\" (Protestants) among them. William Greer, a Protestant, thinking the gunmen were from the IRA, quickly fled to the men's toilet where he placed his feet up against the door. Customer Frederick Graham and his girlfriend, Pat Mahood, assumed the same thing. \\"Mr G\\" told the customers to separate into two groups, with the Protestants standing at the bottom end of the bar, and the Catholics at the top.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, pp. 127, 133 When one man, Edward Farrell, admitted to being a Catholic the UVF men opened fire. Farrell had tried to run towards the toilet but was shot dead. The Catholic owner of the Chlorane, 64-year-old James Coyle, had been standing behind the bar when he was hit at close-range. The bullet entered his heart and he died instantly. The gunmen continued firing; two Protestant men, Daniel McNeil and Samuel Corr, were also struck by the hail of bullets. McNeil was killed on the spot and Corr was fatally wounded. Another Catholic man, John Martin, was shot and died of his injuries on 23 June. Several other customers were hit as gunfire was sprayed around the bar. One customer pretended to be dead; however, a gunman walked over to where he lay and deliberately fired three shots into his thigh, knee, and below the ankle. The man later recounted that he had then looked up to see \\"men lying shot all over the place\\".Dillon, p. 129 William Greer, hiding in the toilet, had been shot when one of the gunmen fired through the door. He survived despite being hit in the leg and neck. There had been more customers upstairs in the lounge area, but although they heard the gunshots, the gunmen never went near them. Dillon maintained that it had not been the UVF unit's intention to kill any Protestants.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 134 \\"Mr G\\" called a halt to the shooting, saying \\"that's it\\",Dillon, p. 133 and the four-man UVF team nonchalantly walked out of the pub and re-entered the hijacked black taxi, which had been parked so the driver could have easy access to North Street; this route offered a quick return to the Shankill. After the four men got into the back seat, the driver (\\"Mr. H\\") drove off. As the taxi passed by the Catholic Unity Flats area, three shots were fired from the vehicle. Two young men walking nearby got a look at the driver. He was described as being around 38 to 40 years old and having shoulder-length, black curly hair. Upon the taxi's return to the Shankill, Mark Hagan and the passenger were released. They immediately went to the Tennent Street Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Station off the Shankill where they reported the taxi's hijacking. The shooting team proceeded to the Long Bar pub where \\"Mr I\\" (commander of UVF 1st Battalion) procured a forty- ounce bottle of vodka for \\"Mr G\\" and \\"Mr D\\" - their payment for having led the operation. Aftermath Having heard the gunshots, a barmaid serving in the upstairs lounge went downstairs to investigate and discovered the body of her employer, James Coyle lying on the floor behind the bar and those of the other dead and wounded.Dillon, p. 128 The first policeman on the scene was Constable George McElnea, from the RUC Special Patrol Group in Tennent Street. He quickly noticed the pile of bodies near the men's toilet as Samuel Corr stumbled towards him, gravely injured. McElnea placed Corr on a bench and offered what assistance he could but to no avail; Corr died of his gunshot wounds before the ambulance arrived.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 131 Alan McCrum, a Scenes of Crime officer, appeared at the Chlorane fifteen minutes after the shootings. He retrieved 24 spent bullet cases from the floor and determined that most of the shots had been fired at the rear of the pub. Later ballistic testing established that the weapons used in the attack were a .22 caliber pistol, a .9mm pistol, and two .45 snub-nosed revolvers. Police believed one of the victims, Daniel McNeil, had tenuous UVF connections, although he was not an active member.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, p. 126 The hijacked black taxi was found by police the following morning in a cul-de-sac in Beresford Street, off the Shankill Road. A cyclist, who had witnessed the masked gunmen entering the Chlorane Bar, described the four men as having been in the 20 to 30 age group, were all about 5'10 in height and well-built; the last gunman to enter had shoulder-length brown hair. The witness had gone to a nearby British Army post where he told soldiers what he had seen. Ten days after the gun attack, the Chlorane Bar was blown up by a bomb.Image of bomb aftermath Three weeks after the attack the Provisional IRA, using their sometime cover-name of the \\"Republican Action Force\\", entered Walker's Bar in Templepatrick and killed three Protestant civilians in retaliation for the Chlorane attack. As part of this series of deadly tit for tat attacks on pubs, the UVF responded by killing six customers at the Catholic-owned Ramble Inn outside Antrim.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, p. 183 No one was ever charged with the shootings. In February 1979, Bates was convicted of the murders he had committed as part of the Shankill Butchers, and given ten life sentences. In his statement to the police following his arrest in 1977, he recounted his role in the Chlorane Bar attack. He alleged while working as a barman in the Long Bar on the evening of 5 June 1976, he had been approached by the UVF military commander, \\"Mr F\\", who informed him of a job in which he was to take part that same evening. It was decided to attack the city centre pub in retaliation for the IRA's earlier bombing of The Times pub. Bates went on to say that \\"Mr I\\" had provided the weapons which were used in the shooting and \\"Mr J\\" (UVF Provost Marshal) had procured the masks. Bates claimed that his revolver had malfunctioned and therefore had never fired his gun during the attack; however, forensic evidence proved that two .45 revolvers had been fired inside the Chlorane.Dillon, The Shankill Butchers, pp. 133-34 Upon his release from the Maze Prison, Bates was gunned-down in June 1997 by the son of James Curtis Moorhead, a UDA man he had killed in 1977.\\"Exposure Sealed Fate of Notorious Activists\\" David McKittrick, 24 August 2000, The Independent on Sunday.McDonald, Henry; Cusack, Jim (2004).

Speech tempo is believed to vary within the speech of one person according to contextual and emotional factors, between speakers and also between different languages and dialects. However, there are many problems involved in investigating this variance scientifically. Problems of definition While most people seem to believe that they can judge how quickly someone is speaking, it is generally said that subjective judgements and opinions cannot serve as scientific evidence for statements about speech tempo; J. Laver has written that analyzing tempo can be \\"dangerously open to subjective bias ... listeners' judgements rapidly begin to lose objectivity when the utterance concerned comes either from an unfamiliar accent or .. from an unfamiliar language\\". Scientific observation depends on accurate segmenting of recorded speech along the time course of an utterance, usually using one of the acoustic analysis software tools available on the internet such as Audacity or, specifically for speech research, Praat, SIL Speech Analyzer or SFS. Measurements of speech tempo can be strongly affected by pauses and hesitations. For this reason, it is usual to distinguish between speech tempo including pauses and hesitations and speech tempo excluding them. The former is called speaking rate and the latter articulation rate. Various units of speech have been used as a basis for measurement. The traditional measure of speed in typing and Morse code transmission has been words per minute (wpm). However, in the study of speech the word is not well defined (being primarily a unit of grammar), and speech is not usually temporally stable over a period as long as a minute. Many studies have used the measure of syllables per second, but this is not completely reliable because, although the syllable as a phonological unit of a given language is well-defined, it is not always possible to get agreement on the phonetic syllable. For example, the English word 'particularly' in the form in which it occurs in dictionaries is, phonologically speaking, composed of five syllables /pə.tɪk.jə.lə.li/. Phonetic realizations of the word, however, may be heard as comprising five [pə.tɪk.jə.lə.li], four [pə.tɪk.jə.li], three [pə.tɪk.li] or even two syllables [ptɪk.li], and listeners are likely to have different opinions about the number of syllables heard. An alternative measure that has been proposed is that of sounds per second. One study found rates varying from an average of 9.4 sounds per second for poetry reading to 13.83 per second for sports commentary. The problem with this approach is that the researcher must be clear as to whether the \\"sounds\\" s/he is counting are phonemes or physically observable phonetic units (sometimes called \\"phones\\"). As an example, the utterance 'Don't forget to record it' might in slow, careful speech be pronounced /dəʊnt fəget tə rɪkɔːd ɪt/, with 19 phonemes, each of which is phonetically realized. When the sentence is said at high speed it might be pronounced as [də̃ʊ̃ʔ fɡeʔtrɪkɔːd ɪt], with 16 units. If we are counting only units that can be observed and measured, it is clear that at faster speeds of utterance the number of sounds produced per second does not necessarily increase. Within-speaker variability Speakers vary their speed of speaking according to contextual and physical factors. A typical speaking rate for English is 4 syllables per second, but in different emotional or social contexts the rate may vary, one study reporting a range between 3.3 and 5.9 syl/sec, Another study found significant differences in speaking rate between story-telling and taking part in an interview. Speech tempo may be regarded as one of the components of prosody. Possibly the most detailed analytical framework for the role of tempo in English prosody is that of Crystal. His system, which uses terms mostly borrowed from musical usage, allows for simple variation away from normal in tempo, where monosyllables may be pronounced as \\"clipped\\", \\"drawled\\" or \\"held\\" and polysyllabic utterances may be spoken at \\"allegro\\", \\"allegrissimo\\", \\"lento\\" and \\"lentissimo\\". Complex variation includes \\"accelerando\\" and \\"rallentando\\". Crystal claims that \\"... tempo has probably the most highly discrete grammatical function of all prosodic parameters other than pitch ...\\". He cites from his corpus-based analysis instances of increased tempo in cases of speakers' self-corrections of speech errors, and in citing embedded material in the form of titles and names, e.g. \\"I'm sorry, but we won't be able to start So you think you know what's happening for a few moments\\" and \\"This is the I'll show you a picture and you tell me what it is technique\\" (where the italicized text is spoken at faster tempo). Between-language differences Subjective impressions of tempo differences between different languages and dialects are difficult to substantiate with scientific data. Counting syllables per second will result in differences caused by the different syllable structures found in different languages; many languages have a predominantly CV (consonant+vowel) syllable structure while English syllables may begin with up to 3 consonants and end with up to 4. Consequently, it is likely that a Japanese speaker can produce more syllables in their language per second than an English speaker can in theirs. Counting sounds per second is also problematic for the reason mentioned above, i.e. that the researcher needs to be sure what objects it is that s/he is counting. Howard Giles has studied the relationship between perceived tempo and perceived competence of speakers of different accents of English, and found a positive linear relationship between the two (i.e. people who speak faster are perceived as more competent). Osser and Peng counted sounds per second for Japanese and English and found no significant difference. The study by Kowal et al., referred to above, comparing story-telling with speaking in an interview, looked at English, Finnish, French, German and Spanish . They found no significant differences in rate between the languages, but highly significant differences between the speaking styles. Similarly, Barik found that differences in tempo between French and English were due to speaking style rather than to the language. From the point of view of the perception of tempo differences between languages, Vaane used spoken Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Arabic produced at three different rates and found that untrained and phonetically trained listeners performed equally well at judging the rate of speaking for familiar and unfamiliar languages. In the absence of reliable evidence to support it, it seems that the widespread view that some languages are spoken more rapidly than others is an illusion. This illusion may well be related to other factors such as differences of rhythm and pausing. In another study, an analysis of speech rate and perception in radio bulletins, the average rate of bulletins varied from 168 (English, BBC) to 210 words per minutes (Spanish, RNE).http://prosodia.upf.edu/home/arxiu/publicacions/rodero/rodero_a- comparative-analysis-of-speech-rate-and-perception-in-radio-bulletins.pdf See also *Isochrony References Bibliography *Roach, P.

The regiment was raised in October 1914, and assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded fifteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in South Australia, adopting the designation of the \\"Flinders Light Horse\\". It was later amalgamated with the 23rd Light Horse to form the 9th/23rd Light Horse, but in late 1941 was re- formed in its own right and converted to a motor regiment during the early years of the Second World War but it was disbanded in early 1943 without having been deployed overseas. In the post war period, the regiment was re- raised as an amalgamated unit along with the 3rd Light Horse designated the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles). Formation The 9th Light Horse Regiment was raised at Adelaide and trained in Melbourne between October 1914 and February 1915. A unit of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, about two thirds of its recruits were from South Australia while the remainder came from Victoria. The regiment comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Once formed the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, serving alongside the 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted rifles armed with rifles, not swords or lances,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history Gallipoli campaign 9th Light Horse trench Gallipoli In February 1915, the 9th Light Horse Regiment left Melbourne for Egypt, arriving on the 1 February 1915. When the Australian infantry units were dispatched to Gallipoli, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties resulted in the deployment of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade as reinforcements in May 1915. On arrival, the regiment was attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division. The regiment was the brigade reserve for the battle of the Nek, so did not suffer the same level of casualties as their sister regiments in the brigade, however their first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Miell, was one of those killed. The regiment was involved in the brigade's next attack at Hill 60 on 27 August, which resulted in the death of the replacement commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Carew Reynell the next day. From then until December 1915, when the regiment was withdrawn, they were only used in a defensive role. Sinai and Palestine campaign 9th Light Horse crossing the Suez canal On the regiment's return to Egypt, together with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, they were assigned to the newly raised ANZAC Mounted Division. Used in the defence of the Suez Canal, the regiment provided the majority of the fighting troops for The Jifjafa Raid. They missed the early battles of the Sinai and Palestine campaign, but were involved in the pursuit of the Ottoman forces into Palestine, following their defeat in the Battle of Romani. In December 1916, the regiment took part in a bayonet attack during the battle of Magdhaba, and another in the battle of Rafa in January 1917. The regiment and brigade were then assigned to a new division, the Imperial Mounted Division – which was later renamed the Australian Mounted Division – and subsequently fought in the unsuccessful First and Second Battles of Gaza. The next Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, was a success, and led to the fall of Gaza. This led to a general withdrawal of Ottoman forces north into Palestine, followed by the British Empires forces. During this pursuit the regiment was involved in the capture of Jerusalem in December. In 1918, the regiment took part in an unsuccessful raid across the River Jordan at Es Salt. On 21 September, the regiment captured Jenin and Sa'sa', and entered Damascus in October. The war in the Middle East ended shortly afterwards when the armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918. Afterwards, the regiment returned to Egypt to assist in putting down a revolt, before sailing for Australia in July 1919. The war cost the regiment over 100 per cent casualties, 190 killed and 481 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re- organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation.Grey 2008, p. 125. Through this process, the 9th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit within the 4th Military District in the state of South Australia, drawing lineage from the 24th Light Horse (Flinders), which had been formed in 1913 and which traced its origins back to the 17th Australian Light Horse Regiment that had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 45. Later, this unit was amalgamated with the 23rd Light Horse to form the 9th/23rd Light Horse, and at the outbreak of the war the regiment was assigned to the 6th Cavalry Brigade, which was part of the 1st Cavalry Division.Finlayson 2012, p. 200. In December 1941, the 9th was re-raised in its own right and converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the \\"9th Motor Regiment (Flinders Light Horse)\\". The regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and, as part of a gradual demobilisation of the Australian Army, on 19 February 1943, it was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war. In the post war period, Australia's part-time force was re-raised and in 1949 the regiment was reformed as an amalgamated unit with the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, adopting the designation of the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles).Festberg 1972, p. 15.

They appeared together in many of the world's most prestigious concert halls and made many recordings together. Early years Zakin was born to a violinist father in Tobolsk, Tyumen Oblast, and began studying at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory from the age of 8. He was a pupil of Aleksander Michałowski from 1911 to 1914, and then studied under Leonid Nikolayev. He emigrated in 1921 and studied music in Berlin, making his solo debut as a performer there in 1926. Career In February 1926, a piano quartet debuted, alternately named Klavier Kiddies, Jass auf vier Flügeln, and ERKLA (Erstes Klavier-quartett), which included Zakin, Adam Gelbtrunk, Lewitsch (replaced by J. Pomerane, and later by Rio Gebhardt) and Leopold Mittmann. They performed for a few years on the radio and in concert, while also making gramophone recordings. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was a performer in parts of Central Europe, giving recitals and supporting chamber-music ensembles. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, he fled to Luxembourg and became a piano teacher to the Royal Family and was employed by the Radio Luxembourg. In 1940, he began performing with violinist Isaac Stern, a partnership which would last 37 years until 1977. He also performed with violinists Paul Godwin, David and Igor Oistrakh, Leonid Kogan and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky in an illustrious career which saw him in frequent contact with impresario Sol Hurok. Zakin played the piano at the White House on several occasions during the terms of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Over the years he performed works by composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, Johannes Brahms, Claude Debussy, George Frideric Handel, Joseph Haydn, Paul Hindemith, Darius Milhaud, Sergei Prokofiev, Robert Schumann, Grigoraș Dinicu, George Enescu, César Franck, Fritz Kreisler, Ottokar Nováček, Gaetano Pugnani, Pablo de Sarasate and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. His performances of the sonatas of Brahms with Stern received considerable acclaim, amongst other performances they did together. He died on October 16, 1990, at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City of heart failure, aged 87.

Carrigan, 564 U.S. 117 (2011), was a Supreme Court of the United States decision in which the Court held that the Nevada Ethics in Government Law, which required government officials recuse in cases involving a conflict of interest, is not unconstitutionally overbroad. Specifically, the law requires government officials to recuse themselves from advocating for and voting on the passage of legislation if private commitments to the interests of others materially affect the official's judgment. Under the terms of this law, the Nevada Commission on Ethics censured city councilman Michael Carrigan for voting on a land project for which his campaign manager was a paid consultant. Carrigan challenged his censure in court and the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in his favor, claiming that casting his vote was protected speech. The Supreme Court reversed, ruling that voting by a public official on a public matter is not First Amendment speech. Background Sparks, Nevada, where Michael Carrigan was elected City Councilman Nevada's Ethics in Government Law Nevada's Ethics in Government law states that \\"a public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in the consideration of, a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer’s situation would be materially affected by... the public officer’s commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others.\\"§281A.420(3) The law further defines commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others as \\"a commitment to a person who is a member of the public officer’s or employee’s household; is related to the public officer or employee by blood, adoption or marriage within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity; employs the public officer or employee or a member of the public officer’s or employee’s household; whom the public officer or employee has a substantial and continuing business relationship; or any other commitment or relationship that is substantially similar to a commitment or relationship described.\\"§281A.420(8)(a)-(e) Investigation of Michael Carrigan The Nevada Commission on Ethics, the body responsible for administering and enforcing the Ethics in Government law, opened an investigation into Michael Carrigan.§281A.280(1) In 2007, the Commission found that Michael Carrigan, an elected member of the City Council of Sparks, Nevada, had violated the law for not abstaining from voting on a hotel/casino project known as the Lazy 8 project.\\"Councilman Carrigan violated NRS 281.501, subsection 2, by not abstaining from voting on the Lazy 8 matter at the August 23, 2006 Council meeting.\\" p. 5 The Commission held that Carrigan's relationship with Carlos Vasquez—Carrigan's friend, former political advisor, and a paid consultant on the Lazy 8 project—was significant enough to warrant recusal under the ethics law.\\"The independence of judgement of a reasonable person in Councilman Carrigan's position would be affected by the commitment and relationship Councilman Carrigan shares with Mr. Vasquez. Therefore, the Commission ruled that during the August 23, 2006 Council meeting, when the Lazy 8 matter was heard, Councilman Carrigan had a commitment in a private capacity to the interest of Mr. Vasquez\\" p. 8 However, the Commission found that Carrigan's violation was not willful\\"Councilman Carrigan's violation… was not willful\\" p. 5 and that Carrigan did not use his position to secure or grant unwarranted privileges for Vasquez.\\"[Councilman Carrigan] did not use his position in the government to secure or grant unwarranted privileges, preferences, exemptions or advantages for Carlos Vasquez\\" p. 4 Carrigan petitioned for judicial review of the decision, which was denied by a district court but granted by the Supreme Court of Nevada.\\"Appeal from a district court order denying a petition for judicial review… reversed.\\" Opinion p. 1 Nevada Supreme Court Ruling In 2010, a majority of the Nevada Supreme Court held that voting by public officers on public issues is protected speech under the First Amendment and that the ethics law was unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.\\"we first conclude that voting by public officers on public issues is protected speech under the First Amendment… we conclude that NRS 281A.420(8)(e) is unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment\\" Opinion p. 3 The dissent argued that there was no previous decision that held that a public official voting was core political speech.\\"Before today, no published decision has held that an elected local official engages in core political speech when he or she votes\\" Dissent p. 1 The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in January 2011.\\"Petition GRANTED.\\" Entry for Jan 7 2011 Opinion of the Court Justice Scalia delivered the opinion for the Court. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion of the Court, which reversed the Supreme Court of Nevada, holding that the Ethics Act did not violate the First Amendment. Scalia wrote, \\"a 'universal and long-established' tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is constitutional\\"p. 4(citing Republican Party of Minnesota v. White) and that \\"the Nevada Supreme Court and Carrigan have not cited a single decision invalidating a generally applicable conflict-of-interest recusal rule-- and such rules and have been commonplace for over 200 years\\".p. 4 The Court held that the Nevada Supreme Court's belief that recusal rules violate legislators' First Amendment rights is inconsistent with long-standing traditions of Congress,\\"Within 15 years of the founding, both the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted recusal rules. \\" p. 4 the judiciary,\\"Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges also date back to the founding.\\" p. 5 and the States.\\"The Nevada Supreme Court’s belief that recusal rules violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also inconsistent with long-standing traditions in the States\\". p. 6 Further, the Court found that a legislator's vote is representative of the legislator's power, but rather belongs to the legislator's constituents.\\"The answer is that a legislator’s vote is the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature’s power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal. The legislative power thus committed is not personal to the legislator but belongs to the people; the legislator has no personal right to it.\\" p. 8 Therefore, restrictions on legislators' voting cannot infringe on the legislator's individual right to speech. The Court held that even if a vote could express personal views, the ethics law would still not be a violation of Carrigan's First Amendment rights because \\"this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.\\" p. 9 Kennedy's Concurrence In his concurrence, Justice Kennedy voiced concern that the ethics law had vague language\\"The application of the statute’s language to the case just supposed, and to any number of variations on the supposition, is not apparent.\\" p. 3 and was an invitation for selective enforcement.\\" A statute of this sort is an invitation to selective enforcement\\" p. 3 Kennedy joined the Court's opinion because \\"the act of casting an official vote is not itself protected by the Speech Clause of the First Amendment\\",p. 1 however he noted that \\"as the Court observes, however, the question whether Nevada’s recusal statute was applied in a manner that burdens the First Amendment freedoms discussed above is not presented in this case\\".p. 4 The Court did not consider the issue because such an argument was not raised in the Nevada Supreme Court case or Carrigan's brief in opposition to the writ of certiorari.\\"Carrigan raises two additional arguments in his brief: that Nevada’s catchall provision unconstitutionally burdens the right of association of officials and supporters, and that the provision is unconstitutionally vague. Whatever the merits of these arguments, we have no occasion to consider them. Neither was decided below: The Nevada Supreme Court made no mention of the former argument and said that it need not address the latter given its resolution of the overbreadth challenge... Nor was either argument raised in Carrigan’s brief in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari. Arguments thus omitted are normally considered waived\\" p. 11 Alito's Concurrence Justice Alito concurred in part and concurred in judgment.\\"JUSTICE ALITO, \\"concurring in part and concurring in the judgment\\" p. 1 Alito disagreed with the Court in finding that restrictions upon legislators' voting are not restrictions upon legislators' speech.\\"I concur in the judgment, but I do not agree with the opinion of the Court insofar as it suggests that restrictions upon legislators’ voting are not restrictions upon legislators’ speech.\\" p. 1 Alito argued that \\"the act of voting is not drained of its expressive content when the vote has a legal effect\\".p. 3 Despite disagreement on whether legislators' voting constitutes speech, Alito concurred in judgement based on the Court's arguments that legislative recusal laws have historically been long standing and not overturned.\\"In Part III of its opinion, the Court demonstrates that legislative recusal rules were not regarded during the founding era as impermissible restrictions on freedom of speech. On that basis, I agree that the judgment below must be reversed.\\" p. 3 Notes References   External links * 2011 in United States case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court 2011 in Nevada ","title":"Nevada Commission on Ethics v.

It began in the fall 2011 season in the northeast, midwest and mid-atlantic, and picks up again in the spring 2012 season for the southern teams, and concludes with the final four- style semifinals and championship games on April 29-30, 2012 in Glendale, CO. The final four are determined by regional tournaments. Salve Regina University of Newport, RI won the largest region - Region 1 (New England & New York) by topping its 46 rugby programs; Franciscan University of Steubenville, OH won Region 3 (Central US) by besting 45 rugby programs. The finalists from Regions 2 University of North Florida and 4 Cal-Maritime were determined in the spring rugby season. Of some note is the fact that Regions 2 and 4 have just over one-half the rugby programs within Regions 1 and 3. Region 2 appears to have only 24 rugby programs, but there is hope that 10 teams can be added from the remnants of the former USA Rugby South Division 3 college rugby program. Region 4 claims to have 31 rugby programs, however, at least four appear to be large state universities with well developed rugby programs (e.g., University of Nevada, Las Vegas which has 28,000 undergraduates - approximately 26,000 more students than Salve Regina or Franciscan). This regional participation disparity between conferences is attributable to two things: 1) efforts to place teams within geographical regions according to traditional season (spring vs. fall); and 2) conference re-alignment as encouraged by USA Rugby.

Early life Dunlop was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As a young child, music brought him to Buffalo, New York, and he lived and worked in Buffalo for the rest of his life. His family followed his aunt who had taken a job as a violinist with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. Dunlop found his first piano outside his house on the corner, discarded with only half the keys working. Dunlop gave his younger brother, Frankie Dunlop, his first drum lesson. Dunlop recalls, “We used the thin wood from the back of a chair as our sticks.” Younger brother Frankie went on to find fame as a drummer, playing with Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Big Jay McNeely, Lionel Hampton, and many other jazz greats, recording nearly one hundred sides during his career. Dunlop's trajectory followed a different course. Until 2011, he can be found only on one record, a blowsy rhythm and blues session from the late 1950s by Big Jay McNeely. For years Dunlop worked in Buffalo's steel mills and rail yards, yet his calling was the piano and he played in the clubs around Buffalo, including the Colored Musicians Club. Career On December 10, 2011, Dunlop released his debut album, Boyd's Blues produced by photojournalist, Brendan Bannon and music producer, Allen Farmelo. Boyd's Blues includes Dunlop on piano, backed by Sabu Adeyola on bass and Virgil Day on drums. The album debuted as the #1 jazz album on iTunes, and #28 on Billboard's Heatseeker chart. The Boyd Lee Dunlop Trio held a CD release performance at Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center on December 10, 2011 to a packed house. as pictured in The Buffalo News.  Recognition  Dunlop was profiled by Dan Barry (Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter) in The New York Times on December 9, 2011, with a short film (\\"An Unexpected Debut\\" ) by Todd Heisler (an Emmy and Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer) and Nick Harbaugh. Dunlop was also profiled by Scott Simon on NPR Weekend Edition on December 10, 2011. Dunlop was also profiled by writer Geoff Kelly for Buffalo, NY's Artvoice. On October 4, 2012 - Dunlop and his brother Frankie were inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of fame. Dunlop played a concert that evening in front of fellow inductees past and present.

It was built about 1849 and is a large three-story frame house with a notable clerestory roof, and two-story full length galleried porch. The home's interior woodwork is of a simple Greek Revival style. The former smokehouse has been converted to a chapel. The house is said to have originally stood on the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to its present location in 1846 at the direction of the Reverend R.H. Phillips. It has been used as both a school and private home. Reverend Phillips established a Female Seminary here between 1846 and 1850, then become a military institute for boys, and by the end of the 1850s it apparently had resumed its role as a Female Seminary. It was used by the 155th Pennsylvania Volunteers as a resting point for Union Troops marching toward the Battle of Antietam on September 16, 1862. The house would host a cotillion ball for Confederate soldiers before eventually becoming a field hospital during the civil war. During 2013 the building was purchased by new owners who have plans to restore it to its Civil War state. The house was listed as the Stancioff House on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The building is located on the Antietam Campaign Civil War Trail. Building and Rebuilding The Landon House was originally built in 1754 near the Rappahannock River in Virginia. In 1846 the building was transported by barge to Georgetown before being moved again via the Potomac to Point of Rocks. During the move the house was added onto with it eventually having 40 rooms. The property it currently sits on is about 6 acres in size. Denis Supercynski, with the Frederick County Planning Department, has said that even though some of the material for the building possibly came from other buildings, something which was common at the time, there was \\"no precise evidence\\" of the building having been moved. Uses over the years Over the years the Landon house has been used for a variety of purposes. When it was first built it was used as a silk mill. After being rebuilt it was used as a schoolhouse for girls. In 1854 it was transformed into the Landon Military Academy run by Robert C. Jones. The building was the site of a notable ball in 1862. The building was used as a field hospital. Civil War At the time of the dance the building was known as the Landon Female Academy. On 8 September 1862 Confederate Gen. J. E. B. Stuart was walking, after having eaten with a local family at their invitation, when he discovered Landon House, (at the time known as the Landon Female Academy). The building was unoccupied at the time. While exploring the house, Stuart discovered a ballroom on the east end. Stuart felt the need for a break from the war and decided to hold a ball there that night to give his men and himself a rest from the war. The ballroom was decorated with flags and roses for the ball. Music was provided by the 18th Mississippi Cavalry's regimental band. Ladies living in Urbana were invited to attend. The ball became known as the Sabers and Roses Ball. During the ball a report came in that Union cavalry were nearby in Hyattstown and heading towards Urbana. The festivities stopped and Stuart and his men left to the picket posts in Hyattstown that were threatened by Union cavalry. When they arrived, they discovered that the Union soldiers had already been repulsed by the 1st North Carolina Infantry and returned to the ball. By the time they had returned most of the ladies had left. Ladies were invited to return to the ball and the ball resumed. After the ball the building was used as a field hospital after the ball. According to Michael Kurtianyk, both Confederate soldiers and Union soldiers made \\"lightning sketches\\" on the walls of the hospital. The Confederate soldiers are said to have drawn CSA President Jefferson Davis and Stuart. Union soldiers using the hospital later on 16 September 1862 drew Abe Lincoln twice as large as the Confederate drawings. They signed their drawing. These drawings can still be seen on the walls of the house today. Modern Usage and Future Following the Civil War, the abandoned military academy was purchased by Sam Hinks who was once mayor of Baltimore. At his death, it was occupied by his descendants until purchased by Lt. Col. Luke Tiernan Brien, a Confederate veteran and an officer in Gen. Stuart's division, who lived there with his wife until 1912. The property was acquired in 1946 by Mr. & Mrs. Ivan Stancioff. He arrived in America with his wife Marion and their children in 1946. They purchased the home in April 1947 and it remained in the Stancioff family until July 1997. The house was added to the National Historic Register in 1974. The building was then purchased by Kevin Dolan and used as an event venue and hosted Civil War re-enactments. In 2013 the Landon House was purchased by Dr. Praveen Bularum, Dr. Rohit Khirbat and Chakri Katepalli, who have plans to restore the building to the condition it was in during the Civil War, for $850,000. They plan to open the house by March 2014. The house will be used as an event center and there are plans to add a bed and breakfast. Preservation of the building has been supported by the Heart of the Civil War Heritage Area. Cultural References In season 5 episode 9 of My Ghost Story a story is told about Landon house.

History  The first port development in Port-au-Prince (Fort Islet) dates back to colonial times. In fact, it was backfilling a rocky reef, in order to provide for the establishment of a defense system for ships sheltered in the bay, to protect them against attack ships belonging to other powers, pirates and privateers plying the region.

The whorls of the protoconch are deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The six whorls of the teleoconch are strongly tabulately shouldered at the summit, flat in the middle, and sloping suddenly toward the suture. They are ornamented by slender axial ribs, of which 15 occur upon the second and 18 upon the remaining whorls. In addition to the axial ribs, the whorls are marked between the sutures by two strong spiral keels, one of which is situated at the angle of the shoulder, the other at the posterior termination of the anterior third between the sutures. The junctions of the axial ribs and spiral keels are very slightly nodulous. The sutures are deeply channeled. The periphery of the body whorl are well rounded, marked by a spiral keel. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by two spiral keels, which divide the space between the peripheral keel and the umbilical area into three equal parts, and the continuation of the axial ribs, which are fainter on the base than on the spire. The aperture is ovate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, rendered angular by the keels. The columella is slender, decidedly curved, reinforced by the base.

The mine accessed seams found in the Denbighshire Coalfield. History The Wrexham area in the 19th Century was highly industrialised. At the peak there were 38 different collieries operating in the area, each producing coal totalling over 2.5 million tonnes annually to the numerous brickworks and steelworks in the area, including Brymbo Steel Works and Shotton Steel Works.Wrexham Council 19th century When the colliery first opened it was named Glan-yr-Afon () Colliery. Operated by Bersham Coal Company, the first shaft was sunk in 1864 on the site of a brickworks immediately adjacent to the Shrewsbury to Chester railway line, however due to difficulties the pit did not reach the main coal seams and the site was left abandoned until 1871 when the pit was deepened by new owners, the Barnes family of Liverpool; coal production started in 1874 with two shafts; No.1 at a diameter of 10 feet and depth of 420 yards, and No.2 shaft at a diameter of 12 feet and a depth of 421 yards. Gravestone of miner who died in the Bersham Colliery explosion August 1880. St Mary's Parish Church, Chirk The colliery worked for six years without major incident until 1880, when a major underground explosion killed 9 men, among them the colliery manager, William Pattison. In 1896, there were 711 men working at both shafts.Bersham Colliery Rhostyllen 20th century There was further growth at the colliery, with 848 men working there by 1908, and 878 by 1918. As with most mining communities, sons followed their fathers into the mines; and the local communities of Rhostyllen, Rhosllannerchrugog and Johnstown grew in size around the coal industry in the area. By 1903, the Wrexham and District Electric Tramways ran from Johnstown to Wrexham through Rhostyllen, connecting the major mining villages with Wrexham General railway station and the town centre. Another explosion killed a number of men in 1909.Welsh Coal Mine Disasters This was the final major incident at Bersham, barring another in 1933, when the timber headgear burned to the ground. Replacement headgear which still stands today was purchased and moved from the nearby Gatewen Colliery at Broughton, Wrexham. Before 1935, mining at the colliery had been done by hand, with mechanisation appearing in the mine at this time. As the miners at Bersham had no experience with the machinery, miners from other local mines that did were brought in to assist, causing friction between the two groups.A history of Bersham Colliery Mining was difficult in Bersham, with seams less than 2 feet high, and a geological faultline, the Wrexham- Staffordshire faultline, running nearby meant that seams abruptly stopped. Showmines of Great Britain In 1923, the mine employed 808 men, and this decreasing to 800 in 1945. Ownership during this time appeared to jump between Broughton & Plas Power Coal Co. Ltd and Bersham Colliery Company Ltd, with ownership changing between the two three times, with Broughton & Plas Power Coal Co. Ltd finally retaining ownership of the mine up until nationalisation in 1947. Nationalisation Erddig HallOn 1 January 1947, along with the rest of the coal industry, Bersham was nationalised and placed under the control of the National Coal Board. The colliery was immediately modernised, completed in 1954 with a new block housing new pithead baths, canteen and offices designed to cater for up to 1,100 men. The pit ponies at Bersham numbering near 100, which had been underground for most, if not all of their lives, were retired in the same year and replaced with mechanical traction. The colliery reached its largest size in 1958, with 1,011 recorded at the site. BBC News In 1961, more mechanisation was brought into the mine, including conveyor belts to convey coal to the surface faster. With the expanding tunnels into the surrounding area, care had to be taken to avoid subsidence. To this end a large pillar of solid coal was left untouched to allow the nearby home of the Yorke Family, Erddig Hall to remain out of danger. Unfortunately this did not prevent subsidence and in 1973, subsidence of 5 feet occurred, leaving the house structurally unsound. Eventually the owner of the estate, the last Squire Yorke had to move out of Erddig and left the property to the National Trust. The National Coal Board paid the trust compensation of £120,000 to stabilise the building through underpinning. Closure Bersham Colliery was closed with the loss of 480 jobs in December 1986 due to unfavourable economic conditions and loss of markets. The large amounts of equipment still underground meant that salvage operations continued into 1987 however a great deal was left in place. Preservation Most of the surface buildings were demolished shortly after with the main exceptions of the No.2 headgear with its wheel, and its engine house complete with electric winding gear. Other remaining buildings have remained as part of a small industrial estate. The site is owned by Wrexham County Borough Council. In 1999, the Shropshire Mines Trust arranged with the council to clean the site up and clean the remaining buildings with a view to create a Museum. They created the Bersham Colliery Trust to do this; however after clearing the site and moving large amounts of mining artifacts to the site, they were disbanded with a lack of local interest. Bersham Colliery Tip The tip created by the Colliery.The most prominent landmark left by the colliery is that of its spoil tip, known as Bersham Tip. In 2003, a company called Bersham Glenside Ltd announced controversial plans to remove the tip and sell it to the building industry.BBC News, 18 Feb 2003 Mining waste tip faces remova Wrexham County Borough Council eventually refused planning permission for this to take place, and Cadw recommended the tip remain. However, upon appeal to the Welsh Assembly Government, this decision was overturned and removal of the tip is now likely to take place. Welsh Assembly Government Appeal Bersham Glenside Ltd have stated they will contribute money to the heritage of the colliery and will keep part of the tip that has become heavily wooded, closest to the colliery.

Based on the successful 1899 play of the same name by Augustus Thomas, the film was directed by Albert Parker. Despite mixed reviews and its release near the end of the Spanish flu epidemic, the film prospered at the box office largely on the strength of its star's drawing power. Arizona is presumed lost. Plot Denton (Fairbanks) is a lieutenant in the U.S. Cavalry regiment commaded by Colonel Benham (Frederick Burton). Benham is married to the much younger Estrella (Kathleen Kirkham), the daughter of wealthy rancher Canby (Theodore Roberts). Estrella has a sister, Bonita (Marjorie Daw), with whom Denton falls in love. Denton discovers an affair between Estrella and Captain Hodgeman (Harry Northrup). In his effort to break up the affair, Denton follows Estrella to her room where Benham catches them and misunderstands what he sees. Denton honorably keeps Estrella's secret and in consequence must resign in disgrace. Canby hires Denton as foreman of his ranch. Denton's relationship with Bonita is endangered by Hodgeman who lies to Canby about him. Hodgeman's grudge against Denton leads to a fight between the two during which Hodgeman is shot and mortally wounded. Denton is suspected, but a cowboy, Tony (Raymond Hatton), declares that he fired the shot to retaliate for Hodgeman's dealings with the girl that he loves. In the end, Estrella reveals the truth about her own indiscretion, enabling Denton and Bonita to marry with her family's blessing as well as a happy ending for Benham and Estrella. Cast *Douglas Fairbanks as Lieutenant Denton *Theodore Roberts as Canby *Kate Price as Mrs. Canby *Frederick Burton as Colonel Benham *Harry S.

Some of the cast recruited for the film were also associated with the play: Theodore Roberts originated the role of Canby on the stage; Frank Campeau was well known for portraying Tony. Allan Dwan had directed Fairbanks in several successful pictures since signing with Fairbanks' studio in 1917; he was slated to direct Arizona as well, but in mid-production Dwan departed the picture and the Fairbanks company. Recently signed by Fairbanks to direct, Albert Parker took over direction of Arizona. The extent of Dwan's contribution, and how much remained in the final film, is not known; advertisements for the movie do not mention a director and contemporary reviews only name Parker. Besides directorial troubles, other issues likely interfered with the production of Arizona. Fairbanks was active in the war effort and production was interrupted by his participation in a Liberty Loan drive that took him to Washington, D.C., New York City, and several cities across the South. The Spanish flu epidemic caused a four-week suspension of production on 60 percent of California films and may also have disrupted Arizona. Exteriors were filmed in Arizona.

Mason Seen Here at the Typewriter Release Arizona was released in December 1918 and fared well at the box office overall. At the time of its release, theaters around the U.S. were just beginning to reopen after forced closures due to the Spanish flu epidemic. Many reviews focused on the effect Fairbanks had on the well-known material; some were favorable. The New York Times observed: Arizona' in the hands of some other actor might have become just another screen melodrama ... but with Fairbanks in the leading role, it has become an enjoyable comedy in which the athletic stunts of the star play a conspicuous and entertaining ... part.\\" The Variety review repeated this opinion almost word for word. The review in The Billboard offered a similar point of view and added that the audience \\"echoed with spontaneous laughter in response to the energetic portrayal\\". P. S. Harrison of Motion Picture News and Edward Weitzel of Moving Picture World were less complimentary. Harrison opined that when Fairbanks attempted heavy drama, both \\"the actor's ability to entertain and the dignity of the drama [suffer]\\". Weitzel found Fairbanks' characterization of Denton lacking: \\"The athletic star has, as usual, put his own personality into the picture, and acts Douglas Fairbanks with his customary life-like perfection.\\" Wid's Daily rated elements of the picture as \\"fair\\", \\"unobjectionable\\", and \\"nothing to brag about\\", and called the star \\"same old Doug\\"; only the supporting cast, Roberts in particular, was judged \\"first-rate\\".

Its aim was to limit the expansion of Austria and Russia at the cost of the Ottoman Empire in the context of the Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791) and the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). Genesis Prussia and Great Britain were concerned that Austria and Russia, having acquired new territories in the Black Sea region, would threaten the European balance of power. In the United Kingdom, this policy was advocated by William Pitt the Younger and supported by the British ambassador in Russia, Charles Whitworth, and British ambassador to Prussia, Joseph Ewart. Pitt was also concerned with a deficit in foreign trade with Russia, which Britain had, and intended to reduce it by increasing import to other countries in the region (such as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), and shifting the exports from Russia to those countries as well. Great Britain did not want war, in so much as it would be content if Russia would retreat from its war with the Ottomans without any territorial changes, but it realized this was an unlikely outcome. Triple Alliance Earlier in 1788, in April, Prussia also secured a credit in case of a war with Russia from the Netherlands. The Anglo-Prusso-Netherland coalition became known as the Triple Alliance.

He died in April 2020, a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early years Lucas was born in Boston in 1934. He grew up in South Boston and attended South Boston High School. He was a star player in football, basketball, and baseball at South Boston High. In 1951, he was named to the all-conference and all-district teams and was selected by The Boston Globe as one of the city's two outstanding linemen. Boston College He enrolled at Boston College where he played college football at the end position from 1953 to 1955. Coach Mike Holovak in November 1955 said of Lucas: \\"Lucas is a wonderful football player. Really great. Does everything well -- he blocks, he is a fine pass receiver, he is great on defense. And never opens his mouth. Just does a wonderful job every time he's in a football game.\\" Lucas received several honors while playing for Boston College. He won the school's Edward J.

However, his professional football career was delayed by two years' service in the United States Marine Corps. He played on the Quantico Marines Devil Dogs football team in 1956 and 1957. Pittsburgh Steelers Lucas completed his military service in 1958. The Pittsburgh Steelers acquired rights to Lucas from the Bears in September 1958. Lucas appeared in four games for the 1958 Steelers, but a knee injury and surgery sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Lucas attempted a comeback with the Steelers in 1959, but he was cut in late September as the team reduced to the league's 35-player limit. Philadelphia Eagles Lucas signed with the Washington Redskins in February 1960. He was then traded by the Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles in September 1960. Lucas played at the tight end position for the 1960 Philadelphia Eagles team, appearing in all 12 regular-season games principally as a blocker on punt and kickoff returns and as a tackler on kickoffs. The 1960 Eagles compiled a 10–2 record and defeated the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game. Lucas appeared in the first quarter of the championship game, but missed the rest of the game with a bruised knee. He received an NFL championship ring for his role on the 1960 Eagles. Lucas returned to the Eagles in 1961, appearing in all 14 games with eight pass receptions, five of them resulting in touchdowns. He set a record for the most touchdowns in NFL history by a player with eight or fewer receptions in a year. Lucas remained with the Eagles in 1962, appearing in nine games, including four as a starter.

The majority of it is in the municipality of Roggentin. For a region so near the coast, it is very hilly, hence the name Rostock Switzerland. The Kösterbeck is a small river, that runs through a deep incision that emphasises the height differences. The valley of the Kösterbeck lies two metres above sea level, its highest elevation is 66 metres. It has changed its name several times: before 1900 it was known as the Bäukenbarg (i.e. Buchenberg or \\"beech hill\\"), during the German Reich it was the Kaiserberg (\\"Emperor Hill\\") and in GDR times, Freundschaftshöhe (\\"Friendship Heights\\"). Settlement This area was already densely populated by Slavic times (800–1000). Witnesses to that are the well preserved Slavic castle ramparts near Fresendorf (on the Schlossberg or \\"castle hill\\") as well as a neighbouring tumulus. Since the late Middle Ages this region has been largely unforested and was used for centuries as pasture land. As a result of constant grazing the landscape was kept open and has been colonised predominantly by drought-loving, grazing-resistant plants that need lots of warmth and light and by animals that are well-adapted to the environment. Today the villages of Unterkösterbeck (in the Kösterbeck valley), Oberkösterbeck and Fresendorf in the municipality of Roggentin and Beselin in the municipality of Dummerstorf lie on the edge of the area.  Tourism  Previously there was an observation tower here, from where there were views of Rostock and the surrounding area and, on clear days, even as far as Warnemünde. In Rostock Switzerland there was once the northernmost ski lift in the East Germany. Remains of the ski lift can still be found between Unterkösterbeck and Beselin.

Career Leo attended Harvard College where he played football, baseball and ran track. Leo is the only Massachusetts High School football athlete to earn All-Scholastic honors for three years. He did so despite missing half his senior year to a separated shoulder early in the season against Arlington High School. The Boston Globe named him the third best high school football player in Massachusetts history in 2015. A Sports Illustrated college football feature in its 10/31/1966 issue praised Leo and included a photo and quotations from an interview with him after an important Harvard victory against Dartmouth. Leo earned All-Ivy honors, was named the top back in New England and was an honorable mention All-American. He is a member of the Harvard Hall of Fame. Leo was drafted by the Boston Patriots in the first combined NFL/AFL draft in 1967. He remains the earliest Harvard player drafted by the Patriots, taken as the Patriots' 5th draft pick in the seventh round, and is still the only Harvard player to score a touchdown for the Patriots. After serving a stint in the military, Leo joined the team toward the end of the season in 1967. His first game was a memorable one. On national television against the Buffalo Bills, Leo was the primary kick and punt returner for the Patriots. He electrified the crowd at Fenway Park with one of the top 10 longest punt returns in the American Football League that season, a 42-yard sprint past the entire Bills coverage team, before slipping on the mud in Fenway's baseball infield dirt, inside the ten yard line, while evading the Bills punter. His first professional reception was a 25-yard touchdown in the final moments of the game. The following season, during the Patriots training camp at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Leo impressed the coaching staff with his speed as compared to the Patriots latest draft picks. The training camp issue of Pats Patter (the Patriots official newsletter) featured a photo of Leo exhibiting his heroics for the Patriots at Fenway Park in that late season game with the caption \\"Leo exhibits his breakaway potential against the Buffalo Bills,\\" along with a brief piece describing his amazing speed. He started camp that year back at his college position as a tailback. Indeed, he was listed as second of five players on the depth chart in the team's official 1968 Patriots Media Guide at the halfback position. During the long preseason (which included games against both AFL and NFL teams), the coaching staff decided to move him to receiver again, with great success. He had a productive game at that position against the Saints in a game played at Tulane University. Against the Jets in a game in Richmond, Virginia, he led the team both in pass receptions and receiving yards, and was moved to the starting lineup the following week against the Dolphins. He concluded his success at flanker by scoring in an AFL v. NFL game against the Philadelphia Eagles at his old stomping grounds, Harvard Stadium, and serving as the team's primary kick and punt returner. The promotional materials for that game featured Leo prominently with a photo and article noting how well he played in when he joined the club the prior year and predicting that we would see \\"quite a bit of action\\" at both flanker back and halfback in the 1968 season. However, various injuries held him back as other veteran receivers pushed for more playing time, but he maintained his starting spot on the punt and kick return squads as the regular season began. After returning punts and kickoffs in the first game of the regular season in Buffalo, the following week Leo suffered a serious injury in a practice scrimmage inflicted by a teammate and was hospitalized for four days. As a result of a bye week for the Patriots in week two of the regular season, the team had a week layoff before their next game, and was required to make roster moves because their primary punter was hurt as well. The coaching staff asked Leo to accept a temporary assignment to the taxi squad as he recovered from his injury. Leo refused, and retired from the game. After football After the 1968 season, Leo decided to return to academics, attending law school in the Boston area and practicing law for many years thereafter.

Apart from theology, he was, together with Polanský Jan Nepomuk (1723 – 1776), active in the field of physics, researching lightning and thunder, colors, phases of Venus, primary and secondary rainbow, and other.

At the University of Olomouc, the struggle was taking place particularly between the conservative Jesuits and a proponent of enlightenment ideas Josef Vratislav Monse. Polanský's book Manudictio sacerdotis ad com-modissime subeundum examen pro approbatione et jurisdictione, printed in 1762, was banned in 1769.

It was published in Mexico through Editorial Joaquín Mortiz. It is the first installment in the Álvaro Mendiola trilogy, which also includes Count Julian and Juan the Landless. Plot summary A man returns to Spain from exile in France and finds himself repelled by Francoist Spain and drawn to the world of Muslim culture. In this novel, Juan Goytisolo, one of Spain's most celebrated novelists, takes the voice of those Spaniards who grew up during the Spanish Civil War, when the caudillo Franco. The narrator discovers, upon his return, that he is torn between the Islamic and European worlds around him, and in the end he finds that none of the two religions give him satisfaction.\\"Marks of Identity\\" at Amazon. The story of Marks of Identity spans from the present time, 1963, when the protagonist Alvaro returns to Spain, after many years of exile in France, which was something he entirely imposed on himself. The parts of the story set in the present are however not the most prominent in this story. The greater part of the novel consists of episodes from Alvaro's younger years: his childhood, days as a student at university, and his time abroad. It is also a story of his family history and the lives of his friends. These are mixed and matched with a variety of seemingly \\"historical\\" documents — police reports, falange propaganda leaflets and tourist brochures etc. — and with wholly other chronicly correct stories of prison inmates, peasants and workers of that period in time. The story is said to have many autobiographical elements. The flashbacks start when Alvaro flips through a family photo album while listening to Mozart, and remembers parts of his childhood days in Barcelona. He remembers his harsh Catholic upbringing, how the whole family fled to France during the Spanish Civil War, how they returned under Franco and the revolt that ensued. While attending the funeral of one of his university lecturers, again in present time, he remembers his student days and his coming of age while being introduced to sex, politics and extremist thinkers. On several similar occasions Alvaro is reminded of his life up to that point, and many memories have connections to the political climate in Spain during the most riotous years preceding and following the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist State. Alvaro's own history is contrasted with his friend Antonio's - a man recently released from prison on parole, living in Andalusia near the place where they both grew up. This part of the story is clattered with and fractioned by numerous police reports regarding the close watch on politically active extremists. The story also contains moments of romance, evoked when Alvaro looks through an atlas with his wife, Dolores. It tells of their first meeting in Paris, their travels through Europe together in Switzerland and Italy, of happiness but mostly of troubles and periods of disillusionment. Alvaro also reflects on what has become of his home region, Andalusia in Spain, and the tourist industry that has besieged the coastline, in comparison to the roots of the land, beginning in Cuba and slavery.Danny Yee, \\"Marks of Identity\\" review. Theme and structure The structure of the story is a somewhat shattered and discontinuous one. There are also whole sections entirely without punctuation or where the author has used blank spaces as an alternative. The story is not hard to read though, once the reader has grown accustomed to the structure. Marks of Identity is a journey through the landscape of Spanish society in the quarter of a century that follows the Spanish Civil War. It is made by an individual who has been torn between Spain and exile existence and who is constantly haunted by the memories of his family's history and fate. The story includes this individuals view on political repression, economic boom and effects of tourism in a Spain that seems very far from Franco's days.

It was founded during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as large groups of Bosnian refugees settled in the United States. Zambak started as a newsletter published by the Information Center of Bosnia Herzegovina in Chicago, and one year later it became an independent magazine publishing monthly issues until 2008. History Zambak reported on political, economic, and cultural developments globally, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as on the activities of the local Bosnian community in Chicago. The magazine's mission was to inform and support the process of integration of the thousands of newly arrived emigres from the conflict-ridden Balkan region. It promoted strong links between local small-businesses and the community. Zambak was committed to upholding and promoting the belief of a united and multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina by fostering a platform for diverse political exchanges. Zambak's director and owner was Ismet Berbić. Its editors, over the years, include: Bakir Viteškić, Mensur Seferović, Esad Boškailo, Amir Berberkić, and Mugdim Karabeg. Regular contributors from Bosnia and Herzegovina were notable writers and journalists such as Mile Stojić and Gojko Berić, amongst others. Zambak was recognized for its particular attention to arts and culture and design and illustrations. The magazine's use of provocative, satirical and politically engaged covers reflected the pertinent themes of each issue. Zambak was art-directed by brothers Amir Berbić (1998–2004) and Isak Berbić (2004–2008). Zambak was distributed free of charge, which was made possible by the financial support of local businesses. In 2008, after 105 published issues, Zambak ceased publication amidst difficult financial circumstances. Throughout its history, Zambak's contributors published stories on politics, war, immigrant life in the US, culture, arts, and education. Name The name Zambak (Lily) is in reference to the fleur-de-lis symbol, lilium bosniacum, on the Bosnian medieval coat of arms which was revitalized in the early 1990s Bosnian independence movements.

He moved from an initial career in theatre to art in his mid- thirties, was an autodidactic as a painter but had from his very early years a natural talent in painting and drawing. Michael Green with large textured oil on canvas from his Yellow Space Series. He lives in London and in Molini di Triora. Life and career Early life Green was born in Nyasaland, East Africa (now Malawi) where he spent his first seven and a half years before coming to England for his Public School education. At the age of 15 he was awarded the Vicountess Northcliffe Scholarship at RADA (London) and initially worked in the theatre and moved to New York City when he was 23. Career After theatre work in Manhattan, he moved into product and decorative design work. Only at the age of 36 did he realise that he had made the wrong career choice at the age of 15. He then decided that he had to be a professional painter and quickly moved from representative painting to abstraction. He was Artist in Residence at the Indiana State University (1978), giving master classes on advanced painting and lectures on colour theory. In 1986, he gave up his New York studio and moved back to London. He set up a studio in the old Spratt's Dog Biscuit factory, where he began his first sculptures. Style He moved into abstraction soon after working figuratively, searching for a personal visual language and set up his first studio in SoHo while still only an avant-garde artist area. Established second studio in Northern Italy, thus preserving a 'European' ethos. His pre-occupation as an abstract painter for four decades has been with space. Not the astronaut's space but the space of the mind, an intellectual infinity. Lacking nature's spatial indicators (sky, perspective, horizon) idiomatic alternatives were needed. Thus his extensive earlier 'Bridge Series', oils and drawings - the metaphorical 'bridge' was his spatial ploy, creating the spatial tension that in reality is elemental to any actual bridge: space, structure and tension. He took up sculpture, concurrently with painting, on moving back to London in 1986, after a quarter century as a 'New York painter'. For him, space automatically is intrinsic to sculpture's dimensionality, so the ingredient of tension became prime: tensile linear balancing, contrasting textural disparities (shiny new, time-worn old), stressing the emotional stretch of a work. The current long on-going 'Painted Drawing Series' (works large and small, canvas oils, works on paper) hopefully engages the viewer more directly with the creative self via emotional painted gestures, the 'drawing' of the brush. Influences His peers of influence range from John Sell Cotman to Richard Diebenkorn.

Gill), a closeted gay former pro-athlete is in a \\"marriage of convenience\\" with Mary (Stephanie Kirchen), college friend, a bisexual woman who has married him to please her mother and not be cut off from finances and inheritance. But there is also an agreement that each is free to have sex partners on the side. Mary isn't really that interested in sex, while Joe cruises parks for other guys. Even though she's not supposed to be, Mary is jealous and resentful of the men Joe picks up, but mostly she is afraid that he might someday fall in love with one of them and decide to end their sham marriage. Things get edgy when Joe is attracted to Thomas (Keith Bearden), a handsome landscaper who came to give an estimate. Joe gets mad at Mary because she followed him in the park, he storms out, checks into a gay-owned motel and calls Thomas. Meanwhile, Mary is also telling the same story over wine to her college friend, Aura (Jill Kocalis).

The title refers to Julian, count of Ceuta. The book was published in Mexico by Editorial Joaquín Mortiz. It is the second installment in the Álvaro Mendiola trilogy, which also includes Marks of Identity and Juan the Landless. The English title does not have the force of the Spanish original. Don Julián (a mythical figure) is one of the villains of traditional Spanish history, who facilitated the Moorish (Islamic) conquest of Spain in the eighth century, to avenge the alleged sexual abuse of one of his daughters by Rodrigo, the last Visigothic king. Goytisolo's title proclaims that this book intends to defend or vindicate Don Julián: that we should celebrate what he did, rather than condemn him. The book is anti-patriotic, anti-Catholic, and anti-Spanish, at least of Spain as it viewed and celebrated itself during the Francoist State. (Until Francisco Franco's death in 1975, the novel could not be published in Spain.) The Roman philosopher Seneca, a national hero, is singled out for particularly harsh criticism and satire. In an amusement park the narrator enters a large model of the vagina of Isabel la Católica, Spain's most Catholic queen. He delights in Don Julián's facilitating the rape of Spanish virgins by the invading Moors. At one point he considers how to infect the whole country with syphilis. The protagonist, who lives in Morocco (as did Goytisolo), seeks revenge on Spain, the country that cast him out, by destroying its literature, religion, cultural beliefs, myths, and language.

As to Henry Ford, words are inadequate to express my feelings. I can only say to you that, in the fullest and richest meaning of the term—he is my friend.\\"Douglas Brinkley, Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress (New York: Viking, 2003), 377 The preceding year had similarly been filled with smaller-scale demonstrations of the influence of Edison's innovations: electrical displays across the country; Broadway signs temporarily darkened to show the difference their light made in the atmosphere of cities across the country; and an \\"open season\\" for biographies, newspaper articles, and commemorations of the inventor.\\"Science: Golden Jubilee,\\" Time Magazine, May 27, 1929, accessed October 25, 2011, The Thomas Edison Institute As part of the celebration, Ford formally dedicated Greenfield Village to his friend Thomas Edison, a man who once encouraged a young Henry Ford to pursue the creation of a gasoline powered automobile.

He was an associate professor at the Department of Philosophy of Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb where he taught logic and the philosophy of language, being employed there since 1975. Švob has written two books and published numerous scientific papers in the academic field of logic. He was greatly influenced by the analytic philosophy and particularly by the philosophers Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Education and academic career Švob was born on 29 May 1947 in Zagreb, then part of Yugoslavia. There he finished his primary school education and graduated from gymnasium. He then enrolled at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb where he got his Master of Arts in philosophy and English language in 1971. The same year he managed to get employed at the Department of Philosophy of the same faculty. During the academic year 1973–1974 Švob spent six months as a research fellow at the University of Oxford. He also had shorter visits at the universities in Austria, West Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and China. In 1988 he got his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the following year he was selected to the position of an assistant professor, and was further promoted to the position of associate professor in 2001. He has been teaching logic and philosophy of language there since 1975. He was also a guest lecturer at the University of Vienna, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Peking University, Hokkaido University, University of Tokyo, and Kyoto University. Švob was the leader of scientific research project Logic, Universal Language and the Philosophy of Language (Croatian: Logika, univerzalni jezik i filozofija jezika) of the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia. Published work Švob published scientific papers in leading philosophical journals, in particular the journal of Praxis School, Filozofska istraživanja, SOL, and, most notably, Acta Analytica. His first book, titled Frege: Pojmovno pismo (English: Frege: Conceptual Notation), was published in 1992. Od slike do igre (English: From Image to Game) was a second book written by Švob, published in 2009. The book is consolidated of articles which differ by subject and time when they were written, though they all mainly focus on the work of three philosophers: Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The focal point of the book, however, is the shift in Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, or the transition from the early to late Wittgenstein.

Basic Types - by operating principle The inside of an extremely large butterfly valve Duplex ball valve Three check valves in corrosion-resistant Hastelloy Stainless steel gate valve Valves can be categorized into the following types, based on their operating mechanism. * Ball valve, for on/off control without pressure drop. Ideal for quick shut-off, since a 90° turn completely shuts- off, compared to multiple 360° turns for other manual valves. * Butterfly valve, for on/off flow control in large diameter pipes. * Choke valve, raises or lowers a solid cylinder placed around or inside a second cylinder with holes or slots. Used for high pressure drops found in oil and gas wellheads, not to be confused with engine choke valve. * Diaphragm or Membrane valve, controls flow by movement of a diaphragm. Used in pharmaceutical applications. * Gate valve, mainly for on/off control, with low pressure drop. * Globe valve, good for regulating flow. Uses a cylinder movement over a seat. * Knife valve, similar to a gate valve, but usually more compact. Often used for slurries or powders on/off control. * Needle valve for accurate flow control. * Pinch valve, for slurry flow regulation and control. * Piston valve, for regulating fluids that carry solids in suspension. * Plug valve, slim valve for on/off control but with some pressure drop. * Solenoid valve, an electrically actuated valve for hydraulic or pneumatic fluid control * Spool Valve, for hydraulic control, similar to the choke valve Basic Types - by function Valves can be categorized also based on their function * Check valve or non-return valve, allows the fluid to pass in one direction only. * Flow control valve, to maintain and control a variable flow rate through the valve * Poppet valve, commonly used in piston engines to regulate the fuel mixture intake and exhaust * Pressure Reducing Valve, to regulate the pressure of the fluid. * Safety valve or relief valve: operates automatically at a set pressure to correct a potentially dangerous situation, typically over-pressure * Sampling valve Specific types These are more specific types of valves, used only in particular fields or applications. Often they are subcategories of the classification by operating principle and by function. * Aspin valve: a cone-shaped metal part fitted to the cylinder head of an engine * Ball cock: often used as a water level controller (cistern) * Bibcock: provides a connection to a flexible hosepipe * Blast valve: prevents rapid overpressuring in a fallout shelter or a bunker * Boston valve: three-part two-port check valve used on inflatable boats, air mattresses, airbeds etc.; available in two sizes, normal and small * Cock: colloquial term for a small valve or a stopcock * Ceramic Disc valve, used mainly in high duty cycle applications or on abrasive fluids. Ceramic disc can also provide Class IV seat leakage * Choke valve, Butterfly valve used to limit air intake in internal combustion engine. Not to be confused with choke valves used in industrial flow control. * Clapper valve: a type of check valve used in the Siamese fire appliance to allow only 1 hose to be connected instead of two (the clapper valve blocks the other side from leaking out). * Demand valve: on a diving regulator * Double beat valve * Double check valve * Duckbill valve * Fill and drain valve: a valve used in space and missile industry which achieves extremely tight leakage, while providing redundant inhibits against external leakage * Flapper valve * Flow divider valve: a valve providing a plurality of output flows from a single fluid source * Flutter (Heimlich) valve: a specific one-way valve used on the end of chest drain tubes to treat a pneumothorax * Foot valve: a check valve on the foot of a suction line to prevent backflow * Four-way valve: was used to control the flow of steam to the cylinder of early double- acting steam engines * Freeze seal/Freeze plug: in which freezing and melting the fluid creates and removes a plug of frozen material acting as the valve * Gas pressure regulator regulates the flow and pressure of a gas * Heart valve: regulates blood flow through the heart in many organisms * Hydrodynamic vortex valve: a passive flow control valve that uses hydrodynamic forces to regulate flow * Larner–Johnson Valve: needle control valve often in large sizes used in water supply systems * Leaf valve: one-way valve consisting of a diagonal obstruction with an opening covered by a hinged flap * Line blind valve: a thin sheet oriented perpendicular to the pipe. The sheet has a solid end and a flow-through end; sliding it from one position to the other opens or stops the flow. Also called sliding blind valve. *Outflow valve: regulates flow and pressure, part of cabin pressurization. * Pilot valve: regulates flow or pressure to other valves * Pinch valve, \\"beach ball valve\\": simple, single- part two-port check valve made from soft plastic and molded on to inflatable units such as beach balls, air mattresses, water wings; can be inflated by pump or by mouth. * Plunger valve: To regulate flow while lowering the pressure * Poppet valve and sleeve valve: commonly used in piston engines to regulate the fuel mixture intake and exhaust * Pressure regulator or pressure reducing valve (PRV): reduces pressure to a preset level downstream of the valve * Pressure sustaining valve, or back-pressure regulator: maintains pressure at a preset level upstream of the valve * Presta, Schrader or Dunlop valves are used to hold the air in bicycle tires * Reed valve: consists of two or more flexible materials pressed together along much of their length, but with the influx area open to allow one-way flow, much like a heart valve * Regulator: used in SCUBA diving equipment and in gas cooking equipment to reduce the high pressure gas supply to a lower working pressure * Rocker valve * Rotolock valve * Rotary valves and piston valves: parts of brass instruments used to change their pitch * Rupture disc: a one time use replaceable valve for rapid pressure relief, used to protect piping systems from excessive pressure or vacuum; more reliable than a safety valve * Saddle valve: where allowed, is used to tap a pipe for a low-flow need * Schrader valve: used to hold the air inside automobile tires * Slide valve: used in early steam engines to control admission and emission of steam from the piston. * Slide gate valve: Slide Gate Valves. Ideal for handling dry bulk material in gravity flow, dilute phase or dense phase pneumatic conveying applications. Similar to a sliding line blind valve, but the latter is for higher-pressure applications. * Stopcock: restricts or isolates flow through a pipe * Swirl valve: A specially designed Joule-Thompson pressure reduction/expansion valve imparting a centrifugal force upon the discharge stream for improving gas–liquid phase separation * Tap (British English), faucet (American English): the common name for a valve used in homes to regulate water flow * Tesla valve: A form of check valve with no moving parts, invented by Nikola Tesla for use with fluids. * Thermally operated valves: ** Thermal expansion valve, used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. ** Thermostatic mixing valve ** Thermostatic radiator valve ** Thermal shut off valve or Thermally released shut off valve, protects against excessive temperature, mandatory in the gas installation of some countries * Trap primer: sometimes include other types of valves, or are valves themselves * Vacuum breaker valve: prevents the back-siphonage of contaminated water into pressurized drinkable water supplies References Engineering-related lists ","title":"List of valves"},{"id":"34113701","text":"Marow may refer to: *Marow Baronets *Maru, Iran (disambiguation) ","title":"Marow"},{"id":"34113715","text":"Charsley's Hall was a private hall of the University of Oxford.

In 1937, he became the music supervisor for the first German language television play, Kabinett Fulero. The German Broadcasting Archive has a recording of jazz-piano concert with Rudolf Ehrecke at the piano and Gebhardt conducting the orchestra. He also conducted an orchestra at the Folies Bergère in Paris, France. On 24 June 1944 Gebhardt died on the eastern front during World War II. An exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of his death (with catalog) documents his career.

It is home to the physics department. LeConte Hall was one of the largest physics buildings in the world at the time it was opened in 1924, and was also the site of the first atom collider, built by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1931. The building was named in honor of the brothers Joseph and John LeConte, professors of Physics and Geology, who were respectively the first and third presidents of UC Berkeley. In 2004, LeConte Hall was named to the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1924, the university opened LeConte Hall in order to accommodate an enlarged physics department, and to support the hiring of new, talented faculty. One of the newly hired faculty was Ernest Lawrence, who joined the department in 1928. Lawrence, together with students M. S. Livingston and David Sloan built an 11-inch cyclotron and installed it in room 329 LeConte. The device was the first successful, functional cyclotron and produced a current of 1.22 MeV protons. Lawrence set up the Radiation Laboratory (\\"Rad Lab\\") in the space between LeConte Hall and the Campanile. The lab was later moved up the hill and renamed Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Another nuclear physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer joined the department in the summer of 1929. Oppenheimer maintained an office, together with his group of students in room 219 LeConte. In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed head of the fast neutron research group, and in the summer of that year, he invited the leading physicists of the time to discuss the theoretical aspects of developing an atomic weapon. The physicists and Oppenheimer's students, including Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Felix Bloch, and others, worked in the top floor of LeConte Hall and spent a month analyzing data. Bronze bust of John LeConte in Physics library, LeConte Hall Nobel Prizes In 1939, Ernest Lawrence was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, the first time the award went to a Bay Area resident. Since then, LeConte Hall has been host to eight Physics Nobel Prize–winning faculty and four alumni. Renovation In 2006, the UC Berkeley campus completed a US$30.7 million renovation project, designed to update the LeConte Hall facilities as well as to provide seismic retrofitting. Being a historic landmark, an effort was made to preserve the original architecture as well as to restore original attributes, such as the historic skylight on the fourth floor, which houses the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics. On July 7, 2020, the University announced they would consider renaming the building due to the LeConte brothers' support of white supremacy.

It was founded by Patrick Lefevere and the bulk of the Belgian riders from the Mapei team, including Johan Museeuw. Sponsor Farm Frites had previously co-sponsored TVM. The team won several notable one-day races in their existence, notably including a podium sweep of 2001 Paris-Roubaix led by Servais Knaven, 2002 Paris-Roubaix by Johan Museeuw, and 2001 Paris-Tours by Richard Virenque. At the end of the 2002 season the team merged with the remnants of the disbanded Mapei team and became Quick Step-Davitamon, with Lefevere at the helm. Sponsor Domo joined Lotto to co- sponsor team Lotto-Domo, with Marc Sergeant as team manager and taking several riders with him.  Roster  Through its two years of existence, the team included several notable riders. In its first year former Mapei riders Johan Museeuw, his super-domestique Wilfried Peeters, American Freddy Rodriguez, and Axel Merckx. In addition, they enrolled Road Cycling World Champion Romāns Vainšteins, sprinter Robbie McEwen, classics specialist Servais Knaven, and Frenchman Richard Virenque who just returned from doping suspension. Rising young riders such as Leif Hoste, Andrey Kashechkin, and Gert Steegmans were also in the squad. The next year brought classics specialist Frank Vandenbroucke, and youngsters Nick Nuyens and Johan Vansummeren.  Notable wins  Their first year brought high-profile wins such as a podium sweep of the 2001 Paris-Roubaix with Servais Knaven, Johan Museeuw and Romāns Vainšteins on the podium. Wilfried Peeters finished fifth. Coming back from suspension, Richard Virenque won the 2001 Paris-Tours from a long two-man breakaway that many thought was hopeless. The next season opened with Johan Museeuw's charismatic win of the 2002 Paris-Roubaix from a solo breakaway of 40 km. Virenque continued his comeback with a stage win on Mont Ventoux at the 2002 Tour de France. The season also included Museeuw's win in the HEW Cyclassics, although he did not win the UCI World Cup.

The river is in length and has a drainage area of . The Koito is the third-longest river in Chiba Prefecture, and under the Rivers Act of 1906 the Koito is designated as a Class 2 River. The name of the river in Japanese is a combination of two kanji characters, the first meaning “little”, and the second meaning “thread”. Geography The Koito River originates from a deep valley in forests around Mount Kiyosumi in the Bōsō Hill Range. The river cuts through the Kazusa Hill Range, a smaller part of the Bōsō Hill Range, and in its upper part, meanders northwest. The Koito creates picturesque ravines throughout the Bōsō Hill Range, and passes by Mount Karasuba and Mount Kiyosumi.小糸川流域懇談会 The middle and lower parts of the Koito feature fluvial terraces. Extensive land reclamation was carried out near the mouth of the river, and this land was used to build the Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works. The Kimitsu Works sits on the north bank of the Koito River where it empties in Tokyo Bay. The Koito River has numerous narrow points along its course, and flooding has been a frequent problem. In the middle part of the river there were floods in 1996 and 2006.小糸川流域懇談会 The Mishima Dam was built on the Koito due to prevent drought on the upper and middle parts of the river, and the Toyofusa Dam was built on the upper part on the river to prevent water shortages and supply water for industrial purposes.  Origin of name  In the third chapter of the Gikeiki, which dates to the 14th century, the Koito River is called the \\"Sue River\\". In Kubo Tadayasu's Edo period illustrations of Kazusa Province domains in 1699 the river appears as the \\"Susu River\\", or possibly the \\"Sue River\\", of Sutō District; in its lower reaches it appears with its present-day name as the Koito River in Susai District. The current name of the river, however, appears in one work as early as 1662, and in the 'Nakatomi kyōdoshi' in 1674.小糸川の名称ルーツを求めて  Tributaries   Upper  *Sanma River *Shin'niyo River *Manami River  Lower  *Egawa River *Miyanoshita River  History  The earliest settlements in the southern part of Chiba Prefecture were via the numerous small rivers on the Bōsō Peninsula.

The battle and resultant massacre comprised the first major standoff of the Second Hashemite-Saudi War. Following a short siege, the city was abandoned by Hashemite forces and then capitulated to the battle-ready Ikhwan force under the command of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. The Ikhwan troops took out their rage on the residents of the city. In the resulting bloodbath, some 400-1000 Ta'if residents were massacred. Following the fall of Taif, Saud's forces moved on Mecca. Background Ta'if was taken by the Hashemite forces in September 1916, during the Arab Revolt, and later incorporated into the Kingdom of Hejaz. Ta'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long however. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, Sultan of Nejd, soon broke out into violence. The hostilities were temporarily patched up in 1919, with truce signed in the aftermath of the First Hashemite- Saudi War. Conquest and massacre In late August 1924, the Saudi-allied Ikhwan, under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai were ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king’s son, Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. The city was quickly breached by the Ikhwan on 3 September or it surrendered on 29 August, after which the Ikhwan went on a rampage through the city. In the resulting massacre, some 300David Holden in The House of Saud to 400 of Ta'if residents were killed. Aftermath Following the fall of Ta'if the Saudi forces moved to conquer Mecca, Medina, and eventually Jeddah, which fell in December 1925, completing the conquest of Hejaz. In 1926 Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new king of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms into one under the title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The king would later die in the city on 9 November 1953.

It is May 1912. Thirteen political prisoners are being tried in a naval fortress of Kronstadt. They are sentenced to death by hanging. A clandestine Bolshevik organization decides to free the prisoners during their transfer to the place of execution. Vasily Panin (played by Vyacheslav Tikhonov), a junker of a school of naval engineers, is one of those entrusted with this dangerous task. The day Panin is promoted to warrant officer is the day he is baptized by fire. In the evening of that same day Panin arrives at a military vessel named Elizaveta, which is supposed to leave for France the next morning. The freed prisoners go out into the sea on a fishing boat and soon find themselves in a desperate situation. Panin and other Bolshevik seamen onboard Elizaveta hide the fugitives in a non-operational boiler of the ship. Elizaveta sails on. Naval officers and petty officers dart about the ship and are close to discovering the fugitives. Petty officer Savichev (Leonid Kmit) comes across the fugitives, and Panin throws him overboard. Finally, Elizaveta arrives in Gâvres. The fugitives manage to disembark under the guise of sailors on shore leave. Warrant officer Panin is a relief commander. That same evening the crew returns from their shore leave short of thirteen people. Captain Sergeyev of Elizaveta (Nikolai Sergeyev) realizes that warrant officer Panin has something to do with the escape and offers him to remain in France. In France, Panin establishes contact with local Bolshevik emigres, who provide him with the money and a passport to return to Russia. He receives a letter from Vladimir Lenin, in which the latter expresses his regret regarding Panin's being away from the Navy. And then warrant officer Panin decides to return to his ship in Kronstadt. He is arrested and stands trial. At the trial, however, he tells a made-up story about his love affairs, and the court decides to simply reduce him to the ranks. Upon becoming a matrose, Panin joins the revolutionary movement yet again.

Constructed over a large area north of Rattanakosin Island between 1897 and 1901 by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). The palace, originally called Wang Suan Dusit or 'Dusit Garden Palace' (วังสวนดุสิต), eventually became the primary (but not official) place of residence of the King of Thailand, including King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) and King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X). The palace covers an area of over and is dotted between gardens and lawns with 13 different royal residences. Dusit Palace is bordered by Ratchwithi Road in the north, Sri Ayutthaya Road in the south, Ratchasima Road in the west and U-Thong Nai Road on the east. History Background King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) found the Grand Palace too overcrowded and unhealthy, as a result he began construction on a new palace, which eventually became Dusit Palace. Vimanmek Mansion, built in 1900, is entirely made of teak. It was built in Ko Sichang, Chonburi Province, but was dismantled on the orders of the king and reconstructed at Dusit Palace in 1901. Since 1782 and the foundation of Bangkok as the capital city of the Kingdom of Siam, the monarchs of the Chakri Dynasty have resided at the Grand Palace by the Chao Phraya River. The palace became the focal point of the city as well as a seat of the royal government and the home of the king and his court (his children and his polygamous household). During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the Grand Palace was transformed, with reconstruction and additions made to the main Middle Court (state buildings) and the Inner Court (residential buildings) of the palace. The changes sought to modernize the palace as well as accommodate its growing population. As a result, the palace, particularly the Inner Court, became extremely overcrowded. The Grand Palace also became stiflingly hot during the summer months, with the passage of air blocked by the closely clustered new buildings. Epidemics, once started, were liable to spread easily within the crowded compound. The king, who enjoyed taking long walks for exercise and pleasure, often felt unwell after prolonged stays inside the Grand Palace. He consequently took frequent trips to the countryside to seek relief. Celestial palace Chulalongkorn got the idea of having a royal residence with spacious gardens on the outskirts of the capital from European monarchs during his trip to Europe in 1897. When he returned to Bangkok he began to build a new royal compound within walking distance of the Grand Palace. He began by acquiring farmlands and orchards between Padung Krung Kasem and Samsen canals from Privy Purse funds. The king named this area Suan Dusit meaning 'celestial garden'. The first building in the area was a single story wooden structure, used by the king, his consorts, and his children for occasional stays. In 1890s, plans for a permanent set of residences were drawn up and construction began under the supervision of Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs (the king's brother) and C. Sandreczki (a German architect, responsible for the Boromphiman Palace). Apart from the prince all other members of the team were Europeans. When it became clear that Chulalongkorn preferred to stay in the garden, with only occasional visits to the Grand Palace for state and royal ceremonies, the name was changed to Wang Dusit meaning 'celestial dwelling'. The king also ordered the construction of Wat Benchamabophit nearby to serve as the palace's official temple. Abhisek Dusit Throne Hall was built in 1904 as an audience hall and entertainment venue for the Dusit Palace complex. The north façade of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, built in 1908 as an audience hall for the palace. Apart from his long walks, Chulalongkorn also indulged in the new and fashionable pastime of cycling. Even before he took permanent residence at Dusit Palace, he would take his entourage cycling from the Grand Palace to the garden and back. With bicycling trips often taking all day. The pathway connecting the Grand Palace to Dusit Palace eventually became Ratchadamnoen Avenue. The construction of both Dusit Palace and Ratchadamnoen Avenue allowed and encouraged the expansion of Bangkok outside its city walls and the traditional confines of the Rattanakosin area. The palace expanded Bangkok northwards, while the avenue accommodated further growth. The avenue extended from the palace, starting in front of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall and the Royal Plaza southwards along the Makawan Rangsant and Phanfah Lielas Bridges then westward across the Phanbipob Liela Bridge, then south again long the Sanam Luang to the Grand Palace. On Chulalongkorn's return from his second European tour in 1908, he expanded the palace northward, creating an additional private garden called Suan Sunandha (สวนสุนันทา), in honour of his first consort Queen Sunandha Kumariratana, who died in 1880. The garden became the setting for residential houses belonging to the king's consorts and children. Chulalongkorn lived at the palace until his death at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall on 23 October 1910 of kidney disease. Sixth, seventh and eighth reigns The moat of the Chitralada Royal Villa. The villa was built in 1913 and was incorporated as part of Dusit Palace in 1925. It was the primary residence of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. Chulalongkorn's successor, King Vajiravudh, contributed to the expansion of the palace by the construction in 1913 of another garden called Suan Chitralada (สวนจิตรลดา), between Dusit Palace and Phaya Thai Palace. In this garden he had a residential villa built and named it Phra Thamnak Chitralada Rahothan or the Chitralada Royal Villa (พระตำหนักจิตรลดารโหฐาน). Later in 1925, during the reign of King Prajadhipok, this garden was incorporated by royal command as part of Dusit Palace. At its greatest extent the palace occupied over of land. In 1932 the absolute monarchy was abolished and part of the Dusit Palace was reduced and transferred to the constitutional government. This included the Khao Din Wana (เขาดินวนา) to the east of the palace, which was given in 1938 to the Bangkok City Municipality by King Ananda Mahidol to create a public park, which later became Dusit Zoo. The Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall was also appropriated as the permanent meeting place of the National Assembly of Thailand. Ninth reign Royal Plaza at Dusit Palace When King Bhumibol Adulyadej returned from his studies to Thailand in 1952 he made the Chitralada Royal Villa his main residence and had it renovated. In the meantime the king and his growing family stayed at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, part of Dusit Palace. After renovations were completed, the king made the royal villa his permanent residence. The area of the royal villa and garden is commonly referred to as \\"Chitralada Palace\\". In 1970, the National Assembly of Thailand requested a new plot of land for the building of a new legislature, as the Ananta Samkhom Throne Hall had become too small and was unable to accommodate the growing assembly and its secretariat. The king granted a plot of land on Dusit Palace grounds immediately north of the Throne Hall for the building of a new Parliament House of Thailand. With the completion of this new building the Ananta Samkhom Throne Hall was returned to the king as part of the palace once more. Tenth reign King Vajiralongkorn chose to keep his residence at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, where he was already living before the death of his father Bhumibol. In 2019 the National Assembly of Thailand moved into new premises, named the Sappaya-Sapasathan. As a result the old parliament building was returned to the King and was promptly demolished. Currently several museums and exhibitions are displayed inside the various buildings within the Dusit Palace precinct, only a few of these are open to the public. Layout Like all Thai royal palaces of the past, Dusit Palace is divided into three areas: the outer, middle, and inner courts. However unlike the Grand Palace, the Dusit Palace courts were organized differently and were separated by canals and gardens as opposed to walls. The king allocated different residential halls and gardens to his consorts and children. The gardens are connected by gates with names drawn from motifs on blue and white Chinese porcelain ware, which the king picked out himself. The gates were specifically named after human or animal motifs, while the name of the paths were taken from floral motifs.  Main edifices Map of Dusit Palace.

This term was coined by Anthony Weston and used in his book Back to Earth in 1994.Weston, Anthony (1994). Back to Earth: Tomorrow's Environmentalism. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Following Weston's work, Bob Jickling, et al. in Environmental Education, Ethics, and Action (United Nations Education Program (UNEP), 2006) wrote: :A self-validating reduction is a self- fulfilling prophecy in which one of the main effects of the \\"prophecy\\" is to reduce someone or something in the world. It acts to make that person or thing less than they, or it, are or could be; or it diminishes some part of the world’s richness, depth and promise. And, this reduction in turn feeds back, not only to justify the original \\"prophecy\\" but also to perpetuate it.  Definition and examples  According to Thomas Schelling’s classic (1978) treatment, the term “self-fulfilling prophecy” originally referred to a process in which a negative but quite possibly baseless expectation or prediction generates a feedback loop that ends by producing exactly the expected negative result: the diminution or defeat of something originally stable and seemingly solid. The standard example is a run on an initially solvent bank that can accelerate into a panic and drive the bank into bankruptcy simply because very few banks, however well-managed, can cash out large numbers of depositors upon unexpected demand. The term has since broadened greatly, however, to include any self-augmenting expectation, prediction, or disposition, many of which can also have positive effects. High self-esteem, however ill-founded, may produce more confident and capable acts, hence \\"fulfilling\\" itself. Other interpersonal expectations such as predictions of student success, initially quite baseless, can produce student success through subtly altering the expectations of their teachers. A 1996 article by philosopher Anthony Weston refocused on part of what Schelling described as the original denotation of “self-fulfilling prophecy” using the more specific term “self-validating reduction”. The \\"reduction\\" is an actual change – some kind of deprivation, loss, or diminution – not merely a \\"prophecy\\" in the sense of an attitude change in another person or society at large; and a change that comes to justify or \\"validate\\" a changed judgment of the person changed or reduced, specifically by ignoring the actual cause of the reduction and attributing it instead to the essential character of the reduced person(s) instead. For example, the abolitionist Frederick Douglass pointed out that : Ignorance and depravity, and the inability to arise from degradation to civilization and respectability, are the most usual allegations against the oppressed. The evils most fostered by slavery and oppression are precisely those which slaveholders and oppressors would transfer from their system to the inherent character of their victims. Thus the very crimes of slavery become slavery’s best defense. By making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, they excuse themselves for failing to make the slave a freeman. Among many other possible examples are the Nazi concentration camps, designed to destroy the inmates' very humanity and thus to validate the Nazis’ prejudices and make systematic murder possible; and the ways in which prejudiced persons, convinced of (say) a co-worker's incapacity or inequality, are likely to reduce their co-workers to uncooperative antagonists: missing their own contribution to the process, they will then naturally conclude that their co-workers – not themselves – are incapable of good work.  Other animals and nature  Self-validating reduction applies beyond the human sphere as well. For example, wild animals who were not originally hostile or wary become that way upon being hunted. Scientific research on other animals that tends to avoid calling on their social instincts, in the name of objectivity, may in fact drive them away and actually induce an avoidance of humans that then is taken to be an objective and independent fact about them. Highly confined and managed animals under \\"factory farming\\" can be reduced to a state of social and physical dysfunction that seems to be their \\"inherent character\\", as Douglass puts it, thus making their treatment less morally troubling, and thereby making them more available for further reduction in turn. The ecological critic Paul Shepard noted that land can be reduced in self-validating ways as well, as when Isaiah commands Israel to “tear down the [pagan] altars, break their images, cut down their groves” -– so that it becomes true, as it may not have been initially, that only the other world, beyond nature, is truly sacred. Shepard called this kind of self-validating reduction “the evangelical desacralizing of place”.

The only known photograph of Mary Ann Girling Life Girling was the daughter of William Clouting (or Clowting), a small farmer, born in the parish of Little Glemham, Suffolk, on 27 April 1827. She had little formal education, and her letters were full of spelling and grammatical errors, but she was considered to be quite intelligent. When she was 16, she married George Stanton Girling in the Anglican Church. He was first a seaman, then a fitter in an iron foundry, and afterwards a general dealer at Ipswich. She had eight miscarriages and two surviving children. Girling had a vision of Jesus Christ on Christmas Day 1858; by Christmas 1864, she began to believe that she was a new incarnation of the Deity. One sign of this was in the stigmata which appeared on her hands, feet, and side. She was wont to describe with minute details the extraordinary emotion which overwhelmed her at the moment when she experienced the divine call. From that period she went about proclaiming the new revelation and speaking as with absolute knowledge of hidden mysteries. She gathered around her a small company of men and women, belonging for the most part to the labouring classes. Their first meeting-place for public worship was at 107 Bridge Road, Battersea, London, where in August 1870 they attracted much attention. They were generally called shakers, but they themselves never accepted that name, but always spoke of their community as the Children of God. By 1871, Girling had been barred from preaching in the Methodist chapels which she had previously attended. This was likely due in part to her style of preaching—an eyewitness who called her \\"the high priestess of Jumperism\\" wrote \\"the woman prayed volubly, and used her long arms freely in gesticulation…actually screaming in a which I thought might have caused a jump or two.\\" However, it also reflected unease with her increasingly public claims to divinity. On 2 January 1872, the Children of God removed from London and settled near Hordle in the New Forest, Hampshire, where Miss Julia Wood, a wealthy lady, had purchased for them a residence and a farm, known as New Forest Lodge. Wood gave £2,250 for the property, on which there remained a mortgage of £1,000. Here the community increased to 160 persons, who learnt to regard Mrs. Girling, ‘their mother,’ with tenderness, love, and reverence. She owed her authority over her people to her belief in herself and to her great force of will. Their faith in her endured through cold, hunger, and suffering, and many and repeated misfortunes. It was believed that they would all live for ever, and that sooner or later everybody would acknowledge the divinity of Mrs. Girling, who would then rule over a peaceful world. She was a tall, lean woman, with an upright carriage, a strong, intelligent countenance, bright eyes, a very good expression, and a rather winning voice. She had scruples against going to law, which afterwards made her an easy prey to her enemies. The community was industrious, and lived in a state of celibacy. It also followed Girling's prohibitions on trade, leading it to fall into debt and be evicted from New Forest Lodge on 15 December 1874. Girling was subsequently declared insane, though the verdict was overturned; several years later, Miss Wood was also declared insane and spent 24 years in an asylum. The eviction took place in very severe weather, and the pitiable condition of the people excited much commiseration, particularly following reports that an infant had died of exposure. The community camped on the roadside for two days, when they had notice to leave, and part of the community returned to their homes in various parts of the country. A Mr. Beasley then offered them the use of a shed, where they remained for three weeks, but the place was not large enough for them all to sit down at one time. They next found a friend in the Hon. Auberon E. M. Herbert, who gave them the use of a barn on the Ashley Arnewood farm, Lymington, on the condition that Girling sign an agreement to \\"prevent any dances without clothes taking place among any of the brothers, sisters or children\\", reflecting the widespread belief that the Children of God engaged in orgies, witchcraft, and other unsavory practices. After staying in Herbert's barn for five weeks, they removed to a field which they formerly had on lease with New Forest Lodge; when this lease expired they were again turned into the roadway, and there they lived night and day for five weeks. In 1879, Girling rented a two-acre farm called Tiptoe Farm, near Hordle. Here the community erected a number of wooden huts with canvas roofs, with a larger and superior hut as a place of public worship. The farm became a tourist attraction, with visitors arriving in charabancs on the weekends and buying quantities of beer from the nearby public house. Girling publicly announced her divinity in a letter to local newspapers in February 1882. The only publication known to survive, however, is a four-page tract entitled The Close of the Dispensation: the Last Message to the Church and the World. It is signed ‘Jesus First and Last (Mary Ann Girling), Tiptoe, Hordle, near Lymington, Hants, 1883.’ In it she says: Latterly the Children of God escaped public notice, except from excursionists visiting the place. The cold and exposure at last told on Mrs. Girling, and she fell ill. During her illness she did not lose faith in what she had preached, and believed that she would never die, but would live until the second coming of Christ. Girling was diagnosed with cancer of the womb and died at Tiptoe, Hordle, on 18 September 1886 (aged 59), and was buried in Hordle churchyard 22 September. A large crowd turned out for the funeral. Afterwards, those of the community who had friends returned to them, and only six persons were left to occupy the camp at Tiptoe. Girling left children, among them a younger son, William Girling.  Legacy  According to author Philip Hoare, Girling inspired Andrew Thomas Turton Peterson's interest in spiritualism and mesmerism. During a séance, Peterson claimed to have received the plans for what would become Peterson's Tower in Sway, Hampshire from Sir Christopher Wren. In the 1870s and 1880s, local newspapers regularly reported \\"rescues\\" and escape attempts related to the Children of God, claiming that members of the community were terrified of Girling. \\"While under Mrs Girling's reign of terror\\", one was said to have written, \\"I was not allowed to write to you, or do anything only in strict accordance with her decrees.\\" Girling has also become the subject of urban legends. In Hampshire and Isle of Wight Folk Tales, author Michael O'Leary reports that in the 1990s, a group of young men who had robbed a service station stashed the money in Hordle churchyard. When one of them returned to claim it, he encountered \\"the tall, gaunt, angular figure of a woman, wearing a long, black Victorian dress and a large, black bonnet…and she was jumping–up and down–up and down…\\" The young man fled, and \\"The police found him the next day, crouching in a foetal position, rocking backwards and forwards, laughing and crying at the same time.\\" Notes References  External links 1827 births 1886 deaths English spiritualists ","title":"Mary Girling"},{"id":"34114502","text":"Randall Philip \\"Randy\\" Hennis (born December 16, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.

Painting by Pavel Chistyakov. The Muscovite Civil War, or Great Feudal War, was a prolonged conflict that cast its shadow over the entire reign of Vasily II of Moscow (from 1425 to 1453). The two warring parties were Vasily II, the Grand Prince of Moscow, as one party, and his uncle, Yury Dmitrievich, the Prince of Zvenigorod, and the sons of Yuri Dmitrievich, Vasily Kosoy and Dmitry Shemyaka, as the other party. In the intermediate stage, the party of Yury conquered Moscow, but in the end, Vasily II regained his crown. It was the first civil war in the history of Muscovy, whose largely peaceful rise had been predicated on a lack of conflict within the ruling family. Background The Mongol invasions of 1236-1241 left the Russian principalities subjugated by the Golden Horde. In the 13th-15th centuries, the Khan of the Golden Horde appointed the Great Prince, who in the 14th century resided in Moscow. In the 13th century the medieval Rus' consisted of a set of relatively small and weak principalities, fighting and making alliances against each other. The larger states (like the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Republic of Novgorod) progressively conquered or absorbed the smaller ones. One bigger principality, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, grew due to a series of clever policies and became the biggest one in central Rus'. In 1380 Dmitry Donskoy, the prince of Moscow, even managed to fight the troops of Golden Horde in the Battle of Kulikovo and win. Whereas formally Moscow remained dependent on the Horde, and the Khan needed to approve position of the Prince, the Grand Duchy of Moscow had become a major regional power, and the Moscow princes aimed to conquer the remaining lands around Moscow and to append them to their Grand Duchy. First period (1425-1434) The Muscovite boyars pledge their support to the dethroned Vasily II In 1389, Dmitry Donskoy died. He appointed his son Vasily Dmitrievich as successor, with the provision that if Vasily were to die as an infant, his brother, Yury Dmitrievich, would be the successor. Vasily died in 1425 and left a child, Vasily Vasilyevich, whom he appointed as the Grand Prince (known as Vasily II). This was against the existing rule, where the oldest living brother and not a son, should have received the crown. Yury thus became a pretender and moved from Zvenigorod, his main residence, to Galich, to be farther from Moscow. In 1428 Yury Dmitrievich formally conceded, under pressure from Metropolitan Photius, who personally travelled to Galich. However, in 1431 Yury decided to seek the title of Prince of Moscow with the Khan of the Horde. The Khan ruled in favor of Vasily, and additionally ordered Yury to give Vasily the town of Dmitrov, which he owned. The formal pretext to start a war was found in 1433, when during the marriage feast of Vasily his mother, Sophia of Lithuania, insulted Vasily Yuryevich, the son of Yury, in public. Both sons of Yury, Vasily and Dmitry, left for Galich. They plundered Yaroslavl, ruled by an allied of Vasily II, allied with their father, collected an army, and defeated the army of Vasily II. Subsequently, Yury Dmitrievich entered Moscow, declared himself the Great Prince, and sent Vasily II to Kolomna. Eventually, however, he did not prove himself as an efficient head of state, having alienated some Muscovites who fled to Kolomna, and even alienating his own sons. Eventually, Yury allied with Vasily II against the sons of Yury and returned the Moscow Princedom to Vasily II, who, in his turn, started to persecute former supporters of Yury. Vasily then sent an army against his cousins, sons of Yury, Vasily Yuryevich and Dmitry Shemyaka, in 1434. His army was defeated in a major battle, in which troops of Yury were fighting against Vasily. Vasily conquered Galich, and Yury openly joined his sons. The army of Vasily II was finally defeated close to Rostov. Yury became the Prince of Moscow again, but suddenly died, and his son, Vasily Yuryevich, became his successor. At this point, Vasily II was in Nizhny Novgorod and was preparing to travel to the Horde to leave a complaint with the Khan. Second period (1434-1436) The brothers of Vasily Yuryevich — Dmitry Shemyaka and Dmitry Krasny — refused to lend him any support. Anticipating that Vasily would not be able to keep Moscow for long, they preferred to ally with Vasily II so that eventually they could get additional lands from him. Indeed, Vasily gave Rzhev and Uglich to Dmitry Shemyaka and Bezhetsky Verkh to Dmitry Krasny. Vasily Yuryevich was driven out of Moscow; he also lost Zvenigorod to Vasily II and was left landless, forced to flee to Novgorod. In 1435, Vasily managed to collect an army in Kostroma and moved in the direction of Moscow. He lost a battle on the bank of the Kotorosl River to Vasily II and fled to Kashin. He then managed to conquer Vologda and built up a new army with the support of Vyatka. With this new army he moved again to the south and encountered Vasily II in Kostroma. The two armies were stationed on two banks of the Kostroma River and could not start fighting immediately. Before the fight started, the two cousins concluded a peace treaty. Vasily Yuryevich recognized Vasily II as the Great Prince and got Dmitrov. However, he only spent a month in Dmitrov and subsequently moved to Kostroma and further to Galich and to Veliky Ustyug. In Veliky Ustyug, the army formed in Vyatka, which had supported Yuri Dmitrievich for a long time, and joined Vasily. Vasily Yuryevich plundered Veliky Ustyug and with the army went south again. In early 1436, he lost a battle in Skoryatino, close to Rostov, to Vasily II, and was captured. Subsequently, when the Vyatka people continued to attack the lands belonging to the Grand Prince, Vasily II ordered to have Vasily Yuryevich blinded. Vasily Yuryevich was known after that as Vasily Kosoy. He lived until 1448, but chronicles do not mention him between 1436 and 1448; apparently he was imprisoned all this time. At the same time Vasily II released Dmitry Shemyaka, who had been exiled to Kolomna, and concluded a treaty with him similar to the treaty he previously concluded with Vasily Kosoy, returning Shemyaka all his lands. Third period (1436-1453) The Blinding of Vasily II, a miniature from the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible In the early 1440s Vasily II was mostly busy with the wars against the Khanate of Kazan. The Khan, Ulugh Muhammad, besieged Moscow in 1439. Dmitry Shemyaka, despite being under the oath of allegiance, failed to appear in support of Vasily. After the Tatars left, Vasily chased Shemyaka, forcing him to flee to Novgorod again. Subsequently, Shemyaka returned to Moscow and confirmed his allegiance. In 1444, Tatars led by Mustafa, the Khan of the Golden Horde, plundered the Ryazan lands, before being defeated by a much larger army sent by Vasily. In 1445, Ulugh Muhammad conquered Nizhny Novgorod, was defeated in a skirmish near Murom, but won the second battle in Suzdal, capturing, among other prominent Muscovites, Vasily II. Vasily was released after negotiations, having promised to pay an enormous ransom. This resulted in an increase of taxes and, consequently, in discontent, which strengthened the party of Dmitry Shemyaka. In early 1446, Vasily was captured by Shemyaka in the Trinity Sergius Lavra, brought to Moscow, blinded, and then sent to Uglich. Shemyaka started to reign as the Prince of Moscow. In the fall of 1446 he traveled to Uglich to seek peace with Vasily. They made a deal, Vasily gave an oath of allegiance and promised not to seek the Great Princedom any more, and in return he was released and got Vologda in his possession. In Vologda, Vasily traveled to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, and the hegumen released him from the oath. Vasily immediately started preparations for the war against Shemyaka. In addition, Shemyaka and his ally, Prince Ivan of Mozhaysk, ruled inefficiently, did not manage to attract allies, and nobility started to defect from Moscow to Vologda. Vasily also managed to ally with Kazan Tatars. In the end of 1446, when Dmitry Shemyaka was out in Volokolamsk, the army of Vasily II entered Moscow. Vasily then started to chase Shemyaka and Mozheysky, who had to retreat, with both armies ravaging and plundering the country. In 1447, they asked for peace, and agreed to accept the superiority of Vasily. Nevertheless, Dmitry Shemyaka continued resistance, trying to attract the allies and to collect a big enough army to fight against Vasily. In 1448, Vasily started military action, which included mostly Northern lands up to Veliky Ustyug and with some interruptions continued till 1452, when Shemyaka was finally defeated and fled to Novgorod. In 1453, he was poisoned there following a direct order of Vasily. Subsequently, Vasily managed to remove all local princes who previously supported Shemyaka. In particular, Ivan Mozheysky had to flee with their family to Lithuania, and the Principality of Mozhaysk was made a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Similarly, the Principality of Serpukhov was made a part of the Grand Duchy, and the Principality of Vereya remained after the war the only independent state in Moscow lands.

The product or service in principle has to be tradable for money. However, in national accounts the term has a more specific meaning, because many producing organizations exist in the economy which either do not produce for any distinct market, or which partly produce for the market, and partly don't. These are non-commercial or partly commercial organizations, which can be mainly self-funded, but not-for-profit, or mainly funded by sources other than their own revenue. Statisticians therefore have to define \\"market production\\" much more exactly, in order to be able to separate out market production in a consistent way, and distinguish it from non-market production. If they would be unable to do so, they would be unable to measure market production in a meaningful and consistent way. In the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA), market production includes all those producing units who sell most or all of their output at prices which are \\"economically significant\\" (i.e. at prices which influence how much producers are willing to supply, and how much purchasers wish to buy). United Nations, System of National Accounts 2008, Pre-edited version of Volume 1, p. 75. For example, a school or a university would be a market producer if it charges fees which are based on their production costs, and which are sufficiently high to influence demand for their services. The school or university would have to generate a definite operating surplus (profit) or loss. Non-market production, by contrast, includes producing units which provide most of their output to others either free of charge, or at prices which are \\"not economically significant\\" - for example, government institutions, households, or non-profit institutions. If prices are charged for services supplied, these prices mostly do not change in response to fluctuations in supply or demand (as in the case of administered prices) or else they are prices which do not cover the cost of supply. The organizations in this category do not provide a financial gain (a source of income or profit) to the units which control or manage them. In addition, they depend mostly on funding other than sales revenue to cover their costs of production, or of other activities they might carry out (for example, funding such as taxes, authorized levies, subsidies, subscriptions, donations etc.). Non-market production can also include subsistence production where producers produce something for their own use, rather than trading what they produce for something else.

They run along the west shore of the northern part of Lake Tanganyika. They contain a vast area of contiguous montane forest and are home to a rich diversity of wildlife. Geography The Itombwe mountains are a section of the Albertine Rift Mountains, which border the western branch of the East African Rift. These mountains extend from the Rwenzori Mountains in the north to the Marungu highlands in the south. They are made up of uplifted Pre-Cambrian basement rocks overlaid in places by recent volcanic activity. Both of these are caused by the forces that created the Great Rift Valley, where tectonic stresses are causing parts of East Africa to separate from the continent. The highest peak of the Albertine Rift Mountains is further north in the Rwenzori Mountains, at . The highest peak in the Itombwe range is Mount Mohi, at . Several other peaks are higher than . The mountains drop sharply in the east to the Ruzizi plain bordering Lake Tanganyika. They form a plateau that slopes down more gently to the west. The Elila River rises in the mountains, which are covered by forest except where rock bluffs emerge from the steepest slopes. Temperatures range from about to , with a mean temperature of about all year round. Frost is occasionally experienced at night. Average annual precipitation is around . There is a relatively cool, dry season with little rain between June and August. Flora The Itombwe Forest of the southern Rift covers a huge area that has had little attention from botanists. Montane forest covers around above , the largest block of such forest in the region. The forest is patchy on the east slopes. On the west there is an exceptional progression of bamboo, montane forest, grassland, and then more montane forest with a canopy reaching blending into lowland forest. Fauna Eastern lowland gorilla Gorilla beringei graueri The mountains are home to endangered Eastern lowland gorillas, chimpanzees and African bush elephants. Rudolf Grauer spent three months in the mountains in 1908, collecting twelve gorillas for the Vienna Museum. A survey in 1996 estimated that there were at least 860 gorillas in the massif. The Grauer population of gorillas in the Itombwe mountains and the region to the north and west is one of three gorilla populations in East Africa, the others being the Bwindi and Virunga populations. The survey recorded fifty-six species of mammals. A type of shrew that has only been collected once is most likely the oldest of all shrew species in Africa. The Itombwe Mountains are much the most important part of the Albertine Rift Highlands for bird conservation, being home to 32 of the 37 species of bird endemic to the highlands. They include the most important site in the region for montane forest birds, with 565 species identified. Of these, 31 are endemic to the Albertine Rift and three have only been found here. People The northern Itombwe region is inhabited by Bafuliro, Babembe, Banyindu and Bashi people, with population densities in 1998 of over 100 people per square kilometer. Population densities on the western slope and the high plateau of Itombwe are lower at between 10 and 20 people per square kilometer. The related Balega and Babembe people live in this area. Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsi) refugees from Rwanda have moved into Babembe territory starting in the 1880s, causing tensions between the inhabitants. The Bavira people live on the Ruzizi River and on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. With the conflict of the Second Congo War (1998-2003) and subsequent instability many displaced people have entered the region. The region has been the scene of struggles between different armed groups, causing severe humanitarian and environmental problems. NGOs have been attempting to help local communities recover and develop sustainable agricultural and practices while conserving the forest. The major mining center of Kamituga is near the north-west edge of the montane forest. Conservation issues Babembe village on the Itombwe plateau The range is still not protected, although there have been proposals to designate all the montane forest and two patches of lowland forest to the south of the upper Elila River as conservation areas. As of 2010 the mountains were inaccessible to tourists. In some areas they have low human populations and the environment is relatively undisturbed. However, the population around the forest is growing, the forest around the villages is being cleared for agriculture and firewood, and the grasslands at higher levels are used to graze cattle. Mining and hunting are other causes of stress to the environment. Perhaps the main concern of conservationists is that the forests, which are the largest and least fragmented in the region, may be logged. The Itombwe mountains were given a high conservation priority at a World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) conference held in Libreville, Gabon in 2000 since they are a globally important biodiversity region for birds, mammals and reptiles. At first it was expected that they would be covered by a conservation program for the Albertine Rift. By 2006 it had been accepted that they should be included in a program specifically for the DRC. In late 2006 the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN), helped by the (WWF), had managed to obtain a declaration from the DRC Ministry of Environment that created the Itombwe Nature Reserve. The declaration did not define the completely protected core zone, mixed-use zones and development zones but left settlement of the zone boundaries to a later process involving consultation with the local communities. A book published in 2011 said the Itombwe Massif was undergoing severe destruction. Law and order had broken down. People were moving in to grow crops or to mine for gold, diamonds and columbo-tantalite, which is used in semiconductors and computer chips.

It is hypothesized to be a Middle Ordovician impact crater.Suttak, P.A., 2013, High-resolution lake-based magnetic mapping and modeling of basement structures, with examples from Küçükçekmece Lagoon, Turkey and Charity Shoal, Lake Ontario. unpublished MS thesis, School of Geography and Earth Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. 113 pp.  History  On December 5, 1897, the (Steamship) Rosedale grounded upon the rocks of East Charity Shoal in the eastern end of Lake Ontario during a northwest gale.Anderson, K., 2001-2019. East Charity Shoal Lighthouse, Welcome to Lighthousefriends.com! last accessed April 3, 2019. During the summer of 1900, John C. Churchill, Jr. visited Charity Shoal to survey and chart the outlying spur known as East Charity Shoal. It was first mapped in detail as part of a bathymetric map of Lake Ontario that was compiled from historic data sets by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, and the Canadian Hydrographic Service.Virden, WT., J.S. Warren, T.L. Holcombe, D.F. Reid, and T.L. Berggren (1999) Bathymetry of Lake Ontario. National Geophysical Data Center, World Data Center A for Marine Geology & Geophysics, Boulder CO. Rept. MGG–14. Based on this bathymetric map and field investigations, it was first proposed that Charity Creek Crater is an impact crater in 2001. In November 2010 and May 2011, high-resolution bathymetric and acoustic backscatter data were collected from the area of Charity Shoal and a 1 by 1 m grid model of its bathymetry was assembled by the Canadian Hydrographic Service. In July 2012, detailed magnetic and bathymetric surveys were conducted across a area over Charity Shoal.  Morphology  The Charity Shoal Crater is a small oval basin with a circular rim that is approximately in diameter. A continuous rim encircles the crater floor, ranging in water depth from less than 1 m at the Charity Shoal Lighthouse on the eastern rim, to just over at the southernmost juncture of the rim. The exterior slopes of its rim are less steep than its interior slopes. Northeast-southwest trending erosional valleys cut across the southwestern sector of the crater rim. The crater floor is slightly ovoid, with a northwest–southeast-oriented long axis diameter of about and a short axis diameter of about . At its deepest point, this basin is . A low, high, central rise high, ridge divides the interior basin into two separate, small depressions. From the Charity Shoal Crater, a prominent, elongated, and tapering ridge extends about southwestward away from its rim and gives it the appearance of a frying pan. At its shallowest, ridges lies less than below the surface of Lake Ontario. Northwest and southeast of and parallel to this ridge, smaller northwest-southeast-trending ridges lie at depths of . In addition, numerous smaller northeast-southwest trending linear features cut Charity Shoal Crater and cover the entire northeastern end of Lake Ontario. The Charity Shoal Crater and associated ridge both lie upon a broader and larger flat-topped ridge. This larger ridge is one of a series of several N23E-trending ridge segments that lie between Main Duck and Wolfe Islands and just northwest of the Saint Lawrence Channel. The Simcoe Island Channel lies on the opposite side of this ridge. This ridge, the Charity Shoal Crater, and the entire northeast end of Lake Ontario are all crosscut N53E-trending lineations. These lineations, which were likely created by subglacial erosion, form a well-defined en echelon topography that characterize the bottom of Lake Ontario.  Surface geology  The surface of the Charity Shoal Crater consists of a mixture of bedrock, broken bedrock, and lacustrine sediments. The rim of this feature consists of eroded bedrock and patches of broken bedrock. Broken bedrock covers the interior and exterior slopes of the feature. Loose rocks recovered from the inner slope of the west–central portion of the crater rim consisted mainly of sandstone, quartzite, and gneiss that are glacial erratics derived from exposures of Precambrian, Cambrian, and Ordovician strata to the northeast. Of these rocks, two specimens consist of fossiliferous limestone and are thought to be representative of local bedrock. Neither shatter cones nor breccia were reported as having been observed among these rocks. The interior basin of this feature is stiff, varved clay covered with a layer of coarse brown sand about Edsall, T.A. (1990) Surficial substrates and bathymetry of five historical lake trout spawning reefs in nearshore waters of the Great Lakes. Great Lakes Fishery Commission. Ann Arbor, Michigan. 21 pp. Sub-bottom seismic profiles found that at most a maximum of of crudely stratified unconsolidated sediments overlie Ordovician limestones of the Trenton Group. Planar parallel reflections, which are interpreted as laminated (post-glacial-Holocene?) muds and silt, comprise the upper of the crater fill. These sediments overlie an acoustically transparent unit that is largely devoid of reflections. This units represents poorly- stratified unconsolidated sediment that likely consist of sand and gravel. The base of the crater fill is a low relief, symmetric, parabolic-shaped bedrock surface that lies only below the crest of the crater's rim. The ridge that extends southwestward form the crater consists of bedrock that is capped by unstratified gravelly and sandy sediment that resembles a medial moraine. The orientations of this ridge parallels other northwest-southeast-trending ridges, lineations, and features that cut through the rim of the Charity Shoal Crater and the bedrock bottom of Lake Ontario.  Bedrock geology  The bottom of Lake Ontario within the area of the Charity Shoal Crater consists of Middle Ordovician limestone belonging to the Trenton Group. They are hard erosion resistant strata that dip very gently to the southwest. As a result, the Trenton Group forms the lake bottom over a wide area although it is only hundreds of meters thick. These Middle Ordovician strata overlie thin Cambrian sandstones which in turn rest unconformably on Late Proterozoic basement rocks. The basement rocks are part of the Frontenac Terrane of the Grenville Province. Thus, they most likely consists of high-grade gneisses, marble and quartzite. High-resolution multibeam sonar data collected in November 2010 and May 2011 revealed that the rim of the crater consists of undisturbed and unbrecciated bedrock that has been al most completely stripped of sediments and debris by erosion. The sonar data demonstrates that the rim consists of severely eroded bedrock exhibits micro-ridges that are generally less than in relief and spaced generally less than apart, depending on the thicknesses, attitudes, and erosional resistances of the strata. Furthermore, these micro- ridges both parallel the rim itself, and dip away from the rim axis in both directions, revealing a continuous ring anticline with a diameter of . This ring anticline coincides with the crater rim, with rock strata dipping gently in both directions away from the rim axis. The ring anticline is more nearly circular, in contrast to the ovoid shape of the Charity Shoal topographic crater floor. The dips of exposed rock strata are generally gentle and lack any evidence of beds being overturned or even vertical.  Evidence of shock metamorphism  No evidence of shock metamorphism has been reported from the Charity Shoal Crater. This is likely because, in situ samples from the sedimentary strata underlying the layers Middle Ordovician limestone that still cover the rim of this feature have not been collected from it. Drilling and coring of this feature will be required to recover any evidence of shock metamorphism and verify the impact origin of the Charity Shoal Crater.  Origin  The ring anticline that forms the bulk of the rim of the Charity Shoal Crater is interpreted to consist of layers of Middle Ordovician limestone that are draped over the still buried rim of an underlying crater. The microridges are argued to be edges of these limestone beds that have been truncated by erosion, which are presumed to be glacial in nature. Based upon its circular nature, lack of local and regional volcanism, and geophysical anomalies, the Charity Shoal Crater is hypothesized to be an extraterrestrial impact crater. As a result of modelling of data collected during a magnetic survey of this feature, Philip Suttak concluded that Charity Shoal Crater is neither a shallow glacial erosional, nor karst sinkhole. As modelled, the data proved to be most consistent with an impact crater that is in the range of deep and possibly consistent with a diatreme. The ridge that extends southwestward from the crater is judged to represent a till ridge or bedrock fluting (Crag-and-tail feature). Crag-and-tail features are a common occurrence in some drumlin fields. It likely formed below the southwestward flowing Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glaciation. Other streamlined erosional features, e.g. oriented bedrock ridges and troughs, Flat-topped ridges, and bedrock lineations indicate that the bottom of this part of Lake Ontario, including Charity Shoal, have been significantly modified by glacial erosion.  Age  Currently, the age of the Charity Shoal Crater is argued to Middle Ordovician. The presence of continuous and well-defined northeast- trending lineations that cut across both the Charity Shoal Crater and adjacent bedrock indicates that this landform has been significantly eroded by glacial processes and predates the last glacial advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As the existing research indicates that the rim of this crater is draped by layers of Middle Ordovician limestone, the Charity Shoal Crater must be at least as old as the Middle Ordovician. That its rim height is 80 to 90 percent lower than predicted by cratering models indicates that the relief has been diminished by the filling of the central basin with sediments after its formation.

As such it is part of the cardinal virtue of Justice, and falls under obedience to the First Commandment. A moral virtue Thomas Aquinas According to Lactantius and endorsed by St. Augustine \\"religion\\" comes from religare, to bind, and thus it would mean the bond uniting man to God. Thomas Aquinas discusses the virtue of Religion in \\"Summa Theologica\\", II-II, Q. lxxxi. Since order is an aspect of good, and Religion orders man's relationship to God, Aquinas finds it a distinct virtue whose purpose is to render God the worship due to Him as the source of all being. He views the virtue of religion as indispensable for attaining the end to which divine providence has ordained humanity —everlasting happiness in communion with God.Hütter, Reinhart. \\"Happiness and Religion\\", Nova et vetera, Vol. 14, Number 1, Winter 2016, pp. 15-60  10.1353/nov.2016.0018 The virtue of Religion is differentiated from other virtues by its object, which is to offer to God the homage demanded by His entirely singular excellence. It is not a theological virtue, because its immediate object is not God, but rather the reverence to be paid to Him. It entails obedience to the First Commandment.CCC §2135 As a sense of the sacred involves the virtue of Religion, this also pertains to the Second Commandment.CCC §2144 Although its practice is associated with the virtues of faith and charity, theologians generally follow Aquinas in placing it among the moral virtues, as a part of the cardinal virtue Justice, since by it one renders God what is due to Him.Catechism of the Catholic Church, §§1807, 2095 In Luke 4:8 Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 6:13, \\" \\"It is written: 'You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.'\\" Aquinas ranks it first among moral virtues. A religious attitude towards God is essentially the product of one's recognition, not only of His sovereign majesty, but also of one's absolute dependence on Him. Hence we are bound to cherish habitually towards Him sentiments of adoration, praise, thanksgiving, loyalty, and love. Just as Aquinas finds a distinction between naturally acquired and the divinely infused virtues of Temperance, so also he see a separate infused virtue of Religion.IIa IIae, q.81. The virtue of Religion is perfected by the Gift of Piety. Acts of the virtue of Religion Joseph Rickaby The chief acts of this virtue are adoration, prayer, sacrifice, oblation, and vows.Delany, Joseph. \\"Virtue of Religion.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 7 April 2017 Joseph Rickaby describes \\"worship\\" as the recognition of one's dependence upon God. Of course God does not need anyone's worship, whether interior or exterior. It is not because it is strictly speaking of use to Him that one renders it, but because He is infinitely worthy of it.Rickaby, Joseph. Four Square - or the Cardinal Virtues, Joseph T. Wagner, New York, 1908 Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \\"Adoration is the acknowledgement of God as God, creator and savior, the Lord and master of everything that exists as infinite and merciful love.\\"CCC §2096 For Aquinas, devotion results in spiritual joy based on a contemplation of the goodness of God. Although a person may begin to practice Religion out of a sense of duty, the more one reveres God, the more \\"...our mind is subjected to him, wherein our perfection consists, since a thing is perfected by being subject to its superior. Aquinas, ST 11-11, Q.81, art.8 As man is a composite being of both body and soul, his composite nature needs to express itself by outward acts in which the body as well as the soul shall have a part — this not only to spur on one's inner feelings, but also because God owns us body and soul, and it is right that both should show their fealty to Him. This is the justification of external religion. Rickaby borrows a line from the English marriage service. \\"With my body I thee worship\\", and observes that worship is a function of social man. \\"In the order of nature you have first the congregation, then the priest and the altar, expressive of the common desire to adore some power above the community, to whom the community owes allegiance, the worship of whom paid by all in common is the cement of that society.\\" Like other moral virtues, the virtue of Religion is acquired through habit and practice. It is instilled by Sacraments, by prayer, and the company of religious people, not by Catechism alone. The sins against Religion are neglect of prayer, blasphemy, tempting God, sacrilege, perjury, simony, idolatry, and superstition. Since atheism rejects or denies the existence of God, it is a sin against the virtue of religion.CCC §2125 In popular culture According to Anne Abbott, classic films like The Bells of St. Mary's, The Song of Bernadette, Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison and The Reluctant Saint all reflect the virtue of religion, which derives from the dignity of the human person.Abbott, Anne. \\"The Good, the True and the Beautiful on Film\\", National Catholic Register, August 30, 2014 See also * Justice (virtue) References External links * Garrigou-Lagrange O.P., Reginald. \\"Article III - The Moral Virtues\\", The Three Ages of the Interior Life Christian ethics Justice ","title":"Religion (virtue)"},{"id":"34114916","text":"Bassen is a surname.

History 1986-2001 founding and early years In 1986, American Bob Bigelow founded BMC as an assembler and wholesale distributor of Raleigh bicycles. After losing his distributor's license, Bigelow began building bikes under a new BMC label, but it remained a niche brand. In 2001, the company shifted their strategy, turning to greater investment in engineering and design. 2001 - present BMC's relationship to performance cycling began when BMC began supplying the Swiss professional road racing team Phonak with bikes. The team's patron was Andy Rihs, owner of the world-leading hearing-aid company of the same name. Andy Rihs took over BMC in 2000 with the vision of building a carbon production facility in Grenchen, Switzerland to produce the ‘Porsche of race bikes’ and the Impec road bike was created. Having a carbon production facility at its disposal has heavily influenced how BMC approaches bike manufacturing. The facility is now called the Impec Advanced R&D; Lab and it is primarily used for research and development by the company's design and engineering teams. Professional cycling teams and athletes riding BMC's bikes have won the Tour de France, the Tour de Romandie, the Tirreno–Adriatico, the Tour de Wallonie, the Paris–Tours, Critérium International, Paris–Roubaix, and many other high-profile events.

It served as the imperial residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years. Today, it is designated as a national heritage site of China. The area is located northeast of present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. Name The palace was originally known as Yong'an Palace but was renamed to Daming Palace in 635. In 662, after renovations to the palace, it was renamed Penglai Palace. In 670, it was renamed Hanyuan Palace or Yuan Palace. Eventually, in 701, the name was changed to Daming Palace again. History The former royal residence was the Taiji Palace (), built in the previous Sui dynasty. In 632, chancellor Ma Zhou charged that the retired Emperor Gaozu was living in Da'an Palace () to the west, which he considered an inhospitable place as it was built on low-lying lands of Chang'an that was plagued by dampness and heat during the summer. According to him, ever since Emperor Taizong moved to the countryside during the summers, his retired father was left behind in Chang'an to suffer in the summer heat. However, his father would always decline any invitation from Emperor Taizong to spend the summer together. Ever since the bloody palace coup of the Xuanwu Gate Incident in 626, it seemed that father and son had drifted apart to an extent that their relationship never healed. In 634, Emperor Taizong launched the construction of the Daming Palace at Longshou Plateau. He ordered the construction of the summer palace for his retired father, Emperor Gaozu, as an act of filial piety. However, Emperor Gaozu grew ill and never witnessed the palace's completion before his death in 635, and construction halted thereafter. Empress Wu commissioned the court architect Yan Liben to design the palace in 660 and construction commenced once again in 662. In 663, the construction of the palace was completed under the reign of Emperor Gaozong. Emperor Gaozong had launched the extension of the palace with the construction of the Hanyuan Hall in 662, which was finished in 663. On 5 June 663, the imperial family began to relocate from the Taiji Palace into the yet to be completed Daming Palace, which became the new seat of the imperial court and political center of the empire. Layout and function Map of ruins Hanyuan Hall's platform Beginning from the south and ending in the north, on the central axis, stand the Hanyuan Hall, the Xuanzheng Hall, and the Zichen Hall. These halls were historically known as the \\"Three Great Halls\\" and were respectively part of the outer, middle, and inner court. The central southern entrance of the Daming Palace is the Danfeng Gate. The gate consisted of five doorways. Outer court Hanyuan Hall's platform After passing through the Danfeng Gate, there is a square of 630 meters long with at the end the Hanyuan Hall. The Hanyuan Hall was connected to pavilions by corridors, namely the Xiangluan Pavilion in the east and the Qifeng Pavilion in the west. The pavilions were composed of three outward-extending sections of the same shape but different size that were connected by corridors. The elevated platform of the Hanyuan Hall is approximately 15 meters high, 200 meters wide, and 100 meters long. The Hanyuan Hall, where many state ceremonies were conducted, would serve as the main hall for hosting foreign ambassadors during diplomatic exchanges. Middle court The Xuanzheng Hall is located at a distance of about 300 meters north of the Hanyuan Hall. State affairs were usually conducted in this hall. The office of the secretariat was located to the west of the Xuanzheng Hall and the office of the chancellery was located to the east. From this area, structured in a Three Departments and Six Ministries system, the Department of State Affairs, the Chancellery, and the Secretariat handled the central management of the Tang empire. Inner court Model of the Linde Hall Linde Hall's platform The Zichen Hall, located in the inner court, is approximately 95 meters north of the Xuanzheng Hall. It housed the central government offices. For officials, it was considered a great honor to be summoned to the Zichen Hall. The Taiye Pool, also known as the Penglai Pool, is north of the Zichen Hall. The former gardens that surround the pond and island have been recreated, based on the historical record, with peony, chrysanthemum, plum, rose, bamboo, almond, peach, and persimmon gardens.China Daily. \\"Brief Introduction of Daming Palace National Heritage Park\\". 2010. Accessed 15 November 2013. The Linde Hall is located to the west of the lake. It served as a place for banquets, performances, and religious rites. It consisted of three halls—a front, middle, and rear hall—adjacent to each other. An imperial park could be found north of the palace complex. The Sanqing Hall was located in the northeast corner the Daming Palace and served as a Taoist temple for the imperial family. Border The area around the palace complex grounds is currently planted with locust trees, willows, flowers, and bushes on all sides. Heritage Stone inscription discovered in 1956 that commemorates the building of the Hanguang Hall (含光殿) and a polo field in the Daming Palace in 831. The site of the Daming Palace was discovered in 1957. Between 1959 and 1960, the earliest surveys and excavations of the Hanyuan Hall site were carried out by the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Preventive conservation measures of the Hanyuan Hall site began in 1993. From 1994 to 1996, for the restoration and preservation of the site, numerous surveys and excavations were conducted. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) and UNESCO drew up and adopted a two-phased plan by 24 July 1995 to safeguard the Hanyuan Hall site. Work on the project started in 1995 by the joint effort of the Chinese government, Chinese and Japanese institutes, UNESCO, and various specialists. Most of the conservation work concluded in 2003. On 1 October 2010, the Daming Palace National Heritage Park was opened to the public. There are many exhibition halls located throughout the site of the palace complex to showcase the excavated cultural relics of the site.

Initiating the movement was writer Ayu Utami's best-selling first novel, Saman (1998), a contemporary view of Indonesian society published two weeks before the downfall of President Suharto. Large numbers of similar works by young women have followed. Label The controversial label \\"sastra wangi\\" originated among predominantly male critics in the early 2000s to categorize such young, female writers as Ayu Utami, Dewi Lestari, Fira Basuki and Djenar Maesa Ayu. > \\"There’s always a tendency to categorize literary work, and sastra wangi is > one such category ... The media came up with [the name] because we weren’t > the typical writers who used to lead the local literary scene. Beyond that, > I don’t know the meaning or significance of sastra wangi.\\" --Ayu Utami Feminist writer Julia Suryakusuma notes that reception of the label has been mixed. Those against the label argue that it demeans women, as if it \\"implies the authors are secondary and unintellectual, producing inferior works popular only because of looks and sensuality\\". Despite the controversy, the sastra wangi label has resulted in publicity and focused attention on the writers' style, word use and subject matter. Suryakusuma writes that \\"they cross sectors of class, ethnicity and religion, do not bear the psychological, political and ideological burdens of the New Order and explore daring sexual themes -- taboo-breaking even.\\" The label has met with criticism from the writers themselves. Djenar Maesa Ayu, known for works such as Jangan Main-main Dengan Kelaminmu and Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!, considers the categorization \\"a kind of sexual harassment of her work\\". Mariana Amiruddin, manager of the women's magazine Jurnal Perempuan, argues that the label categorizes women based on their bodies, and as such does not consider their work as serious as that of male authors. History The sastra wangi movement is generally considered to have been initiated by Ayu Utami with her novel Saman. Arising after a period of heavy repression during Suharto's New Order government, the work inspired other young women writers to publish similarly-themed works, including poems, short stories, and novels. Critics - mostly male - labeled the nascent movement \\"sastra wangi\\" and took offense to the lack of femininity in the works. Utami's first novel, which fused sex and politics, was regarded as introducing a dramatic Indonesian literature, and led other young female writers such as Djenar Maesa Ayu and Fira Basuki to boldly take on subjects once considered forbidden for women. Utami herself has continued to write works with similar themes. Themes and commonalities A. Junaidi and Suryakusuma, writing in The Jakarta Post, note that sastra wangi writers have several things in common. The works tend to be launched in cafes and bookstores, with celebrities and reporters invited. The writers themselves are younger women, generally entering the industry around the age of 30, and often physically attractive. The works usually deal openly with sexuality, traditionally a taboo subject in Indonesian women's literature. This includes homosexuality. Suryakusuma notes that the traditional patriarchal view of sex, with the man as the subject and woman as the object, is reversed in these works, with women aggressively seeking and enjoying sex. The diction can be explicit, with terms such as 'penis' and 'vagina' being common. The diction and subject matter are often \\"shocking\\". Although works from a female perspective have been common in Indonesian literature, with works by Nh. Dini from the 1970s including references to sexuality, they were generally within the realm of social mores; the sastra wangi movement tends to go against these mores. Reception M. Taufiqurrahman, writing in The Jakarta Post, notes that several works by the sastra wangi movement have been well-received internationally. Suryakusuma notes that the sastra wangi works have \\"spearheaded literary development\\" in Indonesia since Saman was released. Although historically, Indonesian literature has not been very commercial within the country, with most novels selling only several thousand copies and even large publishers only producing print runs of 3,000 or less, works by Djenar Maesa Ayu and Ayu Utami have sold tens of thousands of copies. Saman itself sold 100,000 copies. Poet Taufiq Ismail was heavily opposed to the sastra wangi movement, writing that \\"genital literature had gone too far\\". Meanwhile, novelist and literary scholar Sapardi Djoko Damono wrote that the future of Indonesian literature was \\"in the hands of women writers.\\" Notable members and works *Ana Maryam :*Mata Matahari (Eye of the Sun; 2003) *Ayu Utami :*Saman (1999) :*Larung (2001) :*Bilangan FU (2008) *Dewi \\"Dee\\" Lestari :*Supernova trilogy * Dinar Rahayu :*Ode Untuk Leopold von Sacher Masoch (An Ode to Leopold von Sacher Masoch; 2002) *Djenar Maesa Ayu :*Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!

He was a close associate of Former Shu's founding emperor Wang Jian and held great power during Wang Jian's reign. This brought him into conflict with Wang Jian's son and crown prince Wang Yuanying. In 913, with both he and Wang Yuanying suspecting the other of being ready to launch a mutiny, their forces engaged in a battle at the Former Shu capital Chengdu. He was defeated by Wang Yuanying and killed in battle.  During Tang Dynasty  It is not known when Tang Daoxi was born, but it is known that he was from Lang Prefecture (閬州, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan). His father Tang Feng () was a merchant. It is not clear when he first became a follower of Wang Jian, but it was said that he was initially a dancer boy for Wang and became favored by Wang for his handsomeness, but later became even more trusted by Wang due to his ability to plan and carry out plots.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (十國春秋), vol. 46. As of 902, by which time Wang was the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and controlled several other nearby circuits, Tang was serving as the commander of Wang's cavalry guards. That year, when Wang Jian became suspicious of his officer and adoptive son Wang Zongdi, it was Tang whom Wang Jian ordered to get Wang Zongdi drunk and then strangle Wang Zongdi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. At some point, Tang became the defender (防禦使, Fangyushi) of his home prefecture Lang Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266.  During Former Shu  In 907, Tang Dynasty's last emperor Emperor Ai was forced to yield the throne to the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with Zhu as its Emperor Taizu. Wang Jian, along with several other regional warlords (Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu)) refused to recognize the new Later Liang emperor, and Wang Jian and Yang issued a declaration urging the people to rise against Later Liang. However, when they did not receive a positive response from other regional governors, Wang Jian decided to declare himself emperor of a new state of Former Shu. As part of a series of personnel commissions after he declared himself emperor, Wang recalled Tang Daoxi from Lang Prefecture to serve as the director of palace communications (Shumishi). Tang soon came into a conflict with Wang Zongji, the oldest of Wang Jian's adoptive sons, who initially became a chancellor in Wang Jian's regime and was trying to aggrandize his power based on his past military accomplishments. Wang Zongji was said to be arrogant, and he offended Tang by continuing to call Tang by his name despite Tang's having reached the high position of director of palace communications. Tang thus resented him, but outwardly tried to appear friendly and subservient to Wang Zongji. Wang Jian himself eventually became apprehensive of Wang Zongji since Wang Zongji had many associates, and therefore, in 908, gave Wang Zongji the highly honorable position Taishi () but removed him from chancellorship. Resentful of his removal, Wang Zongji was said to continue to foster his group of followers and consider a coup. Further, challenging Wang Jian's initial failure to name an heir — as Wang Jian created his second son Wang Zongyi the Prince of Sui but did not create him crown prince (Wang Jian's oldest biological son Wang Zongren () was disabled and therefore considered by Wang Jian to be unfit to serve as heir), Wang Zongji submitted an irreverent petition to Wang Jian: Wang Jian was incensed, but did not initially publicly express displeasure. When he discussed the matter with Tang, Tang, in order to inflame him more, stated, \\"Zongji's reputation is so grand such that both people inside and outside the palace fear him. He would be a suitable commander.\\" This caused Wang Jian to be further suspicious of Wang Zongji. Soon thereafter, on an occasion Wang Zongji was in the palace to greet Wang Jian, Wang Zongji spoke arrogantly. When Wang Jian rebuked him, he refused to yield. Wang Jian, in anger, ordered the guards to batter him to death. Soon thereafter, Wang Jian created Wang Zongyi crown prince. Tang thereafter developed an enmity with the crown prince as well, as Wang Zongyi liked to humiliate the Former Shu officials and did humiliate Tang by apparently repeatedly referring to Tang's past as a dancing boy. Tang and Wang Zongyi made accusations against each other, and Wang Jian, not wanting to see this conflict growing larger, in 910 commissioned Tang the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and gave him the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Tang initially recommended Zheng Xu () to succeed himself as the director of palace communications, but once Zheng took office, he began to investigate Tang's brothers for embezzlement. Tang, in fear, made a report to Wang Jian stating that Zheng was intolerant and impatient, and should not be director of palace communications. Wang Jian therefore replaced Zheng with Pan Kang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In spring 911, angry that Li Maozhen's state of Qi had gathered troops near its borders with Former Shu, Wang Jian decided to launch an attack on Qi. He commissioned his adoptive son Wang Zongkan () as the overall commander of the operations, and made Tang one of the three commanders under Wang Zongkan, along with his adoptive sons Wang Zongyou () and Wang Zonghe (). Meanwhile, in summer 911, Qi forces made an exploratory attack on Xingyuan Municipality (), the capital for Shannan West (by this point known simply as Shannan); Tang repelled them. However, in fall 911, Li Maozhen sent the general Liu Zhijun and his nephew Li Jichong () to attack Former Shu, engaging the Former Shu force commanded by Wang Zongkan at Qingni Height (青泥嶺, in modern Hanzhong) and defeating them. Tang fled back to Xingyuan, while Wang Zongkan and Wang Zonghe fled to Anyuan Base (安遠軍, in modern Hanzhong). Liu and Li Jichong put Anyuan and Xingyuan under siege, and Tang's staff advised him to abandon Xingyuan. Tang, pointing out that abandoning Xingyuan would cause Anyuan and Li Prefecture (利州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) to fall as well, vowed to defend Xingyuan to his death. Wang Jian, hearing of the defeat at Qingni Height, sent his nephew Wang Zonghui () and adoptive son Wang Zongbo () to aid Anyuan Base. Subsequently, they, along with Tang, counterattacked and defeated Qi forces. When Wang Jian himself subsequently arrived with a relief force as well, Qi forces withdrew. In 913, Tang was recalled from Shannan and again assumed the position of director of palace communications. This drew a vehement opposition from Wang Zongyi (who had been renamed Wang Yuanying), who accused him of crimes. Wang Jian was displeased with Wang Yuanying's accusations, but still relieved Tang from his position and made him Taizi Shaobao (), a senior advisor to Wang Yuanying. In fall 913, Wang Jian planned a vacation away from Chengdu for the Qixi Festival (on August 11 that year). The night before (August 10), Wang Yuanying held a feast for the imperial princes and high-level officials, but three invitees — Wang Jian's adoptive son Wang Zonghan () the Prince of Ji, and the officials Pan Qiao (who succeeded Tang Daoxi as the director of palace communications) and Mao Wenxi (the chief imperial scholar) — did not attend. Wang Yuanying, in anger, accused Pan and Mao in absentia of alienating his brothers from him. Meanwhile, Wang Yuanying's trusted officers Xu Yao () and Chang Qian () were gazing at Tang. Tang, in fear, fled from the feast. The morning next day (August 11, the date of the Qixi Festival), Wang Yuanying went to see his father Wang Jian and accused Pan and Mao of alienating him from his brothers. Wang Jian, believing the accusations, ordered Pan and Mao demoted, making Pan Kang () the new director of palace communications. However, after Wang Yuanying then left the palace, Tang arrived, and Tang made the counteraccusation that Wang Yuanying was planning to rebel, and, as part of his planning, was planning to put the princes and the officials under arrest. Wang Jian, with his suspicions aroused, cancelled the Qixi vacation plans. Further, he agreed to Tang's request to mobilize the regular troops to defend the palace (rather than the imperial guards, who were formally under Wang Yuanying's command). Upon hearing that the regular troops had been mobilized, Wang Yuanying mobilized his own Tianwu Army (). He arrested Pan Qiao and Mao and almost battered them to death, in addition to arresting Pan Jiao () the mayor of Chengdu. The next day (August 12), Xu, Chang, and Yan Lin (), under Wang Yuanying's direction, attacked Tang's forces. Tang initially resisted, but tried to retreat when an arrow hit him. The crown prince's troops then routed his, killing him, and many of the troops under Tang were killed. However, subsequently, the imperial guards defeated Wang Yuanying's troops, and he fled and went into hiding. He was eventually killed in hiding and reduced to commoner rank posthumously, while Tang was posthumously honored Taishi and given the posthumous name Zhongzhuang (忠壯, \\"faithful and died on the field\\").

Based on the short story, \\"D'Artagnan of Kansas\\" by E. P. Lyle, Jr., the film was produced by and stars Douglas Fairbanks. A now complete and restored print of the film still exists and is currently in the public domain.Progressive Silent Film List: A Modern Musketeer at silentera.com Plot The film opens with a sequence in which D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \\"richest man in Yonkers\\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \\"Park Avenue flapper\\" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Lobby card Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party (with Elsie in the front seat beside him) to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies. John Blabb, who works for \\"Town Topics\\", informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere. Meanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored. He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife (his last \\"wife\\" is shown to have committed suicide). He goes to the resort, pretending to be a guide, and selects Elsie as his target. Ned is suspicious, but Vandeteer hires him. Vandeteer and Elsie set out for a horse ride down the canyon with their guide. Ned uses the time to persuade Mrs. Dodge that her daughter's happiness should take priority over their financial security. James Brown, a member of the gang who knows and hates Vandeteer, gleefully tells Ned about the man's impending demise and Chin-de- dah's intentions toward Elsie. Ned shames him into helping with a rescue. They reach the camp in time to free Elsie and Vandeteer, but remain in peril. Vandeteer offers Ned $100,000 to save his life; Ned makes him put it in writing. Then they are lifted up the sheer cliff by a rope pulled by a horse. Once they are safe, Brown wants to kill Vandeteer, who falsely incriminated him in Vandeteer's own scam and stole his wife and children. Vandeteer ends up clinging to the cliffside, kept from falling to his death only by Ned's grip. Under Ned's direction, he writes a note exonerating Brown. Ned persuades Brown to let Vandeteer live, and promises to split the reward with him. Once they are alone, Elsie kisses her rescuer.

Additional scenes were shot at Canyon de Chelly near Chinle, Arizona and at the Jesse Lasky Studios in Los Angeles. Reception Like many American films of the time, A Modern Musketeer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of the two intertitles \\"The boss has gone for another woman\\" and \\"Remember the last woman\\", three scenes of young woman in cave including and following her suicide, and the shooting scene where a man falls. Preservation and restoration The majority of A Modern Musketeer was long presumed lost as only partial 35mm print of the film that Douglas Fairbanks donated to the Museum of Modern Art was known to exist. The missing footage was later discovered by the Danish Film Institute. The DFI and the Museum of Modern Art restored the film with the newly discovered footage and the preserved print.

Career Ljunggren was born in Kristiania and finished his secondary education in 1925. He studied at the University of Oslo, earning a master's degree in 1931 under the supervision of Thoralf Skolem, and found employment as a secondary school mathematics teacher in Bergen, following Skolem who had moved in 1930 to the Chr. Michelsen Institute there. While in Bergen, Ljunggren continued his studies, earning a dr.philos. from the University of Oslo in 1937. In 1938 he moved to work as a teacher at Hegdehaugen in Oslo. In 1943 he became a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and he also joined the Selskapet til Vitenskapenes Fremme. He was appointed as a docent at the University of Oslo in 1948, but in 1949 he returned to Bergen as a professor at the recently founded University of Bergen. He moved back to the University of Oslo again in 1956, where he served until his death in 1973 in Oslo. Research Ljunggren's research concerned number theory, and in particular Diophantine equations. He showed that Ljunggren's equation, :X2 = 2Y4 − 1\\\\. has only the two integer solutions (1,1) and (239,13);. however, his proof was complicated, and after Louis J. Mordell conjectured that it could be simplified, simpler proofs were published by several other authors.... Ljunggren also posed the question of finding the integer solutions to the Ramanujan–Nagell equation :2n − 7 = x2 (or equivalently, of finding triangular Mersenne numbers) in 1943,. independently of Srinivasa Ramanujan who had asked the same question in 1913.

She is the founder and CEO of International Dialogue Education Associates, Inc., a business seminar company based in Palo Alto, California. She has authored several business communication and negotiation books and designed the three-day business seminar “Influencing with Integrity”.  Biography  Laborde’s doctoral degree is from the University of California at Santa Barbara. Her major discipline was Confluent Education, which is Gestalt psychology applied to the educational process. The Confluent Education program was founded by a Ford Foundation Grant for Innovative Education. Laborde’s Master of Arts degree in Creative Writing was conferred by Tulane University, and her Bachelor of Arts in Design and Fine Art was earned at Louisiana State University.  Influences  Interested by the new esoteric classes offered at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California which formed a key part of the Human Potential Movement of the 1960s, during the 1970s she studied with many of the leaders of this movement including George Leonard, Alan Watts, George I. Brown, Gay Luce, Frank Barron, Buckminster Fuller, Joseph Campbell, Joseph Downing, Barbara Brennan, and received Arica Training.  Career  In 1984, Laborde published the communication and negotiation book Influencing with Integrity: Management Skills for Communication and Negotiation, which sold over 151,000 copies and was translated into several languages. The book’s instructional content supports her three-day Influencing with Integrity seminar. The skills taught in the seminar are drawn from Gestalt psychology, linguistics, and right brain insights. While some of the skills overlap with those of neuro-linguistic programming, Laborde emphasizes the psychological principles of Fritz Perls as well as the concrete and theoretical differences between integrity and manipulation in business communication and actions. In 1991, Laborde traveled to Russia on invitation from the Russian Psychological Association to teach seminars which included research demonstrating a statistically important movement towards increased personal responsibility as shown by the pre- and post-test figures. Her communication and negotiation seminars have been taught at the United Nations as well as worldwide. Laborde has produced video training films and courses on her influencing and communication techniques. In 2011 her company International Dialogue Education Associates, Inc. released its first iPhone application “Circle of Excellence”. During the course of her career, Laborde has been a member of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Humanistic Psychology, and the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD).

She is also called Uta of Naumburg as the subject of a famous donor portrait by the Naumburg Master.  Life  Little is known of Uta's descent. She was probably the sister of the Saxon count Esico of Ballenstedt, who became the progenitor of the Ascanian dynasty. One Count Adalbert of Ballenstedt and Hidda, a daughter of the Lusatian margrave Odo I (965-993), are commonly reckoned as their parents, however, these names are not recorded in contemporary sources. According to 13th century Naumburg chronicles, Uta's father married her off to Eckard II in around 1026, the younger brother of Margrave Herman I of Meissen — presumably for political reasons, in order to further promote the rise of the Ascanian dynasty. Eckard, a loyal supporter of the Salian king Henry III, succeeded his brother-in-law Theoderic II as Margrave of Lusatia and in 1038 also assumed the rule in Meissen upon the death of his elder brother. However, his marriage with Uta remained without issue, resulting in the extinction of the Ekkeharding dynasty. When Uta died, her husband donated large parts of her dowry to the convent of Gernrode in Uta's home country, where her sister Hacheza had been appointed abbess by King Henry III in 1044. The remaining estates fell to Empress Agnes of Poitou.  Portrait  Uta was among the donators of Naumburg Cathedral, therefore a painted statue was erected in her honour in the 13th century. The Early Gothic west choir was built with an elevated gallery portraying the founders. The life-sized representation of a group of 12 people of the high nobility that were neither emperor nor king is unique in art history. Similar to the Bamberg Horseman, the individual depiction, part of a semicircle of twelve donor portraits, is today generally considered a masterpiece of Gothic art. From the early 20th century onwards, the idealised picture of Uta with the distinctive collar upturned was published in numerous art history and travel guides, becoming an icon of the \\"genuine\\" German character and culture — often contrasted with the Naumburg statue of Margravine Regelinda as the stereotypical \\"smiling Polish woman\\". Her portrait was appropriated by the Nazi regime as a counter-image to so-called \\"degenerate art\\"; it appeared as an \\"Aryan\\" role model in Fritz Hippler's film The Eternal Jew and as a SS cult object in World War II propaganda.Ullrich, Wolfgang: Naumburger Dom: Uta, das Ewige Deutschland, Zeit Online, 23 February 2011 The statue possibly inspired the character of the Evil Queen in Disney's 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Heinrich, Michael.

James was something of a favourite of his uncle Thomas, who is said to have encouraged him to pursue a legal career. The Dowdall family, originally called Dovedale, came to Ireland from the valley of Dovedale in Derbyshire. There main estates were at Newtown, County Louth and Termonfeckin. Other notable family members included Sir Robert Dowdall, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas in the previous century, and Robert's son Thomas Dowdall, Master of the Rolls in Ireland.Ball, F.

Life  Margaret was a daughter of the Duke Frederick II of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1418–1478) from his marriage to Magdalene (1412–1454), the daughter of Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg. In 1452, Margaret became the third wife of the Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1412–1466). As a dowry she brought with her , which her husband doubled. After her husband's death, she lived on her jointure in Plau am See, which Henry had promised to her. With the death of her stepson Ulrich II the Mecklenburg-Stargard line died out and the indebted country fell to Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was not responsible for the maintenance of Stargard's widow. Margaret then lived in Celle for a while. The dispute between the houses of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Mecklenburg-Schwerin about her jointure at Plau am See dragged on until her death. Margaret spent her 46-year-long widowhood in abject poverty. In letters to their relatives, they said that they would suffer even hunger and thirst. In 1499 she was, under pressure from the Dukes of Brunswick, admitted as a permanent resident to Wienhausen Abbey. She was financially supported by her sister Anna, the widow of her brother Otto V, who sent her only 12 guilders per year. She died on 8 April 1512 in Wienhausen and was buried there in the Chapel of All Saints.  Issue  From her marriage Margaret had two daughters: * Magdalene (1454–1532) : married firstly, in 1475, with Duke Wartislaw X of Pomerania (1435–1478) : married secondly, in 1482, with Count Burkhard of Barby-Mühlingen (d. 1505) * Anna (1465–1498), a nun in Ribnitz Monastery  Ancestors   References  * Verein für Mecklenburgische Geschichte und Alterthumskunde, Schwerin: Mecklenburgische Jahrbücher, vols. 24–25, 1859, p. 33 ff. * Martina Schattkowsky: Witwenschaft in der frühen Neuzeit: fürstliche und adlige Witwen zwischen Fremd- und Selbstbestimmung, Leipziger Universitätsverlag, 2003, p. 106  External links  * http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1450.htm * http://www.emecklenburg.de/Niklot/i0392.htm 1442 births 1512 deaths Margaret Duchesses of Mecklenburg-Stargard 15th- century German people Women of medieval Germany Margaret ","title":"Margaret of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1442–1512)"},{"id":"34115448","text":"In statistics, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) is a measure of the strength of the linear or non-linear association between two variables X and Y. The MIC belongs to the maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) class of statistics. In a simulation study, MIC outperformed some selected low power tests, however concerns have been raised regarding reduced statistical power in detecting some associations in settings with low sample size when compared to powerful methods such as distance correlation and Heller–Heller–Gorfine (HHG). Comparisons with these methods, in which MIC was outperformed, were made in Simon and TibshiraniNoah Simon and Robert Tibshirani, Comment on “Detecting Novel Associations in Large Data Sets” by Reshef et al., Science Dec. 16, 2011 and in Gorfine, Heller, and Heller. It is claimed that MIC approximately satisfies a property called equitability which is illustrated by selected simulation studies. It was later proved that no non-trivial coefficient can exactly satisfy the equitability property as defined by Reshef et al.,Equitability, mutual information, and the maximal information coefficient by Justin B. Kinney, Gurinder S. Atwal, arXiv Jan. 31, 2013 although this result has been challenged. Some criticisms of MIC are addressed by Reshef et al. in further studies published on arXiv.Equitability Analysis of the Maximal Information Coefficient, with Comparisons by David Reshef, Yakir Reshef, Michael Mitzenmacher, Pardis Sabeti, arXiv Jan. 27, 2013  Overview  The maximal information coefficient uses binning as a means to apply mutual information on continuous random variables. Binning has been used for some time as a way of applying mutual information to continuous distributions; what MIC contributes in addition is a methodology for selecting the number of bins and picking a maximum over many possible grids. The rationale is that the bins for both variables should be chosen in such a way that the mutual information between the variables be maximal. That is achieved whenever \\\\mathrm{H}\\\\left(X_b\\\\right)=\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\left(Y_b\\\\right)=\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\left(X_b,Y_b\\\\right).The \\"b\\" subscripts have been used to emphasize that the mutual information is calculated using the bins Thus, when the mutual information is maximal over a binning of the data, we should expect that the following two properties hold, as much as made possible by the own nature of the data. First, the bins would have roughly the same size, because the entropies \\\\mathrm{H}(X_b) and \\\\mathrm{H}(Y_b) are maximized by equal-sized binning. And second, each bin of X will roughly correspond to a bin in Y. Because the variables X and Y are reals, it is almost always possible to create exactly one bin for each (x,y) datapoint, and that would yield a very high value of the MI. To avoid forming this kind of trivial partitioning, the authors of the paper propose taking a number of bins n_x for X and n_y whose product is relatively small compared with the size N of the data sample. Concretely, they propose: n_x\\\\times n_y \\\\leq \\\\mathrm{N}^{0.6} In some cases it is possible to achieve a good correspondence between X_b and Y_b with numbers as low as n_x=2 and n_y=2, while in other cases the number of bins required may be higher. The maximum for \\\\mathrm{I}(X_b;Y_b) is determined by H(X), which is in turn determined by the number of bins in each axis, therefore, the mutual information value will be dependent on the number of bins selected for each variable. In order to compare mutual information values obtained with partitions of different sizes, the mutual information value is normalized by dividing by the maximum achieveable value for the given partition size. It is worth noting that a similar adaptive binning procedure for estimating mutual information had been proposed previously. Entropy is maximized by uniform probability distributions, or in this case, bins with the same number of elements. Also, joint entropy is minimized by having a one-to-one correspondence between bins. If we substitute such values in the formula I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y), we can see that the maximum value achieveable by the MI for a given pair n_x,n_y of bin counts is \\\\log\\\\min\\\\left(n_x,n_y\\\\right). Thus, this value is used as a normalizing divisor for each pair of bin counts. Last, the normalized maximal mutual information value for different combinations of n_x and n_y is tabulated, and the maximum value in the table selected as the value of the statistic. It is important to note that trying all possible binning schemes that satisfy n_x\\\\times n_y \\\\leq \\\\mathrm{N}^{0.6} is computationally unfeasible even for small n. Therefore, in practice the authors apply a heuristic which may or may not find the true maximum.

The British captured her and took her in 1782 into the Royal Navy as HMS Espion. The Royal Navy sold her in 1783. French service Espion was one of the last of the Levrette-class cutters of Royal French Navy, built by Jacques and Daniel Denys at Dunkirk, and launched on 22 June 1781. On 7 December she and Sagittaire sailed as escorts to a convoy of ten transports taking supplies to the fleet of Admiral de Grasse at Martinique.Dunmore (2007), p. 140. The convoy arrived safely in January and from there sailed to bring shells to the forces under François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé, which were Basseterre, the chief port and capital of St Kitts. On 24 January 1782 she encountered a British fleet under Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, which was sailing to try to relieve St Kitts. The sixth-rate frigate captured Espion near Nevis. Her captain was the Knight of Malta Lieutenant de Vaiseau Chevalier de Montluc de la Bourdonnaye.Gardiner (1905), p. 142. Hood described her as a large cutter, seven months old, and armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns. Hood sailed on to Basseterre but the delay occasioned in capturing Espion gave de Grasse time to get out to sea. Although Hood was unable to relieve the siege, he was able to goad de Grasse into three futile attacks on the British fleet on 25 and 26 January. These attacks cost the British 172 men killed and 244 wounded; the French evacuated some 1000 wounded to Sint Eustatius.Cust (1858), Vol. 3, pp. 316–318. Hood then sailed away to Barbados. The Brimstone Hill redoubt at St Kitts surrendered on 13 February. Hood and Admiral George Rodney then met and defeated de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes in early-April. Fate The British took Espion into service under her existing name and commissioned her on 24 January under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Sevell Shivers. She then sailed for Britain in September 1782. The Admiralty sold Espion in April 1783.

Yale - Once the metropolis of the Fraser River, at least two hundred miners lost their lives along the banks of this river in the rush to make their fortune around Yale. 8\\\\. Quesnel Forks - Now a Cariboo ghost town, Quesnel Forks produced immense riches. Two Chinese miners made so much that they returned to their country as multimillionaires. 9\\\\. Atlin - An old dying miner whispered the whereabouts of his source of gold, causing gold fever and a rush to the Atlin district. The area still hides some treasure secrets. 10\\\\. Border Country - Empire builder James J. Hill figures prominently in the story of Border Country, a big man who when fire threatened his office saved his records by throwing his three hundred pound desk out a window. 11\\\\. Granite City - This area was rich in gold and platinum, but at 25 cents a pound, some miners buried their platinum until it was worth more. Some of these caches are being discovered today! 12\\\\. Camp McKinney - Two large gold bars were stolen during a hold up near Camp McKinney, and although the robber was found, the gold remains hidden. 13\\\\. Gold Panning Trip - Mike and Bill venture out to a creek in the Okanagan to try their luck at panning for gold....with some success! Season 2 14\\\\.

Writing On Stone - Bill and Mike leave B.C. for the Milk River Country of Southern Alberta. The badlands are the sources for several interesting stories. 19\\\\. Chinese Miners - The Chinese miners were famous for their skills as placer miners. They reworked areas left by white prospectors and didn't miss much gold. 20\\\\. Slocan City - Unbelievable riches in silver produced some of the classic towns of the era. \\"Cayuse Brown\\" and \\"The Yellow Kid\\" are just two of the characters Bill brings back to life, along with the story of the Golden Wedge Treasure. 21\\\\. The Kettle Valley Railway - A look at the history of the now extinct railway in B.C.'s southern interior and at the life of Andrew McCulloch, the man who masterminded the construction of the line and especially the building of the tunnels and huge trestles. 22\\\\. Lost Golden Plate - This story takes place in Western Ferry County and Eastern Okanogan County in Washington State. Ferry was known as the toughest town this side of Hell. The area was home to some amazing characters. 23\\\\. Ainsworth - It's known as the oldest mining town in the West Kootenay. The miners were attracted by the silver, lead and zinc ore that was so plentiful. Characters like \\"Let'er Go Gallagher\\" all make up the story of Ainsworth on Kootenay Lake. 24\\\\. Wildhorse Creek - Gold was discovered in this area on the western side of the Rockies in 1863. The find was substantial enough to spur the building of the Dewdney Trail. Trouble between the miners and local Indians brought Sam Steele and The Northwest Mounted Police into the region. 25\\\\. Moyie - The Sullivan Mine gets most of the attention as the richest silver mine in the world, but Moyie has many other fascinating stories. Among them how a Catholic priest was involved in a silver find in order to build a new church. 26\\\\. Ymir - Not much remains of this once wealthy mining town that had the reputation of being one of the toughest mining towns of the Pacific Slope, and it may hide some riches yet. Season 3 27 Salmo - The gold produced in the Salmo area was so rich that several mines thought nothing of allowing thousands of ounces of fine gold to be washed away in their operation's tailings. 28 Stikine River Country - In Northern B.C. hundreds of men passed through this area on their way to the Klondike. Through photographs we see one man's impression of this overland route to the Klondike. 29 Northport - A wealth of silver lay buried near Northport Washington, this once booming town that continued to grow although it suffered through several great fires. 30 Eholt - Started up in the 1890s, this town in the Boundary Country grew rapidly. During its heyday, trains ran 24 hours a day to get ore to the smelters in Grand Forks. 31 Three Forks - Three Forks appeared suddenly in the Silvery Slocan, and it vanished almost as suddenly. A story of how a hidden treasure was found is examined. 32 Fritz Augustus Heinze - This colourful character was known for working his mines with a top hat on. He made a fortune in Montana, but sensed greater opportunities north of the border and came to the Kootenays. 33 K & S Railway - James J. Hill, one of the C.P.R.'s biggest rivals, built this small but vital railway in some of the most treacherous country in the west. 34 Rock Creek - This creek near Beaverdell was the source of great riches. Half pound gold nuggets were known to have been found by some miners. 35 Ashcroft - This town was established along the Cariboo Road. It was known as the transportation capital of the interior, but when the railroad came through the town began to decline. 36 Hedley - The mine in Hedley was established on the treacherous terrain of Nickelplate Mountain. Footage of the mine, which produced by today's figures $750 million, is featured. 37 Midway - This town situated midway between the Rockies and the Pacific, saw its share of tough customers, rustlers, and gamblers. It was the sight of The Midway War, a clash of two rival Railroads. 38 Keremeos - The story of how three towns known as Keremeos became one and the unusual characters that frequented the place. 39 Wells - The story of how two men and their families went west to make their fortunes and came across one of the richest creeks in the Cariboo. Season 4 40 Lightning Creek - There were several rushes on Lightning Creek. Thousands of ounces of gold were mined in what was considered to be the richest placer creek in North America. 41 Lytton - Originally an Indian camp, this quiet place was changed forever in the 1850s when thousands of men searching for gold streamed into the area. 42 Cedar Creek - This creek boasted several \\"Nugget Patches\\"; incredibly rich diggings that produced hundreds of ounces of gold per day. 43 Republic, Washington - This area became legendary as a great gold producing town. Right from the start Republic began producing around 50 tons of gold per month. 44 Bankers of B.C. - Alexander MacDonald had a dream to build up a banking empire, but a daring night-time robbery proved disastrous to his plans. 45 Nelson - Known as the Queen City of the Kootenays, Gold Trails examines the rich history of Nelson and the role it played in B.C.'s gold and silver rush! 46 Bridge River Country - The riches of the bridge river country are explored. Mines like the Pioneer and the Braelorne produced record amounts of gold. 47 Bluebell Mine - In the early 1800s the raw lead/zinc/silver ore was used to make musket balls, but it wasn't until the late 1800s that mining took off, and with it several violent incidents. 48 Blakeburn - Named for Blake Wilson and meat packing giant Pat Burns, this town was known for its coal. In the early 1900s thousands of tons of coal were mined until a tragic accident claimed the lives of many miners. 49 Barkerville - One of B.C.'s most famous gold towns, Barkerville produced literally tons of gold. Many of the fascinating locals in the 1800s left their mark on this historic town. 50 Robert Thornton Lowery - This colourful newspaperman was often described as five feet tall and always drunk.

The diffuse extragalactic background radiation (DEBRA) refers to the diffuse photon field from extragalactic origin that fills our Universe. It contains photons over ∼20 decades of energy from ~10−7 eV to ~100 GeV. The origin and the physical processes involved are different within every wavelength range. There are plenty of observational evidences that support the existence of the DEBRA. The figure shows a schematic picture, based on many different data sets, of the spectral intensity (also called spectral radiance) multiplied by wavelength of the DEBRA over all the electromagnetic spectrum. This representation is convenient because the area inside the curve is the energy. The nature and history of the universe is coded in this radiation field and any realistic cosmological model must be able to describe it. Understanding the DEBRA is a major challenge of modern cosmology with huge consequences in other fields of astrophysics, therefore extraordinary efforts are being put by theoreticians, observers, and instrumentalists to do so. Regions of the DEBRA The overall diffuse extragalactic radiation field may be divided in different regions according to their origin and physical processes involved.

Life Born in London, he was son of Henry Corbould and grandson of Richard Corbould, both painters. He was a pupil of Henry Sass, and a student at the Royal Academy. In 1842 his watercolour of The Woman taken in Adultery was purchased by Albert, Prince Consort, and nine years later he was appointed instructor of historical painting to the Royal Family. He continued for twenty-one years teaching its members.Dictionary of National Biography, Corbould, Edward Henry (1815–1905), water-colour painter, by A. M. Hind. Published 1912.

His grandson was the noted designer Leonard Wyburd.\\"Mr. Leonard Wyburd\\", correspondence, The Times, 31 January 1958, p. 13. Works In 1834, 1835, and 1836 Corbould won gold medals of the Society of Arts, in 1834 with a watercolour of the Fall of Phaethon, and in the last two years with models of St. George and the Dragon and a Chariot Race, from Homer. His first exhibits in the Royal Academy in 1835 included a model (Cyllarus and Hylonome); and he submitted designs for four pieces of sculpture for Blackfriars Bridge. Corbould was known for his water-colours, in which he produced subjects illustrating literature (mainly from Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare), history, and daily life. A few of his pictures are in oils (e.g. The Canterbury Pilgrims, 1874). He started exhibiting at the New Water Colour Society in 1837, becoming a member in the same year. His early exhibits included The Canterbury Pilgrims assembled at the old Tabard Inn. Many of his works were acquired by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and his royal pupils, including an illustration of Alfred Tennyson's Morte d'Arthur presented by Queen Victoria to Princess Louise, and Henry VI welcomed to London after his Coronation in Paris, and The Iconoclasts of Basle, acquired by the Empress Frederick for the imperial collection in Berlin. Apart from the royal collections, one of the largest collections of his works was that of George Strutt of Belper. A watercolour Lady Godiva went to the National Gallery of New South Wales. Corbould exhibited in all about 250 drawings at the Royal Institute, retiring from active membership in 1898. He also produced designs for book illustration: in the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels (Cadell, 1841–6), and in A & C Black's edition of the same works (1852–3); Spenser's Faerie Queene and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Routledge, 1853); Martin Farquhar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy (1854); and Robert Aris Willmott's Poets of the Nineteenth Century (1857), and Merrie Days of England (1858–9).

Her presence leaves Ashar in a daze, anger and complete shock, and he is so taken aback to see her standing in front of him that he does not realizes the weight of all the things she said and left with him. He leaves his office without touching or even looking at all the files and the picture of his daughter. It is revealed that Ashar has not seen Khirad in almost four and half years and for unknown reasons (which are revealed later in the novel) she left him heartbroken and filled with anger and he now has nothing but hate for her. Ashar reflects back on the unusual circumstances that lead them to getting married without each other's consent, the development of their married life and the passionate love that they shared once a long time ago. The novel then switches to present where Khirad is eagerly waiting to hear back from Ashar. When he does not contact her for five days, Khirad concludes that he is cruel and vain and all her efforts to contact him are fruitless as they were 4 years ago. In the meantime, Ashar's friends notice he is extremely distracted at work and at home his mother confronts him that he needs to stop living in the past and he needs to get over Khirad and all the hurt and pain she hurled at him. The next day Ashar goes to the hospital to visit a friend who had a heart attack. While walking towards the door, a toy falls at his feet and a little girl walks to get her toy. When Ashar picks up and hands the toy to her, she puts her hands on her face and exclaims “app papa hain; app photo walay papa hain!” (You are my dad; You are my dad from the picture!). Ashar is extremely confused and turns to look at the mother of the child who is walking towards him who is none other than Khirad. Khirad takes Hareem away towards the cardiologist’s office. Ashar at that moment weighs in the purpose of Khirad's meeting with him. His anger and hate for Khirad grows even stronger because she kept his child away from him. He was unaware that she was pregnant and had a daughter. At that moment Ashar decides that he is going to take his daughter with him so Hareem can live with him in a better place, although he can't separate her from her mother as she is too young and extremely sick. He will also provide her with the best treatment possible. Ashar and Khirad tolerate each other for their daughter's sake and start living together in a separate apartment that Ashar rented out for Hareem. The rest of the story continues to reveal what occurred between Ashar and Khirad, the misunderstandings which lead them to be separated, the intensity of the relationship that they have with Hareem and if they can ever resolve their differences and understand each other better.

The older sister of Coretta Scott King, she worked behind the scenes to promote the Civil Rights Movement and was actively involved in many of the crucial events of that era.WIA Report Edythe Scott Bagley 1924-2011 (Accessed 12-18-2011) In 1943, Mrs. Bagley graduated from Lincoln Normal School in Marion, Alabama. With the encouragement of teachers and mentors, she applied for a scholarship to Antioch College and was accepted as a student there that fall. Though Antioch had enjoyed a long history of racial tolerance, Mrs. Bagley was the first African American student admitted to the school in the modern era.Antioch College Honors Alumna Edythe Scott Bagley (Accessed 12-18-2011) Later, she transferred to Ohio State University from which she graduated. She also earned a master of English from Columbia University and a master of fine arts from Boston University.University of Alabama Press author's information page (Accessed 12-18-2011) Involvement in sister's family Her sister Coretta met Martin Luther King Jr. while attending the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston after winning a scholarship. Edythe was frequently confronted by her sister over whether or not to develop her relationship with the aspiring minister, and she became impressed by how King carried himself. However, Edythe was approached by King's parents, Martin Luther King Sr. and Alberta Williams King. The two wanted to meet with members of Coretta's family and obtained Edythe's number from her. Mrs. Bagley had lunch with the two, and was pressed by King Sr. over how she felt about her sister possibly marrying his son. Though Edythe tried to assert her sister was deserving of his son and was a strong person, she did not believe that she had to beg. Coretta and Martin made an announcement of their marriage on Valentine's Day 1953. Despite the wedding being only four months away, Coretta was not fully committed to the idea, and sent a letter to her sister the day before Easter Vacation.Bagley, p. 100. After the assassination of her brother-in-law Martin Luther King Jr., Mrs. Bagley moved to Atlanta, Georgia and stayed there for two years to support her sister. In those years, she helped her sister in developing the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change and served on its board of directors for the rest of her life. On Labor Day weekend of 1968, Edythe went to Atlanta to visit her sister and met with her staff for the first time.Bagley, p. 251. Edythe represented her sister and her brother-in-law in 1971 when the Police Athletic League dedicated a building its then-newest center to Martin Luther King Jr. and helped in ceremonies at that time as well. Career She taught at several colleges in Alabama and Georgia before joining the faculty of Cheyney University of Pennsylvania in 1971. At Cheyney Mrs. Bagley founded the theatre arts major in 1980. In conjunction with that program she produced and directed numerous plays and theatrical productions.Antioch College Official Site (Accessed 12-18-2011) Edythe remained a part of faculty at the college until her retirement in 1996. Later years In 2003, believing her death was near, Edythe called her sister to arrange for the entire family to be together for Thanksgiving. Bagley let her feelings about possibly dying soon be known, to which her niece Bernice King said \\"Aunt Edythe, it's not over because you're not finished.\\" Following the death of her sister Coretta in 2006, Mrs. Bagley called her \\"my best friend and closest associate.\\" At her sister's funeral, Bagley was represented by her son Arturo Bagley, who spoke about the sisters's relationship. Mrs. Bagley's health began to decline in the spring of 2010. In the summer of 2010, alumni of Antioch College honored Edythe with the Walter F. Anderson Award, along with William David Chappelle III and Jim Dunn. In February 2011, Edythe's husband died, and four months later, on June 11, 2011, she died. The day after her death, Mrs. Bagley's nephew Martin Luther King III reported that she had died and called her a \\"vibrant, brilliant woman and always a source of strength and wisdom for our mother during the difficult challenges of the civil rights movement.\\" Published works In 1966, Mrs. Bagley began work on a biography of her sister, Coretta Scott King, detailing their shared experiences growing up in Alabama and Mrs. King's life during the early days of the modern Civil Rights Movement. Over the next two years, she conducted extensive research, gathered family documents, and interviewed countless individuals who had been at the center of the civil rights struggle. That work resulted in a manuscript and after two years of effort, she placed it in the mail to an interested publisher on April 4, 1968, then went home to relax. Later that evening, she learned that her brother-in-law, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had been assassinated. Events in the months that followed overshadowed Mrs. Bagley's manuscript and it went unpublished. Then shortly before Mrs. King's death she again encouraged Mrs. Bagley to pick up the project once more. With the assistance of bestselling author Joe Hilley, the manuscript was updated, expanded and prepared again for publication. After the death of Mrs. Bagley's niece Yolanda King, she mentioned the manuscript to her sister's other daughter Bernice. In April 2012, nearly one year after Mrs. Bagley's death, the book, Desert Rose: The Life and Legacy of Coretta Scott King, was published by the University of Alabama Press.

Most notably, the same technology used by its Solid Framework SDK is licensed by Adobe for Acrobat X. History Established in Redmond, Washington in 2001, Solid Documents, LLC was founded by CEO Michael Cartwright with the goal of becoming the leader in document productivity software. Cartwright leveraged his extensive software development, document management, internationalization, and localization experience to establish an organization with the vision of the Portable Document Format (PDF) as the universally- acceptable, standardized format for document interchange. Partnering with the PDF Association in 2008, Solid Documents assisted in the creation of a series of standardized tests used to ensure compliance of PDF/A validators and converters with ISO 19005-1 archival standards. Shortly after these standardized compliance tests were created, the company began offering a free service to analyze PDF documents and provide feedback on whether or not they comply with ISO 19005-1 archival standards. In 2011, co-founders Tamara and Michael Cartwright relocated to the south island of New Zealand establishing a base of operations as Solid Documents Limited from management offices in Nelson, New Zealand. Products Solid Converter PDF The company’s flagship product, Solid Converter PDF, was released in 2003 and has been translated into 15 languages and distributed in over 60 countries. This product allows documents to be converted into and out of PDF and securely archived in accordance with ISO standards. The last major update to this product, version 9.0, was released in June 2014 and included functionality improvements like feature integration, legacy driver support and reconstruction enhancements. Solid PDF to Word for Mac was released in April 2010 allowing Apple users to manipulate documents out of PDF into Word, Excel, HTML, text, or iWork formats. An updated version 2 of the tool was released to Mac users in September 2013. Solid PDF Tools In 2007, Solid Documents released Solid Converter PDF version 3.0 and launched Solid PDF Tools, a premium product which included scanning and archival features in addition to conversion. Both products were a departure from the previous dialog box- focused user interface by offering a distinctly WYSIWYG user experience. Version 4.0 released in 2008, adding language localization for French, Spanish, and Chinese users as well conversion to and from additional formats like Excel, PowerPoint, and HTML. In December 2010 version 7.0 was released with continued product enhancements including selective conversion, table and workflow improvements. Version 9.0 released in June 2014 increases the number of languages supported by the OCR technology and includes a number of conversion and reconstruction improvements. Solid PDF Creator Solid PDF Creator, released in 2006, provides core conversion from virtually any document format into an easily exchangeable PDF. In 2007, version 2.0 was released supporting encryption, improvements to PDF quality, and archival compliance capabilities. Solid PDF Creator Plus, released in 2008, built upon the features of Solid PDF Creator by including drag and drop navigation, watermark management, page extracts, and search functions. Version 9.0 released in June 2014 includes a number of feature integration improvements, legacy driver support, and conversion enhancements. Solid Framework SDK In September 2010, Solid Documents entered into a strategic partnership with activePDF, Inc. licensing Solid Framework SDK to convert PDFs into a variety of editable formats, in addition to PDF/A validation and conversion already existing in their activePDF DocConverter™ product. Later that year in November 2010, Adobe Inc. licensed Solid Framework SDK for Adobe Acrobat X. By harnessing the Solid PDF to Word and Excel conversion capabilities, Acrobat X users are able to reliably repurpose PDF content. In June 2014 an update to version 9.0 was released which provides enhanced flexibility for application development with the SDK.

The hotel was designed to be an elegant, old world hotel that it could serve General Motors executives traveling to the Cadillac building and the most sophisticated travelers. Weils-Cohan Associates created the plaster décor and the French Regency architecture. The hotel featured red fleur-de-lis tiles similar to those used in ancient European sidewalks, 23k gold trimmed walnut paneling, crystal chandeliers and antiques from all around the world.
