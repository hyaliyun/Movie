The famous Golden Lion is awarded to the best film screening at the competition. Biennale (), Italian for \\"biennial\\" or \\"every other year\\", is any event that happens every two years. It is most commonly used within the art world to describe large-scale international contemporary art exhibitions. As such the term was popularised by Venice Biennale, which was first held in 1895. The phrase has since been used for other artistic events, such as the \\"Biennale de Paris\\", \\"Kochi-Muziris Biennale\\", or even as a portmanteau as with Berlinale (for the Berlin International Film Festival) and Viennale (for Vienna's international film festival). \\"Biennale\\" is therefore used as a general term for other recurrent international events (such as triennials, Documenta, Skulptur Projekte M√ºnster).  Characteristics  According to author Federica Martini, what is at stake in contemporary biennales is the diplomatic/international relations potential as well as urban regeneration plans. Besides being mainly focused on the present (the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù where the cultural event takes place and their effect of \\"spectacularisation of the everyday\\"), because of their site-specificity cultural events may refer back to, produce or frame the history of the site and communities' collective memory.Vittoria Martini e Federica Martini, Just another exhibition. Histories and politics of biennials, Postmedia Books, 2011 , . The Great Exhibition in The Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, in 1851, the first attempt to condense the representation of the world within a unitary exhibition space. A strong and influent symbol of biennales and of large-scale international exhibitions in general is the Crystal Palace, the gigantic and futuristic London architecture that hosted the Great Exhibition in 1851. According to philosopher Peter Sloterdijk,Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals, 2005. the Crystal Palace is the first attempt to condense the representation of the world in a unitary exhibition space, where the main exhibit is society itself in an a-historical, spectacular condition. The Crystal Palace main motives were the affirmation of British economic and national leadership and the creation of moments of spectacle. In this respect, 19th century World fairs provided a visual crystallization of colonial culture and were, at the same time, forerunners of contemporary theme parks.  The Venice Biennale as an archetype  The structure of the Venice Biennale in 2005 with an international exhibition and the national pavilions. The Venice Biennale, a periodical large-scale cultural event founded in 1895, served as an archetype of the biennales. Meant to become a World Fair focused on contemporary art, the Venice Biennale used as a pretext the wedding anniversary of the Italian king and followed up to several national exhibitions organised after Italy unification in 1861. The Biennale immediately put forth issues of city marketing, cultural tourism and urban regeneration, as it was meant to reposition Venice on the international cultural map after the crisis due to the end of the Grand Tour model and the weakening of the Venetian school of painting. Furthermore, the Gardens where the Biennale takes place were an abandoned city area that needed to be re-functionalised. In cultural terms, the Biennale was meant to provide on a biennial basis a platform for discussing contemporary art practices that were not represented in fine arts museums at the time. The early Biennale model already included some key points that are still constitutive of large-scale international art exhibitions today: a mix of city marketing, internationalism, gentrification issues and destination culture, and the spectacular, large scale of the event.  Biennials after the 1990s  The situation of biennials has changed in the contemporary context: while at its origin in 1895 Venice was a unique cultural event, but since the 1990s hundreds of biennials have been organized across the globe. Given the ephemeral and irregular nature of some biennials, there is little consensus on the exact number of biennials in existence at any given time. Furthermore, while Venice was a unique agent in the presentation of contemporary art, since the 1960s several museums devoted to contemporary art are exhibiting the contemporary scene on a regular basis. Another point of difference concerns 19th century internationalism in the arts, that was brought into question by post-colonial debates and criticism of the contemporary art ‚Äúethnic marketing‚Äù, and also challenged the Venetian and World Fair‚Äôs national representation system. As a consequence of this, Eurocentric tendency to implode the whole word in an exhibition space, which characterises both the Crystal Palace and the Venice Biennale, is affected by the expansion of the artistic geographical map to scenes traditionally considered as marginal. The birth of the Havana Biennial in 1984 is widely considered an important counterpoint to the Venetian model for its prioritization of artists working in the Global South and curatorial rejection of the national pavilion model.

Rainer was born in Baden, Austria. During his early years, Rainer was influenced by Surrealism. In 1950, he founded the Hundsgruppe (dog group) together with Ernst Fuchs, Arik Brauer, and Josef Mikl. After 1954, Rainer's style evolved towards Destruction of Forms, with blackenings, overpaintings, and maskings of illustrations and photographs dominating his later work. He was close to the Vienna Actionism, featuring body art and painting under the influence of drugs. He painted extensively on the subject of Hiroshima such as it relates to the nuclear bombing of the Japanese city and the inherent political and physical fallout. In 1978, he received the Grand Austrian State Prize. In the same year, and in 1980, he became the Austrian representative at the Venice Biennale. From 1981 to 1995, Rainer held a professorship at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna - the same place where he aborted his own studies after three days, unsatisfied. His works are shown in the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. As the culmination of the appraisal of his work, the Arnulf Rainer Museum opened in New York City in 1993. His works have also continuously been shown at the European Cultural Centre's palazzos in Venice during the Biennale since 2011. In the same year, he published the work Unfinished into Death () with the same organisation.  References   External links  * Arnulf Rainer Museum, Baden * Arnulf Rainer at the Museum of Modern Art.

Younger was the lead singer for punk rockers, Radio Birdman, and in other hard rock groups, New Race, Bad Music, the Other Side, Nanker Phelge, and Deep Reduction. The New Christs line-up since 2011 is Younger with Jim Dickson on bass guitar, Dave Kettley on guitar, Paul Larsen on drums and Brent Williams on guitar and keyboards. Over their career the group have issued five studio albums, Distemper (1989), Lower Yourself (1997), We Got This! (2002), Gloria (2009) and Incantations (2014). Three former members have died: Stevie Plunder in January 1996, Mark Wilkinson in December 2012 and Christian Houllemare in June 2014. 1980‚Äì1981 The New Christs were formed early in 1980 in Sydney as a hard rock group with Clyde Bramley on bass guitar (ex-The Hitmen, Other Side), Bruce 'Cub' Callaway on guitar (ex-X-Men, Saints), John Hoey on keyboards (ex-X-Men), Don McGloneon on drums (ex-Bedhogs) and Rob Younger on lead vocals (ex-Radio Birdman, Other Side). This line up never performed live but they released a single, \\"Face a New God\\", in August 1981, which was produced by Callaway for Green Records. The track was co-written by Callaway and Younger. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as \\"searing acid-punk\\" which has \\"since emerged as one of the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk/new wave era.\\" They disbanded later that year. 1983‚Äì1984 The New Christs reformed in June 1983 with Younger joined by Chris Masuak on guitar, Mark Kingsmill on drums and Tony Robertson on bass guitar (all from The Hitmen) and Kent Steedman on guitar (also in the Celibate Rifles). They supported an Australian tour by Iggy Pop and then Steedman returned to the Celibate Rifles. Younger kept the band going with Richard Jakimyszyn as a replacement on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders). They issued two singles, \\"Like a Curse\\" (April 1984) and \\"Born out of Time\\" (April 1986), on Citadel Records, which were written and produced by Younger. McFarlane felt they were \\"consummate, guitar-driven, hard rock\\". AllMusic's Jack Rabid reviewed \\"Like a Curse\\", as being \\"more slam-bang rock with great rhythm from a man who has it coursing in his bones.\\" The group's music was used on the soundtrack of the feature film, Going Down (1983). This line-up broke up in May 1984. 1987‚Äì1990, 1991 Another version of the New Christs were assembled in February 1987: with Younger were Louis Burdett on drums (ex-Powerhouse, Ed Kuepper Band), Jim Dickson on bass guitar (ex- Railroad Gin, Survivors, Passengers, Barracudas) and Charlie Owen on lead guitar (ex-Tango Bravo). Burdett was soon replaced on drums by Nick Fisher (ex-Wet Taxis, Paris Green). This line up released four singles, \\"The Black Hole\\" (July 1987), \\"Dropping Like Flies'\\" (December), \\"Headin' South\\" (November 1988) and \\"Another Sin\\" (June 1989). A four-track extended play, Detritus, was issued as a compilation in 1987 for the United Kingdom and United States markets. It was followed in 1988 by an Australian compilation album, Divine Rites, which collected five singles from Citadel Records. The group's first studio album appeared in August 1989, Distemper, which McFarlane opined was \\"explosive\\" and \\"remains the definitive statement on the band's sound and style. It contained a wealth of powerful tracks.\\" Penelope Layland of The Canberra Times declared it to be \\"good, aggressive music, full of hate, even if it has all been done before... All in all a good album. Play it as a substitute for clobbering someone.\\" In June 2008 Dylan Lewis described it as \\"A non-stop ride of terrific songs full of melody and power offset the bleak, venomous lyrics. The tension the musicians create in each track is spine tingling. It's an exhausting album to listen to. To my ears, it stands as the greatest, raging Australian rock'n'roll album.\\" It reached No. 1 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. They toured Australia and undertook two tours of Europe (1988, 1989). The band split up in February 1990 but briefly reformed in 1991 to support Ramones at a gig in Sydney. 1992‚Äì2001 Younger established the next version of New Christs in January 1992 with Billy Gibson on guitar and organ (ex-Eastern Dark), Greg Hitchcock on guitar (ex-The Neptunes, Kryptonics), Christian Houllemare on bass guitar (ex-Happy Hate Me Nots), Peter Kelly on drums (ex-Flies, No Man's Land, Vanilla Chainsaws) and Stevie Plunder on guitar (ex-The Plunderers). Hitchcock soon left to join the Boom Babies and, in September 1992, Plunder formed the Whitlams and was replaced by Tony Harper (ex-Viscounts, Voodoo Lust). Another four-track EP, Pedestal, was released in October 1994. In 1995 Mark Wilkinson (ex-Girlies, Lime Spiders) replaced Gibson on piano and guitar. Younger, Harper, Houllemare, Kelly and Wilkinson line-up were recorded on a seven-track EP, Woe Betide (November 1995), which was produced by Younger. A Canadian label, Lance Rock Records, issued a compilation album, Born out of Time (1996), which McFarlane described as \\"13 tracks of prime New Christs aural mayhem.\\" Younger felt it contained \\"the songs I can still stand.\\" The New Christs were temporarily put on hold in early 1996 while Younger toured with a reformed, Radio Birdman. The New Christs resumed by mid-year and released their second studio album, Lower Yourself (early 1997), produced by Younger. Lauren Zoric of Rolling Stone explained that it is \\"Propelled by tough, inventive riffs and glorious rock & roll grooves, occasional keyboards now infiltrate the make up. Harnessing and driving the band's considerable power, Younger is ever on the brink of immolation, expressing a diseased soul, wracked by the compromises and humiliations of love. Long may we revel in his purgatory.\\" An extended version included a bonus four-track EP. The group toured Australia and then, in April 1997, Europe with Al Creed on guitar and vocals (ex-Fruitworld, Hey Charger!), who replaced Harper. They disbanded in 2001 and posthumously released a 2√ó CD studio album, We Got This!, in 2002, which was produced by Wayne Connolly. Online webzine, Oz Music Projects Pants noticed that \\"The crux of this album though is the incredible vibrancy and individuality of the songs, each track rocking hard but having its own identity and personality, yet amazingly intertwining such emotion into each track.\\" I-94 Bar's Simon Li felt that \\"Younger is in some of his best vocal form on this CDLP, as the band responds the best way they can; solid and continually menacing.\\" Fellow reviewer John McPharlin notice \\"there is a remarkable consistency of vision, intent and achievement across the whole album. Not for a single moment on any of these tracks does this sound like a band that had run its race, dropped the ball, hit bottom, lost the plot, shot its load and/or was about to tear itself apart.\\" Ahead of its appearance Younger declared that it would be the last album from his group. Also in 2002, Citadel Records issued another compilation album, These Rags, using remixed versions of two earlier EPs, Pedestal and Woe Betide. Three members of the 1990s line-up have died: Stevie Plunder in January 1996, Mark Wilkinson in December 2012 and Christian Houllemare in June 2014. 2006‚ÄìPresent In May 2006 Younger displayed another New Christs line- up: Jim Dickson on bass guitar, Dave Kettley on guitar (Shifter, The Dead Set, Radio Birdman), Brent Williams on guitar and keyboards, and Stu Wilson on drums. The Barman of I-94 Bar website caught their gig in May in Wollongong, where they played \\"a Greatest Hits package with none of the new songs from the Younger canon... A solid hit-out by a new line-up with versatility and style... Europe's going to be in for a fine old time.\\" In May and June that year the group performed in Spain ‚Äì including at the Primavera Sound in Barcelona, an eclectic annual festival specialised in independent music ‚Äì France, Germany and Belgium. They subsequently toured Europe four more times (2008, 2009, 2011, 2014). In January 2008 Younger told Patrick of Mess+Noise website that he disputes providing a lasting legacy, \\"I think much of that [perceived influence] is born of hindsight... Sure, we had some degree of influence because so many people have told me over the years they started their group after hearing us. That‚Äôs how I got started, hearing other groups, except it was via the records of the New York Dolls and the Stooges, because the local groups were so vapid rather than inspiring.\\" The group's fifth studio album, Gloria, was released in May 2009. Jeff Glorfeld of The Age rated it at three out of five. The Barman described it as \\"the most low key-sounding New Christs album in the canon. Production was an exercise in economic rationalism ‚Äì live crowds are small and labels with cash to burn are thin on the ground ‚Äì and much of what resulted from an earlier session was scrapped.\\" In that same year they played at the Azkena Rock Festival in Spain. In 2011 Wilson was replaced by Paul Larsen (also with The Celibate Rifles). Dominique Genot of I-94 Bar reviewed the group's live album, Live 2011, which is \\"[as] live as you hope to see them (and I did during the 2011 Euro tour). The record was done at the Excelsior Hotel's closing night in Sydney in May, and the thing was quickly mixed by guitarist-keyboardist Brent Williams. The album's got a big sound, with Dave Kettley's guitar high in the ears. My personal criticisms is that Rob Younger's voice is too low in the mix - also i think there are a few cuts between the songs.\\" This line-up issued their sixth studio album, Incantations, in June 2014. Gus Ironside of Louder Than War rated it as 9 out of 10 and felt it was \\"a highly melodic album, packed with hooks and insidious tunes, it's a tightly-coiled brute, as claustrophobically dense with detail as it is outright rocking.\\"  Members  ;Current line-up * Rob Younger ‚Äì vocals * Jim Dickson ‚Äì bass * Dave Kettley (Shifter, The Dead Set, Radio Birdman) ‚Äì guitar * Brent Williams (Zambian Goatherders) ‚Äì guitar, keyboards * Stu Wilson ‚Äì drums * Paul Larsen (aka Paul Loughhead) (The Celibate Rifles) ‚Äì drums (replaced Wilson in 2011) ;Previous line-ups ;1980‚Äì81 * Rob Younger ‚Äì vocals * Clyde Bramley (The Hoodoo Gurus) ‚Äì bass * Bruce \\"Cub\\" Calloway (The Saints) ‚Äì guitar * John Hoey ‚Äì keyboards * Don McGlone ‚Äì drums * Ken Doyle ‚Äì drums (appeared on the single) ;1983‚Äì84 * Rob Younger ‚Äì vocals * Chris Masuak (The Hitmen, Radio Birdman) ‚Äì guitar * Mark Kingsmill (The Hellcats, The Hitmen, The Hoodoo Gurus) ‚Äì drums * Tony Robertson (The Hitmen) ‚Äì bass * Kent Steedman (The Celibate Rifles) ‚Äì guitar * Richard Jakimyszyn (Lime Spiders, The Hitmen, Molten Universe) ‚Äì guitar (replaced Steedman) ;1987‚Äì90, 1991 * Rob Younger ‚Äì vocals * Charlie Owen ‚Äì guitar * Jim Dickson (Railroad Gin, The Survivors, The Barracudas, The Passengers, Deniz Tek Group, Radio Birdman) ‚Äì bass * Louis Burdett ‚Äì drums * Nick Fisher ‚Äì drums ;1992‚Äì2001 * Rob Younger ‚Äì vocals * Bill Gibson (Hellmen, The Eastern Dark, Pyramidiacs, Loose Pills) ‚Äì guitar * Greg Hitchcock ‚Äì guitar (left in 1992) * Christian Houllemare (The Someloves, Happy Hate Me Nots) ‚Äì bass * Stevie Plunder (The Plunderers, The Whitlams) ‚Äì guitar * Peter Kelly (Flies, Vanilla Chainsaws, No Man's Land) ‚Äì drums * Tony Harper (Voodoo Lust) ‚Äì guitar (replaced Plunder) * Mark Wilkinson (Lime Spiders, The Girlies ‚Äì guitar (replaced Gibson) * Al Creed (Aberration, The Panadolls, Hell Crab City) ‚Äì guitar (replaced Harper) * Nik Rieth (Celibate Rifles, Brother Brick, Tumbleweed) ‚Äì drums (replaced Kelly) * Stu Wilson ‚Äì drums (replaced Reith) Discography Albums * Distemper (1989) ‚Äì Citadel * Lower Yourself (1997) ‚Äì Citadel * We Got This!

Data from the Web of Science show that Granovetter has written both the first and third most cited sociology articles. He is best known for his work in social network theory and in economic sociology, particularly his theory on the spread of information in social networks known as \\"The Strength of Weak Ties\\" (1973). Education Granovetter earned an A.B. in History at Princeton University (1965) and a Ph.D in Sociology at Harvard University (1970). At Harvard he studied under the supervision of Harrison White. He is currently the Joan Butler Ford Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford and is the chair of the Department of Sociology. He worked at Northwestern University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Johns Hopkins University.Curriculum Vitae , November 2005, from Stanford University website Major ideas The strength of weak ties Granovetter's paper \\"The Strength of Weak Ties\\" is a highly influential research paper, with about 50,000 citations according to Google Scholar (as of November 2018). In 1969 Granovetter submitted it to American Sociological Review, but it was rejected. Eventually this pioneering research was published in 1973 in American Journal of Sociology and became the most cited work in the Social Sciences. In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties. The concepts and findings of this work were later published in the monograph Getting A Job, an adaptation of Granovetter's doctoral dissertation at Harvard University's Department of Social Relations, with the title: \\"Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Population\\" (313 pages). Economic sociology: Embeddedness In the field of economic sociology, Granovetter has been a leader since the publication in 1985 of an article that launched \\"new economic sociology\\", \\"Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness\\". This article caused Granovetter to be identified with the concept of \\"embeddedness\\", the idea that economic relations between individuals or firms are embedded in actual social networks and do not exist in an abstract idealized market. The concept of embeddedness originated with Karl Polanyi in his book The Great Transformation, where Polanyi posited that all economies are embedded in social relations and institutions. Granovetter also published a book called Society and Economy (2017). \\"Tipping points\\" / threshold models Granovetter has done research on a model of how fads are created. Consider a hypothetical mob assuming that each person's decision whether to riot or not is dependent on what everyone else is doing. Instigators will begin rioting even if no one else is, while others need to see a critical number of trouble makers before they riot, too. This threshold is assumed to be distributed to some probability distribution. The outcomes may diverge largely although the initial condition of threshold may only differ very slightly. This threshold model of social behavior was proposed previously by Thomas Schelling and later popularized by Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping Point. Security influence Granovetter's work has influenced researchers in capability-based security. Interactions in these systems can be described using \\"Granovetter diagrams\\", which illustrate changes in the ties between objects.J.B. Dennis and E.C. Van Horn.

The term \\"red-eye\\" derives from the symptom of having red eyes, which can be caused by fatigue.  Business and passenger utility  Red-eye flights offer numerous advantages for passengers. For example, passengers do not have to navigate peak hour traffic reaching the airport at their origin or while entering the city at their destination. These flights are also good for passengers who want to travel to a city and return the same day. They can save the money that they would spend for a night's stay in a hotel by taking the flight at night for return. Furthermore, red-eye flights allow passengers to spend a full day at both their origin and destination, especially by giving them time to complete any important tasks at their origin before flying out at night. For this reason, red-eye flights are popular among business travelers who benefit more from flying at night than during the day.  Examples  One definition of a red-eye flight is one that is too short to allow a full night's sleep. An example would be those flights from Los Angeles to New York City‚Äîabout six hours' flying time‚Äîthat depart between 2200 and 0100, and arrive between 0500 and 0700.  Asia  *Japan Airlines used to operate red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda, but they have changed to daytime flights. Cathay Pacific still operates one flight each to Tokyo Narita and Osaka, while All Nippon Airways operates red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Tokyo's Haneda daily. *Asiana, Korean Air, and Cathay Pacific operate red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Seoul. Asiana and Dragonair operate flights to Busan. Cathay Pacific used to fly a red-eye flight from Seoul to Hong Kong, but the flight is now suspended and the airline operates only daytime and evening flights from Seoul to Hong Kong. *Cathay Pacific operates many red-eye flights outside of Tokyo and Seoul. These include red-eye flights between Hong Kong and cities in Australia and New Zealand in both directions, as well as between Hong Kong and Singapore. Cathay Pacific flights that are red-eye only in the Hong Kong-bound direction include those from Bangkok. Cathay Pacific flights that are red-eye only from Hong Kong include those to Seoul and parts of Japan. The Vancouver to New York (JFK) tag flight operated by Cathay Pacific is also a red-eye service. *Flights that leave India and Southwest Asia around midnight arrive in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore early morning. *Philippine Airlines also operates red-eye flights from Korea and Japan back to Manila, which also have regular late-night flights from Manila to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. *Many flights from Southeast Asia to Japan, Korea, and China depart in the evenings or around midnight, and land at the destinations in the early morning. There are also flights that depart Japan, Korea, or China around midnight, and arrive in Southeast Asia in the early morning. *Indonesian airlines operate overnight red-eye flights from Jakarta to the easternmost province of Papua. With a flight time of four to five hours and a two-hour time difference, most red-eye flights depart shortly before midnight and arrive around 6am. Garuda Indonesia also operates daily overnight flights to the East Asia's Tokyo, Seoul, and Beijing, leaving Jakarta at midnight and arriving at around 6am the next morning. Garuda Indonesia applies a similar daily overnight flight schedule for its Australia-bound flight routes, departing from Jakarta and Denpasar just before midnight and arriving in Sydney and Melbourne at around 9am the next morning. *Pakistan International Airlines flies red-eye flights to Lahore, Pakistan from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. *Turkish Airlines Flies red-eye flights to Istanbul, Turkey From Mal√©, Maldives *Singapore Airlines Flies red-eye flights to Singapore From Mal√©, Maldives  Australia  The majority of transcontinental flights are operated during the day, but as of 2010, red-eye flights operate from Perth to Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, and Melbourne, and from Darwin to Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Red-eye flights have previously operated from Australia to New Zealand and Fiji. Red-eye flights to Australia operate from various locations in Southeast Asia and North America, such as Scoot's flights from Singapore to Gold Coast, Sydney, and Melbourne. Jetstar offers red-eye flights between Melbourne and Wellington with the flight departing Melbourne at 1am and arriving in Wellington at 6am. Another example would be Qantas flights from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Sydney), generally leaving 10pm to 11pm and arriving from 5am to 8am. While they do fly during the night - this is more a product of large time zone differences - the flights take around 15 hours (giving more time to sleep) and westward flight stretches out the local length of day and night. Furthermore, as the flight crosses the International Date Line, flights arrive roughly 2 days later in local time  Brazil  TAM Airlines, Azul Brazilian Airlines and Gol Transportes A√©reos offer red-eye flights, popularly known as \\"Great Owl\\", because of a film session in a late night broadcast by Rede Globo. () flights in Brazil, with over 50 different routes throughout Brazil, all departing between 10pm and 6am.

Europe  Red-eye flights to Europe were once meant to apply exclusively to the morning arrivals of transatlantic flights from the American East Coast to Western Europe. Such traffic now comprises the busiest of the long-haul air routes. The first of these flights, from the busiest destinations of New York and Washington D.C., will arrive at the major European airports at London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Amsterdam before 0600 local time (and when still subject to costly night-flying restrictions); and hence in increasing numbers and to and from a wide range of American/European destinations. Travelling from Europe, are scheduled red-eye flights out of Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Frankfurt. The flight time is of three to five hours, with typical departure around midnight, and arrival around dawn the next day. Most airlines from the Middle East & Asia operate red-eye services from major Western European destinations. One example is at London Heathrow, where the last departures - leaving between 22.30 and 23.00 - are eastbound medium-haul services to destinations such as Moscow and Tel Aviv.  Russia  Russian airlines operate similarly to U.S. airlines by connecting Moscow to Yakutsk, Irkutsk, and Vladivostok. They last five to eight hours but due to the northerly latitude the flights can cross as many as eight time zones during this interval, drastically enlarging the time difference. The flights depart Moscow around 6pm and arrive at the eastern cities around 6am the next day. One of the current examples of red-eye flight is Aeroflot's SU783 from Moscow to Magadan, departing 11:05pm Moscow time and arriving 2:00pm Vladivostok Time on the next day, with a flight time of approximately eight hours.  South Africa  Many medium and long-haul flights to/from South Africa and Europe, other African destinations and the Middle East make use of red-eye flights and longitudinal advantages (similar time zones) so that passengers can arrive at their destinations early in the morning and benefit from minimal time zone changes due to South Africa's geographic position. This makes it an efficient and convenient way to travel between each area.  United States and Canada  Red-eye flights frequently connect West Coast cities to East Coast cities. These typically depart the West Coast between 10pm and 1am, have a flight time of three to six hours but gain between two and four hours due to the time difference, arriving on the East Coast between 5am and 7am. American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and other U.S airlines operate red-eye flights that depart from the west coast at night such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, etc.. that arrive in Boston, New York JFK, Newark, Washington, etc.. in the morning. Red- eye flights also connect Hawaii or Alaska with West Coast mainland cities. Furthermore, flights from Tokyo to Honolulu are considered red-eye flights, as the flights are usually overnight flights that are around six hours.http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/flights/RePrintableTimetable.asp  Historical availability  In the 1930s and 1940s, red-eye flights were not possible, as most airports did not have the equipment necessary to work at night. There are still airports that do not function after certain hours, or have curfews for noise reasons, limiting the number of airports from which red-eye flights can depart.  Red-eye flights in pop culture  Films involving red-eye flights include Airport 1975 (1974), Airplane! (1980), The Langoliers (miniseries) (1995), Turbulence (1997), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Red Eye (2005), Flightplan (2005), Snakes on a Plane (2006), and Non-Stop (2014). The TV series Into the Night (2020) also includes a red-eye flight in its central premise. Red-eye flights are also referenced in the song Goodbye Earl by The Chicks.

He was admired for his powerful, sumptuous voice, and was particularly associated with roles of Mussorgsky and Verdi. Ghiaurov married the Bulgarian pianist Zlatina Mishakova in 1956 and Italian soprano Mirella Freni in 1978, and the two singers frequently performed together. They lived in Modena until Ghiaurov's death in 2004 of a heart attack. Biography Ghiaurov monument in Velingrad Ghiaurov was born in the small mountain town of Velingrad in southern Bulgaria. As a child, he learned to play the violin, piano and clarinet. He began his musical studies at the Bulgarian State Conservatory in 1949. From 1950 until 1955, he studied at the Moscow Conservatory. Ghiaurov's career was launched in 1955, when he won the Grand Prix at the International Vocal Competition in Paris and the First Prize and a gold medal at the Fifth World Youth Festival in Prague. Ghiaurov made his operatic debut in 1955 as Don Basilio in Rossini's The Barber of Seville in Sofia. He made his Italian operatic debut in 1957 in Teatro Comunale Bologna, before starting an international career with his rendition of Varlaam in the opera Boris Godunov at La Scala in 1959. 1962 marked Ghiaurov's Covent Garden debut as Padre Guardiano in Verdi's La forza del destino as well as his first appearance in Salzburg in Verdi's Requiem, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Ghiaurov first shared a stage with Mirella Freni in 1961 in Genoa. She was Marguerite, he was Mephistopheles in Faust. Married in 1978, they lived in her hometown, Modena. They sang together frequently. He made his US debut in Gounod's Faust in 1963 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and he went on to sing twelve roles with the company, including the title roles in Boris Godunov, Don Quichotte, and Mefistofele. Ghiaurov made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 8 November 1965 as Mefistofele. He sang a total of 81 performances in ten roles there, last appearing there on October 26, 1996, as Sparafucile in Rigoletto. During the course of his career, he also performed at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre, the Vienna State Opera, Covent Garden, and Paris Op√©ra. In the late 1970s Ghiaurov sang the title role in the first complete stereo recording of Massenet's opera Don Quichotte. He was recorded frequently, and his discography includes complete recordings of many of his great stage roles, including Don Giovanni, Don Basilio, Ramfis, Colline, Banco, Gounod's and Boito's Mephistos and Boris Godunov, among many others. In October 2000, at the age of 71, he gave an acclaimed performance at the 1st Herbert von Karajan Memorial concert under the baton of James Allen G√§hres in Ulm, where he sang opera arias and duets by Cilea, Tchaikovsky and Verdi, together with Mirella Freni.Official Herbert von Karajan - online archive 1.

Other terms for this footwear include over-the-knee boots (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term is also used for the 15th century riding boots for men, later adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, pirate boots. Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch boots or crotch-high boots). Thigh boots are made of materials ranging from various leathers to various synthetic materials (including vinyl, polyurethane, or latex) to various fabrics (such as silk or polyester microfiber). Many are constructed with zippers, but some are designed as pull-on boots. Heel heights vary, but most styles are either flat or with heels greater than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can also have platform soles. Thigh boots are considered by many to be erotic or kinky. They are used as fetish clothing in boot fetishism and shoe fetishism. Cheaper thigh boots are often worn by prostitutes and professional dominatrices, so many people consider them icons of such trades. Because of the latter, they are often associated with sadomasochism. Nevertheless, they are frequently sold by couture designers, perhaps because of the implied eroticism. Thigh-high boots are more flattering on women with longer legs: \\"The shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you.\\" History Late Victorian era Pair of fetish boots, c. 1900, from a Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibit. Laced leather boots were fashionable throughout the Victorian era for women. By the end of the 19th century, over- the-knee length laced leather boots were becoming a trend among London prostitutes wanting a style that would appeal to foot fetishists and clients interested in finding a dominatrix. 1960s Kinky boots, also referred to as fetish boots, are boots made typically with patent leather and high stiletto heels.https://books.google.com/books?id=LKTACQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA191&lpg;=PA191&dq;=kinky+boots+encyclopedia&source;=bl&ots;=eCsLwP1Wm5&sig;=009yg1M2ewQfYlfPWC7BOFbP0sw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwid9ZapjczYAhWM3YMKHblVAJEQ6AEIaTAI#v=onepage&q;=kinky%20boots%20encyclopedia&f;=false Their extreme characteristics intended to present a dramatic sexy appearance, such as by a prostitute or dominatrix. Characteristics often include very high heels, thigh- or crotch-high length, or unusual colors or materials. Boots of this type, and specifically the thigh-high leather boots worn by Honor Blackman in her role as Cathy Gale in The Avengers, are referred to in the 1964 song \\"Kinky Boots\\" by Blackman and her Avengers co-star Patrick Macnee. In fashion In the world of women's fashion, thigh boots run through cycles in both popularity and design. As referenced by several authors, the popularity of the motion picture Pretty Woman hurt the credibility of thigh boots as wardrobe staples.\\"Thigh High Boots Trend ‚Äî Like it or Not Here it Comes.\\" Red Carpet Fashion Awards, 3 September 2009. . Retrieved 4 October 2009. Nevertheless, in any fall fashion season, one or more designers and retailers will take a chance on their appeal. Like shoes in general, fashion thigh boots are marketed through several different channels. A key differentiator among these channels is the price point and construction: * Couture fashion designers * Fashion designers * Couture shoe designers * Boutique brands * Fashion and shoe retailers Couture fashion designers marketing thigh boots will vary from year to year. Introducing a boot model is typically tied to the designer's theme for the line. These boots will typically be marketed at the highest price point for thigh boots and, usually, for shoes in general. Fashion designers market similarly, though at a lower price point. A number of couture shoe design houses regularly include thigh boots in their collections, and the price point will be at a premium, just as with the couture fashion designers. Examples of these designers are: * Brian Atwood * Manolo Blahnik * Jimmy Choo * Christian Louboutin * Sergio Rossi (of Gucci Group) * Stuart Weitzman * Giuseppe Zanotti (of Vicini S.p.A.) Couture fashion designers regularly use the shoe design houses to design the boots and shoes for their collections. Thigh boots are a regular staple of several Italian boutique brands, including: * Gianmarco Lorenzi * Left and Right * Le Silla * Loriblu * Ic√¥ne The price point for these boots can be very high, particularly at retail boutiques, but will vary more than for couture designers. Some brands are available through eBay sellers and clearance sellers (e.g., YOOX) at discounted prices. The lowest price tier is typically the fashion retailers.

Ariana Grande has incorporated many styles of thigh-high boots into her signature look. Because of this many articles were published advertising thigh-high boots, resulting in a surge of demand for the item. This could also be linked to the fact that the years of 2018-2019 saw a trend of popular 90's trends becoming fashionable again. Fetish :See also boot fetishism Black vinyl fetish thigh-high (or thigh-length) boots Red vinyl fetish thigh boots as art Thigh boots as articles of fetish clothing date back to at least the 1950s when Irving Klaw used them in the costuming of the women in his erotic photography. Since that time, they have been a staple of fetish and adult photography. For instance, Bob Guccione photographed the 1982 Penthouse Pet of the Year, Corinne Alphen, in a pair of black leather thigh boots for her feature layout. Similarly, Dwight Hooker photographed the Playboy 25th Anniversary Playmate, Candy Loving, in white leather over-the-knee boots for her layout.Hooker, Dwight (January 1979), \\"Picture Perfect,\\" Playboy, pp 196‚Äì205. Until the 2000s, fetish thigh boots were generally distinguished from fashion boots by being more extreme in many design dimensions, particularly heel height and platform height. In the late 2000s, this trend began to change as couture designers, particularly Christian Louboutin, began to experiment with more extreme designs in their shoes. Consequently, the difference between the two now is more a function of the materials used. In particular, fetish thigh boots tend to be constructed of polyurethane (PU) or vinyl (often incorrectly referred to as patent leather). In addition, they are generally produced in China and sold at low cost. Some European cobblers have specialized in higher- priced thigh boots for the fetish market. Iconography and symbolism in motion pictures Motion pictures in which thigh boots were prominent in an actress' wardrobe include: * In the 1990 film Pretty Woman, the protagonist, Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts), wears her black vinyl thigh boots throughout much of the first part of the movie as a symbol of her role as a prostitute. * In the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada, the protagonist, Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), completes her ugly-duckling-to-swan transformation by strutting confidently into her employer's offices wearing a pair of Chanel black leather thigh boots. Andy's wardrobe for this scene and the rest of the movie was styled by noted costumer, stylist, and designer Patricia Field. * In the live-action versions of 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, Glenn Close (Cruella) wears thigh high red PVC and thigh / crotch high black PVC boots respectively; boots end up in molasses, mud and caked in.

Clarke and Gentry Lee. The major premise of Cradle is contact between a few humans from the Miami area in 1994 and the super robots of a damaged space ship submerged off the Florida coast. Telecommunication advances such as videotelephones and highly efficient underwater scanning equipment used in the story bridge from the everyday, real-life aspects of the setting toward the near future, bespeaking technological progress.  Plot summary  In 1994, the US Navy is testing a new missile, but after the launch it mysteriously disappears and it is clear that if the rocket reaches civilian areas they will be in big trouble. Carol Dawson, a journalist, is alerted by an unusual sight of whales in the Miami area, and decides to go and write about it. Armed with special equipment provided by her friend, Dr. Dale Michaels from MOI (Miami Oceanographic Institute), goes to investigate the rumors of a missing missile belonging to the Marines and that could be behind the mysterious whale behavior lately. She hires the services of Nick Williams and Jefferson Troy, owners of a little boat so she can get to the Gulf of Mexico and investigate closer if a missile has something to do with all of the above. They end up finding an unknown artifact, bringing a lot of doubts about its nature, and even if it is part of a lost treasure that could be worth millions. Old friends of Williams and Troy noticed the finding and just like the old times, they want to steal it from them. In the background of the story, the author talks about a submarine snake civilization on a planet called Canthor, and how they were struggling to stay alive due to new threats into their ecosystem. It is revealed later in the story that the artifact found in the sea is actually a cradle that contains seeds with altered superhumans, which were extracted from earth millions of years ago and were altered so they could live with other species (including the submarine snakes) on earth. The spaceship that carries the cradle is manned by robots/cyborgs and has hidden itself on Earth's ocean floor to make repairs. Dawson, Williams and Troy found the damaged ship in the bottom of the sea while looking for the missile, and were asked to gather materials so the ship can be repaired and it could go back to its mission. Before leaving earth, the ship asked the humans to keep the cradle because it would enormously help the human race to have such superhuman seeds to develop faster and better through time, but in the end the humans refuse in order to avoid future wars between the human and superhumans.  Critical response  The book has been criticized for excessive descriptions of the characters' personal lives unrelated to the plot and its numerous sex scenes. In one critic's words:Jones, C.:Cradle, Science Fiction and Society, accessed 24.8.2010. :\\"I‚Äôm all for character development and, if it‚Äôs pertinent to future events, I don‚Äôt really mind if it drags a little. But the first few hundred pages of Cradle are filled with more-or-less pointless character development, clearly written by Lee, that would be perfectly at home in a Harlequin romance novel. A few pages of sci-fi, clearly not written by Lee, are interspersed so that the reader may be reminded that they paid $6 for a Clarke novel and not $2 for a grocery store romance tome.\\" References *  External links  * 1988 British novels 1988 science fiction novels Literary collaborations Novels by Arthur C.

It was proposed by Jean-Pierre Serre and proven by Ken Ribet. The proof of the epsilon conjecture was a significant step towards the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. As shown by Serre and Ribet, the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture (whose status was unresolved at the time) and the epsilon conjecture together imply that Fermat's Last Theorem is true. In mathematical terms, Ribet's theorem shows that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties, then that curve cannot be modular (in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form which gives rise to the same Galois representation).  Statement  Let f be a weight 2 newform on Œì0(qN)-i.e. of level qN where q does not divide N-with absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation œÅf,p unramified at q if q ‚â† p and finite flat at q = p. Then there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that : \\\\rho_{f,p} \\\\simeq \\\\rho_{g,p}. In particular, if E is an elliptic curve over \\\\mathbb{Q} with conductor qN, then the modularity theorem guarantees that there exists a weight 2 newform f of level qN such that the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation œÅf, p of f is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation œÅE, p of E. To apply Ribet's Theorem to œÅE, p, it suffices to check the irreducibility and ramification of œÅE, p. Using the theory of the Tate curve, one can prove that œÅE, p is unramified at q ‚â† p and finite flat at q = p if p divides the power to which q appears in the minimal discriminant ŒîE. Then Ribet's theorem implies that there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that œÅg, p ‚âà œÅE, p.  The result of level lowering  Note that Ribet's theorem does not guarantee that if one begins with an elliptic curve E of conductor qN, there exists an elliptic curve E' of level N such that œÅE, p ‚âà œÅE‚Ä≤, p. The newform g of level N may not have rational Fourier coefficients, and hence may be associated to a higher-dimensional abelian variety, not an elliptic curve. For example, elliptic curve 4171a1 in the Cremona database given by the equation :E: y^2 + xy + y = x^3 - 663204x + 206441595 with conductor 43√ó97 and discriminant 437 √ó 973 does not level-lower mod 7 to an elliptic curve of conductor 97. Rather, the mod p Galois representation is isomorphic to the mod p Galois representation of an irrational newform g of level 97. However, for p large enough compared to the level N of the level-lowered newform, a rational newform (e.g. an elliptic curve) must level-lower to another rational newform (e.g. elliptic curve). In particular for p ‚â´ NN1+Œµ, the mod p Galois representation of a rational newform cannot be isomorphic to that of an irrational newform of level N. Similarly, the Frey-Mazur conjecture predicts that for p large enough (independent of the conductor N), elliptic curves with isomorphic mod p Galois representations are in fact isogenous, and hence have the same conductor. Thus non-trivial level-lowering between rational newforms is not predicted to occur for large p (in particular p > 17).  History  In his thesis, came up with the idea of associating solutions (a,b,c) of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve. If p is an odd prime and a, b, and c are positive integers such that :a^p + b^p = c^p, then a corresponding Frey curve is an algebraic curve given by the equation :y^2 = x(x - a^p)(x + b^p). This is a nonsingular algebraic curve of genus one defined over \\\\mathbb{Q}, and its projective completion is an elliptic curve over \\\\mathbb{Q}. In 1982 Gerhard Frey called attention to the unusual properties of the same curve as Hellegouarch, now called a Frey curve. This provided a bridge between Fermat and Taniyama by showing that a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would create such a curve that would not be modular. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when Frey (1986) suggested that the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem. However, his argument was not complete. In 1985 Jean-Pierre Serre proposed that a Frey curve could not be modular and provided a partial proof of this. This showed that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture would imply Fermat's Last Theorem. Serre did not provide a complete proof and what was missing became known as the epsilon conjecture or Œµ-conjecture. In the summer of 1986, Kenneth Alan Ribet proved the epsilon conjecture, thereby proving that the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture implied Fermat's Last Theorem.  Implications for Fermat's Last Theorem  Suppose that the Fermat equation with exponent p ‚â• 5 had a solution in non-zero integers a, b, c. Let us form the corresponding Frey curve Eap,bp,cp. It is an elliptic curve and one can show that its minimal discriminant Œî is equal to 2‚àí8 (abc)2p and its conductor N is the radical of abc, i.e. the product of all distinct primes dividing abc. By an elementary consideration of the equation ap \\\\+ bp = cp, it is clear that one of a, b, c is even and hence so is N. By the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture, E is a modular elliptic curve. Since all odd primes dividing a, b, c in N appear to a pth power in the minimal discriminant Œî, by Ribet's theorem one can perform level descent modulo p repetitively to strip off all odd primes from the conductor. However, there are no newforms of level 2 as the genus of the modular curve X0(2) is zero (and newforms of level N are differentials on X0(N)).

It serves as the Geographical Centre of South America and forms the metropolitan area of the state, along with the neighbouring town of V√°rzea Grande.Mato Grosso - information The city's name is an indigenous Bororo word meaning ‚Äòarrow- fishing‚Äô, The city was founded in 1719, during the gold rush,City in Focus: Cuiab√°, Brazil it has been the state capital since 1818. The city is a trading centre for an extensive cattle-raising and agricultural area. The capital is among the fastest-growing cities in Brazil, followed by the growth of agribusiness in Mato Grosso, despite the recession that is affecting Brazilian industries. Cuiab√° was one of the host cities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Cuiaba is the heart of an urban area that also includes the state's second largest city, V√°rzea Grande. Thermal electric and hydroelectric plants located in the area have been expanded since the completion of a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia in 2000 (see Pantanal Pipeline by Alex Ramsay). The city is the seat of the Federal University of Mato Grosso and the largest soccer stadium of the state, Arena Pantanal.Cuiaba - Britannica The city is a rich mix of European, African and Native American influences and numerous museums reflect this. Cuiab√° is also notable for its cuisine, dance, music and craftwork. Known as the \\"Southern gate to the Amazon\\", Cuiab√° experiences a hot humid tropical climate.  History  Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica with Cathedral of Senhor Bom Jesus de Cuiab√°, 1941. Cuiab√° was founded on January 1, 1727 by Rodrigo C√©sar de Menezes, then the \\"captain\\" of the captaincy of S√£o Paulo in the aftermath of the discovery of gold mines. The Ros√°rio Church built at the time in the centre of the little town marked the location of a rich seam of gold. However, in 1746 much of the town was destroyed by an earthquake.Cuiaba History National Archives of Brazil. It was given township status in 1818 and became the state capital in 1835. From the late eighteenth century, until the time of the Paraguayan War (1864-1870), the town remained small and was in decline. The war, however, brought some infrastructure and a brief period of economic boom, with Cuiab√° supplying sugar, foodstuffs and timber to the Brazilian troops. After the war, the town was once again forgotten by the rest of the country, to such an extent that the Imperial and later the Republican governments of Brazil used to use it as a site of exile for troublesome politicians. Isolation allowed it to preserve many of the oldest Brazilian ways of life until well into the twentieth century. Starting in 1930, the isolation was diminished, with the construction of roads and later with the advent of aviation. The town became a city and would grow quite rapidly from 1960 onwards, after the establishment of the newly built Brazilian capital in Bras√≠lia. Ipiranga Square. In the 1970s and 1980s, the pace of growth would continue to increase as agriculture became commercialized, using the roads to transport soybeans and rice produced in the state in order to be sold abroad. The growth was such that from 1960 to 1980 the small town of 50,000 inhabitants grew into a giant, with more than a quarter of a million inhabitants (including those from the surrounding area and towns). Since 1990, the rate of population growth has decreased, as other towns in the state have begun to attract more immigration than the capital. Tourism has emerged as a source of income and environmental issues have become a concern for the first time.alt=  Geography  Cuiab√° City Hall. Church of Our Lady of \\"Bom Despacho\\".alt=Cuiab√° borders the towns of Chapada dos Guimar√£es, Campo Verde, Santo Ant√¥nio do Leverger, V√°rzea Grande, Jangada and Acorizal. The city is an intersection of many major roads and waterways. However, on account of sand banks along the river, these waterways no longer support medium or large ships. The city at night. The third most important airport of the Brazilian Mid-West region is located in Cuiab√°, and the city is the centre of an important and productive agricultural region. It is famous throughout Brazil as one of the country's hottest cities, where temperatures are often above 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F). In central Cuiab√°, an obelisk marks the exact center of the South American continent, as calculated in 1909. However, more accurate measurements in the 1990s located the exact center about northeast of Cuiab√°, near the town of Chapada dos Guimar√£es. The town sits in a transition zone between three of the most characteristic Brazilian ecosystems: Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal. It is also close to the mountain range known as Chapada dos Guimar√£es (which blocks polar masses and causes the extremely hot weather). Cuiab√° is also known as the Southern gate to the Amazon. The municipality contains 11% of the Rio da Casca Ecological Station, a strictly protected conservation unit created in 1994. Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Cuiab√° has a tropical wet and dry climate. Cuiab√° is famous for its searing heat, although temperatures in winter can sometimes drop to . This is atypical, caused by cold fronts coming in from the south, and may only last one or two consecutive days then returning to the usual heat. The climate is tropical and humid. Rainfall is concentrated from September to May, the mass of dry air over the center of Brazil inhibiting the rain formation from June to August. The cold fronts dissipates the heat associated with the smoke produced by fires lit on during the dry season. The relative humidity drops to very low levels, sometimes below 15%, increasing cases of respiratory diseases. The average annual rainfall is , with maximum intensity from December to March. The mean maximum temperature reaches , but the absolute maximum can reach in hotter months but is muffled on rainy days, when the maximum temperature is typically only . The average low in July, the coldest month is with wind chill of .Temperature in Cuiab√° Vegetation The Massairo Okamura State Park provides a green space with typical cerrado vegetation in the centre of a highly urbanized area. It helps preserve the headwaters of the Barbado and Moinho streams. The Z√© Bolo Fl√¥ State Park is in the Grande Coxip√≥ district. The city also includes the M√£e Bonif√°cia State Park, created in 2000, also with typical cerrado trees. Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. It is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Humid fields and \\"buriti\\" palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils. \\"Cerrado\\" trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark, and leaves which are usually broad and rigid. Many herbaceous plants have extensive roots to store water and nutrients. The plant's thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape. These adaptations protect the plants from destruction and make them capable of sprouting again after the fire.  Economy  Street trading. The economy of Cuiab√° is concentrated on commerce, services and industry. Commerce and services based in Cuiab√° are important to the whole state, since the population is divided in several small agriculture-centered cities. People from these smaller cities often travel to the capital to access these services and buy goods not sold anywhere else. The industrial sector is represented, basically, by agribusiness, particularly food processing. Many industries, mainly those that should be maintained far from the populous areas, have been set up in the Industrial District of Cuiab√° (DIICC), which was founded in 1978. Even though it is located in one of the most agriculturally focused states of Brazil, Cuiab√° itself only grows small vegetable farms, mainly family- or cooperative-based. The city, with a GDP of 4.75 billion reals in 2003, according to the IBGE, is responsible for 21.99% of the total of the state GDP. Greater Cuiab√° possesses, currently, four shopping centers registered in the HUGS (Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers), and another 8 commercial galleries. The GDP for the city was R$7,189,521,000 (2006). The per capita income for the city was R$13,244 (2006). Education Federal University of Mato Grosso. English is taught as part of the official high school curriculum. Higher educational institutions include * IFMT - Instituto Federal de Educa√ß√£o, Ci√™ncia e Tecnologia de Mato Grosso (Public) * Universidade de V√°rzea Grande (UNIVAG) (private) * Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT) (Public); * Universidade de Cuiab√° (Unic) (Private); * Universidade C√¢ndido Rondon (Private); * and many others (mostly private). Culture Cultural Centre of Sesc in Cuiab√°. Historical Museum of Mato Grosso. There is a very rich local culture based on Portuguese, African and Amerindian influences. Cuiab√° is home to an interesting Indian (Native American) influenced cuisine, native dances, craftwork and music. Local dance and music were traditionally connected to the worship of Catholic saints, like Saint Benedict (the city's patron), but today is secular.

Also like many other cities in Brazil, Cuiab√° holds its own off-season Carnaval (\\"Carnaval fora de √©poca\\", or \\"micareta\\"), called Micarecuia. Transportation International airport Marechal Rondon International Airport (CGB). Marechal Rondon International Airport connects Cuiab√° with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights. The runway at Marechal Rondon International Airport was opened to traffic in 1956. In February 1975, Infraero took over the airport's administration and began various upgrades to meet the needs of the airport complex. In 1996, Marechal Rondon Airport, located from the city center,Airport informations started receiving international flights. Currently it serves more than 900 thousand passengers a year. The airport has one building. There are two sections, upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs is all check-in terminals, and upstairs there are shops, eateries and an observation lounge.Cuiaba airport Highways Cuiab√° is connected to the Pacific Ocean with the Interoceanic Highway, and to the Atlantic Ocean by the BR-364 Highway.Highway Light rail A light rail line, that would connect Cuiab√° with V√°rzea Grande in the Cuiab√° metropolitan area and the international airport,VLT - Cuiaba was under construction and was originally intended to begin operations in time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As of November 2018, the project appears to be abandoned, as construction is not taking place and construction of infrastructure never started being built, except for a portion of the line near the airport. None of the line is operational. Sports Arena Pantanal. Cuiab√° was one of 12 cities chosen to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Brazil. The games were to be played at the Arena Pantanal, a stadium completed in April 2014, with a capacity of 42,968. The stadium hosted four group matches in the tournament. It replaced the old Est√°dio Jos√© Fragelli (Verd√£o), which used to be the principal soccer stadium of the city. Verd√£o got demolished in 2010, and works on the new stadium commenced later that year. The architects GCP Arquitetos have focused strongly on sustainability and one of the stadium's noticeable features are the plants and trees that fill the four corner areas. Following completion, the stadium has become the permanent home of local sides Mixto EC and Cuiab√° EC.Arena Pantanal Next to the football stadium is the Tocantins Gymnasium - Gin√°sio Aecim Tocantins. The stadium has a car park of 15,000 spaces. Local side Mixto hold the record for most state titles, having won the Campeonato Mato-Grossense on 24 occasions. Mixto are also the only club from Mato Grosso to have played at the top level of Brazilian football, the Brasileir√£o, in 1976 and 1986. Even more contested than Manaus as a FIFA World Cup host city, Cuiab√° represents both the positive and negative of Brazil's hosting of the event. Negative because it is a relatively small, remote city with no great footballing tradition, best as its inclusion shows that the World Cup, geographically speaking at least, will be an event for all of Brazil and not just in the east coast capitals.Venue Guide - Cuiaba Sister cities * Kyzyl, RussiaEach is located in the exact centre of its respective continent Distances From S√£o Paulo - From Rio de Janeiro - From Bras√≠lia - Violence Cuiaba was ranked the 22¬∞ most violent city in the world by the Mexican NGO Seguridad, Justicia y Paz in 2015.

Shakargarh was previously in Gurdaspur district in British India, but now falls in district Narowal in Pakistan). His family moved to Chandigarh in 1947 during the Partition. They moved to Chandigarh in 1955. At the time, the city was being redesigned as a modern utopia by the Swiss/French architect Le Corbusier. It was to be the first planned city in India, and Chand found work there as a roads inspector for the Public Works Department in 1951. He was awarded the Padma Shri by Government of India in 1984. He died in 2015. The Rock Garden is one of the most famous sites in India. Chand, its creator, died in 2015, but it is still visited by millions of people every year. In his spare time, Nek Chand began collecting materials from demolition sites around the city . He recycled these materials into his own vision of the divine kingdom of Sukrani,New Delhi choosing a gorge in a forest near Sukhna Lake for his work. The gorge had been designated as a land conservancy, a forest buffer established in 1902 that nothing could be built on. Chand's work was illegal, but he was able to hide it for eighteen years before it was discovered by the authorities in 1975. By this time, it had grown into a complex of interlinked courtyards, each filled with hundreds of pottery-covered concrete sculptures of dancers, musicians, and animals. Made from recycled materials, Chand built up the mass with a cement and sand mix before adding a final coating of smoothly burnished pure cement combined with waste materials such as broken glass, bangles, crockery, mosaic and iron-foundry slag.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.58 Nek Chand sculptures at the AES campus in New Delhi. His work was in serious danger of being demolished, but he was able to get public opinion on his side, and in 1986 the park was inaugurated as a public space. Chand was given a salary, a title (\\"Sub-Divisional Engineer, Rock Garden\\"), and a workforce of 50 labourers so that he could concentrate full-time on his work. It even appeared on an Indian stamp in 1983. The Rock Garden is still made out of recycled materials; and with the government's help, Chand was able to set up collection centres around the city for waste, especially rags and broken ceramics. When Chand left the country on a lecture tour in 1996, the city withdrew its funding, and vandals attacked the park. The Rock Garden Society took over the administration and upkeep of this unique visionary environment. The garden is visited by over five thousand people daily, the second most popular location in India (after the Taj Mahal) with a total of more than twelve million visitor. The rock garden is visited by thousands of people everyday. It has become the famous tourist attraction in INDIA Exhibitions Chand's statues have found their way into museums across the world, including an environment at the Capitol Children's Museum in Washington, D.C., the American Folk Art Museum in New York City and the main entrance to the Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne, Switzerland. The John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Wisconsin, USA owns the largest collection of Chand's work outside of Chandigarh. The pieces were on exhibition there from June 2007 to January 2008 as part of the museum's focus on artist environment builders, or outsider artists. An exhibition of Chand's work also took place at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) gallery in Liverpool, England from 16 April to 11 May 2007. The exhibition displayed survey drawings of the garden's architecture and landscaping, and plans to be a travelling exhibition. Numerous Nek Chand sculptures are also displayed in the gardens and on the walkways of the campus of the American Embassy School in New Delhi.

It is southwest of the spa town of Lisdoonvarna. It is a noted centre of traditional Irish music, which is played nightly in its pubs, making it a popular tourist destination. There are numerous nearby archaeological sites, many dating to the Iron Age and earlier. Doonagore Castle and Ballinalacken Castle are also in the area. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht (an Irish-speaking community) prior to the 1950s, and maintains a connection with Irish-speaking areas - including via its maritime connection with the Aran Islands. Amenities and tourism Evening at Doolin Harbour, with the Cliffs of Moher and Hag's Head visible in the distance Layout The scattered village of Doolin comprises three sections - along with a harbour: * \\"The Harbour\\" is the departing point for boat trips to the Aran Islands and the Cliffs of Moher. There is also a campsite nearby * \\"Fisher Street\\" has O'Connor's Pub and several shops and hostels. * \\"Fitz's Cross\\" has a hostel, campsite, two new hotels and another pub which opened in 2006 * \\"Roadford\\" has McGann's and Mc Dermott's pubs, four restaurants, two hostels and a number of B&Bs.; Trips to Doolin Cave are also run from here. The Aille River runs from the hills of the Burren down past Doolin to meet the sea. The small Crab Island is a short distance out from Doolin Harbour, barren except for the remains of a 19th-century stone constabulary outpost. The Great Stalactite at Doolin Cave Doolin Cave The Great Stalactite, measuring 7.3 metres, was discovered in 1952. Doolin Cave claims that it is recognised as being the longest stalactite in the Northern hemisphere. Owing to environmental protection measures, concurrent visitor numbers are limited to 20 per tour. Surfing Doolin is a noted surfing destination. A break which generates Ireland's biggest wave, 'Aill na Searrach', is just off the Cliffs of Moher. The wave features in the movie Waveriders. Crab Island is also a local surfing spot. Rock climbing As well as serving as an accommodation centre for visitors to the major limestone rock climbing area of Ailladie (most climbs at or above E1 5b), a short 8 km drive away, Doolin has its own less-popular sea-cliff rock-climbing area, with several routes recorded. Like Ailladie, the cliffs are single-pitch steep limestone; however the rock is not of as high a quality, the cliffs are tidal, and access is not as easy. There are also several smaller inland crags scattered throughout the Burren region (e.g. Ballyryan, Murroughkilly, Aill na Cronain and Oughtdarra), and some good bouldering to be found along the coast, most notably at Lackglass, which was first bouldered in April 2005. Pubs Pubs in Doolin include Fitzpatricks, Gus O'Connor's, McDermott's and McGann's. The Micho Russell Festival Weekend is held each year after the last Friday in February.

Transport Ferry A ferry approaching Doolin Pier Doolin is one of three places (Galway and the village of Rossaveal on the northwest shore of Galway Bay are the others) with ferry services to the Aran Islands, which are visible from the town. A ferry service also brings tourists from Doolin Pier to the base of the Cliffs of Moher. Bus As Doolin is close to the Cliffs of Moher, a bus service between Galway and Ennis calls at both Doolin and the cliffs in each direction. Bus √âireann route 350 links Doolin to Ennis, Ennistymon, Cliffs of Moher, Lisdoonvarna, Fanore, Kinvara and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway. Road Two regional roads serve the village. The R479 connects the village both with coastal areas to the north and with Lisdoonvarna to the east. The R459 connects the village to the Cliffs of Moher, the Burren Way and the Inisheer ferry port. People Musicians associated with Doolin, who have lived there or played in its pubs, include Micho Russell and his brothers Packie and Gussie, Sharon Shannon, Davy Spillane, and Steve Wickham of The Waterboys. Popular culture Doolin is the main setting for the 2007 PlayStation 3 game Folklore. According to the game's storyline, the Netherworld, the world of the dead is a realm that can only be accessed from one place in the world, the sea-side village of Doolin. The Celtic band Gaelic Storm has a fiddle tune which references the town called \\"The Devil Went Down to Doolin\\" (presumably a play on the popular song The Devil Went Down to Georgia) on their album Herding Cats.

Early years √Åsmundur Sveinsson was born in Kolsstadir in West Iceland on 20 May 1893. In 1915 he moved to Reykjav√≠k where he enrolled in the Technical College of Iceland and apprenticed with sculptor R√≠kar√∞ur J√≥nsson for four years. In 1919 he relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, and from there to Stockholm, Sweden, where he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts where he remained for six years, much of it spent studying with sculptor Carl Milles. In 1924 he married sculptor Gunnfr√≠√∞ur J√≥nsd√≥ttir, whom he later divorced. After graduating from the Academy, √Åsmundur moved to Paris, France where he continued his study, here under the sculptor Charles Despiau. Work √Åsmundur returned to Iceland in 1929 and began producing a series of abstracted figurative works. His themes were often men and women at work and included such pieces as, The Blacksmith, The Washer Women and The Water Carrier. During the 1940s √Åsmundur's work moved even farther away from the human and animal form that had been his mainstay until then and by the 1950s he was producing work that was almost entirely abstract. Like many Icelandic artists, he drew upon the traditions of his native country when seeking subjects to inspire him. These include Trollwoman, (1948), Head Ransom, (1948), based on a poem that Egil Skallagrimsson composed to save his own head and bleep-Ride, (1944) taken from the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlusson. His S√¶mundur and the Seal, also in this vein, is situated in front of the main building of the University of Iceland in Reykjav√≠k. Generally, the artist believed in placing works of art not only in the hands of a small elite, but also in making them accessible to the public. Other works of √Åsmundur Sveinsson are to be found on the hill √ñskjuhl√≠√∞ near Perlan in Reykjav√≠k or at the farm of Borg √° M√Ωrum near Borgarnes. The abstract sculpture here represents the saga hero Egill having his dead son in his arms. The title Sonartorrek is referring to a poem which Egill Skallagrimsson wrote about this scene. √Åsmundur died in Reykjav√≠k on 9 December 1982. In 2015, his statue of poet Einar Benediktsson was moved to a spot near H√∂f√∞i house in Reykjavik, where the poet had lived. √Åsmundarsafn The former house of the artist in Laugardalur, Reykjav√≠k, has been installed as a museum, called √Åsmundarsafn. The house was constructed in the 1930s, based on designs drawn by the artist who was a fan of the Bauhaus style. The house is slightly reminiscent of Le Corbusier and his chapel of Ronchamp. The sculpture garden nearby is open to public.

Kruszelnicki is the Julius Sumner Miller Fellow in the Science Foundation for Physics at the School of Physics, University of Sydney.Dr Karl Kruszelnicki ‚Äî The Julius Sumner Miller Fellow ‚Äì Physics ‚Äì The University of Sydney. Physics.usyd.edu.au (3 May 2010). Retrieved on 22 October 2011. Early life Kruszelnicki () was born in Helsingborg, Sweden, to Polish parents, Rina and Ludwick. Kruszelnicki's background was hidden from him for a long time, with his mother having told him that she was Swedish and a Lutheran but she was, in fact, Polish and Jewish. Both his parents were Holocaust survivors. His father Ludwick, a Polish Gentile, was turned in to the Gestapo for smuggling Jews out of Poland and was imprisoned at Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp used mainly for political prisoners. As the end of World War II approached, Ludwick avoided execution by swapping identities with a dead person. Rina escaped the Auschwitz concentration camp when the Nazis ran out of Zyklon B used to gas prisoners. They separately fled to Sweden, where they met, and where Karl was later born. When Kruszelnicki was two years old, his parents became concerned about the risk of Sweden being overrun by Russia and decided to flee the country. Before boarding a boat bound for America, Karl became ill with fever following a smallpox vaccination. Worried for his health, his parents decided not to board the boat. \\"Luck has it that the next ship went to Australia, so that is where we ended up. It is amazing how fate can take you in unexpected directions.\\" On arrival in Australia, the family were tenanted at the migrant camp in Bonegilla, Victoria. They remained here for three years before settling in the city of Wollongong, New South Wales. Kruszelnicki talks of his childhood as a refugee in Wollongong as being difficult, and of desperately trying to fit in. \\"We weren't particularly liked and I got bullied at school a lot. Anybody who was not an Irish Catholic was considered an outsider.\\" He found an escape in the Wollongong Library and his quest for knowledge began. \\"I got into science fiction and funny stuff like that. And the librarians looked after me.\\" Education Kruszelnicki attended Edmund Rice Christian Brothers College in Wollongong, New South Wales.McIlwain, Kate. (30 July 2012). Dr Karl's advice for Edmund Rice boys\\", Illawarra Mercury. Retrieved 3 March 2016. After high school, he attended the University of Wollongong, completing a Bachelor of Science majoring in physics in 1968.\\"Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\\" (22 July 1988). Campus Bulletin, University of Newcastle, Australia. Number 5. In 1980 Kruszelnicki was awarded a Master of Biomedical Engineering at the University of New South Wales. He completed a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery at Sydney University in 1986.  Career  After high school, Kruszelnicki's first job was ditch digger in the Wollongong suburb of Dapto. Other odd jobs between careers included film maker, car mechanic, TV weatherman, and also as roadie for Slim Dusty, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. He worked for a time as a taxi driver in Sydney, and on one occasion was beaten unconscious after picking up a passenger trying to escape a group of men. After graduating from university at age 19, Kruszelnicki took a job as a physicist working for a steel works in his home town of Wollongong. Here he was required to test the strength of steel made for use in Melbourne's West Gate Bridge, which was under construction at the time. He designed a machine to test the steel. When asked to fake the results of his tests, he decided to resign. In the early 1980s he worked for ophthalmologist Fred Hollows. His Masters of Biomedical Engineering allowed him to design and build a machine to pick up electrical signals off the human retina to diagnose certain eye diseases. He commenced his degree in medicine at the University of Sydney at the age of 32, graduating in 1986. From here he began work at a number of hospitals around Sydney, including the Children's Hospital in Camperdown. He talks fondly of his time as a children's doctor, however he left this profession after witnessing the first child die from whooping cough in twenty years. This came about, he says, after a television program tried to create controversy by presenting the efficacy of vaccinations with a false balance. This caused a drop in herd immunity, and eventually the death of this child. \\"That very strongly influenced me to go into the media, because I felt like I could do more good there (convincing people to vaccinate). And as a result, I gave up the best job of my life, which was being a doctor in a kids' hospital, so I could do more good in the community.\\" Television Kruszelnicki presented the first series of Quantum (replaced by Catalyst) in 1985. As a science communicator and presenter, he appears on the Seven Network's Weekend Sunrise and on ABC TV. From early 2008 to 2010 he co-hosted a TV series called Sleek Geeks with Adam Spencer.  Journalism, radio and podcasts  Australian Skeptics Convention held in Sydney, November 2014. Kruszelnicki speaking on \\"Great moments in science\\". Kruszelnicki does a number of weekly radio shows. His hour-long show on ABC radio station Triple J has been going on in one form or another since 1981. This weekly science talkback show, is broadcast on Thursday mornings from 11:00 am to 12:00 and attracts up to 300,000 listeners; it is also available as a podcast. Kruszelnicki also often helps with other science and education Triple J promotions, such as the Sleek Geek Week roadshow with Adam Spencer and Caroline Pegram. He and Adam Spencer release the Sleek Geeks podcast regularly (about once a week). For many years, until March 2020, Kruszelnicki appeared on a live weekly late-night link-up on BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night, usually with Rhod Sharp (Thursdays 03:00 - 04:00 UK time), answering science questions. In 2017, he hosted Dr. Karl's Outrageous Acts of Science on Discovery Channel (Australia). Kruszelnicki writes a regular column for Australian Geographic magazine, called 'Need to Know' which is republished as a blog on the magazine's website. He has also written for the Sydney Morning Herald‚Äôs Good Weekend magazine. Politics Kruszelnicki was an unsuccessful candidate for the Australian Senate in the 2007 Australian federal election.

They have three children together: Karl, Alice and Lola. Kruszelnicki is a sufferer of the condition prosopagnosia where he lacks the ability to recognise faces. To help him recognise co-workers he has been known to carry a seating map of familiar office spaces. He puts the cause of his condition down to having an unhappy, lonely childhood, saying that it impeded the development of the part of his brain responsible for remembering faces. Recognition and awards In 2000, the Australian Financial Review Internet Awards awarded Kruszelnicki the Best Science and Technology Website. In the 2001 honours list, he was awarded the Centenary Medal \\"for major service in raising public awareness of the importance of science and technology\\". One of Kruszelnicki's more notable undertakings was his part in a research project on belly button fluff, for which he received the tongue-in- cheek Ig Nobel Prize in 2002. He received the Australian Father of the Year award in 2003. In the 2006 honours list, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia. In 2006, the Australian Skeptics recognized him as the Australian Skeptic Of The Year. In 2012, Kruszelnicki was named as a National Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

He was born in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, and died in Pisa. He was a leading member of the vigorous geometric school which flourished in Italy during the later years of the 19th century and the early years of the twentieth century. Biography Like his friend and colleague Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, Bianchi studied at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa under Enrico Betti, a leading differential geometer who is today best remembered for his seminal contributions to topology, and Ulisse Dini, a leading expert on function theory. Bianchi was also greatly influenced by the geometrical ideas of Bernhard Riemann and by the work on transformation groups of Sophus Lie and Felix Klein. Bianchi became a professor at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in 1896, where he spent the remainder of his career. At Pisa, his colleagues included the talented Ricci. In 1890, Bianchi and Dini supervised the dissertation of the noted analyst and geometer Guido Fubini. In 1898, Bianchi worked out the Bianchi classification of nine possible isometry classes of three-dimensional Lie groups of isometries of a (sufficiently symmetric) Riemannian manifold. As Bianchi knew, this is essentially the same thing as classifying, up to isomorphism, the three-dimensional real Lie algebras. This complements the earlier work of Lie himself, who had earlier classified the complex Lie algebras. Through the influence of Luther P. Eisenhart and Abraham Haskel Taub, Bianchi's classification later came to play an important role in the development of the theory of general relativity. Bianchi's list of nine isometry classes, which can be regarded as Lie algebras, Lie groups, or as three dimensional homogeneous (possibly nonisotropic) Riemannian manifolds, are now often called collectively the Bianchi groups. In 1902, Bianchi rediscovered what are now called the Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor, which play an even more important role in general relativity. (They are essential for understanding the Einstein field equation.) According to Tullio Levi-Civita, these identities had first been discovered by Ricci in about 1889, but Ricci apparently forgot all about the matter, which led to Bianchi's rediscovery. Where in the footnote one can read: These identities were staded without proof by PADOVA, on the strength of a verbal communication of RICCI (cf. 'Sulle deformazioni infinitesime', in Rend. della R. Acc. dei Lincei, (4), Vol. V (first half-year, 1889, p. 176). They were then forgotten even by Ricci himself. BIANCHI rediscovered them and published a proof obtained by direct calculation in 1902 (Ibid., (5), Vol. XI (first half-year, 1902, pp. 3-7). However, the contracted Bianchi identities, which are sufficient for the proof that Einstein tensor always vanishes, had been published by Aurel Voss in 1880.

They are an important tool in soliton theory and integrable systems. A B√§cklund transform is typically a system of first order partial differential equations relating two functions, and often depending on an additional parameter. It implies that the two functions separately satisfy partial differential equations, and each of the two functions is then said to be a B√§cklund transformation of the other. A B√§cklund transform which relates solutions of the same equation is called an invariant B√§cklund transform or auto-B√§cklund transform. If such a transform can be found, much can be deduced about the solutions of the equation especially if the B√§cklund transform contains a parameter. However, no systematic way of finding B√§cklund transforms is known.  History  B√§cklund transforms originated as transformations of pseudospheres in the 1880s. B√§cklund transforms have their origins in differential geometry: the first nontrivial example is the transformation of pseudospherical surfaces introduced by L. Bianchi and A.V. B√§cklund in the 1880s. This is a geometrical construction of a new pseudospherical surface from an initial such surface using a solution of a linear differential equation. Pseudospherical surfaces can be described as solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, and hence the B√§cklund transformation of surfaces can be viewed as a transformation of solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. The Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations The prototypical example of a B√§cklund transform is the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann system :u_x=v_y, \\\\quad u_y=-v_x,\\\\, which relates the real and imaginary parts u and v of a holomorphic function. This first order system of partial differential equations has the following properties. # If u and v are solutions of the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations, then u is a solution of the Laplace equation : u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 (i.e., a harmonic function), and so is v. This follows straightforwardly by differentiating the equations with respect to x and y and using the fact that #:u_{xy}=u_{yx}, \\\\quad v_{xy}=v_{yx},.\\\\, # Conversely if u is a solution of Laplace's equation, then there exist functions v which solve the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations together with u. Thus, in this case, a B√§cklund transformation of a harmonic function is just a conjugate harmonic function. The above properties mean, more precisely, that Laplace's equation for u and Laplace's equation for v are the integrability conditions for solving the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations. These are the characteristic features of a B√§cklund transform. If we have a partial differential equation in u, and a B√§cklund transform from u to v, we can deduce a partial differential equation satisfied by v. This example is rather trivial, because all three equations (the equation for u, the equation for v and the B√§cklund transform relating them) are linear. B√§cklund transforms are most interesting when just one of the three equations is linear. The sine-Gordon equation Suppose that u is a solution of the sine-Gordon equation : u_{xy} = \\\\sin u.\\\\, Then the system :\\\\begin{align} v_x & = u_x + 2a \\\\sin \\\\Bigl( \\\\frac{v+u}{2} \\\\Bigr) \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_y & = -u_y + \\\\frac{2}{a} \\\\sin \\\\Bigl( \\\\frac{v-u}{2} \\\\Bigr) \\\\end{align} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where a is an arbitrary parameter, is solvable for a function v which will also satisfy the sine-Gordon equation. This is an example of an auto-B√§cklund transform. By using a matrix system, it is also possible to find a linear B√§cklund transform for solutions of sine-Gordon equation. The Liouville equation A B√§cklund transform can turn a non-linear partial differential equation into a simpler, linear, partial differential equation. For example, if u and v are related via the B√§cklund transform :\\\\begin{align} v_x & = u_x + 2a \\\\exp \\\\Bigl( \\\\frac{u+v}{2} \\\\Bigr) \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_y & = -u_y - \\\\frac{1}{a} \\\\exp \\\\Bigl( \\\\frac{u-v}{2} \\\\Bigr) \\\\end{align} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where a is an arbitrary parameter, and if u is a solution of the Liouville equation u_{xy}=\\\\exp u \\\\,\\\\\\\\! then v is a solution of the much simpler equation, v_{xy}=0, and vice versa. We can then solve the (non-linear) Liouville equation by working with a much simpler linear equation.

It is well known for its Swiss Army knives. The Swiss Army knives made by Victorinox are made of a proprietary blend steel from Germany and France. Since its acquisition of rival Wenger in 2005, it has become the sole supplier of multi-purpose knives to the Swiss army. It is the biggest manufacturer of pocket knives in the world; in addition, the company licenses its logo for watches, apparel, and travel gear. History  Founding  The company was founded in 1884 as the workshop of Karl Elsener in Ibach. Elsener in 1891 co-founded Schweizerischer Messerschmiedverband, an association of Swiss knife manufacturers. Elsener and his colleagues from this time delivered knives to the Swiss army. In 1892, most of Elsener's colleagues left the enterprise, as it became apparent that Solingen manufacturers could deliver at a lower price. Elsener persisted in competing with Solingen, incurring severe financial losses. Elsenser's Schweizer Offiziers- und Sportmesser was patented in 1897, later marketed internationally as Original Swiss Army Knife. This knife was not adopted by the Swiss Armed Forces as ordnance, but its commercial success allowed the company to recover financially. On the death of his mother in 1909, Elsener named his company \\"Victoria\\" in her honour. The introduction of the Swiss coat of arms as company logo dates to the same year. In 1921, the company was renamed to the present \\"Victorinox\\", a portmanteau of \\"Victoria\\" and \\"inox\\", an abbreviation for acier inoxydable, the French term for stainless steel.  Original versus Genuine  During 1908 to 2005, the delivery of knives to the Swiss Armed Forces was shared with Wenger. A compromise between the two companies stated that Victorinox would market their knives as the \\"Original Swiss Army Knives\\", while Wenger would market theirs as \\"Genuine Swiss Army Knives\\". Wenger was acquired by Victorinox in 2005. Knives actually made for the army (as opposed to the generic \\"Swiss Army\\" trademark) are known as Soldatenmesser (\\"soldier knives\\"). These were produced in five generations, known by the date of their introduction as models 1890, 1908, 1951, 1961 and \\"08\\" (with minor variants within each generation). Model 1890 was originally produced by Wester & Co, Solingen, and produced by Elsenser in competition with the Solingen manufacturer. Models 1908 and 1951 were also produced by several companies in Germany and Switzerland. Model 1961 was produced exclusively by Victorinox and Wenger, and Model 08, introduced after the acquisition of Wenger, is exclusively manufactured by Victorinox.

In 1981, the company went public and Charles Elsener, president of Victorinox, acquired a significant percentage of its shares. In 1983, it was renamed the Forschner Group, Inc. In the 1980s, Forschner registered the Swiss Army name as a trademark in the USA. In 1992, Precise Imports Corp., U.S. and Canadian importer of Wenger knives, sued and Forschner retained the rights to use the trademark on its compasses, timepieces, and sunglasses, while Precise could use it in marketing other non-knife items. In the mid-1990s, Forschner changed its name to Swiss Army Brands, Inc. (SABI). In 2001, Victorinox teamed up with SABI to create an international watch company Victorinox Swiss Army Watch AG. In August 2002, Victorinox acquired all remaining shares of SABI to gain control of the Swiss Army trademark. Previously, SABI had sold the Swiss Army branded watch in North America and - under the license - the Victorinox branded watch outside North America. But afterwards, the combined Victorinox Swiss Army brand has been marketed worldwide.  Wenger acquisition  On 26 April 2005 Victorinox acquired Wenger, the other official supplier of the Swiss Army knife, announcing that it intended to keep both brands intact. In 2006 the company had a workforce of 900 employees and produced about 34,000 Swiss Army knives, 38,000 multi-tools, and 30,000 household, kitchen, and knives per workday. Approximately 90 percent of its production is exported to more than 100 countries. Victorinox has claimed never to have had to lay off an employee. To avoid this they set aside profits during boom periods to supplement recessionary periods, as well as temporarily contracting employees to other companies as outsourced labour during recessions. On 30 January 2013 Victorinox announced that the company will merge Wenger's knife product lines with the Victorinox brand to strengthen its competitive position internationally.  Luggage and clothing  In 2014, Victorinox acquired the TRG Group from Centric Group. For several years, TRG Group was the Victorinox licensee for the manufacturing of luggage and travel oriented products. Victorinox integrated TRG Group in the company as the Victorinox Travel Gear division. In 2017 Victorinox decided to close the apparel division with the purpose of focusing in other core product lines. Products  Swiss Army knives  Victorinox \\"Officer's Watch\\" (basic design) Victorinox \\"Huntsman\\" Swiss Army knife with knife chain and belt clip The Swiss Army knife is the best-known product by Victorinox. Originally the sole supplier, Victorinox has shared the contract with Wenger since 1908. A compromise between the two companies gave Victorinox the right to advertise as the Original Swiss Army Knife, while Wenger laid claim to the title of Genuine Swiss Army Knife. Victorinox took over Wenger in 2005. Swiss Army knives are widely used outside the army (and civil sales represent most of the turnover \\"Les couteaux Victorinox propos√©s au catalogue de l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\\", Radio t√©l√©vision suisse, 10 July 2017 (page visited on 10 July 2017).). They are multi- functional tools, and many sizes and functional combinations are produced. NASA astronauts have a Victorinox knife as standard equipment. Victorinox knives have also been taken to Mount Everest and the Arctic. The \\"Champion\\", Victorinox's model flagship prior to the introduction of the \\"SwissChamp\\" in 1986, is in the New York Museum of Modern Art's Permanent Design Collection.  SwissCard  The SwissCard is roughly the size of a business card, typically with a small pair of scissors, a short non-folding knife, a small file with a screwdriver point, a plastic toothpick, tweezers, a slim ballpoint pen, and a straight pin, housed in a hard plastic case of 82 √ó 54.5 x 4.5 mm in size, with an inch ruler on one side and metric measurements on the other. Victorinox produces three types of SwissCards, the Classic, the Quattro and the Lite model. All three models differ in the number of functions they provide, ranging from 10 (Classic) to 13 functions (Quattro and Lite).  Cutlery  Victorinox has long produced other kitchen cutlery under their own name and the Forschner brand name. In 2011 Victorinox stopped using the Forschner name and produces the same knives with the Victorinox name.  Professional knives  Bread Knife and Standard Cooking Knife Victorinox make a range of household and professional food preparation knives. They offer chef's knives, carving, filleting, deboning, paring, and specialized knives such as a cheese knife. Victorinox models are made with molded plastic handles, wooden handles or riveted handles. Most models are stamped blades, but one series has a forged bolster. They also have no ricasso ‚Äì the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the heel. Most models use stainless steel blades. One type is available with ceramic blades.  Bayonets  Victorinox also produces the Sturmgewehr 90 bayonet for the Swiss Sturmgewehr 90 assault rifle.sigsauer-2018-catalog.pdf The bayonet has an overall length of 310 mm and a muzzle ring diameter of 22 mm. The 177 mm long blade is single-edged and it has no fuller. The bayonets were manufactured exclusively for the Swiss Army by both Wenger and Victorinox before the two companies merged. Timepieces In 1989 Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name \\"Swiss Army\\".\\"Victorinox: History\\", swissarmy.com, Victorinox corporate website Victorinox has various collections of watches which range from luxury dress watches to rugged dive watches. They feature mechanical and quartz movements. Collections include Infantry, Divemaster, Airboss, I.N.O.X. The timepieces are produced in Switzerland.  Other  Victorinox produced a fashion line since the late 1990s, but retired from this project in 2017.\\"Victorinox gibt die Mode auf\\", NZZ, 17 February 2017. In 2012, Victorinox licensed its name to luggage manufacturer TRG Accessoires to produce branded travel gear and business accessories. Victorinox acquired TRG Accessories from Centric Group in 2014. A number of Emissive Energy Corps products have been redesigned and rebranded as Victorinox LED flashlights. Most are available with a knurled aluminium body, similar to Swiss Army knives. Similarly, SwissTools are Victorinox's multi-tools, i.e. a pair of pliers with other tools folded into the grips. In 2018, Victorinox marketed a perfume under the name \\"Swiss Army\\", and registered \\"Swiss Army\\" and \\"Swiss Military\\" as trademarks under US law. In October 2018, the Swiss Federal Office for Defence Procurement (Armasuisse) sued Victorinox, demanding the retirement of these trademarks. The context of the lawsuit is a 2012 parliamentary motion by state councillor Thomas Minder requesting the active protection of trademarks such as \\"Swiss Army\\", \\"Swiss Military\\" or \\"Swiss Air Force\\" on the part of the federal authorities.

Such a model is necessary as the commonly used Fermi liquid model breaks down for one dimension. The Tomonaga‚ÄìLuttinger liquid was first proposed by Tomonaga in 1950. The model showed that under certain constraints, second-order interactions between electrons could be modelled as bosonic interactions. In 1963, J.M. Luttinger reformulated the theory in terms of Bloch sound waves and showed that the constraints proposed by Tomonaga were unnecessary in order to treat the second-order perturbations as bosons. But his solution of the model was incorrect; the correct solution was given by and Elliot H. Lieb 1965.  Theory  Luttinger liquid theory describes low energy excitations in a 1D electron gas as bosons. Starting with the free electron Hamiltonian: H = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\epsilon_k c_k^{\\\\dagger} c_k is separated into left and right moving electrons and undergoes linearization with the approximation \\\\epsilon_k \\\\approx \\\\pm v_{\\\\rm F}(k-k_{\\\\rm F}) over the range \\\\Lambda: H = \\\\sum_{k = k_{\\\\rm F} -\\\\Lambda}^{ k_{\\\\rm F} +\\\\Lambda} v_{\\\\rm F} k(c_k^{R \\\\dagger } c_k^R - c_k^{L \\\\dagger }c_k^L) Expressions for bosons in terms of fermions are used to represent the Hamiltonian as a product of two boson operators in a Bogoliubov transformation. The completed bosonization can then be used to predict spin- charge separation. Electron-electron interactions can be treated to calculate correlation functions.  Features  Among the hallmark features of a Luttinger liquid are the following: * The response of the charge (or particle) density to some external perturbation are waves (\\"plasmons\\" - or charge density waves) propagating at a velocity that is determined by the strength of the interaction and the average density. For a non-interacting system, this wave velocity is equal to the Fermi velocity, while it is higher (lower) for repulsive (attractive) interactions among the fermions. * Likewise, there are spin density waves (whose velocity, to lowest approximation, is equal to the unperturbed Fermi velocity). These propagate independently from the charge density waves. This fact is known as spin-charge separation. * Charge and spin waves are the elementary excitations of the Luttinger liquid, unlike the quasiparticles of the Fermi liquid (which carry both spin and charge). The mathematical description becomes very simple in terms of these waves (solving the one-dimensional wave equation), and most of the work consists in transforming back to obtain the properties of the particles themselves (or treating impurities and other situations where 'backscattering' is important). See bosonization for one technique used. * Even at zero temperature, the particles' momentum distribution function does not display a sharp jump, in contrast to the Fermi liquid (where this jump indicates the Fermi surface). * There is no 'quasiparticle peak' in the momentum-dependent spectral function (i.e. no peak whose width becomes much smaller than the excitation energy above the Fermi level, as is the case for the Fermi liquid). Instead, there is a power-law singularity, with a 'non-universal' exponent that depends on the interaction strength. * Around impurities, there are the usual Friedel oscillations in the charge density, at a wavevector of 2 k_\\\\text{F}. However, in contrast to the Fermi liquid, their decay at large distances is governed by yet another interaction-dependent exponent. * At small temperatures, the scattering of these Friedel oscillations becomes so efficient that the effective strength of the impurity is renormalized to infinity, 'pinching off' the quantum wire. More precisely, the conductance becomes zero as temperature and transport voltage go to zero (and rises like a power law in voltage and temperature, with an interaction-dependent exponent). * Likewise, the tunneling rate into a Luttinger liquid is suppressed to zero at low voltages and temperatures, as a power law. The Luttinger model is thought to describe the universal low-frequency/long-wavelength behaviour of any one-dimensional system of interacting fermions (that has not undergone a phase transition into some other state).  Physical systems  Attempts to demonstrate Luttinger- liquid-like behaviour in those systems are the subject of ongoing experimental research in condensed matter physics. Among the physical systems believed to be described by the Luttinger model are: * artificial 'quantum wires' (one- dimensional strips of electrons) defined by applying gate voltages to a two- dimensional electron gas, or by other means (lithography, AFM, etc.) * electrons in carbon nanotubes * electrons moving along edge states in the fractional Quantum Hall Effect or integer Quantum Hall Effect although the latter is often considered a more trivial example. * electrons hopping along one-dimensional chains of molecules (e.g. certain organic molecular crystals) * fermionic atoms in quasi-one-dimensional atomic traps * a 1D 'chain' of half-odd-integer spins described by the Heisenberg model (the Luttinger liquid model also works for integer spins in a large enough magnetic field) * electrons in Lithium molybdenum purple bronze.

The Lebesgue measure is an example for such a function. In geometry, to translate a geometric figure is to move it from one place to another without rotating it. A translation \\"slides\\" a thing by a: Ta(p) = p + a. In physics and mathematics, continuous translational symmetry is the invariance of a system of equations under any translation. Discrete translational symmetry is invariant under discrete translation. Analogously an operator A on functions is said to be translationally invariant with respect to a translation operator T_\\\\delta if the result after applying A doesn't change if the argument function is translated. More precisely it must hold that :\\\\forall \\\\delta \\\\ A f = A (T_\\\\delta f).\\\\, Laws of physics are translationally invariant under a spatial translation if they do not distinguish different points in space. According to Noether's theorem, space translational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the momentum conservation law. Translational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not change the object. For a given object, the translations for which this applies form a group, the symmetry group of the object, or, if the object has more kinds of symmetry, a subgroup of the symmetry group.  Geometry  Translational invariance implies that, at least in one direction, the object is infinite: for any given point p, the set of points with the same properties due to the translational symmetry form the infinite discrete set {p + na  n ‚àà Z} = p + Z a. Fundamental domains are e.g. H + [0, 1] a for any hyperplane H for which a has an independent direction. This is in 1D a line segment, in 2D an infinite strip, and in 3D a slab, such that the vector starting at one side ends at the other side. Note that the strip and slab need not be perpendicular to the vector, hence can be narrower or thinner than the length of the vector. In spaces with dimension higher than 1, there may be multiple translational symmetry. For each set of k independent translation vectors, the symmetry group is isomorphic with Zk. In particular, the multiplicity may be equal to the dimension. This implies that the object is infinite in all directions. In this case, the set of all translations forms a lattice. Different bases of translation vectors generate the same lattice if and only if one is transformed into the other by a matrix of integer coefficients of which the absolute value of the determinant is 1. The absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by a set of translation vectors is the hypervolume of the n-dimensional parallelepiped the set subtends (also called the covolume of the lattice). This parallelepiped is a fundamental region of the symmetry: any pattern on or in it is possible, and this defines the whole object. See also lattice (group). E.g. in 2D, instead of a and b we can also take a and a ‚àí b, etc. In general in 2D, we can take pa + qb and ra + sb for integers p, q, r, and s such that ps ‚àí qr is 1 or ‚àí1\\\\. This ensures that a and b themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. If not, not all translations are possible with the other pair. Each pair a, b defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental domain. The vectors a and b can be represented by complex numbers. For two given lattice points, equivalence of choices of a third point to generate a lattice shape is represented by the modular group, see lattice (group). Alternatively, e.g. a rectangle may define the whole object, even if the translation vectors are not perpendicular, if it has two sides parallel to one translation vector, while the other translation vector starting at one side of the rectangle ends at the opposite side. For example, consider a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row a shift of a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, wallpaper group p1 (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern on the tile we have p2 (more symmetry of the pattern on the tile does not change that, because of the arrangement of the tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to consider as fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one. In 2D there may be translational symmetry in one direction for vectors of any length. One line, not in the same direction, fully defines the whole object. Similarly, in 3D there may be translational symmetry in one or two directions for vectors of any length. One plane (cross- section) or line, respectively, fully defines the whole object.  Examples   Text  An example of translational symmetry in one direction in 2D nr. 1) is: Note: The example is not an example of rotational symmetry. example example example example example example example example (get the same by moving one line down and two positions to the right), and of translational symmetry in two directions in 2D (wallpaper group p1):         (get the same by moving three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; consequently get also the same moving three lines down). In both cases there is neither mirror-image symmetry nor rotational symmetry. For a given translation of space we can consider the corresponding translation of objects. The objects with at least the corresponding translational symmetry are the fixed points of the latter, not to be confused with fixed points of the translation of space, which are non-existent.

The postcode is 2031.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 History Ventnor, Avoca Street Randwick was named after the village of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England, birthplace of Simeon Henry Pearce, who became Mayor of Randwick no fewer than six times.Rand Simeon, who migrated to Australia in 1842, and his brother James who arrived in 1848, were responsible for the founding and early development of Randwick. Simeon built the first stone house in the area in 1848, called Blenheim House, which can still be seen in Blenheim Street. It was neglected for some time in the mid-1900s, but was eventually acquired by Randwick City Council and restored. Proclaimed as a Municipality in February 1859, and as a City in 1990, Randwick has a rich history and a number of heritage buildings. Another Mayor of Randwick, George Kiss, lived in the house known as Ventnor in the 1870s.Kiss A two-storey sandstone house, Ventnor was built by Alderman Edward Dawson in 1859, and is situated on Avoca Street, overlooking Coogee. It is now owned by the nearby Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church (built 1888). Other buildings of note include the St Jude's Church group, also on Avoca Street. Originally designed by Edmund Blacket,The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981 (who also designed St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney and the University of Sydney), the church was completed in 1865. It was modified by H.M. Robinson in 1889. The rectory next door was built in 1870. The Verger's Residence, designed by Thomas RoweRowe and completed in 1862, was the original Randwick Municipal Chambers. This distinctive building, with its Gothic touches, was followed by the present Randwick Town Hall, which was built further north in Avoca Street in 1881. The church group and Ventnor are listed on the Register of the National Estate. Further south down Avoca Street is the sandstone building with a tower, built in 1859 as an investment property by William Ellis, one of Randwick's first six elected aldermen. After briefly being used as the 'Star and Garter' Inn by Mrs Elizabeth Shipway, it was later the home of Captain Thomas Watson,Wat who was responsible for commissioning the 1874 statue of Captain James Cook, sculpted by Walter McGill, which still stands at the south side of the building. Captain Watson also heightened the square tower, thus ensuring another distinctive landmark feature of the area. Close by is another even more imposing building in Randwick's heartland - the Prince of Wales Hospital, which started life as the Randwick Asylum for Destitute Children.Children Opened in 1858, it was partly financed by the legacy of Dr. Cuthill, whose name is commemorated by the adjacent Cuthill Street. The southern wing was added in 1863, by which time over 800 children were being cared for. In 1915 the Asylum buildings were finally deemed unsuitable as premises in which to provide a realistic home life for children, and they were then adapted for WWI use as a military and repatriation hospital. In 1953 the complex was officially re-named as the Prince of Wales Hospital, which continues to grow as a renowned medical facility. Other noteworthy buildings include private homes like Ilfracombe, Clovelly and Torquay in Avoca Street, and Venice, in Frenchmans Road. The latter was built 1884-84 on part of St Mark's Glebe. The land had been leased in 1880 for 99 years to S.Holmes and J.Parsons. The house features Tudor and Gothic elements and has stained glass windows. It has been described as a \\"comparatively rare and distinctive example of late Victorian Gothic architecture retaining most of its detailing intact.\\"State Heritage Website It has a New South Wales heritage listing. thumb Another notable home was Sandgate, located in Belmore Road. This sandstone house was built circa 1870 on Crown land purchased by Simeon Pearce in 1853. It was bought by the Federal Government in the 1920s; it was then used as a Red Cross facility for First World War veterans. It was saved from demolition in 1978 and restored by Randwick Council. The last Gothic mansion left in Randwick is Nugal Hall, located in Milford Street. It was designed by Mortimer Lewis and the southern portion of the house was built in 1853 for Alexander McArthur, a shipping merchant. The house features a staircase with glass dome above; the staircase was built of Mauritius mahogany and cedar. The coach house building at the front was originally a lodge for horse-drawn vehicles. The northern portion of the house was completed by Dr Fred Tidswell who owned the Coogee Bay Hotel. The architect of the northern portion is thought to have been Mortimer Lewis's son, Oswald. The Tidswell family owned the house from c. 1880 ‚Äì 1903. Frederick Squire Tidswell (1831‚Äì1898) and his wife Mary Ann (1836‚Äì1912) had nine children including the microbiologist Dr Frank Tidswell (1867‚Äì1941) and architect Thomas Tidswell (1870‚Äì1950).

Commercial area Randwick is primarily a residential area. The Randwick Racecourse takes up a large portion in the north-west corner of the suburb. The Prince of Wales Hospital, Royal Hospital for Women, Prince Henry Hospital and Sydney Children's Hospital are all located in Randwick. The main commercial area is centred on Belmore Road. A range of retail stores are located at Belmore Road along with two shopping centers (Royal Randwick Shopping Centerhttp://www.royalrandwick.com.au/home and Randwick Plaza,https://foursquare.com/v/randwick-plaza-shopping- centre/4bc53fb26c26b7134d28ebf3 which contains a Coles Supermarket) on eitherside of Belmore Road. Avoca Street is also quite popular for commerce, there is the 150 year old Coach and Horses Hotel. Where the two busy streets meet is the gourmet Cookhouse, a heritage sandstone building with a statue of Captain Cook outside and High Cross Park, with a war memorial. Within one kilometer, Coogee is another retail precinct offering good food services while enjoying the great view of the beach. The Spot at the Perouse and St Pauls Road junction also wins good fame for its popular restaurants, caf√©s and recreational facilities. Randwick's main entertainment district is The Spot, located in the suburb's south-east, which contains the Randwick Ritz cinema, a famous art deco cinema which dates from the 1930sRandwick Ritz cinema website and numerous cafes, bars and restaurants.107 restaurants, cafes and food options in the 2031 post code Churches * Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Catholic ChurchOur Lady of the Sacred Heart Parish (OLSH) * St Jude's Anglican ChurchSt Jude's Anglican Church * East Sydney Community Christian Church,East Sydney Community Christian Church * Randwick Presbyterian Church,Randwick Presbyterian Church * Canvas ChurchCanvas Church * Rhema Church of God.Rhema Church of God  Sport and recreation  Royal Randwick Racecourse Former Randwick Post Office Just 6 kilometres east of Sydney‚Äôs CBD, the City of Randwick, once known as the ‚ÄòSports Coast‚Äô is home to some 29 km of coastline, 10 beaches and bays and many major recreation facilities. Randwick City is one of the most visited tourist areas outside central Sydney, attracting some 13 million visits each year. The City is home to the Coastal Walkway, Randwick Racecourse, Coogee and Maroubra Beaches, Botany Bay National Park, Centennial Parklands (which includes Queens Park and Moore Park), several top class golf courses and major institutions including the University of New South Wales and the Prince of Wales Hospitals. A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area. Since 1882 the Randwick District Rugby Union Football Club nicknamed the 'Galloping Greens' or 'The Wicks' have represented the district in the Sydney premier grade rugby competition, the 'Shute Shield' and play their home games at the picturesque Coogee Oval. The local cricket team Randwick Petersham Cricket Club plays in the Sydney Grade Cricket domestic competition and was formed through a merger between Randwick and Petersham Cricket Clubs. Randwick has been jointly represented in the National Rugby League by the Sydney Roosters, formally the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club and the South Sydney Rabbitohs Rugby League Football Club. Local derby contests between these two neighbouring teams are always fiercely contested. Junior rugby league teams include the Clovelly Crocodiles, the Coogee Dolphins and Coogee Randwick Wombats. The former Randwick Post Office building in the centre of Randwick Junction (corner of Alison Road and Avoca Street) is known as Easts House. The building is owned by the Sydney Roosters (Eastern Suburbs Rugby League Club), which has donated the building for use by the Ted Noffs Foundation, for the purpose of providing assistance to troubled youth in the district. There are numerous community or corner parks like Alison Park, Randwick Peace Park, Frank Doyle Park, Fred Hollows Reserve and Writtle Park in the locality of Randwick used for recreational and sporting purposes.

The main bus corridor is Belmore Rd with buses to Bondi Junction, Coogee, Eastgardens, Maroubra, Sydney Airport and Sydney CBD. On 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build the CBD and South East Light Rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central Station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line splits into two branches - one of which heads to Randwick via Alison Road. A bus/tram interchange will be established in Randwick and many of the bus routes that currently traverse Anzac Parade to access the city will be replaced by feeder routes connecting to the light rail. Construction commenced in 2015 and services on the Randwick branch commenced in December 2019.

He is by many considered one of the most important artists of Iceland. Early life Born in poverty, he was adopted and as a young man worked as a fisherman. However, he spent every spare time drawing and painting and managed to learn basics from artist √Åsgr√≠mur J√≥nsson. At age 27 with financial support from fishermen and the Icelandic Confederation of Labour he passed an entrance examination and was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for higher education in the arts where he completed his studies. During the Copenhagen years he became acquainted with various styles including impressionism, expressionism and cubism but he also became an accomplished draughtsman. Later he also took shorter trips to France and Italy. Style Kjarval was a prolific painter, leaving thousands of drawings and paintings after a long life. The paintings vary greatly in style and frequently mix different styles into a very personal style. Although not surreal, some of his works include absurd and symbolist elements mixing elves and myths into landscape. Many of his works include Icelandic landscape and lava formation but many of his landscape paintings are partially \\"cubist\\" and abstract with his focus on zooming on the closest ground and less the impressive mysterious mountains in the background. Later in his life his art frequently also included abstract painting. Because of the unique mix of styles, it is an oversimplification to classify him has a landscape painter. His work includes expressionist, abstract, cubist, landscape and portrait paintings and drawings - and his \\"style promiscuity\\" was highly original as the man himself was.

A painting on the wall of a public house in Penicuik, Scotland Unique body snatching headstone, Stirling, 1823 Body snatching is the secret removal of corpses from burial sites. A common purpose of body snatching, especially in the 19th century, was to sell the corpses for dissection or anatomy lectures in medical schools. Those who practised body snatching were often called \\"resurrectionists\\" or \\"resurrection-men\\". A related act is grave robbery, uncovering a tomb or crypt to steal artifacts or personal effects that had been buried with the deceased; however, grave robbery differs from body snatching in that grave robbing does not involve stealing the corpse itself. United Kingdom Graveyard watchtower, Edinburgh Before the Anatomy Act of 1832, the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. Those who were sentenced to dissection by the courts were often guilty of comparatively harsher crimes. Such sentences did not provide enough subjects for the medical schools and private anatomical schools (which did not require a licence before 1832). During the 18th century hundreds had been executed for trivial crimes, but by the 19th century only about 56 people were being sentenced to capital punishment each year. With the expansion of the medical schools, however, as many as 500 cadavers were needed annually.East London History accessed 24 January 2007 Interfering with a grave was a misdemeanour at common law, not a felony, and therefore only punishable with a fine and imprisonment rather than transportation or execution.R v Lynn (1788) 100 All ER 395 made taking a body from a churchyard a misdemeanour The trade was a sufficiently lucrative business to run the risk of detection, particularly as the authorities tended to ignore what they considered a necessary evil.John Fleetwood, The Irish Body Snatchers, Tomar Publishing, Dublin, 1988. pp. 14‚Äì18 Mortsafe in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh Body snatching became so prevalent that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body until burial, and then to keep watch over the grave after burial, to stop it being violated. Iron coffins, too, were used frequently, or the graves were protected by a framework of iron bars called mortsafes, well-preserved examples of which may still be seen in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh. Mort houses, such as the circular Udny Mort House in Aberdeenshire built in 1832, were also used to store bodies until decomposition, rendering the cadavers useless for medical dissection. One method the body snatchers used was to dig at the head end of a recent burial, digging with a wooden spade (quieter than metal). When they reached the coffin (in London the graves were quite shallow), they broke open the coffin, put a rope around the corpse and dragged it out. They were often careful not to steal anything such as jewellery or clothes as this would cause them to be liable to a felony charge. Watchtower in Dalkeith town cemetery, Midlothian The Lancet reported another method. A manhole-sized square of turf was removed away from the head of the grave, and a tunnel dug to intercept the coffin, which would be about down. The end of the coffin would be pulled off, and the corpse pulled up through the tunnel. The turf was then replaced, and any relatives watching the graves would not notice the small, remote disturbance. The article suggests that the number of empty coffins that have been discovered \\"proves beyond a doubt that at this time body snatching was frequent\\". During 1827 and 1828, Burke and Hare brought a new dimension to the trade of selling corpses \\"to the doctors\\" by murdering rather than grave- robbing and supplying their victims' fresh corpses for medical dissection. Their activities, and those of the London Burkers who imitated them, resulted in the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832. This allowed unclaimed bodies and those donated by relatives to be used for the study of anatomy, and required the licensing of anatomy teachers, which essentially ended the body snatching trade. The use of bodies for scientific research in the UK is now governed by the Human Tissue Authority.John Fleetwood, The Irish Body Snatchers, Tomar Publishing, Dublin, 1988. pp. 9‚Äì13 The South Metropolitan cemetery at West Norwood, London constructed in 1837 had high walls and railings to deter unauthorised entry. 1862 saw a late example of body snatching occur at the Wardsend Cemetery in Sheffield. United States In the United States, body snatchers generally worked in small groups, which scouted and pillaged fresh graves. Fresh graves were generally given preference since the earth had not yet settled, thus making digging easier work. The removed earth was often shoveled onto canvas tarp laid by the grave, so the nearby grounds were undisturbed. Digging commenced at the head of the grave, clear to the coffin. The remaining earth on the coffin provided a counterweight which snapped the partially covered coffin lid (which was covered in sacking to muffle noise) as crowbars or hooks pulled the lid free at the head of the coffin. Usually, the body would be disrobed‚Äìthe garments thrown back into the coffin before the earth was put back into place. Resurrectionists have also been known to hire women to act the part of grieving relatives and to claim the bodies of dead at poorhouses. Women were also hired to attend funerals as grieving mourners; their purpose was to ascertain any hardships the body snatchers may later encounter during the disinterment. Bribed servants would sometimes offer body snatchers access to their dead master or mistress lying in state; the removed body would be replaced with weights. Although medical research and education lagged in the United States compared to medical colleges' European counterparts, the interest in anatomical dissection grew in the United States. Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York with several medical schools, were renowned for body snatching activity: all locales provided plenty of cadavers. Finding subjects for dissection proved to be \\"morally troubling\\" for students of anatomy. As late as the mid-19th century, John Gorham Coffin, a prominent aptly named professor and medical physician wondered how any ethical physician could participate in the traffic of dead bodies. Charles Knowlton (1800‚Äì1850) was imprisoned for two months in the Worcester (Massachusetts) County Jail for \\"illegal dissection\\" in 1824, a couple of months after graduating with distinction from Dartmouth Medical School. His thesishttp://www.danallosso.com/Graverobbing.html defended dissection on the rationalist basis that \\"value of any art or science should be determined by the tendency it has to increase the happiness, or to diminish the misery, of mankind.\\" Knowlton called for doctors to relieve \\"public prejudice\\" by donating their own bodies for dissection. The body of Ohio congressman John Scott Harrison, son of William Henry Harrison, was snatched in 1878 for Ohio Medical College, and discovered by his son John Harrison, brother of President Benjamin Harrison.\\"The Graveyard Robbers,\\" New York Times, May 31, 1878Stephen J. Taylor, \\"Ghoul Busters: Indianapolis Guards its Dead: Or Does It?\\", Hoosier State Chronicles: Indiana's Digital Newspaper Program (January 24, 2015). Large, gated, centralized cemeteries, which sometimes employed armed guards, emerged as a response to grave-robbing fears. Gated, \\"high-security\\" cemeteries were also a response to the discovery that many old urban and rural burying grounds were found to be practically empty of their human contents when downtown areas were re-developed and old pioneer cemeteries moved, as in Indianapolis. Use in medical schools The demand for cadavers for human dissection grew as medical schools were established in the United States. Between the years of 1758 and 1788, only 63 of the 3500 physicians in the Colonies had studied abroad, namely at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Study of anatomy legitimized the medical field, setting it apart from homeopathic and botanical studies. Later, in 1847, physicians formed the American Medical Association, in an effort to differentiate between the \\"true science\\" of medicine and \\"the assumptions of ignorance and empiricism\\" based on an education without the experience of human dissection. In 1762, John Morgan and William Shippen Jr. founded the medical department of University of Pennsylvania. Shippen put an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette in November 1762 announcing his lectures about the \\"art of dissecting, injections, etc.\\" The cost was \\"five pistoles.\\" In 1765, his house was attacked by a mob, claiming the doctor had desecrated a church burying ground. The doctor denied this and made known that he only used bodies of \\"suicides, executed felons, and now and then one from the Potter's Field\\". In Boston, medical students faced similar issues with procuring subjects for dissection. In his biographical notes, John Collins Warren Jr. wrote, \\"No occurrences in the course of my life have given me more trouble and anxiety than the procuring of subjects for dissection.\\" He continues to tell of the difficulty his father John Warren had finding subjects during the Revolutionary War: many soldiers who had died were without relation. These experiences gave John Warren the experience he needed to begin his lectures on anatomy in 1781. His advertisement in the local paper stated the following: \\"A Course of lectures will be delivered this Winter upon the several Branches of Physick, for the Improvement of all such as are desirous of obtaining medical Knowledge: Those who propose attending, are requested to make Application as soon as possible, as the Course will commence in a few days. It was dated and signed: Boston 01/01/1781 John Warren, Sec'y, Medical Society. Ebenezer Hersey, a physician, left Harvard College ¬£1,000 for the creation of a Professorship in Anatomy in 1770. A year earlier, John Warren and his friends had created a secret anatomic society. This society's purpose was to participate in anatomic dissection, using cadavers that they themselves procured. The group's name was the \\"Spunkers\\"; however, speaking or writing the name was prohibited. Often the group used shovels to obtain fresh corpses for its anatomical study. Harvard Medical School was established on November 22, 1782; John Warren was elected Professor of Anatomy and Surgery. When his son was in the college in 1796, the peaceful times provided few subjects. John Collins Warren Jr. wrote: \\"Having understood that a man without relations was to be buried in the North Burying-Ground, I formed a party ... When my father came up in the morning to lecture, and found that I had been engaged in this scrape, he was very much alarmed.\\" John Warren's quest for subjects led him to consult with his colleague, W.E. Horner, professor of anatomy at University of Pennsylvania, who wrote back: \\"Since the opening of our lectures, the town has been so uncommonly healthy, that I have not been able to obtain a fourth part of subjects required for our dissecting rooms.\\" Warren later enlisted the help of an old family friend, John Revere (son of Paul Revere) to procure subjects for dissection. Revere called upon John Godman who suggested that Warren employ the services of James Henderson, \\"a trusty old friend and servant\\" who could \\"at any time, and almost to any number, obtain the articles you desire.\\" Warren attempted to set up a cadaver provision system in Boston, similar to the systems already set up in New York and Philadelphia. Public officials and burial-ground employees were routinely bribed for entrance to Potter's Field to get bodies. In New York, the bodies were divided into two groupings‚Äìone group contained the bodies of those \\"most entitled to respect, or most likely to be called for by friends;\\" the other bodies were not exempt from exhumation. In Philadelphia's two public burying grounds, anatomists claimed bodies regularly, without consideration. \\"If schools or physicians differed over who should get an allotment of bodies, the dispute was to be settled by the mayor‚Äìa high-reaching conspiracy that resulted in a harvest of about 450 bodies per school year.\\" Race and body snatching Public graveyards were not only arranged by social and economic standing, but also by race. New York was 15% black in the 1780s. \\"Bayley's dissecting tables, as well as those of Columbia College\\" often took bodies from the segregated section of Potter's field, the Negroes Burying Ground. Free blacks as well as slaves were buried there. In February 1787, a group of free blacks petitioned the city's common council about the medical students, who \\"under cover of night...dig up the bodies of the deceased, friends and relatives of the petitioners, carry them away without respect to age or sex, mangle their flesh out of wanton curiosity and then expose it to beasts and birds.\\" In the Antebellum American South, bodies of enslaved workers were routinely used for anatomical study; in one case that has been studied, 80% of the corpses dissected at Transylvania University in the 1830s and 1840s were African American. the ready availability of such bodies was cited as an incentive to enroll by Southern medical schools such as the Medical College of South Carolina. According to Hampden-Sydney, in Richmond, Virginia, \\"from the peculiarity of our institutions [slavery], materials [anatomical subjects] can be obtained in abundance, and we belueve are not surpassed if equaled by any city in the country.\\" The bodies of criminals about to be executed were routinely requested of authorities for this purpose. After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia, the University of Virginia and Winchester Medical College both requested the cadavers of those about to be hung. Four, three black (Shields Green, John Anthony Copeland Jr., and Jeremiah Anderson), and one white (John Brown's son Watson Brown), were obtained by the latter college. In retaliation, Union troops burned Winchester Medical College in 1862; it never reopened. In December 1882, it was discovered that six bodies had been disinterred from Lebanon Cemetery and were en route to Jefferson Medical College for dissection. Philadelphia's African-Americans were outraged, and a crowd assembled at the city morgue where the discovered bodies were sent. Reportedly, one of the crowd urged the group to swear that they would seek revenge for those who participated in desecration of the graves. Another man screamed when he discovered the body of his 29-year-old brother. The Philadelphia Press broke the story when a teary elderly woman identified her husband's body, whose burial she had afforded only by begging for the $22 at the wharves where he had been employed. Physician William S. Forbes was indicted, and the case led to passage of various Anatomical Acts. After the public hanging of 39 Dakota warriors in the aftermath of the Dakota War of 1862, a group of doctors removed the bodies under cover of darkness from their riverside grave, and each took some for himself. Doctor William Worrall Mayo received the body of a warrior called \\"Cut Nose\\" and dissected it in the presence of other doctors. He then cleaned and articulated the skeleton and kept the bones in an iron kettle in his office. His sons received their first lessons in osteology from this skeleton. Public outcry On February 21, 1788, a body of a woman was taken from Trinity Church. A hundred-dollar reward was offered by the rector of the church for information leading to the arrest of grave robbers. In the Daily Advertiser, many editorial letters were written about the incident: one such writer named Humanio warned that \\"lives may be forfeit ... should [the body snatchers] persist.\\" There was cause for concern: body snatching was perceived to be \\"a daily occurrence.\\" To assuage the outraged public, legislation was enacted to thwart the activities of the body snatchers; eventually, anatomy acts, such as Massachusetts Anatomy Act of 1831, allowed for the legalization of anatomy studies. Prior to these measures allowing for more subjects, many tactics were employed to protect the bodies of relatives. Police were engaged to watch the burying grounds but were often bribed or made drunk. Spring guns were set in the coffins, and poorer families would leave items like a stone or a blade of grass or a shell to show whether the grave was tampered with or not. In his collection of Boston police force details, Edward Savage made notes of a reward offer on April 13, 1814: \\"The selectmen offer $100 reward for arrest of grave-robbers at South Burying- Ground\\". Iron fences were constructed around many burying grounds as well as a deterrent to body snatchers. \\"Burglar proof grave vaults made of steel\\" were sold with the promise that loved ones' remains would not be one of the 40,000 bodies \\"mutilated every year on dissecting tables in medical colleges in the United States.\\" The medical appropriation of bodies aroused much popular resentment. Between 1765 and 1884, there were at least 25 documented crowd actions against American medical schools. Despite these efforts, body snatchers persisted. At City Hospital in New York, on April 13, 1788, a group of boys playing near the dissection room window peered in. Accounts vary, but one of the boys saw what he thought were his mother's remains or that one of the students shook a dismembered arm at the boys. The boy, whose mother had recently died, told his father of the occurrence; the father, a mason, led a group of laborers in an attack on the hospital, known as the Doctors' Riot. In order to control the destruction of private property, the authorities participated in searches of local physicians' houses for medical students, professors, and stolen corpses. The mob was satisfied. Later, the mob reassembled to attack the jail where some of the medical students were being held for their safety. The militia was called, but few showed; this was perhaps due to the militia sharing the public's outrage. One small troop was harassed and quickly withdrew. Several prominent citizens‚Äìincluding Governor George Clinton; General Baron von Steuben, and John Jay‚Äìparticipated in the ranks of the militia protecting the doctors at the jail. Three rioters were killed when the embattled militia opened fire on the mob, and when militia members from the countryside joined the defense, the mob threat quickly dissipated. Other countries Australia In Tasmania, the bodies of William Lanne (1835‚Äì1869) and Truganini (1812‚Äì1876), considered at the time to be the last Aboriginal Tasmanians (Palawa), were both exhumed from their graves. Lanne's head, hands and feet were removed illegally by surgeon William Crowther and members of the Royal Society of Tasmania before he was buried, and the rest of his body was stolen after his burial. Truganini, who outlived Lanne by several years, had wished to avoid his fate and expressly asked to be cremated, but was buried anyway. The Royal Society of Tasmania exhumed her body and put it on display.Antje K√ºhnast: 'In the interest of science and the colony'. Truganini und die Legende von den aussterbenden Rassen.

Canada The practice was also common in other parts of the British Empire, such as Canada, where religious customs as well as the lack of means of preservation made it hard for medical students to obtain a steady supply of fresh bodies. In many instances the students had to resort to fairly regular body snatching. In Montreal during the winter of 1875, typhoid fever struck at a convent school. The corpses of the victims were stolen by body snatchers before relatives arrived from the United States, causing an international scandal. Rewards were offered which students collected to return bodies to the families. Eventually the Anatomy Act of Quebec was amended to prevent a recurrence, effectively ending medical body snatching in Quebec.Jack 1981, 130 China In China there were reports in 2006 of a resurgence in the ancient practice of ghost marriages in the northern coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Hebei and Shandong. Although the practice has long been abandoned in modern China, some superstitious families in isolated rural areas still pay very high prices for the procurement of female corpses for deceased unmarried male relatives. It is speculated that the very high death toll among young male miners in these areas has led more and more entrepreneurial body snatchers to steal female cadavers from graves and then resell them through the black market to families of the deceased. In 2007, a previously convicted grave robber, Song Tiantang, was arrested by Chinese authorities for murdering six women and selling their bodies as \\"ghost brides\\". Cyprus In Cyprus, the former President Tassos Papadopoulos's body was stolen from his grave on 11 December 2009. India For over 200 years, the city of Kolkata, in the north-eastern region of India, has been known to be the center of a network of bone traders who remove skeletons from graveyards in order to sell them to universities and hospitals abroad. In colonial times, British doctors used to hire thieves to dig up bodies from Indian cemeteries. Despite changes in laws, a similar process is going strong today. According to journalist Scott Carney, historically members of the Domar caste, who traditionally performed cremations, were pressed into service processing bones; skeletons were exported from India to be used in anatomy classes worldwide. In the 1850s, Calcutta Medical College processed 900 skeletons a year, but mostly for shipment abroad. A century later, a newly independent India dominated the world market for human bones. thumb At their height, in the early 1980s, Calcutta's bone factories took in an estimated $1 million a year by digging the graveyards of West Bengal after the mourners had left. In 1985 the Indian government banned the export of human bones after human rights groups raised questions about how the bones were being collected and pointed towards the greater need for institutions to obtain informed consent before remains were used for medical research. However, the human organ trade was only forced underground. In rural parts of northern India, the lowest classes sometimes cannot obtain wood for cremation or ground for burial, and the exposure of bodies is the result. The Indian government banned the export of human remains in the mid-1980s, but body snatching is still thriving, even if secretly, in many parts of the country as a result of ineffective laws and poverty. Ireland In Dublin, Ireland, the medical schools of the 18th and 19th centuries were on a constant hunt for bodies. The Bullys' Acre or Hospital Fields at Kilmainham was a rich source of anatomical material as it was a communal burial ground and easily accessed. Soldiers attached to the nearby Royal Hospital were always on the alert for grave robbers mainly because many of their comrades were buried there. In November 1825 a sentry captured Thomas Tuite, a known resurrectionist, in possession of five bodies. When searched his pockets were found to be full of teeth‚Äìin those days a set of teeth fetched ¬£1 (about ¬£50 in 2011). Many other graveyards were targets of the medical students or those who made robbing graves their profession. The largest cemetery in Ireland, Glasnevin Cemetery, laid out in the 18th century, had a high wall with strategically placed watch-towers as well as blood-hounds to deter body snatchers.John Fleetwood, The Irish Body Snatchers, Tomar Publishing, Dublin, 1988. Italy The first recorded case of body snatching is attributed to four medical students from Bologna in 1319.Body Snatching Around The World  History Detectives  PBS. [online] Available at: http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/body-snatching-around-the- world/ The Netherlands In The Netherlands, poorhouses were accustomed to receiving a small fee by undertakers who paid a fine for ignoring burial laws and resold the bodies (especially those with no family) to doctors. Contemporary body snatching  United Kingdom  Rare reports of body snatching continue to occur. One notorious case in the United Kingdom involved the removal of the remains of Gladys Hammond from Yoxall Churchyard near Lichfield in south Staffordshire. Mrs Hammond's remains were taken by animal rights activists who were campaigning against Darley Oaks Farm, a licensed facility that bred guinea pigs for scientific research. Mrs Hammond was the mother in law of one of the farm's owners. After a four-year investigation by Staffordshire Police four leaders of the Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs campaign group (three men: Kerry Whitburn of Edgbaston, John Smith of Wolverhampton, John Ablewhite of Manchester; and one woman: Josephine Mayo of Staffordshire) were jailed for conspiracy to blackmail. The men received 12 years each and the woman received four years. The police said the conspiracy included the removal of Mrs Hammond's remains, which were recovered by police following information given by one of the four.  United States  In February 2006, Michael Mastromarino, then a 42-year-old former New Jersey- based oral surgeon and CEO and executive director of operations at Biomedical Tissue Services, was convicted along with three employees of illegally harvesting human bones, organs, tissue and other cadaver parts from individuals awaiting cremation, for forging numerous consent forms, and for selling the illegally obtained body parts to medical companies without consent of their families, and then sentenced to long prison terms. BTS sold its products to five companies, including Life Cell Corporation, of New Jersey, and Regeneration Technologies, of Florida. There is still a demand for corpses for transplantation surgery in the form of allografts.Aaron Smith, \\"Tissue from corpses in strong demand\\" CNNMoney.com October 5, 2005, retrieved 18 May 2006 Modern body snatchers feed this demand.Aaron Smith, \\"Body snatchers tied to allograft firms?\\", CNNMoney.com October 7, 2005, retrieved 18 May 2006. Tissue gained in this way is medically unsafe and unusable. The broadcaster Alistair Cooke's bones were removed in New York City and replaced with PVC pipe before his cremation.Sam Knight, \\"Bodysnatchers steal Alistair Cooke's bones\\", Times online December 22, 2005, retrieved 18 May 2006. The director Toby Dye made a documentary titled Body Snatcher of New York about this case in 2010.  India  Though it banned the export of human remains in the mid-1980s, India continues to maintain a robust, if under the table, international trade in human skeletons, as journalist Scott Carney indicates In 2007, the Indian police discovered a stash of hundreds of human skulls and thigh bones and arrested a gang for allegedly carrying out the practice of body snatching and indulging in bone trade. This gang was arrested after they exhumed dozens of graves from Muslim cemeteries in Burdwan district, and smuggled the skeletons not just to medical institutions in need of cadavers across the world, but also to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan for use in Buddhist monasteries. Kamal Sah was caught carrying 67 human skulls and 10 bones on a bus in Chhapra, in the state of Bihar, by fellow passengers who had noticed a jagged bone sticking out of a bag beneath his seat. The investigating officer of the incident, Ravinder Nalwa, reported to a Reuters journalist that, \\"during the interrogation the gang members confessed that the hollow human thigh bones were in great demand in monasteries and were used as blow-horns, and the skulls as vessels to drink from at religious ceremonies.\\" Buddhist monks in India likewise admitted that human thigh bones and skulls were used by followers of a Tibetan school of Buddhism. Another report in the newspaper, The National, reported in 2009 how the alleged bone smuggler, Kamal Sah, was caught with two bags of human skulls and bones in Bihar state, who was identified by the civilians and handed over to the police. When questioned on the subject, the police refused to acknowledge the authorities failure to stamp out the practice and simply claimed that the police lacked \\"equipment, manpower and expertise to stop this practice\\". The criminal lawyer, Majid Menon, acknowledges that the dire economic conditions for vast numbers of people living in such states as Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, have favored the practice of body snatching till date and given room for bone smugglers to flourish. According to estimates, 20,000-25,000 human skeletons are smuggled out of India every year through Nepal, China, and Bangladesh. The skeletons reach markets in the US, Japan, Europe and the Middle East, mostly for medical institutions. The price for a complete the skeleton in these markets ranges from $700 to $1500 depending on the quality and size. In India, a full skeleton costs around $350 in the open market. Young Brothers, a Calcutta-based bone dealer, sells a human skeleton for $300. While the complete skeletons mostly find their way to medical laboratories mostly in the West, the assorted bones and skulls are used for religious rituals mostly in Hindu and Buddhist-dominated areas. As part of their tantric rituals, many tantrics drink wine in human skulls in places such as Nepal and the state of Assam in India. And even though till date police have been unable to unearth any irregularity in the skeleton trade, the exporter-turned-moralist, Sanker Narayan Sen, maintains that the people from the Domar caste are often responsible for body snatching and later process the procured cadavers for export.The Government of India had twice earlier banned exports, only to revoke its decision on each occasion. According to the Exporters Association, the CBI, in 2014 had once again recently concluded its investigations and submitted a report exonerating such body snatchers and exporters.

The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the vacuum expectation value v = (G_F \\\\sqrt{2})^{-1/2} of the Higgs field (where G_F is the Fermi coupling constant). In some cases the term electroweak scale is used to refer to the temperature of electroweak symmetry breaking, 159.5¬±1.5 GeV . In other cases, the term is used more loosely to refer to energies in a broad range around 100-1000 GeV. Interactions may have been above this scale during the electroweak epoch. In the unextended Standard Model, the transition from the electroweak epoch was not a first or a second order phase transition but a continuous crossover, preventing any baryogenesis. However many extensions to the standard model including supersymmetry and the inert double model have a first order electroweak phase transition (but still lack additional CP violation).

He was best known for being an accompanist to various hard bop artists in the Detroit area, including Donald Byrd and Jackie McLean. Biography Watkins was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States. An original member of the Jazz Messengers, he later played in Horace Silver's quintet and freelanced with Gene Ammons, Kenny Burrell, Donald Byrd, Art Farmer, Jackie McLean, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Sonny Rollins, and Phil Woods among others. Some of Watkins' best-known work can be heard, when as a 22-year-old, he appeared on the 1956 album, Saxophone Colossus by tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, with Max Roach and Tommy Flanagan. From that session, the tunes \\"Blue Seven\\" and \\"St. Thomas,\\" especially, have become revered not only as evidence of Rollins' original genius but as fine examples of Watkins' work. According to Horace Silver's autobiography, Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty, Watkins, along with Silver, later left Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers because the other members of the band at the time (Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley and Blakey) had serious drug problems, whereas Watkins and Silver were tired of being harassed and searched by the police every time they went to a gig in a new city and club. In 1958, Watkins joined Donald Byrd for a European tour, taking up extended residence at Le Chat Qui P√™che, a jazz club on Paris' Left Bank. Along with Byrd, tenor saxophonist Bobby Jaspar, pianist Walter Davis, Jr. and drummer Art Taylor, Watkins made two albums with Byrd during this time, one recorded in the club and another at a formal concert featuring Byrd's quintet. Watkins was known for his superb tone and distinct phrasing. He had a distinct walking tone and was right on the beat, forming an organic, indivisible relationship with his instrument as he swayed with it in perfect time. Pianist Red Garland often stated that Watkins was his favorite bassist and that he was always in tune and never off-key. Watkins played with Garland in 1959, along with drummer Specs Wright. While Watkins lived only to the age of 27, he appeared on well over 350 LPs in his career backing many major jazz stars of the time. When Charles Mingus briefly ventured over to the piano stool in 1961, he hired Watkins to take over the bass part; Oh Yeah!!! and Tonight at Noon were the results. Watkins recorded only two albums as leader. Watkins at Large (1956) is an album for the tiny Transition label, made with fellow members of the Horace Silver Quintet of the time ‚Äî most recently it has been available on a two-disc set, The Transition Sessions (Blue Note, 2002), which incorporates two additional Transition dates on which Watkins appears. The other Watkins-led session, Soulnik (1960), with Yusef Lateef and reissued as part of the OJC series, features Watkins on cello with Herman Wright backing him on bass. The cello was an instrument he had started to play only three days before the recording session. Watkins died in an automobile accident on February 5, 1962, while traveling from Arizona to San Francisco to meet drummer Philly Joe Jones for a gig. He fell asleep at the wheel and was hit head-on by an oncoming truck. The other occupants of the car, pianist Sir Roland Hanna and trumpeter Bill Hardman, survived the crash.

Born in the Old Vicarage, Padiham, near Burnley England, Tysoe ran part-time with the Skerton Harriers running team while still working as a farm labourer. Tysoe winning the Olympic 800 m Alfred Tysoe's grave In 1896, he won the Northern Counties 1000y and one mile titles. His running successes brought him to the attention of Harold Hardwick, founder of Salford Harriers in 1884; in 1897 Tysoe was persuaded to join the Salford club. Within his first year with Salford Harriers, he had won the AAA championships at one and ten miles. In 1898, he helped the team to win their sixth National Cross Country championship. At the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris, Tysoe was a favourite in the 800m, having just two weeks before the games broken the 880y world record by running 1:57.8. He won easily, beating John Cregan from the United States by 3 yards. He also won a gold medal as part of the British team in the 5000m team race. This proved to be his last season on the running track. In 1901, he became severely ill with pleurisy and died at his home in Blackpool, aged 27. He is buried in Layton Cemetery, Blackpool. His gravestone reads: \\"In loving memory of Alfred Ernest Tysoe. Amateur Champion half-mile runner of the world. Born March 21st 1874, Died October 26th 1901.

Supersymmetry breaking occurs at supersymmetry breaking scale. The superpartners, whose mass would otherwise be equal to the mass of the regular particles in the absence of the SUSY breaking, become much heavier.

Loos first came to public attention following her claims that she had conducted an affair with the married footballer David Beckham while she was employed as his personal assistant. The allegations led to Loos appearing on several reality television series, magazine covers, and in other media for a few years thereafter. Early life and education Loos was born in Madrid, Spain, but holds Dutch citizenship. Her father, Leonard Loos Bartholdi, was a Dutch diplomat, and her mother, Elizabeth Loos, is originally from Surrey, England. Loos was privately educated at Runnymede College in Madrid. She is a second cousin of Piers Morgan. Career Loos became the personal assistant to the former England football captain, David Beckham when he transferred to Real Madrid in July 2003. Her employment was terminated a few months later, and Loos subsequently gave an interview to the British tabloid newspaper News of the World in April 2004, alleging that she and Beckham had conducted a four-month affair. The claims were never corroborated and were dismissed by Beckham as \\"ludicrous\\", although he did not mount a legal challenge to the story. Shortly after the newspaper coverage of her alleged affair with Beckham, Loos commenced a career as a media personality. In 2004, she briefly appeared as a hostess on the Dutch TV programme Shownieuws (alongside the singer Gerard Joling who had represented the Netherlands in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest). In October 2004, Loos made a controversial appearance on the reality television programme The Farm, a Channel 5 version of the RT√â show Celebrity Farm. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accused producers of pandering to a \\"morbid and sordid fascination with farm animals\\" while PETA and Mediawatch-uk demanded the show be taken off the air. In 2005, Loos appeared on the ITV network \\"reality\\" TV show Celebrity Love Island. The same year, Loos took part in a staged wedding ceremony with American fashion model Jenny Shimizu for the television programme Power Lesbian UK\\"Jenny Shimizu & Rebecca Loos: what's the story?\\" by Jane Czyzselka, Diva magazine, November 2005. Retrieved 16 November 2007. to protest against America's laws on gay marriage. It was broadcast in the United States as Power Lesbians on LOGO which profiled successful lesbians in Los Angeles. The two had a relationship for a period thereafter. Loos has stated that she is bisexual and \\"has been ever since she was a teenager.\\"\\"When Hello means Bi for now\\" The Observer, 9 May 2004. In 2006, Loos played for the England Women's football team in a Sky TV charity event. In April of the same year, Loos ran the London Marathon, and raised more than ¬£7,000 in sponsorship for the British Red Cross. Later in May, Loos appeared on The X Factor: Battle of the Stars alongside James Hewitt ‚Äì where she famously received a negative reception from judge Sharon Osbourne.\\"You Loos, Sharon\\" Daily Mirror, 5 June 2006. In 2007, Loos was a contestant on the Spanish version of Survivor in which she came third. In November of that year, she appeared in Sky TV's Cirque de Celebrite in which she was one of two new contestants introduced midway through the series. In 2008, Loos was a guest on The Podge and Rodge Show. In September, she had a part in a Dutch feature film called Mijn vader is een Detective. In October, she took part in the Dutch version of 71 Degrees North (71 Graden Noord). Loos has been featured on the cover of Playboy, FHM, Nuts, Zoo and other men's magazines. Personal life Loos met her future husband, Norwegian doctor Sven Christjar Skaiaa while she was filming 71 Graden Noord.

The company was formed by the merger of Bendigo Bank and Adelaide Bank in November 2007. Before the merger, Bendigo Bank delivered its products and services through almost 900 outlets Australia-wide, including more than 160 company owned branches, 220 community owned Community Bank branches of Bendigo Bank, 100 agencies and 400 Elders outlets. The bank's branches are primarily in Victoria and Queensland. The merged bank now has over 400 branches, including 25 that came with the merger of Adelaide Bank. National headquarters remain in the city of Bendigo, with a major office in Adelaide, South Australia and regional offices in Docklands, Melbourne and Ipswich, Queensland. History and development The company started in 1858 as a fixed-term (terminating) building society to improve conditions in the Bendigo goldfields during the Victorian gold rush. At seven years old, in 1865, the company restructured, taking the name Bendigo Mutual Permanent Land and Building Society, which incorporated in Victoria 11 years afterwards. It continued to expand its holdings when, in 1978, it merged with Bendigo and Eaglehawk Star, a building society established in 1901. Further growth involved the acquisition of the building societies Sandhurst, in 1983, and Sunraysia, in 1985, a merger with Sandhurst Trustees Ltd and the acquisition of Capital and Compass building societies. In 1982 BBS became the first financial institution in Australia to introduce successfully both Visa credit and debit cards. 1993 saw BBS receive a stockmarket listing. Its growth continued throughout the 90s when it acquired National Mortgage Market Corporation Limited in 1995, a mortgage-manager company focussed on loan introducers and brokers. In that year BBS converted to a bank with the name Bendigo Bank. In 1997, Bendigo Bank acquired Monte Paschi Australia from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, an Italian banking group, for AU$42.255M. Monte Paschi Australia was renamed Cassa Commerciale Australia in the same year. Bendigo Bank's \\"Community Bank\\" program began in 1998‚Äîthe first branches opened in the western Victoria towns of Minyip and Rupanyup on 26 June and the first metropolitan branch in the outer eastern suburb of Upwey on 19 October. The late 1990s saw a further development when Bendigo Bank and Elders Australia formed Elders Rural Bank, a joint venture company focused on agribusiness and rural Australia. Bendigo Bank was also the first financial institution to introduce a mortgage offset account, now a standard banking product in Australia. In 1999 the bank formed an alliance involving mutual shareholding with IOOF. The bank received its operating licence in 2000 and absorbed the First Australian Building Society in Queensland, acquiring a new regional headquarters in Ipswich. That same year saw a A$75 million head office expansion in Bendigo. In 2002 Bendigo Bank introduced the first \\"Green Loans\\" in Australia and formed \\"Community Sector Banking\\", a banking joint venture with the not-for-profit sector. Three years later, Bendigo Bank built a regional headquarters on Harbour Esplanade in Melbourne, Docklands. In 2007 Bendigo Bank rejected Bank of Queensland's merger/takeover proposal, and merged with Adelaide Bank. The A$4 billion takeover was completed on 30 November. Subsequently, shareholders voted to change the company's name to Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, with the change taking effect from 31 March 2008. On 11 December 2008, Bendigo Bank's new headquarters in Bendigo was completed. The 26th Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, was present at the opening. On 16 December 2011, Bendigo Bank announced that it has reached agreement with the Bank of Cyprus Group to acquire its 100 per cent owned Australian subsidiary, Bank of Cyprus Australia Limited (BOCAL). The purchase will be for an estimated total consideration of A$130 million. It has been renamed Delphi Bank. In April 2013, Bendigo Bank's subsidiary 'Oxford Funding' rebranded as Bendigo Debtor Finance, offering independent credit assessments and cash-flow solutions to businesses on a national level. In June 2014, the bank became the first in Australia to adopt an investment policy which shunned fossil fuel investments. \\"Specifically, the bank does not lend to companies for whom the core activity is the exploration, mining, manufacture or export of thermal coal or coal seam gas.\\"Bendigo Bank executive Marnie Baker, Bendigo Advertiser, 7 June 2014 On 1 March 2015, a group of credit unions diverged from Cuscal and aligned with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to form Alliance Bank. The credit unions were AWA Credit Union/Mutual (Geelong, 1969), Circle Credit Co-operative Limited (Deer Park, 1969), Service One Credit Union (ACT, circa 1950), BDCU (Berrima, 1963), and in 2018 NOVA (Newcastle, 1964). Alliance Bank maintains some autonomy, but conducts regulated banking activities through Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. They still market themselves under their original name suffixed with \\"Alliance Bank\\" and declare themselves agents of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. In 2015 Bendigo bank openly supported the building and funding of a mosque in Bendigo. While locals protested against both the mosque and the immigration Bendigo bank responded by closing the account of a group called Stop the Mosque who spoke out against the mosque. The bank chairman said that history showed Bendigo was an inclusive community and he believed that is the sort of place needed again, and bigotry and hate were not Bendigo's values. In April 2014, after it closed the account, Bendigo Bank stated in closing the account that it only wants to do business with organisations that share its values. This drew criticism from a local councillor. The bank said that it values tolerance and inclusiveness, which are important parts of a strong community. Community Bank program Community Branch at Braidwood, New South Wales Community Bank is an innovative franchise program in which the local community owns and operates a Bendigo Bank branch (which is separately incorporated) and Bendigo Bank provides all the banking infrastructure and support. The community company, after paying its branch running costs, shares any remaining profit with the Bendigo Bank. The program was a response to the massive closure of bank branches in rural areas. Bendigo Bank has since extended the program to areas with existing bank services. Subsidiaries of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank include Rural Bank, Rural Bank ONE, Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, Bendigo Debtor Finance (formerly Oxford Funding), LeveragedEquities, Sandhurst Trustees, Delphi Bank (formerly Bank of Cyprus Australia), Bendigo Financial Planning, and Bendigo Bank Telco. Bendigo and Adelaide Bank joint ventures with Community 21 in its Community Sector Banking project. Bendigo and Adelaide Bank had acquired Wheeler Financial Services which was merged with Bendigo Financial Planning, and also acquired Southern Finance.

Hotel Covenant College is a private Christian liberal arts college on Lookout Mountain in Dade County, Georgia, near Chattanooga, Tennessee. History Founded in 1955 in Pasadena, California as an agency of the Bible Presbyterian Church, Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary moved its campus to St. Louis, Missouri the following year. Following a split among the Bible Presbyterians, it became affiliated with the Bible Presbyterian Church-Columbus Synod (renamed the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961). In 1964, it separated from the seminary, moving to Lookout Mountain, in Georgia.William F. Hull, Lookout Mountain, Arcadia Publishing, 2009, , p. 94. In 1965, it was the site of the merger between the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. It became and remains an agency of the Presbyterian Church in America after the 1982 merger between the RPCES and the PCA. As such, Covenant stands in the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions.

The focus of the college is found in its motto, \\"In All Things Christ Preeminent.\\"Colossians 1:18 The purpose of this focus is to ground excellence in academic inquiry in a biblically grounded frame of reference. The college offers Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and Master of Education degrees, and several pre-professional programs. In addition, Covenant is home to the Chalmers Center for Economic and Community Development (established 1999), which offers courses and programs in community and economic development in the urban United States and throughout the developing world. Covenant's faculty is composed of 67 full-time teaching faculty members, 92% of whom hold doctorates or terminal degrees in their fields. The student-faculty ratio is 13:1. This ratio ensures a better learning environment, due to the \\"personal, small class size\\".https://www.princetonreview.com/college/covenant-college-1023259 The college has been accredited since 1971 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Covenant College has a literary magazine known as The Thorn that has been published annually since 1970.https://portal.covenant.edu/archives/entry/2779 The magazine features creative work from the students and faculty and is currently available online. Athletics Covenant has sports teams that compete at the intercollegiate level in men's and women's soccer, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's golf, baseball, softball and women's volleyball. Its athletic teams are known as the Scots. Covenant is a member of NCAA Division III. Covenant joined the USA South Athletic Conference in 2010 where a number of its programs have won conference championships in recent years. Campus The campus is located at the top of Lookout Mountain in Dade County, Georgia, near the city of Lookout Mountain, Georgia. Carter Hall Carter Hall is the signature building on campus. It was originally named The Lookout Mountain Hotel and was built in 1928 by the Dinkler Hotel Corporation and run by Paul Carter, for whom the building is now named. It has been rumored, although not confirmed, that Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher spent their honeymoon there.https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College- Renovation-Latest.aspx It was popularly known as the \\"Castle in the Clouds.\\" However, since it was completed less than a year before the Great Depression, the hotel soon went bankrupt. It opened and closed several times prior to 1960, when it shut down for the last time. Bill Brock, the grandfather of the college's fourth president, Frank Brock, served on the original board of the hotel. Both the exterior and interior of Carter Hall are Austro-Bavarian Gothic revival in style. The building has had two towers in its history. The first tower was similar in design to the Frauenkirche (Cathedral of Our Lady) in Munich. Poor maintenance before acquisition by the college required it to be rebuilt. The new tower, though considerably simpler in style, maintains the architectural style of the original tower. Covenant College bought the building in 1964, upon relocating to Lookout Mountain. During the first few years of Covenant's operation on the mountain, all the functions of the college were contained within Carter Hall. At that time, it housed the chapel, the library, the classrooms, the professors' offices, dorm rooms, the dining hall, and administrative offices. Today, it has all of these except the library, as well as a snack bar and the campus bookstore, as well as the mailroom.https://www.covenant.edu/students/residence/carter The current halls of Carter are 5th South and Borderlands (men's), 4th North, Central and South (women's), 3rd North, Central and South (women's), 2nd Central and 2nd South (men's). From 2015 to 2017, Carter underwent significant renovations. They included improving the stucco, fixing insulation and moisture issues, and renovating the tower.https://archpaper.com/2018/01/rehabilitating-lookout- mountains-historic-castle- clouds/#gallery-0-slide-0https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant- College-Renovation-Latest.aspx Founders Hall Founders Hall contains three wings, each named for members of the founding generation of Covenant College. Belz Hall, the first to be built, was completed in 1972, is named after pastor and Christian educator Max Belz, a member of Covenant College's original board of trustees. Belz Hall houses approximately 100 students and was originally a men's dorm. In 1990 and 1993 two new wings were added to the structure, and the building was renamed Founders Residence Hall. Currently the dorm halls for Belz are as follows: Ekklesia (a men's hall on the main floor), Brethren (a men's hall on the second floor), 1st Belz (a men's hall on the first floor), and Catacombs (a men's floor on the basement level). Schmidt Hall, completed in 1990, is named in honor of Rudy and Collyn Schmidt, co- founders and long-time friends of the college, involved in virtually every dimension of college life since its inception. The dorm halls in Schmidt include Balcony (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Jungle (a women's hall on the main floor), and Jubilee (a women's hall on the second floor). Rayburn Hall was completed in 1993 and is named for Robert G. Rayburn, the founding president of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Rayburn include Highlands (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Gracewell (a women's hall on the main floor), and Blackwatch (a men's hall on the second floor). Maclellan/Rymer Hall The Maclellan wing of the hall, built in 1998, was named in honor of the Maclellan Foundation, a longtime supporter of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Maclellan wing of the building include Sutherland (a men's hall on the second floor), Suburbs (a men's hall on the third floor), Rowan (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Halcyon (a women's hall on the fifth floor). The Rymer wing of the building, completed in 2000, was given by Ann Caudle Rymer and her son, S. Bradford Rymer, Jr. The dorm halls in the Rymer wing include The Five Points (a men's hall on the second floor), Lawrence (a men's hall on the third floor), Harambe! (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Chi Alpha (a women's hall on the fifth floor). Andreas Hall Andreas Hall, completed in 2007 as part of the BUILD campaign, is located slightly south of Maclellan/Rymer Hall, and is the newest addition to the college's residence halls. It is named for Lowell Andreas, a recent financial supporter of Covenant College. It houses over 100 students and is four stories tall. The dorm halls in Andreas include Ithaca (a men's hall on the second floor), Bloodfield (a men's hall on the second floor), Ruhama (a women's hall on the third floor), Kallah (a women's hall on the third floor), The Fritz (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Imani (a women's hall on the fourth floor).

Note: The state of Missouri did not have legislation requiring medical registration until March 27, 1874. author,Osteopathy:Research & Practice, Eastland Press, Inc (1910 & 1992) inventor and Kansas territorial and state legislator. He was one of the founders of Baker University, the oldest four-year college in the state of Kansas, and was the founder of the American School of Osteopathy (now A.T. Still University), the world's first osteopathic medical school, in Kirksville, Missouri. Early life and interests Still was the son of a Methodist minister and physician. At an early age, Still decided to follow in his father's footsteps as a physician. After studying medicine and serving an apprenticeship under his father, he entered the Civil War. He served as a hospital steward assigned to Company F of the Cass County Home Guard of the Missouri Cavalry (Union), but later stated in his autobiography that he served as a \\"de facto surgeon.\\" Despite biographical accounts of him earning an MD there appears to be no record that he was ever conferred one. At the time, the hospital stewards of the Army had many responsibilities, including maintaining hospital stores, furniture, and supplies for the sick. Since pharmacists were not provided for the hospitals, the hospital stewards also filled prescriptions, and when the medical officers were not present, they took care of the patients. Hospital Stewards were sometimes rewarded with promotions to surgeon or assistant surgeon. In his autobiography Still says he served in the Civil War in Company F of the 9th Kansas Cavalry. His military service record for the Missouri regiment says that his company was transferred to the 9th Kansas Infantry, not cavalry, but that the transfer was made \\"without proper authority.\\" The judge advocate general then orders that these men not be given credit for this unauthorized service. After the Civil War and following the death of his wife, three of his children, and an adopted child from spinal meningitis in 1864, Still concluded that the orthodox medical practices of his day were frequently ineffective and sometimes harmful. He devoted the next thirty years of his life to studying the human body and finding alternative ways to treat disease. During this period, he completed a short course in medicine at the new College of Physicians and Surgeons in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1870. His initial method of studying the human body was controversial and disturbing. His personal account details that he would desecrate the graves of Native Americans by removing the remains for the purposes of dissection. Still adopted the ideas of spiritualism sometime around 1867, and it \\"held a prominent and lasting place in his thinking.\\"Trowbridge, Carol. Andrew Taylor Still, 1828-1917. Truman State University Press, 1991, 232 pages Kansas territorial and state legislator Still was active in the abolition movement and a friend and ally of the Free State leaders John Brown and James H. Lane. He became deeply embroiled in the fight over whether Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 provided that the settlers in those two territories would decide the question for themselves. Civil war raged in Kansas as both sides tried to gain control of the territorial government. In October 1857, Still was elected to represent Douglas and Johnson counties in the Kansas territorial legislature. Still and his brothers took up arms in the cause and participated in the Bleeding Kansas battles (between the pro and anti-slavery citizens). By August 1858, a free-state constitution had been passed; Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861. Inventor and patents Still was fascinated by machines, and whenever faced with a mechanical problem, his answer was always to devise a better approach. In the 1870s, he patented an improved butter churn. He made improvements to a mowing machine designed to harvest wheat and hay, but before a patent could be submitted, his idea was stolen by a visiting sales representative from the Wood Mowing Machine Co. In 1910, he patented a smokeless furnace burner but had \\"some difficulty producing a full-sized working model. Heartbroken after his wife, Mary Elvira's, death in May 1910, he did not have the will to pursue the matter further, and the invention was never successfully marketed.\\" Baker University Still and his family were among the founders of Baker University in Baldwin City in 1858, the first four-year university in the state of Kansas. Still was involved in selecting the location for the site of Baker University's first building. Along with his brother, Still donated 640 acres of land for the university campus. While maintaining his medical practice, where he treated patients afflicted with small-pox and cholera, Still spent five years building the facilities. Osteopathy Still believed that osteopathy was a necessary discovery because the current medical practices of his day often caused significant harm and conventional medicine had failed to shed light on the etiology and effective treatment of disease. At the time Still practiced as a physician, medications, surgery and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey and opium. Additionally, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures. Dr. Still sought to reform existing 19th-century medical practices. Still investigated alternative treatments, such as hydropathy, diet, bonesetting, and magnetic healing. Still found appeal in the relatively tame side effects of those modalities and imagined that someday \\"rational medical therapy\\" would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery and very sparing use of drugs, including anesthetics, antiseptics and antidotes. He invented the name osteopathy by blending two Greek roots osteon- for bone and -pathos for suffering in order to communicate his theory that disease and physiologic dysfunction were etiologically grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs. Still founded the first school of osteopathy based on this new approach to medicine - the school was called the American School of Osteopathy (now A.T. Still University) in Kirksville, Missouri in 1892. Still was also one of the first physicians to promote the idea of preventive medicine and the philosophy that physicians should focus on treating the disease rather than just the symptoms.The True Fountainhead of Osteopathy, Journal of Osteopathy, p. 230. Still defined osteopathy as: In a 1907 interview by the Topeka Daily Capital newspaper, A.T. Still's son, Charles Still, D.O., described his father's philosophy that the body would operate smoothly into old age, if properly maintained and that every living organism possessed the ability to produce all the necessary chemicals and materials to cure itself of ailments. Publications Still published four books during his life. His first book, published in 1897, was entitled Autobiography of Andrew Taylor Still with a History of the Discovery and Development of the Science of Osteopathy. A revised edition of the book was re-published in 1908 after a fire damaged the original printing plates. In 1899, Still published his second book, Philosophy of Osteopathy. In 1902, Still published his third book, The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy, although some dispute remains over the date. Still published his fourth and final book in 1910, entitled Osteopathy Research and Practice. Honors In December 2013, Still was announced as an inductee to the Hall of Famous Missourians. His bronze bust will be one of forty-four on permanent display in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City. For the first time in the hall's history, the public was allowed to vote on new inductees. Still received over 38 percent of the votes, far outdistancing all others in consideration. See also * S. S.

Generally, it contains no physical particles. Zero-point field is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of an individual quantized field. According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is \\"by no means a simple empty space\\". According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of existence.AIP Physics News Update,1996Physical Review Focus Dec. 1998 The QED vacuum of quantum electrodynamics (or QED) was the first vacuum of quantum field theory to be developed. QED originated in the 1930s, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was reformulated by Feynman, Tomonaga and Schwinger, who jointly received the Nobel prize for this work in 1965. For an historical discussion, see for example For the Nobel prize details and the Nobel lectures by these authors see Today the electromagnetic interactions and the weak interactions are unified (at very high energies only) in the theory of the electroweak interaction. The Standard Model is a generalization of the QED work to include all the known elementary particles and their interactions (except gravity). Quantum chromodynamics (or QCD) is the portion of the Standard Model that deals with strong interactions, and QCD vacuum is the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. It is the object of study in the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and is related to the so-called vacuum structure of strong interactions. Non-zero expectation value The video of an experiment showing vacuum fluctuations (in the red ring) amplified by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. If the quantum field theory can be accurately described through perturbation theory, then the properties of the vacuum are analogous to the properties of the ground state of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, or more accurately, the ground state of a measurement problem. In this case the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of any field operator vanishes. For quantum field theories in which perturbation theory breaks down at low energies (for example, Quantum chromodynamics or the BCS theory of superconductivity) field operators may have non-vanishing vacuum expectation values called condensates. In the Standard Model, the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking, is the mechanism by which the other fields in the theory acquire mass. Energy In many situations, the vacuum state can be defined to have zero energy, although the actual situation is considerably more subtle. The vacuum state is associated with a zero-point energy, and this zero-point energy has measurable effects. In the laboratory, it may be detected as the Casimir effect. In physical cosmology, the energy of the cosmological vacuum appears as the cosmological constant. In fact, the energy of a cubic centimeter of empty space has been calculated figuratively to be one trillionth of an erg (or 0.6 eV).Sean Carroll, Sr Research Associate - Physics, California Institute of Technology, June 22, 2006 C-SPAN broadcast of Cosmology at Yearly Kos Science Panel, Part 1 An outstanding requirement imposed on a potential Theory of Everything is that the energy of the quantum vacuum state must explain the physically observed cosmological constant. Symmetry For a relativistic field theory, the vacuum is Poincar√© invariant, which follows from Wightman axioms but can be also proved directly without these axioms. Poincar√© invariance implies that only scalar combinations of field operators have non-vanishing VEV's. The VEV may break some of the internal symmetries of the Lagrangian of the field theory. In this case the vacuum has less symmetry than the theory allows, and one says that spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. See Higgs mechanism, standard model. Non-linear permittivity Quantum corrections to Maxwell's equations are expected to result in a tiny nonlinear electric polarization term in the vacuum, resulting in a field-dependent electrical permittivity Œµ deviating from the nominal value Œµ0 of vacuum permittivity. These theoretical developments are described, for example, in Dittrich and Gies. The theory of quantum electrodynamics predicts that the QED vacuum should exhibit a slight nonlinearity so that in the presence of a very strong electric field, the permitivity is increased by a tiny amount with respect to Œµ0. What's more, and what would be easier to observe (but still very difficult!), is that a strong electric field would modify the effective permeability of free space, becoming anisotropic with a value slightly below Œº0 in the direction of the electric field and slightly exceeding Œº0 in the perpendicular direction, thereby exhibiting birefringence for an electromagnetic wave travelling in a direction other than that of the electric field. The effect is similar to the Kerr effect but without matter being present.Mourou, G. A., T. Tajima, and S. V. Bulanov, Optics in the relativistic regime; ¬ß XI Nonlinear QED, Reviews of Modern Physics vol. 78 (no. 2), 309-371 (2006) pdf file. This tiny nonlinearity can be interpreted in terms of virtual pair productionKlein, James J. and B. P. Nigam, Birefringence of the vacuum, Physical Review vol. 135, p. B1279-B1280 (1964). The required electric field is predicted to be enormous, about 1.32 \\\\times 10^{18}V/m, known as the Schwinger limit; the equivalent Kerr constant has been estimated, being about 1020 times smaller than the Kerr constant of water. Explanations for dichroism from particle physics, outside quantum electrodynamics, also have been proposed. Experimentally measuring such an effect is very difficult, and has not yet been successful. Virtual particles The presence of virtual particles can be rigorously based upon the non-commutation of the quantized electromagnetic fields. Non-commutation means that although the average values of the fields vanish in a quantum vacuum, their variances do not. The term \\"vacuum fluctuations\\" refers to the variance of the field strength in the minimal energy state, and is described picturesquely as evidence of \\"virtual particles\\". It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles, or variances, based upon the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle: ::\\\\Delta E \\\\Delta t \\\\ge \\\\hbar \\\\ , (with ŒîE and Œît being the energy and time variations respectively; ŒîE is the accuracy in the measurement of energy and Œît is the time taken in the measurement, and is the Reduced Planck constant) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the \\"borrowing\\" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times. Although the phenomenon of virtual particles is accepted, this interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universal. One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty Œît determines a \\"budget\\" for borrowing energy ŒîE. Another issue is the meaning of \\"time\\" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position and momentum , for example) do not satisfy a canonical commutation relation (such as ). Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy. The very many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a long and continuing subject. Physical nature of the quantum vacuum According to Astrid Lambrecht (2002): \\"When one empties out a space of all matter and lowers the temperature to absolute zero, one produces in a Gedankenexperiment [thought experiment] the quantum vacuum state.\\" According to Fowler & Guggenheim (1939/1965), the third law of thermodynamics may be precisely enunciated as follows: > It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any > assembly to the absolute zero in a finite number of operations.Fowler, R., > Guggenheim, E.A.

Photon-photon interaction can occur only through interaction with the vacuum state of some other field, for example through the Dirac electron-positron vacuum field; this is associated with the concept of vacuum polarization.Jauch, J.M., Rohrlich, F. (1955/1980). The Theory of Photons and Electrons. The Relativistic Quantum Field Theory of Charged Particles with Spin One-half, second expanded edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, , pages 287‚Äì288. According to Milonni (1994): \\"... all quantum fields have zero-point energies and vacuum fluctuations.\\"Milonni, P.W. (1994). The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics, Academic Press, Inc., Boston, , page xv. This means that there is a component of the quantum vacuum respectively for each component field (considered in the conceptual absence of the other fields), such as the electromagnetic field, the Dirac electron-positron field, and so on. According to Milonni (1994), some of the effects attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field can have several physical interpretations, some more conventional than others. The Casimir attraction between uncharged conductive plates is often proposed as an example of an effect of the vacuum electromagnetic field. Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978) are cited by Milonni (1994) as validly, though unconventionally, explaining the Casimir effect with a model in which \\"the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero.\\"Milonni, P.W. (1994). The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics, Academic Press, Inc., Boston, , page 239. In this model, the observed phenomena are explained as the effects of the electron motions on the electromagnetic field, called the source field effect. Milonni writes: > The basic idea here will be that the Casimir force may be derived from the > source fields alone even in completely conventional QED, ... Milonni > provides detailed argument that the measurable physical effects usually > attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field cannot be explained by that > field alone, but require in addition a contribution from the self-energy of > the electrons, or their radiation reaction. He writes: \\"The radiation > reaction and the vacuum fields are two aspects of the same thing when it > comes to physical interpretations of various QED processes including the > Lamb shift, van der Waals forces, and Casimir effects.Milonni, P.W. (1994). > The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics, Academic > Press, Inc., Boston, , page 418. This point of view is also stated by Jaffe (2005): \\"The Casimir force can be calculated without reference to vacuum fluctuations, and like all other observable effects in QED, it vanishes as the fine structure constant, , goes to zero.\\"Jaffe, R.L. (2005). Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum, Phys. Rev. D 72: 021301(R), http://1‚Äì5.cua.mit.edu/8.422_s07/jaffe2005_casimir.pdf Notations The vacuum state is written as 0\\\\rangle or \\\\rangle.

Originally chieftain of the Qoyunlu branch of the Qajar tribe, Agha Mohammad Khan was enthroned as the king of Iran in 1789, but was not officially crowned until March 1796, having deposed Lotf Ali Khan of the Zand dynasty in 1794. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar was famously the eunuch Monarch, being castrated as a young adult upon his capture by Adel Shah Afshar, and hence was childless. He was assassinated on 17 June 1797, and was succeeded by his nephew, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. Agha Mohammad Khan's reign is noted for the return of a centralized and unified Iran and for relocating the capital to Tehran, where it still stands today. He is also noted for his cruel and rapacious behavior, particularly during the re-subjugation of Georgia. He sacked the capital Tbilisi, massacred many of its inhabitants, and moved some 15,000 Georgian captives back to mainland Iran. Early life (1742‚Äì1779) Family and youth Astarabad, the birthplace of Agha Mohammad Khan. Agha Mohammad Khan was born in Astarabad around 1742. He belonged to the Qoyunlu (also spelled Qawanlu) branch of the Qajar tribe. The Qajars were one of the original Turkoman Qizilbash tribes that emerged and spread in Asia Minor around tenth and eleventh centuries. They later supplied power to the Safavids since the dynasty's earliest days. The tribe had several other branches, one of the most prominent ones being the Develu, which often fought against the Qoyunlu. Agha Mohammad Khan was the eldest son of the chieftain of the Qoyunlu clan, Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and the grandson of Fath-Ali Khan Qajar, a prominent aristocrat executed by the orders of Shah Tahmasp II (possibly compelled by Nader Qoli Beg, who came to be known as Nader Shah after usurping the throne of Iran in 1736, marking the foundation of the Afsharid dynasty). Agha Mohammad Khan had several half- brothers and full-brothers: Hossein Qoli Khan, Morteza Qoli Khan, Mostafa Qoli Khan, Reza Qoli Khan, Jafar Qoli Khan, Mehdi Qoli Khan, Abbas Qoli Khan and Ali Qoli Khan. When Nader Shah died in 1747, the Afsharid rule of Iran fell apart, which gave Mohammad Hasan an opportunity to seize Astarabad for himself, leading Nader Shah's nephew Adel Shah to march from Mashhad to the city in order to capture him. Although he failed to capture Hasan, Adel Shah managed to capture Agha Mohammad Khan, whom he planned to kill. He later chose to spare Agha Mohammad Khan's life and instead had him castrated and thereafter freed. While the common spelling of \\"Agha\\" (ÿ¢ŸÇÿß) is usually used as a title roughly translated to \\"Sir\\" or \\"Mister\\", Agha Mohammad Khan's title is differently spelled (ÿ¢ÿ∫ÿß), which is a common one among eunuchs who served at the court. Death of Mohammad Hasan During the following 10 years, Afsharid rule in Khorasan suffered heavily from war among rival chieftains and from invasions by the Durrani ruler of Qandahar, Ahmad Shah Durrani. During this period, Mohammad Hasan fought against the Pashtun military leader Azad Khan Afghan and the Zand ruler Karim Khan for suzerainty over the western part of Nader Shah's former empire. He was, however, defeated in 1759 by a Zand army. He was betrayed by his own followers and thereafter, killed by his old rival, Mohammad Khan of Savadkuh. Due to Agha Mohammad Khan's castration, his brother Hossein Qoli Khan was appointed as the new chieftain of the Qoyunlu instead. Shortly thereafter Astarabad fell under the control of Karim Khan, who appointed a Develu named Hossein Khan Develu as its governor. Meanwhile, Agha Mohammad Khan and his brother Hossein Qoli Khan fled to the steppe. One year later, Agha Mohammad Khan made an incursion against Astarabad, but was forced to flee, chased by the city's governor. Agha Mohammad Khan managed to reach Ashraf, but was at last seized and was sent as a hostage to Tehran, ruled by Karim Khan. Hossein Qoli Khan was also soon captured and sent to Karim Khan. Life at court Picture of the Arg of Karim Khan, the royal residence of the Zand dynasty, where Agha Mohammad Khan spent most of his time during his \\"captivity\\". During his stay, Agha Mohammad Khan was treated kindly and honorably by Karim Khan, who made him convince his kinsmen to lay down their arms, which they did. Karim Khan then settled them in Damghan. In 1763, Agha Mohammad Khan and Hossein Qoli Khan were sent to the Zand capital, Shiraz, where their paternal aunt Khadija Begum, who was part of Karim Khan's harem, lived. Agha Mohammad Khan's half-brothers Morteza Qoli Khan and Mostafa Qoli Khan were granted permission to live in Astarabad, due to their mother being the sister of the governor of the city. His remaining brothers were sent to Qazvin, where they were treated honorably. Agha Mohammad Khan was looked upon more as a respected guest in Karim Khan's court than a captive. Furthermore, Karim Khan also acknowledged Agha Mohammad Khan's political knowledge and asked his advice on interests of the state. He called Agha Mohammad Khan his \\"Piran-e Viseh\\", referring to an intelligent counselor of the mythical Turanian king Afrasiab in the Shahnameh epic. Two of Agha Mohammad Khan's brothers who were at Qazvin were also sent to Shiraz during this period. In February 1769, Karim Khan appointed Hossein Qoli Khan as the governor of Damghan. When Hossein Qoli Khan reached Damghan, he immediately began a fierce conflict with the Develu and other tribes to avenge his father's death. He was, however, killed ca. 1777 near Findarisk by some Turks from the Yamut tribe with whom he had clashed. On 1 March 1779, while Agha Mohammad Khan was hunting, he was informed by Khadija Begum that Karim Khan had died after six months of illness. Rise to power (1779‚Äì1789) Conquest of Mazandaran and Gilan Map of northern Iran. Agha Mohammad Khan took with him a group of loyal followers and left for Tehran. Meanwhile, in Shiraz, people were fighting among themselves. In Tehran, Agha Mohammad Khan met the main chieftains of the Develu clan, with whom he made peace. He visited the shrine of Shah Abd al-Azim, where his father's skull was kept. He then travelled to the Mazandaran Province, where his first task was to set up his suzerainty among his Qoyunlu brothers. This resulted in a clash with his brothers Reza Qoli and Morteza Qoli, whom he defeated on 2 April, conquering Mazandaran. Meanwhile, Morteza Qoli fled to Astarabad, where he fortified himself. Agha Mohammad Khan could not simply storm the city, since starting a war with Morteza Qoli would mean that his frail alliance with the Develu could fall apart‚ÄîMorteza Qoli's mother was a Develu. At the same time, the Zand prince Ali-Morad Khan Zand sent an army of Zand and Afghan troops under Azad Khan Afghan's son Mahmud Khan to Mazandaran, which Agha Mohammad Khan's brother Jafar Qoli Khan managed to repel. Agha Mohammad Khan, together with Hossein Qoli Khan's sons Fath-Ali Qoli and Hosayn Qoli, was now in a firm position in Babol, the capital of Mazandaran. Some time later, Reza Qoli invaded Babol with an army of men from Lahijan, where he captured Agha Mohammad Khan. When Morteza Qoli learned of this, he advanced on the place with an army of Turkmens and released Agha Mohammad Khan. The three brothers tried to settle their problems; Agha Mohammad Khan and Reza Qoli succeeded, while Morteza Qoli was discontented and fled to Ali-Morad Khan in Isfahan, and then to Sadeq Khan Zand in Shiraz. He died in Khorasan. His former supporters then went to Agha Mohammad Khan and began serving him. At that time, Agha Mohammad Khan had once again become involved in a conflict with his brother Reza Qoli, whom he defeated in several battles, and thereafter established peace with him once more: Morteza Qoli was allowed as the de facto ruler of Astarabad and several districts in Mazandaran. Peace did not last long. Ali- Morad Khan soon invaded Mazandaran, which led Agha Mohammad Khan to march from Babol with an army of Mazandaranis and Qajars and attack Ali-Morad Khan, whom he managed to repel from the province. Agha Mohammad Khan then seized Qumis, Semnan, Damghan, Shahrud and Bastam. Furthermore, he also made Hedayat-Allah Khan, the ruler of Gilan, his vassal. He thereafter granted land in Semnan to his brother Ali Qoli as a reward for his help in the conquest of the cities. First conflict with the Russians, dispute with Gilan, and the invasion of northern Persian Iraq In 1781, the Russian Empire, which was interested in building a trade route with Iran in order to be able to trade with regions deep into Asia, sent an emissary under Marko Ivanovich Voinovich to the coast of Gorgan, where he sought approval to build a trading-post at Ashraf. When Agha Mohammad Khan refused, Voinovich ignored his refusal and went on to establish an interim settlement on Ashurada island. With no ships, Agha Mohammad Khan was unable to retake the island. Instead, he tricked Voinovich and some of his men into meeting him at Astarabad, where they were held as captives until Voinovich agreed to order his men to leave Ashurada. A year later Agha Mohammad Khan invaded Gilan, because its ruler Hedayat-Allah had changed his allegiance to the Zand dynasty. Hedayat-Allah then sent two diplomats, Mirza Sadeq and Agha Sadeq Lahiji, to Agha Mohammad to make peace. As a precaution he went to Shirvan. The diplomats were unable to come to favorable terms with Agha Mohammad Khan, who raided Gilan's capital Rasht and seized its riches. Rejoicing in his victory, he sent his brother Jafar Qoli Khan to conquer the northern part of Persian Iraq. He defeated a Zand army in Ray (or Karaj), and thereafter seized Qazvin. He then marched to Zanjan, which he also seized. In 1783, Agha Mohammad Khan besieged Tehran, a town under Zand control which had proved troublesome. During the siege, plague started spreading in the town, and thereafter to Agha Mohammad Khan's army camp outside the city, which forced him to lift the siege. Mazandaran's brief submission to the Zand dynasty The next year Ali-Morad Khan, in retaliation for Agha Mohammad Khan's attack on Tehran the previous year, sent a massive army under his son Shaykh Vais Khan to Mazandaran, which made its people quickly surrender. Agha Mohammad Khan and a few of his supporters fled to Astarabad, where he tried to fortify the city as much as possible. Meanwhile, Morteza Qoli changed his allegiance and began serving the Zand dynasty. Ali- Morad Khan then sent an army under his relative Mohammad Zahir Khan to Astarabad, and laid siege to the city. Agha Mohammad Khan had already stocked provisions in case of a siege. Every day his troops would try to lay waste to the countryside to limit the besiegers' provisions. This in the end made the besiegers' situation unsustainable, and allowed Agha Mohammad Khan to leave the city to attack them. Mohammad Zahir Khan fled towards the Karakum Desert, but was captured by Agha Mohammad Khan's Yamut allies. Only a few of his men managed to survive. Meanwhile, Agha Mohammad Khan defeated a Zand garrison near Ashraf and afterward marched towards Sari. By the start of November 1784, Agha Mohammad had expelled the Zand forces from Mazandaran. First war with Jafar Khan Zand Portrait of Jafar Khan Zand Meanwhile, Ali-Morad Khan had raised another group of Zand troops, which he sent to Mazandaran under the command of his cousin Rustam Khan Zand, only to be defeated by Agha Mohammad Khan. Ali-Morad Khan died on 11 February 1785. When Agha Mohammad Khan heard of his death, he went to Tehran to try to capture it. When he reached the city, the inhabitants quickly closed the gates, and told him that they would open the gate only for the king of Iran, who according to them was Jafar Khan Zand, who had succeeded Ali-Morad Khan. Thus Agha Mohammad Khan had to defeat Jafar Khan to be recognized as the king of Iran. He thereafter quickly marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Khan sent men to stop his advance towards the city, but they withdrew at Qom without putting up any resistance. Jafar Khan then sent an even larger Zand army towards Agha Mohammad Khan, who defeated the army near Kashan.Jafar Khan then fled to Shiraz. Agha Mohammad arrived at Isfahan, where he discovered what was left of the Zand treasure and Jafar Khan's harem. The Qajar troops then looted the city. During the summer of 1785, Agha Mohammad Khan made the city his headquarters for his expeditions in Persian Iraq, in which he managed to bring the Bakhtiari chieftains under his suzerainty. He then left for Tehran, appointing a former Zand commander to govern. When he arrived at Tehran, the town finally submitted to him. At the same time, his men captured Hamadan and forced many Kurdish and Turkic chieftains to submit to Qajar rule. On 12 March 1786, Agha Mohammad Khan made Tehran his capital. By then the city had a population of 15,000‚Äì30,000 people. It appears that during this period, Agha Mohammad Khan saw himself as the king of Iran, although he avoided using the title \\"shah\\". Some time later, while Agha Mohammad Khan was in northern Iran, Jafar Khan quickly marched towards Isfahan and re-captured it. He then sent troops towards Kashan and Qom, while he marched towards Hamadan. He was, however, defeated by local tribal chieftains, among them Khosrow Khan and Mohammad Hosayn Khan Qaragozlu. Jafar Khan then withdrew to Isfahan. When Agha Mohammad Khan heard about the Zand invasion of Isfahan and its surroundings, he quickly moved towards the city, which made Jafar Khan retreat to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan then appointed Jafar Qoli Khan as the city's governor. However, the governor of Zanjan revolted shortly afterward, which forced Agha Mohammad Khan to go back north, where he suppressed the latter's revolt and pardoned him. Second invasion of Gilan Agha Mohammad Khan now had to focus on Gilan because Hedayat-Allah Khan had returned to the province (allegedly with Russian help) since the Qajar invasion of the province in 1782. In Agha Mohammad Khan's eyes, the whole Caspian coast was under threat by Hedayat-Allah and the Russians. Agha Mohammad Khan and his men easily managed to enter Gilan. While he was marching towards Rasht, he was joined by a local ruler named Mehdi Beg Khalatbari and other people. Furthermore, the Russian consul in Gilan betrayed Hedayat-Allah by providing weapons to Agha Mohammad Khan. Hedayat-Allah once again tried to flee to Shirvan, but was captured by men sent by a local ruler named Agha Ali Shafti (or another local ruler according to some sources), who killed him to avenge the slaughter of his family a few years earlier. Gilan was now completely under Qajar rule. Besides the conquest of Gilan, the second most valuable thing for Agha Mohammad Khan was Hedayat-Allah's treasure. Second war with Jafar Khan Zand and enthronement Painting of Agha Mohammad Khan with his men Some time later a local ruler named Amir Mohammad Khan, who with another local ruler named Taqi Khan (the ruler of Yazd), had recently defeated Jafar Khan and seized many riches, invaded Qajar territory, and marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Qoli Khan, who was still the governor of Isfahan, left the city before Taqi Khan could reach it and defeated the latter. Agha Mohammad Khan then went southwards once again. He met Jafar Qoli Khan at Isfahan in 1788, and after some time, made Taqi Khan accept Qajar suzerainty, and thereafter punished some Qashqai tribes, who fled into the mountains. Agha Mohammad Khan then approached Shiraz, where he hoped to bait Jafar Khan out of the city, which was strongly fortified, making it very hard to besiege. Unfortunately for him, Jafar Khan remained in the city. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Isfahan, where he appointed his brother Ali Qoli as its governor, succeeding Jafar Qoli Khan. He then left for Tehran. With Agha Mohammad Khan once again in the north, Jafar Khan began raising an army to prepare another attack against Isfahan and its surroundings. When Ali Qoli learned of it he sent a group of tribesmen to Qumishah, a city south of Isfahan. However, Jafar Khan easily defeated them. Ali Qoli thereafter retreated to Kashan. Agha Mohammad Khan, learning of this, marched rapidly towards Isfahan, which led Jafar Khan withdraw to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Tehran rather than attacking Shiraz again. Jafar Khan was murdered on 23 January 1789, which started a four-month civil war between several Zand princes who fought for succession to the throne. In May Jafar Khan's son Lotf Ali Khan emerged the victor in this civil war. It was also during this period that Agha Mohammad Khan was enthroned (however still not crowned) and named his nephew Baba Khan (who would later be known as Fath- Ali Shah Qajar) as his heir. Thus 1789 is marked as the start of his reign. Reign (1789‚Äì1797) War with Lotf Ali Khan, family disputes, and the first invasion of Azerbaijan =First attack on Shiraz and dispute with Jafar Qoli Khan Qajar= Now that the Zand dynasty was no longer under the rule of Jafar Khan Zand, Agha Mohammad Khan saw an opportunity to capture Shiraz once and for all. He marched towards the city, and as he neared it, was attacked by Lotf Ali Khan. A battle was fought on 25 June 1789, which ended in Lotf Ali Khan withdrawing to Shiraz while Agha Mohammad Khan followed him and besieged the city. The siege lasted until 7 September. He set up an encampment and returned to Tehran, where he stayed until the end of the ensuing Nowruz. On 17 May 1790, Agha Mohammad Khan once again marched towards Shiraz. When he reached Fars, the governor of Bihbahan acknowledged his authority. Lotf Ali Khan once again left Shiraz in order to stop Agha Mohammad Khan's advance, but the Qajar ruler withdrew to Qazvin and its surroundings, where he had to resolve some problems. Agha Mohammad Khan later quarreled with Jafar Qoli Khan, who saw himself as the best heir of the Qajar dynasty. Agha Mohammad had him executed, which he believed necessary having seen in the Zand family how quickly a dynasty could decline due to disputes over the throne. =Invasion of Azerbaijan= While Lotf Ali Khan was having problems with Kerman, Agha Mohammad Khan could thus freely focus on Azerbaijan. He appointed Baba Khan as the governor of Persian Iraq and marched into Azerbaijan in the spring of 1791. He stopped at Tarum, and sent his relative Suleiman Khan Qoyunlu to make the Talysh Khanate acknowledge Qajar authority. Agha Mohammad Khan thereafter went to Sarab, where he forced the Sarab Khanate into submission. He then went to Ardabil, where he subdued the Ardabil Khanate and visited the city's shrine. He finally went to Qarajadagh, where he brought an end to all resistance against him. He appointed the Donboli noble Hosayn Qoli Donboli as the governor of Khoy and Tabriz. Conquest of Fars Painting of Agha Mohammad Khan (right) and his grand vizier Hajji Ebrahim Shirazi (left) While Agha Mohammad Khan was conquering Azerbaijan, Lotf Ali Khan used the opportunity to attack Isfahan. However Hajji Ebrahim Shirazi, the popular governor of Shiraz, used Lotf Ali Khan's absence from the city to stage a coup, while his brother Mohammad-Hosayn Shirazi, who was the Zand ruler's general, mutinied along with many other troops. Lotf Ali Khan rushed to Shiraz, but when he arrived at the city, its inhabitants refused to open the gates. He went into the mountains and raised an army large enough to capture Shiraz. Hajji Ebrahim then sent an emissary to Agha Mohammad Khan, asking him to become the ruler of Fars, offering to give him 3,000 mares if he accepted; he immediately did. When Agha Mohammad Khan arrived at Fars, he appointed Hajji Ebrahim as the governor of the whole province, and sent one of his men to take Lotf Ali Khan's family to Tehran, and take the possessions of the Zand family. Furthermore, he also ordered Baba Khan to establish a garrison in nearby Shiraz to be prepared to help Hajji Ebrahim if needed. Battle between Agha Mohammad Khan and Lotf Ali Khan. In the meantime, Lotf Ali Khan had defeated the men sent by Hajji Ebrahim and had captured the stronghold of Kazerun. He then marched to the countryside outside Shiraz and prepared to starve the city. Some time later, the Qajar army from the nearby garrison attacked Lotf Ali Khan's men and were winning‚Äîuntil Lotf Ali Khan himself decided to participate in the battle, and the Qajar army was defeated. When Agha Mohammad Khan learned of this, he sent 7,000 horsemen to reinforce Hajji Ebrahim's forces, and also ordered the surviving Qajar forces from the nearby garrison to do the same. Lotf Ali Khan let the reinforcements arrive to Shiraz, expecting that as soon as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim were strengthened, they would come out of Shiraz, and could be overwhelmed in open battle. He was correct in his prediction‚Äîa battle shortly took place to the west of Shiraz, where Lotf Ali Khan defeated the united forces of Hajji Ebrahim and his Qajar reinforcements. This took place in late 1791, or early 1792. Agha Mohammad Khan's capture and sack of Kerman The inhabitants of Shiraz now faced extreme hardship from the siege, and it was questionable if they would endure. Large parts of Fars were ravaged by warfare, and for three to four years a pandemic had spread around the landscape. Albeit Lotf Ali Khan's forces had gone through as much difficulty as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim whose forces had begun to desert to the Zands. Agha Mohammad Khan thus raised a large army and marched into Fars. On 5 June 1792, Lotf Ali Khan, with a small force of his men, made a bold night raid on Agha Mohammad Khan's encampment near Persepolis. At first, this choice seemed to be in Lotf Ali Khan's favor‚Äîhe was certain that the Qajars were routed. In his delight at this, he let his men spread out and rest for the night, only to discover at daybreak that Agha Mohammad Khan still held his ground. Lotf Ali Khan then fled to Tabas through Neyriz. Agha Mohammad Khan set foot in Shiraz on 21 July 1792, and stayed there for a month, maintaining his retinue in the Bagh-e Vakil. Before leaving Shiraz, he appointed Hajji Ebrahim as the governor of Fars, and had the body of Karim Khan Zand exhumed and reburied in Tehran, where he went after his stay in Shiraz. Two years later, after the Battle of Krtsanisi brought eastern Georgia and the other principal territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus back within the Iranian domains, he proclaimed himself Shahanshah (King of Kings) on the Mughan plain, just as Nader Shah had done some sixty years earlier.Michael Axworthy. ( 2008)Iran: Empire of the Mind: A History from Zoroaster to the Present Day Penguin UK, Final conquest of Azerbaijan Reconquest of Georgia and the rest of the Caucasus The country of Georgia had been under Iranian vassalage for the first time in the early modern era in 1502, and under intermittent Iranian rule and suzerainty since 1555, but had been de facto independent after the disintegration of the Iranian Afsharid Dynasty. For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. Like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, he viewed the territories no differently than those in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever was necessary in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands. This included putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the wali of Georgia. Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Iran secure, the Iranians demanded the Georgian monarch Heraclius II renounce his treaty with Russia and re-accept Iranian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized Iran's rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius II appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was not listened to, leaving Georgia to fend off the Iranian threat alone.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, p. 38. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 59. Indiana University Press, In August 1795, Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with a 70,000-strong army.Donald Rayfield (2013).Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia Reaktion Books, p. 255 This force was divided in three: the left wing was sent in the direction of Erivan, the right one parallel to the Caspian Sea into the Mughan across the lower Aras towards Dagestan and Shirvan, while the Shah headed the centre force himself, advancing towards the fortress of Shusha in the Karabakh Khanate, which he besieged between 8 July and 9 August 1795. His right and left wing forced the Khans of Ganja and Erivan into an alliance.Tapper, Richard (1997), Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan, p. 122. Cambridge University Press, . Having abandoned the siege of Shusha due to stiff resistance, which was further aided by Georgian crown prince Aleksandre, the Khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khan, eventually surrendered to Agha Mohammad Khan after discussions. He paid a regular tribute and surrendered hostages, though the Qajar forces were still denied entrance to Shusha. Since the main objective was Georgia, Agha Mohammad Khan was willing to have Karabakh secured by this agreement for now, for he and his army subsequently moved further. While at Ganja, having secured Shirvan, he was joined by Javad Khan Qajar and the rest of his right wing contingent. At Ganja, Mohammad Khan sent Heraclius II his last ultimatum, which he received in September 1795: According to the author of the FƒÅrsnƒÅma-ye NƒÅ·π£eri, ·∏§asan-e FasƒÅ ºi, a contemporary Qajar era historian, Agha Mohammad Khan had declared in the letter: His advisors divided, Heraclius II ignored the ultimatum but sent couriers to St.Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Heraclius II to avoid \\"expense and fuss\\", while Heraclius II, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians.

At the same time, Agha Mohammad Khan marched directly on Tbilisi, with half of the army he crossed the Aras river. Some estimate his army had 40,000 men instead of 35,000.Kalistrat Salia. History of the Georgian nation N. Salia, 1983. University of Wisconsin - Madison p. 351 They attacked the heavily fortified Georgian positions of Heraclius II and Solomon on the southwestern limits of the city. Abandoned by several of his nobles, Heraclius II managed to mobilize around 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 auxiliaries from the neighbouring Imereti under its King Solomon II, a member of the Georgian Bagrationi Dynasty and thus distantly related to Heraclius II. The Georgians offered a desperate resistance and succeeded in rolling back a series of Iranian attacks on 9 and 10 September. After that, it is said that some traitors informed the Iranians that the Georgians had no more strength to fight and the Qajar army cancelled their plan of returning to Iran. Early on 11 September, Agha Mohammad Khan personally led an all-out offensive against the Georgians. Amid an artillery duel and a fierce cavalry charge, the Iranians managed to cross the Kura River and outflanked the decimated Georgian army. Heraclius II attempted to mount a counterattack, but he had to retreat to the last available positions in the outskirts of Tbilisi. By nightfall, the Georgian forces had been exhausted and almost completely destroyed. The last surviving Georgian artillery briefly held the advancing Iranians to allow Heraclius II and his retinue of some 150 men to escape through the city to the mountains. The fighting continued in the streets of Tbilisi and at the fortress of Narikala. In a few hours, Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital which was completely sacked and its population massacred. The Iranian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off some 15,000 captives.Malcolm, Sir John (1829), The History of Persia from the Most Early Period to the Present Time, pp. 189‚Äì191. London: John Murray. The Georgians had lost 4,000 men in the battle, the Iranians 13,000; a third of their total force. An eye-witness, having entered the city several days the bulk of the Iranian troops had withdrawn, described what he saw: Coronation Conquest of Khorasan Agha Mohammad Shah now focused on Khorasan, which was under the rule of Nader Shah's blind and old grandson Shahrokh Shah. He had earlier been a vassal of the Durrani ruler, Ahmad Shah, but after the latter's death in 1773 had become a pawn of the chieftains who had taken control of the surrounding cities and towns of the Afsharid capital of Mashhad. The most prominent of these chieftains was most likely Eshaq Khan, who preserved Torbat-e Heydarieh as his center of operations. In the eastern parts of the Alborz, Kurdish chieftains ruled over several fortresses, such as Bojnord, Quchan, Dargaz, and Kalat. The Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad. Agha Mohammad Shah first marched to Astarabad, and penalized the Turkmens who had been pillaging the city and its surroundings. He then continued to Mashhad, where the local chieftains, who knew of it was hopeless to resist, swiftly acknowledged his rule. Agha Mohammad Shah also demanded these local chieftains dispatch him hostages, who were sent to Tehran. When Agha Mohammad Shah reached Mashhad, Shahrokh, along with a prominent mujtahid named Mirza Mehdi, went to the Qajar encampment. There they were warmly received by Agha Mohammad Shah's nephew Hossein Qoli Khan. Shortly afterwards, Agha Mohammad Shah sent a force of 8,000 soldiers under Suleiman Khan Qajar, followed by Mirza Mehdi, to conquer Mashhad and affirm its citizens of the Shah's generosity. A day later, Agha Mohammad Shah, followed the customary of the famous Iranian shah Abbas I the Great, and entered Mashhad by foot as a pilgrim to the Imam Reza shrine, whilst being teary eyed and kissing the ground. His pilgrimage continued for 23 days, where he seemed to be unaware of the politics of the country. =The torture of Shahrokh Shah= However, things quickly changed. Agha Mohammad Shah ordered the exhumation of Nader Shah's corpse, and had it sent to Tehran, where it was reburied alongside Karim Khan Zand's corpse. He then forced Shahrokh to give him any riches that originally belonged to Nader Shah. Shahrokh swore that he did not possess any more of Nader Shah's riches. Agha Mohammad Shah, ruthless and revengeful, and with a desire for treasure, did not believe him. He had Shahrokh Shah hurt severely to confess the hidden locations of the last gems that had passed down to him from his grandfather. Shahrokh, however, refused to speak. Agha Mohammad Shah was personally involved in the torture and on one occasion he had Shahrokh tied to a chair, his head shaved and a crown of thick paste built on his head. He then poured a jug of molten lead into the crown. A number of Shahrokh's servants, who were struck with misery for their previous monarch, sent an admired mullah of the city to make an emotional appeal to Agha Mohammad Shah in support of Shahrokh and Shahrokh was sent to Mazandaran with his family. Shahrokh died at Damghan due to the injuries he had suffered during his torture. Rest of reign Agha Mohammad Khan restored Iran to a unity it had not had since Karim Khan. He reunited the territory of contemporary Iran and the Caucasus region which had been part of the concept of Iran for three centuries. He was, however, a man of extreme violence who killed almost all who could threaten his hold on power, a trait he showed in several of his campaigns. A year after Agha Mohammad Khan re-subjugated the Caucasus, he also captured Khorasan. Shah Rukh, ruler of Khorasan and grandson of Nader Shah, was tortured to death because Agha Mohammad Khan thought that he knew of Nadir's legendary treasures. In 1778, Agha Mohammad Khan moved his capital from Sari in his home province of Mazandaran to Tehran. He was the first Iranian ruler to make Tehran‚Äîthe successor to the great city of Ray‚Äîhis capital, although both the Safavids and the Zands had expanded the town and built palaces there. One of the main reasons noted for moving the capital farther south was to remain in close reach of Azarbaijan and Iran's integral Caucasian territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, at that time not yet ceded to Imperial Russia, their fate in the course of the 19th century. He was formally crowned in 1796 and founded the Qajar dynasty. Although the Russians briefly took and occupied Derbent and Baku during the expedition of 1796 under the command of count Valerian Zubov, Agha Mohammad Khan successfully expanded Iranian influence into the Caucasus, reasserting Iranian sovereignty over its former dependencies in the region. He was, however, a notoriously cruel ruler, who reduced Tbilisi to ashes, while massacring and carrying away its Christian population, much as he had done with his Muslim subjects. He based his strength on tribal manpower like Genghis Khan, Timur and Nader Shah. Assassination Agha Mohammad's successful reign was short-lived, as he was assassinated in 1797 in his tent in the city of Shusha, the capital of the Karabakh khanate, three days after he had taken the city, and less than three years after he had taken power. According to Hasan-e Fasa'i's' Farsnama-ye Naseri, during Agha Mohammad's stay in Shusha, one night \\"a quarrel arose between a Georgian servant named Sadegh Gorji and the valet Khodadad-e Esfahani. They raised their voices to such a pitch that the shah became angry and ordered both to be executed. Sadeq Khan-e Shaghaghi, a prominent emir, interceded on their behalf, but was not listened to. The shah, however, ordered their execution to be postponed until Saturday, as this happened to be the evening of Friday (the Islamic holy day), and ordered them back to their duties in the royal pavilion, unfettered and unchained, awaiting their execution the next day. From experience, however, they knew that the King would keep to what he had ordered, and, having no hope, they turned to boldness. When the shah was sleeping, they were joined by the valet Abbas-e Mazandarani, who was in the plot with them, and the three invaded the royal pavilion and with dagger and knife murdered the shah.\\" His nephew, crowned as Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, succeeded him. Government The bureaucracy The bureaucracy remained small during the reign of Agha Mohammad Shah‚Äîapart from the grand vizier, the leading figures of the administration were the chief revenue officer (mustaufƒ´) and the muster-master (lashkarnevƒ´s) of the army. Only one person occupied each post during Agha Mohammad Shah's reign; Hajji Ibrahim, who served as grand vizier; Mirza Ismail, who served as the chief revenue officer, and Mirza Asad-Allah Nuri, who served as muster-master. Since Agha Mohammad Shah was primarily busy with his military expeditions, his court was constantly his camp, and Hajji Ebrahim, along with other officials, usually participated in his campaigns. Provincial administration Flag of Iran during the reign of Agha Mohammad Shah. During Agha Mohammad Shah's reign, provincial administration followed the same model of the Safavid one; beglerbegis were appointed to govern provinces. A city was under the rule of a kalantar and darugha, while its quarters was under the rule of the kadkhuda. Governorship of provinces went for the most part to tribal chieftains‚Äîthis was later changed by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, who appointed many of his relatives as governors. Military Agha Mohammad Shah was more of a military leader than politician, and was known for his determined sovereignty, instead of a charismatic one. His military prowess was highly noticeable‚ÄîMalcolm's evaluation, which was written some years after his death, says the following: \\"His army was inured to fatigue, and regularly paid; he had introduced excellent arrangement into all its Departments, and his known severity occasioned the utmost alacrity and promptness in the execution of orders, and had he lived a few more years, it is difficult to conjecture the progress of his arms.\\" The Scottish traveller James Baillie Fraser also says the following thing about him: \\"Agha Mohammad had likewise the talent of forming good and brave troops. His active and ambitious disposition kept his army constantly engaged; and they acquired a veteran hardihood and expertness, that rendered them superior to any other Asiatic troops.\\" Construction Agha Mohammad Shah did not construct or repair much during his reign, due to the campaigns and battles which occupied his time. In Tehran, he ordered the creation of a mosque named the Masjid-e Shah (meaning \\"the Shah's mosque\\"), while in Mashhad he ordered the reparation of the Imam Reza shrine. In Astarabad, he repaired (or fortified) the walls, emptied the ditch, built several buildings, one of them being a palace for the governor. Furthermore, he also improved the overall condition of the city. He did something similar in Babol, Ashraf and Sari. Of all these constructions and reparations, his best and most lasting achievement is debatably making Tehran his capital, which to this day is the country's capital and largest city.

It is native to Europe, northwest Africa and West Asia but has been introduced in many other parts of the world.  Names  Other common names include may, mayblossom, maythorn, quickthorn, whitethorn, motherdie, and haw. This species is one of several that have been referred to as Crataegus oxyacantha, a name that has been rejected by the botanical community as too ambiguous. In 1793, Medikus published the name C. apiifolia for a European hawthorn now included in C. monogyna, but that name is illegitimate under the rules of botanical nomenclature.International Plant Names Index Description The common hawthorn is a shrub or small tree 5‚Äì14 metres (15 to 45 feet) tall, with a dense crown. The bark is dull brown with vertical orange cracks. The younger stems bear sharp thorns, approximately 12.5 mm (half an inch) long. The leaves are 20 to 40 mm (1 to 1¬Ω inches) long, obovate and deeply lobed, sometimes almost to the midrib, with the lobes spreading at a wide angle. The upper surface is dark green above and paler underneath. The hermaphrodite flowers are produced in late spring (May to early June in its native area) in corymbs of 5‚Äì25 together; each flower is about 10 mm diameter, and has five white petals, numerous red stamens, and a single style; they are moderately fragrant. The flowers are pollinated by midges, bees and other insects and later in the year bear numerous haws. The haw is a small, oval dark red fruit about 10 mm long, berry-like, but structurally a pome containing a single seed. Haws are important for wildlife in winter, particularly thrushes and waxwings; these birds eat the haws and disperse the seeds in their droppings. The common hawthorn is distinguished from the related but less widespread Midland hawthorn (C. laevigata) by its more upright growth, the leaves being deeply lobed, with spreading lobes, and in the flowers having just one style, not two or three. However they are inter-fertile and hybrids occur frequently; they are only entirely distinct in their more typical forms.

The plant parts used are usually sprigs with both leaves and flowers, or alternatively the fruit (\\"berries\\"). Hawthorn has been investigated by evidence-based medicine for treating cardiac insufficiency. Crataegus monogyna is a source of antioxidant phytochemicals, especially extracts of hawthorn leaves with flowers. In gardening and agriculture Common hawthorn is extensively planted as a hedge plant, especially for agricultural use. Its spines and close branching habit render it effectively stock- and human-proof, with some basic maintenance. The traditional practice of hedge laying is most commonly practised with this species. It is a good fire wood which burns with a good heat and little smoke. Numerous hybrids exist, some of which are used as garden shrubs. The most widely used hybrid is C. √ó media (C. monogyna √ó C. laevigata), of which several cultivars are known, including the very popular 'Paul's Scarlet' with dark pink double flowers. Other garden shrubs that have sometimes been suggested as possible hybrids involving the common hawthorn, include the various-leaved hawthorn of the Caucasus, which is only very occasionally found in parks and gardens. Edible \\"berries\\", petals, and leaves The fruit of hawthorn, called haws, are edible raw but are commonly made into jellies, jams, and syrups, used to make wine, or to add flavour to brandy. Botanically they are pomes, but they look similar to berries. A haw is small and oblong, similar in size and shape to a small olive or grape, and red when ripe. Haws develop in groups of two or three along smaller branches. They are pulpy and delicate in taste. In this species (C. monogyna) they have only one seed, but in other species of hawthorn there may be up to five seeds. Petals are also edible, as are the leaves, which if picked in spring when still young are tender enough to be used in salads.Richard Mabey, Food for Free, Collins, October 2001. Hawthorn petals are used in the medieval English recipe for spinee, an almond-milk based pottage p. 70 recorded in 'The Forme of Cury' by the Chief Master-Cook of King Richard II, c. 1390. Notable trees An ancient specimen, and reputedly the oldest tree of any species in France, is to be found alongside the church at Saint Mars sur la Futaie, Mayenne. The tree has a height of 9 m (30 feet), and a girth of 265 cm (8'8\\") (2009). The inscription on the plaque beneath reads: \\"This hawthorn is probably the oldest tree in France. Its origin goes back to St Julien (3rd century)\\", but such claims are impossible to verify. A famous specimen in England was the Glastonbury or Holy Thorn which, according to legend, sprouted from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea after he thrust it into the ground while visiting Glastonbury in the 1st century AD. The tree was noteworthy because it flowered twice in a year, once in the late spring which is normal, but also once after the harshness of midwinter had passed. The original tree at Glastonbury Abbey, felled in the 1640s during the English Civil War, has been propagated as the cultivar 'Biflora'.Phipps, J.B.; O‚ÄôKennon, R.J.; Lance, R.W. 2003. Hawthorns and medlars. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K. A replacement was planted by the local council in 1951, but was cut down by vandals in 2010. The oldest known living specimen in East Anglia, and possibly in the United Kingdom, is known as The Hethel Old Thorn, and is located in the churchyard in the small village of Hethel, south of Norwich, in Norfolk. It is reputed to be more than 700 years old, having been planted in the 13th century. In culture The hawthorn is associated with Faerie in Ireland, and as such is not disturbed by those who believe in the danger fairies traditionally represent.

Early career Born in Scotland two years before the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain, in which his father Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun was a significant figure, Campbell inherited his father's estates and peerages in 1731, becoming Lord Loudoun. He raised a regiment of infantry that took part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 on the side of the Hanoverian government. The regiment consisted of twelve companies, with Loudoun as colonel and John Campbell (later 5th Duke of Argyll) as lieutenant-colonel. The regiment served in several different parts of Scotland; three of the twelve companies, raised in the south, were captured at Prestonpans. Eight companies, under the personal command of Lord Loudoun, were stationed in Inverness. Loudoun set out in February 1746 with this portion of his regiment and several of the Independent Companies in an attempt to capture the Jacobite pretender, Charles Edward Stuart. The expedition was met by a ruse de guerre (by only four Jacobites) which suggested a large force protected Stuart, and they returned without engagement. This was later publicised as the Rout of Moy. After this, Loudoun fell back to join the Duke of Cumberland's army, giving up the town of Inverness to the rebels. Following the battle at Culloden, Loudoun led his mixed force of regulars, militia and highlanders in \\"mopping up\\" operations against the remaining rebels Seven Years War North America In 1756, Loudoun was sent to North America as Commander-in-Chief and Governor General of Virginia, where he was unpopular with many of the colonial leaders. When he learned that some merchants were still trading with the French, while he was trying to fight a war against them, he temporarily closed all American ports. Despite his unpopularity the county of Loudoun, formed from Fairfax in 1757, was named in his honour. As Commander-in-Chief during the Seven Years' War (called the French and Indian War in the Thirteen Colonies), he planned an expedition to seize Louisbourg from the French in 1757 but called it off when intelligence (possibly including a French military deception) indicated that the French forces there were too strong for him to defeat. While Loudoun was thus engaged in Canada, French forces captured Fort William Henry from the British, and Loudoun was replaced by James Abercrombie and returned to London. Francis Parkman, a 19th- century historian of the Seven Years' War, rates his martial conduct of the affair poorly. Many historians debate whether he played a fundamental part in the Seven Years' War. Arguably, he was an influential figure as he embarked on reforms for the army such as replacing the ordinary musket with the flintlock musket for greater accuracy. He made improvements by embarking on a road improvement programme, recognising the need to supply the army as he replaced the traditional supply line with army wagons. His focus was centralising the system of supplies and had built storehouses in Halifax and Albany, whilst recognising the importance of waterways as a means of transport. Most notably, he integrated regular troops with local militias-and the irregulars were to fight a different kind of war, than the linear, European style of warfare in which the British had previously been trained. Benjamin Franklin's anecdotes of Lord Loudon Benjamin Franklin provides several first-hand anecdotes of Loudon's North American days in his Autobiography, none complimentary.Franklin, Benjamin (first published 1791). The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Chapter XIX. Online version: The following are excerpts: :(Loudon) set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His answer was, \\"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer.\\" By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail'd. There were then two of the packet-boats, which had been long in port, but were detained for the general's letters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers were engaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly. :Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. \\"So, you are soon return'd, Innis?\\" \\"Return'd! no, I am not gone yet.\\" \\"How so?\\" \\"I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.\\" \\"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire.\\" \\"Yes,\\" says Innis, \\"but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on.\\"... :This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. At length the fleet sail'd, the general and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general's ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with all his troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation.... :On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. Portugal In 1762, he was sent to Portugal to counter the Spanish invasion of Portugal as second-in-command, and he became overall commander in 1763. Despite being unable to prevent the loss of Almeida, the British forces soon launched a counter-attack that drove the invaders back across the border.

Loudoun's interest in horticulture led to his estate being renown for its landscaping. He collected willow species in particular from around the globe. On 23 January 1773, the town of Loudon, New Hampshire was incorporated and named in Campbell's honor. Loudonville, New York was also named after him as well as the then unincorporated town of Loudon, Massachusetts which was renamed to Otis upon incorporation. Campbell remained a bachelor, and on his death in 1782 was succeeded as earl by his cousin, James Mure-Campbell.

The R800 was designed by ASCII Corporation of Japan and built by Mitsui & Co., Ltd.. The goal was a modern and pipelined (i.e. efficient) CPU binary compatible with the Z80, and therefore with MSX software, while also maintaining compatibility with older MSX Z80-based hardware. Compatibility During the development of the MSX Turbo R, ASCII Corporation considered various processors, both compatible and incompatible with the Z80, as candidates. At that time, Kazuya Kishioka , a company employee, was researching and developing an ASIC that was a high-speed version of the Z80 and largely customized for the MSX architecture. For software compatibility with older MSX software, the R800 uses the same instruction set as the Z80, with only minor but useful additions, such as 8x8-bit and 16x16-bit multiplication instructions called MULUB (8-bit), and MULUW (16-bit). Also, many of the undocumented Z80 instructions were made official, including all the opcodes for instructions dealing with IX and IY as 8-bit registers (IXH, IXL, IYH, IYL). As the R800 is not based directly on the Z80, but stems from the Z800 family, it lacks some of the other undocumented Z80 features. For instance, the undocumented flags represented in bits 3 and 5 of the F register don't assume the same values as in Z80 (causing it to fail ZEXALL tests) and the undocumented opcode often called SLL is just an alias of the SLA instruction. Hardware changes Being a much newer design, the R800 implementation was of course quite different from the old Z80. The changes were similar to the Z800, Z280, Z380 and eZ80 lines of Z80 compatible processors. The original Z80 uses an unusual 4-bit ALU hardware internally,http://www.righto.com/2013/09/the-z-80-has-4-bit-alu-heres-how- it.html a solution actually able to compete with similar CPUs using full hardwired 8-bit ALU logic (such as its immediate precursor, the Intel 8080The 8080 was designed by the same designers (Faggin and Shima, then at Intel) and used a plain 8-bit ALU. The later 4-bit ALU implementation in the Z80 was intended to make the Z80 sufficiently different from the 8080 design, thereby avoiding a lawsuit from Intel. The performance did not suffer much: 16-bit instructions took 11 cycles, compared to 10 on the 8080. 8-bit instructions actually became faster: 4 cycles, compared to 5 on the 8080. (Together with a rough doubling in clock frequency, that gave the Z80 a significant edge over the 8080.)). However, the R800 designers implemented a full 16-bit ALU in order to keep up with its more pipelined execution. Instructions like ADD HL,BC that takes 11 clock cycles on the Z80 can in some situations execute in as little as one bus cycle (1-2 clocks) on the R800, due to the degree of pipelining made possible by this full width ALU. The maximum CPU clock speed used on this new MSX was 14.32 MHz--four times as fast as the original 3.57 MHz speed used in the older MSX, while the bus clock was increased to 7.16 MHz. The data bus remained 8-bit to maintain compatibility with old hardware. Fetching opcodes Additional changes were made in the way the CPU fetches opcodes. The original Z80 uses two cycles to fetch a simple instruction like OR A, plus two cycles for refresh. An additional waitstate is issued on the MSX architecture. A review of the fetch mechanism in a typical MSX environment helps in explaining the R800: *Z80, cycle 1: set the higher 8-bits of address *Z80, cycle 2: set the lower 8-bits of address *Z80, cycle 3: waitstate *Z80, cycle 4: refresh, part 1 *Z80, cycle 5: refresh, part 2 Since most implementations of MSX use RAM memory disposed in a 256√ó256 bytes block, two cycles are required to set the address for the fetch. The R800 avoids this by remembering the last known state of the higher 8-bits. If the next instruction is in the same 256-byte boundaries, the higher 8-bits are not set, and a cycle is saved. However, on the Z80, the refresh cycles destroy the information on the higher bits, so a workaround was needed.https://www.msx.org/wiki/R800 The solution used in the R800 was to refresh entire blocks of RAM, instead of refreshing one line of RAM on each instruction issued. Each 30Œºs, the CPU is halted for 4Œºs, this time is used to refresh a block of the RAM. Since there's no refresh in between fetch instructions, and the waitstate is removed due to faster RAM chips, simple instructions can be issued using only one cycle. This cycle would be cycle 2 in the Z80 example above; cycle 1 becomes optional, and it's only issued when the program crosses a 256-byte boundary. External hardware All this only applies to the fast RAM used on the MSX turboR. External hardware, connected through cartridge slots, uses timings similar to Z80. Not even the internal ROM of turboR is fast enough for this fetch scheme, so additional chips on the turboR can mirror the contents of ROM into RAM, in order to make it run faster.

Released in November 2003, it has a number of integrated features and it is possible to check the calendar while talking on the phone, dial directly from contacts list, take pictures or send emails. It includes a five-way navigation button and favorites screen allowing quick access to the phone functions. On October 24, 2004, palmOne officially unveiled the Treo 600's successor, the Treo 650. Design The Treo 600 is a rather large device by cell phone standards but compact for a PDA. The 600 is slightly wider and deeper than its predecessor and is nearly half an inch slimmer, giving it a more cell-phone like feel. The new form factor has been compared to a bar of soap. The design is definitely an example of form-follows-function, the front of the phone consists of a full QWERTY keyboard at the bottom with menu and home buttons at the bottom right. Above the keyboard are the 4 application buttons with a \\"five-way\\" navigator in-between. Each application button can be mapped to two applications, with the exception of the last button which has one of its functions permanently mapped to the on/off. Above the buttons and navigator is a small Treo logo and the large 160x160 color touch screen. The top of the phone is occupied by the earpiece, antenna, SDIO/MMC slot; in front of the slot is the Infrared port with the power button which can be used to turn off the screen, or, if held down for a few seconds can turn off the radio functions. Opposite of the IR port is a switch which, by default is set to switch between normal ringer operation and silent mode with vibration. The back of the Treo is simple enough with a Palm logo at the bottom with a reset pin hole offset to the right. On the back of the phone towards the top is a sticker with various serial numbers and a triangular shaped speaker grill offset to the left. Above the speaker grill is the VGA camera lens and the top of the stylus is visible above and to the left of the lens. The bottom of the Treo houses the 2.5mm jack which can output stereo sound and accept an adapter for standard 3.5mm jack. Next to the audio jack, in the center of the phone, resides a connector used for data transfer and charging. The upper left side of the phone contains 2 volume keys; the right side is a mirror image of the left without the volume keys.

Anne de Detroit History and is the second-oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish in the United States. The current Gothic Revival cathedral-styled church, built in 1886, is located at 1000 Ste. Anne Street in Detroit, Michigan, in the Richard-Hubbard neighborhood, near the Ambassador Bridge, and the Michigan Central Station. At one time it was the seat of a diocese that included French (and later British) territory in Ontario, Canada south of the Detroit River. Historically, the parish congregation has occupied eight different buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The main entry to the Church faces a grand tree-lined, brick paved plaza. Reflecting demographic changes in the city and region since the 1930s, the present parish is largely Latino in population. On March 1, 2020, Pope Francis elevated the church to a minor basilica, the 86th such designation in the United States and the third in Michigan. History Ste. Anne's church was the first building constructed in Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit. The vicinity developed as the city of Detroit. Cadillac and a party of French colonists arrived at the bank of the Detroit River on July 24, 1701. They began construction of a church on July 26, 1701, the feast day of Saint Anne (sainte Anne). The parish was founded and named by the settlers in honor of the patron of France, Saint Anne, mother of Mary and grandmother of Jesus. Nicholas Constantine del Halle, a Franciscan, and Fran√ßois Vaillant, a Jesuit, were the two priests who accompanied the group. Vaillant returned east to Quebec in the fall. Local Native Americans set the church on fire in 1703; this destroyed part of the fort including the church, the rectory, and the baptismal records. A new church building was built in 1704. The oldest surviving church records date to this time, with the first record on February 2, 1704, being the baptism of a child born to Cadillac. Father del Halle was kidnapped by local Native Americans, likely the historic Ojibwe of the area. After his release, as he walked back to the fort, he was shot and killed by an Indian. His remains were buried under the altar of Ste. Anne's; they have been moved four times since to the succeeding new church buildings. Father Ch√©rubin Deniau was assigned to the parish and began work on a larger church in 1708. This church was outside the fort's palisade. It was burned in 1714 by settlers during a Fox attack, as they feared it would offer cover to the attackers. The parish did not have a church building for many years after this. One may have been built by Father Bonaventure Li√©nard, who was priest here for more than three decades, between 1722-1754. Father Simple Bocquet is known to have begun construction of a new church building in 1755, within a year after he arrived. Bocquet served here for nearly 30 years; in 1763 Detroit was part of the French territory east of the Mississippi River ceded to British rule after the latter's victory in the Seven Years' War. After the American Revolutionary War and establishment of independence, the territory came under United States rule in the early 1800s. An Anglican wedding was recorded in the parish records during this period. Father Gabriel Richard was called to Ste. Anne's in 1796. He helped start the school that eventually developed as the University of Michigan, started primary schools for white boys and girls as well as for Indians, and was elected as a territorial representative to the U.S. Congress. He helped initiate a road-building project that connected Detroit and Chicago. He also brought the first printing press to Detroit and started The Observer, the Michigan Territory's first newspaper. After his death in 1832, Father Richard was interred under the altar of Ste. Anne's. In 1805, most of Detroit, including the church, was destroyed in an accidental fire. A new church building was not begun until 1818, and it was not completed until 1828. This church was built at a new location outside the grounds of the old fort but still near the Detroit River, which travelers and traders used. In 1833, Ste. Anne's was designated as the cathedral for the new Roman Catholic diocese of Detroit; it served in this role until 1848. That year coadjutor bishop Peter Paul Lefevre moved the bishop's throne to St. Peter's Cathedral, today's Saints Peter and Paul Church. Around that time, the old St-Anne's parish registers were stolen. Because of this priceless loss, parish registers are no longer allowed to be freely and easily accessed by the public. Because the registers contain precious information about the founders and history of Detroit and Michigan, researchers have worked to make copies available through digital reproduction in the public domain. In 1817, many of the remains in the old cemetery were moved to the churchyard of the new Ste. Anne's. In the 1860s, many were moved again to Mount Elliott Cemetery, including the remains of Colonel Jean Fran√ßois Hamtramck. In the 1860s, the 1818 church building was demolished. Furnishings and even the cornerstone were split between the new Ste. Anne's and the new parish of St. Joachim, named after Ste. Anne's husband. Architecture The church nave Although the church design has often been attributed to Leon Cocquard, parish records, Detroit building permit number 23, and the final report for the Ste. Anne historic district list Albert E. French as the architect of Ste. Anne de D√©troit Catholic Church (1886-1887). French designed the church in the Gothic Revival style with flying buttresses, expressing the French history of the parish and territory. The Church faces a landscaped grand brick plaza, and the main entrance on the north facade includes four gargoyles. Ste. Anne's displays the oldest stained glass in the city of Detroit. Ste. Anne's is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1818 church altar and Father Richard's remains are installed in a side chapel of the present Church. Other elements from the 1818 church include the communion rail, a statue of Ste. Anne, and the church bell. Both Ste. Anne and St. Joachim parishes continued French traditions. By the 1920s, increased immigration from the 19th century and other demographic changes resulted in Ste. Anne's having a predominately ethnic Irish-American congregation. Since the late 1930s, its population has become primarily Hispanic. At that time, most Hispanic parishioners were immigrants from Mexico and Puerto Rico. The first sermon in Spanish was given in 1940; the last sermon in French in 1942. A Spanish-speaking priest was assigned in 1946. The parish remains largely Hispanic, more recently bolstered by immigration from Central and South American nations.

Brown represented Virginia in the Continental Congress (1777‚Äì1778) and the U.S. Congress (1789‚Äì1791). While in Congress, he introduced the bill granting Statehood to Kentucky. Once that was accomplished, he was elected by the new state legislature as a U.S. Senator for Kentucky. Early life John Brown was born in Augusta County, Virginia, on September 12, 1757. He was a son of Reverend John Brown and Margaret Preston Brown, immigrants from northern Ireland. The son of a Presbyterian minister and schoolmaster, John was well educated, first at his father's Liberty Hall Academy (now Washington and Lee University), and then at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). His studies at Princeton were halted, temporarily, as a result of the approach of English troops during the American Revolutionary War. Brown's role during the Revolutionary War is unclear. The family tradition was that Brown served under General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette in the Continental Army; however, no known documentation supports this account. Two years after he left the College of New Jersey (1778), Brown enrolled at The College of William & Mary where he studied law. In the fall of 1780, his studies were interrupted by the War and the arrival of the British forces to the city. Brown continued to study law by 'reading it' while working in the office of Thomas Jefferson near Charlottesville, Virginia. Family life Brown married Margaretta Mason on February 21, 1799. They had five children together, only two of whom lived to adulthood: *Mason Brown (November 10, 1799 ‚Äì January 27, 1867) was born in Philadelphia. *Orlando (September 26, 1801 ‚Äì July 26, 1867) was born at Liberty Hall. *Alfred was born at Liberty Hall on February 23, 1803 and died on January 29, 1804; *a second Alfred was born on May 9, 1804 and died on July 30, 1805. *Euphemia Helen, their youngest child and only daughter, was born on May 24, 1807. She died of a calomiel overdose on October 1, 1814. Descendants of John and Margaretta Brown include Senator Benjamin Gratz Brown, the 20th Governor of Missouri and Vice Presidential candidate in the 1872 election, and children's author Margaret Wise Brown. Politics Secret mission In May 1783 the young John Brown was commissioned by Robert Morris, Superintendent of Finance and President of the Secret Committee of Foreign Affairs Correspondence of the US government to visit Luis de Unzaga \\"le Conciliateur\\", who served him as an intermediary in his secret mission to free the trade with the United States thanks to bills of exchange from the bankers Le Couteulx; in fact Brown's secret mission was a success and thus the Continental Army could be paid, avoiding a rebellion in its ranks that would endanger the peace of the nascent United States of America with EnglandCazorla, Frank, G.

Virginia legislature Brown became politically active after being admitted to the bar. He was elected to the Virginia state Senate, succeeding William Christian, where he served from 1783 to 1788. He was succeeded by William Russell. The Virginia legislature sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 and 1788. When the U.S. Constitution became effective, Brown was twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1789 to 1792. Kentucky statehood As a Congressman representing Virginia, Brown introduced the petition for Kentucky Statehood. When Kentucky became a state in 1792, he resigned from the House on June 1, 1792. On June 18, the Kentucky legislature elected him to the United States Senate (as was the practice then) for a term ending in 1793. He was re-elected twice and served until 1805. He was President pro tem during the Eighth Congress. During Brown's Senate service, he moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the capital of the state. Other works In 1805, Brown was defeated for re-election to the Senate and retired to Liberty Hall. He remained active in a number of public matters for the remaining thirty years of his life. In 1800, he purchased a ferry that crossed the Kentucky River at Frankfort. Brown managed large areas of property in central Kentucky and near Chillicothe, Ohio. He was a founding member of the Frankfort Water Company and director of the first Bank of Kentucky. In 1812 Brown was appointed by the legislature to oversee the construction of a public house of worship on the public square of Frankfort. In 1829 Brown was elected as the Sheriff of Franklin County. He also served on the board that oversaw the construction of the brick Capitol building and the limestone one that replaced it (now known as the Old Capitol). In 1836, Brown presided over the organizational meeting of the Kentucky Historical Society. Liberty Hall John Brown died on August 29, 1837 in Lexington, Kentucky and was brought to Frankfort for burial. In 1847, he was re-interred in the Frankfort Cemetery. The home he occupied in his later years is preserved as Liberty Hall Historic Site located at 202 Wilkinson Street in Frankfort. The site contains two houses: Liberty Hall (1796) built by John Brown, and the Orlando Brown House (1835), designed by Gideon Shryock, and owned by Senator Brown's second son. Liberty Hall is operated as a house museum and is open to the public.

Course The Shenandoah River is formed northeast of Front Royal near Riverton, by the confluence of the South Fork and the North Fork. It flows northeast across Warren County, passing underneath Interstate 66 from its formation. Beyond the I-66 bridge the river flows through a set of bends before turning to the northeast again, crossing into Clarke County below I-66. Five miles (8 km) downriver from the Clarke County border, the Shenandoah passes under U.S. Route 50 and then passes through a triple bend. below the Route 50 bridge, the river passes underneath State Route 7 and then continues northeast another where it crosses into Jefferson County in West Virginia. Once in West Virginia the river completes six large bends before joining with the Potomac from the southwest near Harpers Ferry.

The fertile soil made it a favored place for early settlement. It continues to be a major agricultural area of Virginia and West Virginia. Some karst topography is evident, and the limestone is honeycombed with caves. Several have been developed as commercial tourist attractions, including Luray Caverns, Shenandoah Caverns, and Skyline Caverns. On the riverbank a few miles above Harper's Ferry is said to be a cave with an opening just large enough for a mounted rider to squeeze through. It widened in the interior to a spacious room where hundreds of Col. John Mosby's raiding troops are said to have hidden from pursuing Union cavalry.Virgil Carrington Jones, Mosby's Rangers (Chapel Hill & University of North Carolina Press, 1944), p. 240 (The Union discovered Mosby's cave only by accident late in the war when a wandering horse fell through a trap door hidden in a burnt-out house on the bluff above the river. A curious Union soldier noticed stairs leading downward, which proved to be the second entrance to the cave. There were stalls, hay, and room enough for 100 to 300 horses). Environmental issues Since 2005, the Shenandoah River has experienced several springtime fish kills that have affected several of its native fish species. In 2005, redbreast sunfish and smallmouth bass along a stretch of the South Fork Shenandoah River began dying of lesions caused by bacteria and fungi. Although the fish kill eventually wiped out 80% of the adult redbreast sunfish and smallmouth bass, juvenile populations appeared to be unaffected. The following year more-localized fish kills in Clarke County spread to two of the Shenandoah's three species of sucker: the shorthead redhorse and the northern hogsucker ‚Äì the former suffering from similar lesions witnessed in the previous year's fish kill. Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality received reports of fish kills near Elkton and between Bentonville and Front Royal in late April 2007 and observed fish exhibiting lesions and strange behavior. Etymology Moonlight on the Shenandoah, engraving by J.D. WoodwardWoodward engraving reproduced from The Aldine Magazine, Vol. VI No. 7, July 1873 Various accounts tell the origin of the name. According to one, General George Washington named the valley (and river) in honor of Skenandoa (or Shenandoah), an Oneida \\"pine tree chief\\" based in New York, who led hundreds of Oneida and Tuscarora warriors in support of the American rebels on the frontier during the Revolutionary War. He also sent much needed corn to Washington and his troops during their hard winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1777-1778. However, the name was in use when Washington was a child, as evidenced in land grants and correspondence.http://image.lva.virginia.gov/LONN/LO-1/018/018_0109.tif It is also said to be named after the Senedo people, a little-documented tribe said to have lived on the north fork of the river and destroyed by the Catawba, some time between 1650 and 1700. Recreation The Shenandoah River is a very popular river for canoeing, river tubing, and white-water recreation such as rafting and kayaking (class I-III in season, II-III+ during the spring run- off), and several commercial outfitters offer a variety of guided trips and rentals.

Established in 1922, it is managed by the Conservation Society of California, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of wildlife both locally and globally. The zoo is home to over 700 native and exotic animals. It's recognized for its outstanding animal care, particularly its elephant care program, and for its Leed-certified, 17,000 square foot, state-of-the-art veterinary hospital‚Äîthe largest wild animal veterinary facility in Northern California. On July 12, 2018, the Oakland Zoo opened the California Trail to the public, focusing on this state's remarkable native wildlife‚Äîboth past and present. Establishment Naturalist Henry A. Snow established the Oakland Zoo in 1922 on 19th St and Harrison St in downtown Oakland. Snow Park now occupies the site of the zoo's first home. Over the years the zoo relocated several times: to Sequoia Park, Joaquin Miller Park and finally in 1939 to Durant Park. Under Joseph R. Knowland, chairman of the California State Park Commission, California purchased the land and in 1950 renamed the park to Joseph Knowland State Arboretum and Park.Oakland Zoo History East Bay Zoological Society The East Bay Zoological Society (EBZS), founded in 1936 by Henry Snow's son, Sidney, has had a long relationship with the Oakland Zoo. At the time of its founding, EBZS was known as the Alameda County Botanical and Zoological Society. In August 2017, the East Bay Zoological Society was renamed the Conservation Society of California (CSC) to better reflect the zoo's evolving purpose and mission in its commitment to conservation. Although EBZS has always been involved with zoo projects and operations to some extent, it was not until after major development of the zoo from 1958 to 1965 that the EBZS's role increased dramatically. Through their efforts, money was raised to develop the African Veldt (1965), the Australian Outback (1975) and the original tiger exhibit (1980). In 1977, the EBZS purchased the food, rides and Children's Zoo concessions. In 1982 the EBZS entered into an agreement with the City of Oakland to manage the zoo and develop it under non-profit status. In 1985, Joel Parrott, DVM, was hired as executive director of the Oakland Zoo. Expansion Many new exhibits have been created, including those for the hamadryas baboons and the chimpanzees. A new, spacious elephant exhibit was built in 1987. The current sun bear exhibit was finished in 1995 and was featured on Animal Planet Ultimate Zoos. The white-handed gibbons now live on a lush island in the heart of the Rainforest. The African Savannah, with camels, lions, elephants, meerkats, hyenas and more, was completed in 1998. The Education Center opened its new doors in 1999 with the new main entrance followed soon after in summer 2001 (see picture). In autumn of 2001, a new squirrel monkey exhibit opened along with a larger, newly renovated tiger exhibit. In the spring of 2007, the four dromedary camels were moved to a larger, fenced enclosure uphill from their old enclosure. In 2012, a fully funded LEED-certified Veterinary Hospital opened, followed by the opening in 2013 of the Oakland Zoo Biodiversity Center, and the 2014 inauguration of the Condor Recovery Center at Oakland Zoo. Each of these projects has improved care of the zoo's animals as well as conservation of the species in the wild. California Trail California Trail represents $70 million out of an $81 million multi-phase zoo development. Guests travel to the Trail via an aerial gondola from the existing zoo. Along the trail, they encounter various animals, such as American bison, American black bears, California condors, eagles, gray wolves, grizzly bears, jaguars and mountain lions. A half-acre California Kids' Zone introduces young children and their families to California wildlife and habitats through themed play structures. Inside an interpretive center with a wall-length window into the grizzly habitat, visitors explore California's diverse habitats, step into the shoes of conservation researchers, and find their place as a member of a community of people taking action for California's wildlife. The project was designed by Noll & Tam Architects and built by C. Overaa & Co. The Wayne and Gladys Valley Children's Zoo In the summer of 2005 the Valley Children's Zoo opened with spacious new animal exhibits along with plenty of interactive play- structures for children. The ring-tailed lemurs, century old Aldabra tortoises, the interactive Goat and Sheep Contact Yard along with the river otters can be found in the Children's Zoo. The popular American alligators, the bats, the pot-bellied pigs, the Old-World rabbits along with the Bug Room, and the Reptile and Amphibian Discovery Room are also in the Children's Zoo. One of the most interesting and popular features with the smaller children are the brass insects embedded in the concrete walkways, which were installed as a form of public art.

According to various estimates there may be between 10 and 18 species found in the wild. Description Arrangement of flowers Detail of P. officinalis flowers Lungworts are evergreen or herbaceous perennials that form clumps or rosettes. They are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and sometimes also bear glands. The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Flowering stems are unbranched, rough, covered with bristly hairs, usually not exceeding , with a few exceptions (P. mollis, P. vallarsae). The stems are usually upright, or slightly spreading. The plants reach in height, spreading up to wide. The leaves are arranged in rosettes. The blades are usually large, from narrowly lanceolate to oval, with the base ranging from heart shaped to very gradually narrowing, and can have a sharply pointed or blunt tip. The leaf margin is always entire, but in some species and forms can be rather wavy. Basal leaves are carried on stalks that can be short or longer than the leaf blade in various species. Stem leaves are smaller and often narrower, and are unstalked or clasping the stem. All leaves are covered with hairs that are usually bristly, or occasionally soft. The leaves are often prominently spotted in black and blue, or sometimes in pale green, or unspotted. The spots are due to the presence of foliage air pockets. These pockets, which cool the lower leaf surface, mask the presence of chlorophyll. The inflorescence is a terminal scorpioid cyme as a cymose corymb, with bracts, on short pedicels (stalks), reaching just above the foliage. The flowers are heterostylous, with two distinct forms of flower within each species; those with short stamens and long styles (\\"pin\\" flowers) and those with long stamens and short styles (\\"thrum\\" flowers), with the former usually being larger and more showy. The calyx is hairy, 5-lobed, tubular or funnel-shaped, enlarging as the fruit ripens. The corolla is funnel-shaped and consists of a long, cylindrical tube and a limb with five shallow lobes. Within the corolla throat, five tufts of hairs alternate with the stamens to form a ring. The colour of the corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The colour of the flower in bud is often pink to violet when they first emerge, which then changes to blue as the flower matures. The stamens and style are included within the corolla and not protruding. The nutlets are smooth, egg-shaped, brownish, up to long and wide, each containing a single seed. Up to four nutlets per flower are produced, ripening mostly in summer.  Taxonomy  Pulmonaria is a genus in the Boraginoideae subfamily of Boraginaceae, consisting of approximately 18 species, although species delineation (speciation) has proved problematic. Within the Boraginoideae, Pulmonaria is placed in the tribe Boragineae, where it is closely related to Borago.  Etymology The scientific name Pulmonaria is derived from Latin pulmo (lung). In the times of sympathetic magic, the spotted oval leaves of P. officinalis were thought to symbolize diseased, ulcerated lungs, and so were used to treat pulmonary infections. The common name in many languages also refers to lungs, as in English \\"lungwort\\", German Lungenkraut, French herbe aux poumons, Serbian pluƒánjak... In some East European languages, the common name is derived from a word for honey, e.g. Russian medunitza, Polish miodunka, Serbian meduniƒçe, Bulgarian \\"–º–µ–¥—É–Ω–∏—Ü–∞\\".  Distribution and habitat  The species of the genus are distributed across Eurasia.  Ecology  Pulmonaria is an early spring flowering deciduous perennial, retaining its leaves till late winter, just before the new growth emerges.  Pests and diseases  Pulmonaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include the case-bearer Coleophora pulmonariella, which feeds exclusively on P. saccharata, and the moth Ethmia pusiella, which has been recorded on P. officinalis.  Cultivation  Pulmonaria on stamp of USSR Of the known species of Pulmonaria, only about 8 are known in cultivation. Pulmonaria are used as ornamental garden plants, particularly P. saccharata, P. angustifolia and P. longifolia. Others include P. affinis.They are especially valued as groundcover in damp shaded areas, producing their blue and/or pink flowers in late winter and early spring, accompanied by dense clusters of heart-shaped leaves that are often strikingly mottled and marbled, throughout summer.

The A1W designation stands for: * A = Aircraft carrier platform * 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor * W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer  History  The reactor was a Westinghouse Electric Corporation-built naval reactor power plant, installed in the Naval Reactors Facility in the desert at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Arco, Idaho. It first operated in October 1958. This reactor plant consisted of two reactors, A1W-A and A1W-B, operated in tandem so that the steam produced by both reactors was used to power one turbine connected to a drive shaft. Since the purpose of A1W prototype was to simulate the USS Enterprise at sea it was also possible to divert the steam to two 'dump condensers' that simulated launching aircraft. Also, the electricity generated by the Main Engine was dissipated by immersing three electrodes in a pool of water. This was done to simulate load. In the early 1970s the A1W-B core was replaced with 1/4 of the USS Nimitz core for testing. This nuclear reactor was the prototype for the A2W reactor used in the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise (CVN-65). The A1W prototype was used to train nuclear-qualified sailors for almost 34 years until its reactor plants were shut down on January 26, 1994.INL 60th Anniversary References External links * Stacy, Susan M (2000). \\"Proving the Principle, A History of The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, 1949-1999\\", (Chapter 10) United States naval reactors Pressurized water reactors ","title":"A1W reactor"},{"id":"701295","text":"The S1W reactor was the first prototype naval reactor used by the United States Navy to prove that the technology could be used for electricity generation and propulsion on submarines. The designation of \\"S1W\\" stands for * S = Submarine platform * 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor * W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer and is a later Navy designation. During the plant's early years the project name was \\"Submarine Thermal Reactor\\" (STR) The land-based nuclear reactor was built at the National Reactor Testing Station, later called Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Arco, Idaho. The plant was the prototype for the power system of USS Nautilus (SSN-571), the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, which used the improved S2W reactor. The specific location within the vast Idaho National Laboratory where the S1W prototype was located was the Naval Reactors Facility.  Design  Nautiluss reactor core prototype at the S1W facility in Idaho Under the leadership of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, Naval Reactors followed a concurrent design strategy, with the design and construction of the S1W reactor taking place ahead of the design and construction of the Nautilus. This enabled problems to be identified and resolved before they appeared in the shipboard plant. To better support this design process, the S1W power plant was built inside of a submarine hull. While the cramped spaces prevented engineers from obtaining information on some plant components, it provided a much more realistic example of how the shipboard plant would have to be constructed.  Operation  The S1W was a pressurized water reactor that utilized water as the coolant and neutron moderator in its primary system, and enriched Uranium-235 in its fuel elements. The S1W reactor reached criticality on March 30, 1953. In May of that year, it began power operations, performing a 100-hour run that simulated a submerged voyage from the east coast of the United States to Ireland. This test run clearly demonstrated the revolutionary impact that nuclear propulsion would have upon the submarine, which prior to that time was greatly limited in its ability to conduct continuous underwater operations by battery life and by the oxygen requirement of diesel propulsion systems. The heated, pressurized water of the S1W reactor power plant was circulated through heat exchangers in order to generate high pressure saturated steam in a separate water loop. This saturated steam powered steam turbines for propulsion and generation of electricity. These facilities were constructed inside an elevated hull simulating the engineering portion of the Nautilus hull. A single propeller was simulated through use of a water brake. Large, exterior water spray ponds were used to dissipate the heat energy created in the facility into the air. Following the commissioning of the USS Nautilus, the S1W plant was operated to support plant testing and training of operators. Trainees were graduates of the Naval Nuclear Power School in Bainbridge, MD, Mare Island, CA or Orlando, FL (all locations now closed). The course of study lasted six months and consisted of a combination of classroom and closely supervised practical training. In the mid-1960s, the S1W core was removed. An extension was bolted to the top of the reactor vessel so that a larger S5W reactor core could be installed. After that time the prototype was called S1W/S5W core 4. The new core was first taken critical in late summer of 1967. In order to use the additional power generated by the S5W reactor, additional facilities were added in order to dump the excess steam when the plant was operated at higher power levels. These steam dumps were constructed in the same building, but outside the mock submarine hull. The S1W/S5W plant was shut down permanently in 1989 (October 17).Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory References *Hewlett, Richard G. and Francis Duncan. Nuclear Navy: 1946-1962.

During World War II it was the highest point between the American sector landings at Utah Beach to the west and Omaha Beach to the east. The German army fortified the area with concrete casemates and gun pits. On D-Day, the United States Army Ranger Assault Group attacked and captured Pointe du Hoc after scaling the cliffs. Background Pointe du Hoc lies west of the center of Omaha Beach.Heinz W.C. When We Were One: Stories of World War II, Basic Books, 2003, , p170Le Cacheux, G. and Quellien J. Dictionnaire de la lib√©ration du nord-ouest de la France, C. Corlet, 1994, , p289 As part of the Atlantic Wall fortifications, the prominent cliff top location was fortified by the Germans. The battery was initially built in 1943 to house six captured French First World War vintage GPF 155mm K418(f) guns positioned in open concrete gun pits. The battery was occupied by the 2nd Battery of Army Coastal Artillery Regiment 1260 (2/HKAA.1260). To defend the promontory from attack, elements of the 352nd Infantry Division were stationed at the battery. Prelude 15.5 cm K 418(f) gun, of the type used in the Pointe du Hoc battery, is preserved at the Atlantic Wall on Jersey. To provide increased defensive capability, the Germans began to improve the defenses of the battery in the spring of 1944, with enclosed H671 concrete casemates being started and the older 155mm guns displaced. The plan was to build six casemates but two were unfinished when the location was attacked. The casemates were built over and in front of the circular gun pits, which housed the 155mm guns. Also built was a H636 observation bunker and L409a mounts for 20mm Flak 30 anti-aircraft guns. The 155mm guns would have threatened the Allied landings on Omaha and Utah beaches when finished, risking heavy casualties to the landing forces. In the months before D-Day the Germans were recorded by Allied Intelligence removing their guns one by one as they re-developed the site with the final aim of 4 casemates facing Utah Beach and the possibility of 2 x 155mm guns in open emplacement. During the preparation for Operation Overlord it was determined by Lt Col. Rudder that Pointe du Hoc should be attacked by ground forces, to prevent the Germans using the casemates. Recently released documents in the US Archives show that Rudder knew prior to landing that the casemates were unfinished and only two were actually structurally close to being ready. They remain that way today. The U.S. 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions were given the task of assaulting the strong point early on D-Day. Elements of the 2nd Battalion went in to attack Pointe du Hoc but delays meant the remainder of the 2nd Battalion and the complete 5th Battalion landed at Omaha Beach as their secondary landing position. Though the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc, the beachheads were shelled by field artillery from the nearby Maisy battery, on the fire support plan of heavy cruiser HMS Hawkins.Naval Bombardment at D-Day chart. (1962) Wikimedia commons. The rediscovery of the battery at Maisy has shown that it was responsible for firing on the Allied beachheads until 9 June 1944.http://www.maisybattery.com The Maisy Battery  Plan  bombing of Pointe du Hoc by 9th Air Force A-20 Havoc bombers Pointe du Hoc lay within General Leonard Gerow's V Corps field of operations. This then went to the 1st Infantry Division (the Big Red One) and then down to the right-hand assault formation, the 116th Infantry Regiment attached from 29th Division. In addition they were given two Ranger battalions to undertake the attack. The Ranger battalions were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder. The plan called for the three companies of Rangers to be landed by sea at the foot of the cliffs, scale them using ropes, ladders, and grapples while under enemy fire, and engage the enemy at the top of the cliff. This was to be carried out before the main landings. The Rangers trained for the cliff assault on the Isle of Wight, under the direction of British Commandos. Major Cleveland A. Lytle was to command Companies D, E and F of the 2nd Ranger Battalion (known as \\"Force A\\") in the assault at Pointe du Hoc. During a briefing aboard the Landing Ship Infantry TSS Ben My Chree, he heard that French Resistance sources reported the guns had been removed.Hatfield, Thomas M. (21 Apr 2011). Rudder: From Leader to Legend. Texas A&M; University Press. p. 112.Antal, John (19 Aug 2017). 7 Leadership Lessons of D-Day: Lessons from the Longest Day‚ÄîJune 6, 1944. Casemate Publishers. p. 50. Impelled to some degree by alcohol, Lytle became quite vocal that the assault would be unnecessary and suicidal and was relieved of his command at the last minute by Provisional Ranger Force commander Rudder. Rudder felt that Lytle could not convincingly lead a force with a mission that he did not believe in.Gawne, Jonathan (2001). Spearheading D-Day: American Special Units 6 June 1944. Poole, UK: Histoire & Collections. . p. 210. Lytle was later transferred to the 90th Infantry Division where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Battle Landings  Rangers from 2nd Ranger Battalion demonstrate the rope ladders they used to scale Pointe du Hoc The assault force was carried in ten landing craft, with another two carrying supplies and four DUKW amphibious trucks carrying the ladders requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade. One landing craft carrying troops sank, drowning all but one of its occupants; another was swamped. One supply craft sank and the other put the stores overboard to stay afloat. German fire sank one of the DUKWs. Once within a mile of the shore, German mortars and machine guns fired on the craft.\\"The Ultimate Sacrifice: Rudder's Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc\\" militaryhistoryonline.com These initial setbacks resulted in a 40-minute delay in landing at the base of the cliffs, but British landing craft carrying the Rangers finally reached the base of the cliffs at 7:10am with approximately half the force it started out with. The landing craft were fitted with rocket launchers to fire grapnels and ropes up the cliffs. As the Rangers scaled the cliffs, the Allied ships USS Texas (BB-35), USS Satterlee (DD-626), USS Ellyson (DD454), and HMS Talybont (L18) provided them with fire support and ensured that the German defenders above could not fire down on the assaulting troops.Beevor, Antony. \\"D-Day: The Battle for Normandy\\". (2009) pp. 102‚Äì103 The cliffs proved to be higher than the ladders could reach. Attack The original plans had also called for an additional, larger Ranger force of eight companies (Companies A and B of the 2nd Ranger Battalion and the entire 5th Ranger Battalion) to follow the first attack, if successful. Flares from the cliff tops were to signal this second wave to join the attack, but because of the delayed landing, the signal came too late, and the other Rangers landed on Omaha instead of Pointe du Hoc. The added impetus these 500 plus Rangers provided on the stalled Omaha Beach landing has been conjectured to have averted a disastrous failure there, since they carried the assault beyond the beach, into the overlooking bluffs and outflanked the German defenses. When the Rangers made it to the top at Pointe du Hoc, they had sustained 15 casualties. \\"Ranger casualties on the beach totalled about 15, most of them from the raking fire to their left\\".US Army Small Unit After Action Report for Pointe du Hoc 1944. The force also found that their radios were ineffective.Beevor, p. 103 Upon reaching the fortifications, most of the Rangers learned for the first time that the main objective of the assault, the artillery battery, had been removed. The Rangers regrouped at the top of the cliffs, and a small patrol went off in search of the guns. Two different patrols found five of the six guns nearby (the sixth was being fixed elsewhere) and destroyed their firing mechanisms with thermite grenades. Len Lommel of the 2nd Ranger Battalion maintained that he and Ranger Jack Kuhn found the guns completely by accident after walking down a tree- lined lane, whilst on patrol. Multiple copies of the Rangers orders were released in 2012 by the US National Archives, indicating that Lt. Col. Rudder had been told of the guns' removal prior to landing. His D-Day orders went beyond the taking of Pointe du Hoc and remained consistent: Land at Pointe du Hoc & Omaha Beach; advance along the coast; take the town of Grandcamp, attack the Maisy Batteries and reach the \\"D-Day Phase Line\\" (close to Osmanville) two hours before dark. The Rangers could then repel counterattacks along the Grandcamp-Vierville road, via the Isigny-Bayeux road or diagonally across open fields. They could also prevent mobile 150mm artillery getting within a 12 mile range of the beachhead. The Rangers trained specifically for the 12-mile inland march during the Slapton Sands exercises in England, and the First Infantry Division was also given the same \\"D-Day Phase Line\\" objective. Once captured, Pointe du Hoc did not offer the German Army any advantage of observation as they already used the taller Chateau, houses and churches in the area. The Small Unit Actions ReportUS Army Small Unit After Action Report for Pointe du Hoc 1944. written by US Army Intelligence, states that there were times (some hours) when the Rangers did not see a single German after the initial fighting. Historians suggest this gave Lt. Col. Rudder the time to have continued with his objectives. No documentary evidence has been produced ordering Rudder to stay and \\"guard the road\\" behind Pointe du Hoc or wait for reinforcements. Yet that version of events is often stated as factual in books written prior to 2012. German counter-attacks The costliest part of the battle for Pointe du Hoc for the Rangers came after the successful cliff assault.Gal Perl Finkel, 75 years from that long day in Normandy ‚Äì we still have something to learn, The Jerusalem Post, June 12, 2019. Determined to hold the vital high ground, yet isolated from other Allied forces, the Rangers fended off several counter-attacks from the German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The 5th Ranger Battalion and elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment headed towards Pointe du Hoc from Omaha Beach. However, only twenty-three Rangers from the 5th were able to link up with the 2nd Rangers during the evening of 6 June 1944. During the night the Germans forced the Rangers into a smaller enclave along the cliff, and some were taken prisoner. It was not until the morning of 8 June that the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc were finally relieved by the 2nd and 5th Rangers, plus the 1st Battalion of the 116th Infantry, accompanied by tanks from the 743rd Tank Battalion. When the Rangers began suffering heavy losses, brief consideration was given to sending in the 84-man Marine Detachment aboard the battleship U.S.S. Texas on the morning of June 7. At the last minute, word was passed down through the Army chain of command that no Marines would be allowed to go ashore, not even providing armed escort on landing craft ferrying Army troops or supplies. Aftermath Casualties At the end of the two-day action, the initial Ranger landing force of 225+ was reduced to about 90 fighting men. In the aftermath of the battle, some Rangers became convinced that French civilians had taken part in the fighting on the German side. A number of French civilians accused of shooting at American forces or of serving as artillery observers for the Germans were executed.Beevor, Antony. \\"D-Day: The Battle for Normandy\\".

Media The movie The Longest Day (1962) depicts the assault and capture of Pointe du Hoc. The assault on Pointe du Hoc has been portrayed in the 2005 video game Call of Duty 2, in which the player is a member of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, Dog Company, and is faced with destroying the artillery battery and fending off the counter-attacks. Pointe du Hoc is also a map in the strategy game Company of Heroes. Pointe du Hoc is a map featured in the multiplayer of Call of Duty: World War 2.

A favourite master builder of Adolf Hitler from 1930, his Neoclassical designs for the F√ºhrerbau and the Haus der Kunst in Munich influenced the style of Nazi architecture. Life Early career Born in Elberfeld, Troost attended the Technical College of Darmstadt and, upon finishing his course, worked with Martin D√ºlfer in Munich. In about 1904, he opened his own architectural office and became a member of the modernist Deutscher Werkbund association. Troost designed several rooms of Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam; he graduated from designing steamship d√©cor for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company before World War I, and the fittings for showy transatlantic liners like the SS Europa, to a style that combined Spartan traditionalism with elements of modernity. An extremely tall, spare- looking, reserved Westphalian with a close-shaven head, Troost belonged to a school of architects like Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius who, even before 1914, reacted sharply against the highly ornamental Jugendstil movement and advocated a restrained, lean architectural approach, almost devoid of ornament. Hitler Troost and Hitler first met in 1930, through the agency of the Nazi publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife Elsa. Although before 1933 he did not belong to the leading group of German architects, Troost became Hitler's foremost architect whose neo-classical style became for a time the official architecture of the Third Reich. His work filled Hitler with enthusiasm, and he planned and built state and municipal edifices throughout Germany. Haus der Kunst in 2009 In the autumn of 1933, he was commissioned to rebuild and refurnish Hitler's dwellings in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin.Seligmann, Matthew; Davison, John; and McDonald, John (2003). Daily Life in Hitler's Germany, p. 96. London: The Brown Reference Group plc. . Along with other architects like Ludwig Ruff, Troost planned and built State and municipal edifices throughout the country, including new administrative offices, social buildings for workers and bridges across the main highways. One of the many structures he planned before his death was the Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) in Munich,Zalampas, Sherree Owens (1990). Adolf Hitler: A Psychological Interpretation of His Views on Architecture, Art and Music, p. 76. Bowling Green State University Popular Press. . modeled on Schinkel's Altes Museum in Berlin and intended to be a great temple for a \\"true, eternal art of the German people\\". It was a good example of the imitation of classical forms in monumental public buildings during the Third Reich, though subsequently Hitler moved away from the more restrained style of Troost, reverting to the more elaborate imperial grandeur that he had admired in the 19th century Vienna Ring Road (Ringstra√üe) boulevard of his youth. Hitler's relationship to Troost was that of a pupil to an admired teacher. According to Albert Speer, who later became Hitler's favorite architect, the F√ºhrer would impatiently greet Troost with the words: \\"I can't wait, Herr Professor. Is there anything new? Let's see it!\\" Troost would then lay out his latest plans and sketches. Hitler frequently declared, according to Speer, that \\"he first learned what architecture was from Troost\\"'. The architect's death on 21 January 1934, after a severe illness, was a painful blow, but Hitler remained close to his widow Gerdy Troost, whose architectural taste frequently coincided with his own, which made her (in Speer's words) \\"a kind of arbiter of art in Munich\\". He was buried in the Munich Nordfriedhof (Northern Cemetery). The gravestone still survives although the family name has been removed. Hitler posthumously awarded Troost the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1937.

Memorial tablet on the birthplace of Alfredo Kraus in the Calle de Col√≥n in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria Alfredo Kraus Trujillo (; 24 November 192710 September 1999) was a distinguished Spanish tenor from the Canary islands (known professionally as Alfredo Kraus), particularly known for the artistry he brought to opera's bel canto roles. He was also considered an outstanding interpreter of the title role in Massenet's opera Werther, and especially of its famous aria, \\"Pourquoi me r√©veiller?\\" Early years Kraus was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. His father was Austrian and his mother was Spanish. He began his musical career with piano lessons at the age of four, and he sang in the school choir by age eight. His older brother, Francisco Kraus Trujillo, a baritone, studied music and opera alongside him. Career After refining his technique singing Spanish zarzuela on stage in Madrid and Barcelona, Kraus made his professional opera debut in Cairo during 1956 as the Duke in Rigoletto, which became one of his signature roles. In 1958, he sang Alfredo at the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos in Lisbon in a production of La traviata with Maria Callas, a live recording of which was later released. Kraus made his Covent Garden debut as Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor in 1959 and his La Scala debut as Elvino in La sonnambula in 1960. He made his American debut with Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1962, and his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1966 in Rigoletto, the role of his last performance there in 1994. In subsequent decades, Kraus extended his repertoire to include more Italian operas such as Lucrezia Borgia, La fille du r√©giment, Linda di Chamounix, Don Pasquale and La favorita by Donizetti; and French operas such as Rom√©o et Juliette, Les contes d'Hoffmann, Faust and Lakm√©, while continuing to sing his hallmark roles of Werther and of Des Grieux in Manon. He also recorded a number of rarely performed French operas including La jolie fille de Perth and Les p√™cheurs de perles, both by Georges Bizet, and La muette de Portici by Daniel Auber. He also performed in some very well known works, such as Don Giovanni and Faust. Kraus came to be virtually synonymous with such lyric tenor roles as Werther, Faust, Don Ottavio (Don Giovanni), Nemorino, and Arturo. He was also known for his performances of Spanish music, notably many classics from the zarzuela repertoire, which he continued to perform live on stage in Spain until the end of his career, and many of which he recorded complete for EMI Spain as well as for his own label, Carillon. Technique Thanks to his superlative technique and careful husbanding of his vocal resources, Kraus sang onstage until his early 70s. He studied voice technique in Milan with Mercedes Llopart. Kraus was also noted for extremely refined musicianship, accompanied by a seemingly effortless high register. As a result, many opera connoisseurs consider him to be one of the best tenors of the end of the 20th century. He was admired for his cultivated musical education and his complete respect for his chosen profession. His first priority was the integrity of his artistic interpretation of a piece, rather than his formidable range and excellent technique. He performed all over the world, including the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, Teatro Municipal in Caracas, Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile, Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, and the Liceu in Barcelona. In 1991, Kraus was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award. In 1997, his home city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria opened The Alfredo Kraus Auditorium in his honor. Later years The loss of his wife in 1997 affected Kraus so deeply that he stopped performing for eight months. A proud and strong-willed man, he eventually returned to the stage and to teaching. He said, \\"I don't have the will for singing but I must do it, because, in a sense, it is a sign that I have overcome the tragedy. Singing is a form of admitting that I'm alive.\\" Kraus died on 10 September 1999 in Madrid, at the age of 71, after a long illness.

The play was written in 1938 and received its first theatrical production (in German) at the Zurich Schauspielhaus, opening on the 9th of September 1943. This production was directed by Leonard Steckel, with set-design by Teo Otto. The cast included Steckel himself (as Galileo), Karl Paryla and Wolfgang Langhoff. The second (or 'American') version was written in English between 1945‚Äì1947 in collaboration with Charles Laughton, and opened at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles on 30 July 1947. It was directed by Joseph Losey and Brecht, with musical direction by Serge Hovey and set-design by Robert Davison. Laughton played Galileo, with Hugo Haas as Barberini and Frances Heflin as Virginia. This production opened at the Maxine Elliott's Theatre in New York on 7 December of the same year. In 1955 Brecht prepared a third version. A production, by the Berliner Ensemble with Ernst Busch in the title role, opened in January 1957 at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm and was directed by Erich Engel, with set-design by Caspar Neher.Willett (1959, 46‚Äì47). The play was first published in 1940. The action of the play follows the career of the great Italian natural philosopher Galileo Galilei and the Galileo affair, in which he was tried by the Roman Catholic Church for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between dogmatism and scientific evidence, as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.  Versions of the play  After emigrating to the United States from Hitler's Germany (with stopovers in various other countries in between, among them the USSR), Brecht translated and re-worked the first version of his play in collaboration with the actor Charles Laughton.McNeil (2005: 45‚Äì47) The result of their efforts was the second 'American version' of the play, entitled simply Galileo, which to this day remains the most widely staged version in the English-speaking world. This version differed in tone from the original, as Brecht felt that the optimistic portrait of the scientific project present in the first version required revision in a post-Hiroshima world, where science's harmful potential had become more apparent.McNeil (2005: 63; 111‚Äì113) This second version formed the basis for Losey's 1975 film adaptation for American Film Theatre under the title Galileo with Topol in the title role. In September 1947, Brecht was subpoenaed in the US by the House Un-American Activities Committee for alleged communist connections. He testified before HUAC on 30 October 1947, and flew to Europe on 31 October. He chose to return to East Germany and continued to work on the play, now once again in the German language. The final German version premiered at Cologne in April 1955. Matej Danter offers a readily-accessible and detailed comparison of the early, the American, and the final German versions.Danter (2001) In 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company performed a new version of the play based on a \\"pared down\\" translation by Mark Ravenhill; the Swan Theatre production received a favorable review from the veteran theater critic Michael Billington.  Synopsis  Portrait of Galileo Galilei by Giusto Sustermans, c. 1640 Galileo, an eminent professor and scientist in the 17th century Venetian Republic, is short of money. A prospective student tells him about a novel invention, the telescope (\\"a queer tube thing\\"), that is being sold in Amsterdam. Galileo replicates it, and offers it to the Republic as his own creation. He gains an increase in his salary, but within a short time his ruse is discovered. Galileo then uses the telescope for careful observations of the Moon and the planets, and he discovers the moons orbiting Jupiter. His observations strongly support Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric model of the Solar System, which is counter both to popular belief and to the doctrine of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. He furthermore publishes in vernacular Italian, rather than traditional scientific Latin, thus making his work and conclusions more accessible to the common people. His daughter's engagement to a well-off young man (with whom she is genuinely in love) is broken because of Galileo's reluctance to distance himself from his unorthodox teachings. Galileo is brought to the Vatican in Rome for interrogation by the Inquisition. Upon being threatened with torture, he recants his teachings. His students are shocked by his surrender in the face of pressure from the church authorities. Galileo, old and broken, now living under house arrest with a priest monitoring his activities, is visited by one of his former pupils, Andrea. Galileo gives him a book (Two New Sciences) containing all his scientific discoveries, asking him to smuggle it out of Italy for dissemination abroad. Andrea now believes Galileo's actions were heroic and that he just recanted to fool the ecclesiastical authorities. However, Galileo insists his actions had nothing to do with heroism but were merely the result of self-interest. Historical background The play stays generally faithful to Galileo's science and timeline thereof, but takes significant liberties with his personal life. Galileo did in fact use a telescope, observe the moons of Jupiter, advocate for the heliocentric model, observe sunspots, investigate buoyancy, and write on physics, and did visit the Vatican twice to defend his work, the second time being made to recant his views, and being confined to house arrest thereafter. One significant liberty that is taken is the treatment of Galileo's daughter Virginia Gamba (Sister Maria Celeste), who, rather than becoming engaged, was considered unmarriageable by her father and confined to a convent from the age of thirteen (the bulk of the play), and, further, died of dysentery shortly after her father's recantation. However, Galileo was close with Virginia, and they corresponded extensively. Allusions There are a number of allusions to Galileo's science and to Marxism which are not further elaborated in the play; some of these are glossed below. The discussion of price versus value was a major point of debate in 19th century economics, under the terms exchange value versus use value. Within Marxian economics this is discussed under the labor theory of value. More subtly, Marx is sometimes interpreted as advocating technological determinism (technological progress determines social change), which is reflected in the telescope (a technological change) being the root of the scientific progress and hence social unrest. The mention of tides refers to Galileo's theory that the motion of the Earth caused the tides, which would give the desired physical proof of the Earth's movement, and which is discussed in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, whose working title was Dialogue on the Tides. In actuality Galileo was wrong. Kepler correctly believed that the Moon's gravity caused the tides. The bent wooden rail in scene 13 and the discussion that the quickest distance between two points need not be a straight line (though a straight line offers the shortest path, the fastest descent of a rolling ball in fact follows a curve) alludes to Galileo's investigation of the brachistochrone (in the context of the quickest descent from a point to a wall), which he incorrectly believed to be given by a quarter circle. Instead, the brachistochrone is a half cycloid, which was only proven much later with the development of calculus. In performance * Notes : Life of Gelileo References * Brecht, Bertolt (1952).

It originated as a free email service and later expanded its offerings. Juno is a subsidiary of United Online, which in turn is a subsidiary of investment bank B. Riley Financial. United Online is also the parent of NetZero and BlueLight Internet Services. History The earliest Juno logo, circa 1996, the year the company was founded. Juno was founded in May 1996 by Charles Ardai, Brian Marsh and Clifford Tse, with equity capital provided by the D. E. Shaw Group and headquarters in the same Midtown Manhattan building as Shaw. In August 1996, it began a free e-mail service ‚Äî a customer would install the proprietary Juno client which would allow them to send and receive email of about 35 kilobytes in size. Version 1 did not offer attachments or other features. The user could write emails with the Juno client and would periodically sign in by dial-up. Upon doing so, the Juno client would upload any emails the user had written, download any new incoming emails in the online mailbox, and download targeted advertisements, which were displayed in the client. This was similar to \\"QWK\\" and similar less automated offline readers that had been used for years by BBSes to save phone line connect time. In June 1998, Juno expanded its service to offer premium support for paying subscribers, and added the ability to browse the web in addition to use of email. In December 1999, Juno began to offer the same service (minus technical support) for free, provided the user ran the Juno client, which displayed a bar containing advertisements for the majority of the time that the user was online. Juno later imposed limits on how much usage could be made of its free Internet service in a single month. Free service was limited, as of the middle of July 2015, to a maximum of 10 hours per month. With the collapse of the 1990s Dot-com bubble, Internet advertising revenues declined and the company shifted emphasis to offering discount Web and mail services similar to large ISPs, but at half the price. Juno stock began trading on NASDAQ in May 1999, under the symbol JWEB. In June 2001, Juno and NetZero, which also traded on NASDAQ but under the symbol NZRO, announced a merger. The two had been in litigation over the patent which NetZero held to provide free Internet access by using an Ad bar. Though NetZero held the said patent, Juno had six million members, and thus was far larger. Eventually, they chose to merge rather than continue to fight in court. By September 2001, the two companies were merged into the present-day United Online, and both JWEB and NZRO were delisted. Juno released, along with NetZero, a service that purported to make web browsing faster. It displayed pictures at lower resolutions, thereby speeding page loads. In 2001, Juno enacted a new version of their privacy policy. By continuing to use the service, customers implicitly agreed to allow Juno to harvest any unused CPU cycles. The plan was to assemble a quasi supercomputer using customers processors, and sell computing services to private companies. This additional revenue was intended to keep the company afloat after the dot-com bubble. Most customers did not notice the change of terms. Though a customer for the Juno Virtual Supercomputer service was announced,Incubator buys into Juno Virtual Supercomputer by Thor Olavsrud, May 1, 2001, Internetnews.com it remained unclear, as of the middle of July 2015, whether the company followed through on this plan.  Proprietary client  Image:Juno icon.png The Juno client software icon. The client software was updated many times in the late 1990s. Version 1.49 was final for Windows 3.1, except for a date problem that was fixed in version 1.51. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.0.33 were final for Windows 95 and later. Version 4 had attachments and a spell checker, and displayed fonts and colors. For old messages, it had storage folders, each stored in a separate file containing up to 1000 messages. Version 5 added an ineffective integral twit/spam filter and the ability to write messages in chosen fonts and colors with inline images. It stored its old messages in a different format, with one large file for all messages. When disk free space was not several times larger than the message file, it often suffered \\"folder collapse\\" in which all messages returned to the \\"Inbox\\" or disappeared. As of December 1, 2004, use of an e-mail client such as the Juno client, Microsoft Outlook Express, or Eudora had ceased to be free. Users who wished to use an e-mail client instead of Juno's web-based e-mail interface were required to pay for either Juno Platinum or Juno Megamail. The Juno client software's version 5.0, build 33, would not work with Internet Explorer 7. However, by the time Microsoft released the final version of IE7, Juno had released Juno 5.0 build 49, which resolved the issues with IE7 and made it compatible with Windows Vista. Version 8, compatible with Windows 7, was released in 2009. The proprietary mailers were only slightly supported in the 21st century, and the service supported POP3 standard mail clients. No version of Juno's offline mail reader was made to use third party utilities to scan for viruses or clean out E-mail spam among messages that had already been downloaded. Versions 5 and 8 could weed downloaded email messages individually by exact email address matches; however, there were no wildcards, boolean exclusion-filters, or routing features to facilitate this. The company opened a spamdesk to help screen spam at the servers, thus minimizing the amount of spam received by the Juno client. While the Juno client software could back up e-mails and addresses, it did not support exporting these to other clients, nor did other clients support importing from Juno. Only a handful of third-party utilities were made that could do anything with the proprietary message storage format; instead, users were forced to use third party applications to convert and export the data, principally juno5bdb for messages (which Juno stored in a Berkeley DB), and Dawn for addresses.

He was, and remains, popularly known as \\"The Flying Prince\\", \\"The Flying Slav\\", or simply as \\"Obo\\" to many sports fans. Biography A member of the Rurik dynasty, he was born at Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) on 17 February 1916, the son of Prince Sergei Alexandrovich Obolensky, an officer in the Tsar's Imperial Horse Guards and his wife Princess Lubov' (n√©e Naryshkina). The family name derives from the ancient Russian city of Obolensk; they fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and settled in Muswell Hill, London. He was appointed a Knight of St John in 1938. Obolensky was educated at The Ashe boys' preparatory school, Etwall and Trent College, Long Eaton, both in Derbyshire, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford in Michaelmas 1934, where he held a college exhibition and read Politics, Philosophy and Economics; he graduated with a Fourth Class degree (BA (Oxon)) in 1938. At Oxford he won two rugby blues representing Oxford University RFC as a wing/three-quarter. Having previously played for Chesterfield FC whilst still at school, he played for Leicester Tigers between 1934 and 1939, as well as Rosslyn Park FC; his selection for England caused a stir because he was not a British subject, although he was naturalised British in March 1936. On 4 January 1936. Obolensky scored two tries on his England debut in a 13‚Äì0 victory over the All Blacks, the first time England had beaten New Zealand. Aided by Path√© News footage of the game, his name has entered into legend, since the first try, beating several All Blacks in a run of three-quarters of the length of the field, was widely regarded as the greatest try of the time, and one of the greatest tries ever scored by England.Green Umbrella Productions: 101 Greatest English Tries.

He was selected as a member of the touring party for the 1936 British Lions tour to Argentina. He also played seven games for the \\"invitation only\\" Barbarian F.C. between 1937 and 1939, scoring three tries. On 12 August 1939, Obolensky was commissioned as an Acting Pilot Officer in 615 Squadron (Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF)), being stationed at RAF Kenley and at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined RAF 504 Squadron.

Yaroslav and his son Mikhail Yaroslavich presided over Tver's transformation from a sleepy village into one of the greatest centres of power in medieval Russia. All the later dukes of Tver descended from Yaroslav Yaroslavich. He was a son of Yaroslav II and younger brother of Alexander Nevsky. In 1247, while still a minor, he received from his uncle the town of Tver. In 1252, Yaroslav and his brother Andrey seized Alexander's capital, Pereslavl- Zalessky. Reinforced by Tatar units, Alexander presently fought it back, taking prisoner Yaroslav's children and leaving his wife as a casualty on the field of battle. Yaroslav fled to Ladoga whence he was summoned by Novgorodians to succeed Alexander as their military commander. In 1258 he visited the khan's capital in Sarai, and two years later led the Novgorod army against the Teutonic Knights. Upon Alexander's death in 1263, Yaroslav quarrelled with Andrey as to who should become Grand Duke next. They went to the Golden Horde for arbitration, which was in favour of Yaroslav. The latter, however, settled in Novgorod and married a daughter of one local boyar.

The last known sighting of Small occurred the evening of 2 December 1919. He had been known to travel without notice, so his disappearance was not reported until early 1920. His body was never recovered. Small's disappearance became a national news sensation. Various theories explaining Small's disappearance were publicly promoted, and the famed mystery writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was consulted, although he elected not to pursue the case.  Early life  Peter Ambrose Joseph Small was born on January 11, 1866, in Newmarket, Ontario, to Daniel Small, an innkeeper, and Helen (Ellen) Brazell, each twenty years old. He was baptized Roman Catholic on January 21, 1866. The 1871 Canadian census places his address in Albion, Cardwell, Ontario, age 6. The 1881 Canadian census places his address in St. Andrew's Ward, Toronto, at age 15. The 1891 Canadian census places his address in St. Thomas's Ward, Toronto, age 25. Ambrose married Theresa Kormann on November 6, 1904, in York (Toronto). Disappearance The Grand Opera House in Toronto, where Small was last seen On December 1, 1919, Ambrose Small sold all his theatre holdings at a profit of . The following day he met with lawyer F. W. M. Flock in Small's office at the Grand Opera House. Flock left at 5:30 p.m. and was the last person to see Small. That night, Small disappeared from his office. No one who testified for the police claimed to have seen him leave his office or in the Adelaide and Yonge Street area outside the building. A newsstand operator, Ralph Savein, claimed to have seen Small and had an altercation with him regarding the late shipment of that day's newspapers. At the time, however, this claim was discounted by the police, who considered it to be an attempt by Savein to gain fame from the case. Small had no motive to disappear: the millionaire did not take money with him, nor was there any ransom note, let alone evidence of kidnapping. At 53, Small owned theatres in seven Ontario cities and was the controller of 62 other buildings, a self-made millionaire at the height of his career. Because Ambrose Small was known to disappear occasionally to womanize and carouse, his absence was not reported nor was it noted for several weeks. In January 1920, Small's attorney, F. W. M. Flock, along with Teresa Small, now alarmed by Small's lengthy absence, notified the local police. Teresa Small offered a $50,000 reward for information about her husband's disappearance and whereabouts. The reward went unclaimed. The investigation Original leads The police launched an extensive investigation. Small was officially declared dead in 1924. The case remained unsolved until being closed in 1960. The week of his disappearance, Small's Opera House was playing Revelations of a Wife, a play that attracted full houses. Police analyzed the plot and its themes but found no leads. Small had not used this play to provide cryptic hints. His wife Theresa suggested that Small had fallen into the hands of a \\"designing woman\\" but police found no candidates. Along with his office, \\"Amby\\", as he was known locally, had a \\"private, secret room\\" with its own entrance. The room is said to have had a dual purpose: first and foremost, it was for the settling of gambling debts, and secondly, it was for Ambrose Small's many private liaisons with actresses and chorus girls, employees at his Ontario theatres. The room was scoured for leads but with no success. Ambrose Small was not the only notable disappearance in December 1919. His former secretary, John (Jack) Doughty, had not been seen since December 2, 1919. The last sighting of Doughty in Canada was at a bank where he was observed cashing in $100,000 in bonds. He was eventually located in the United States and extradited back to Canada to stand trial. He was convicted only of the theft of the bonds. No evidence was ever found he was responsible or had any knowledge of the disappearance of his boss, Ambrose Small.

Brothy stated that the man, who he claimed was Small, was a \\"half-crazed cripple.\\" He stated that he had been dropped off in Des Moines, Iowa, by an unidentified motorist who claimed he'd accidentally struck Small with his car, badly wounding him and that he hoped he'd receive the best medical care available. Brothy claimed that the man had a gunshot wound in his neck, a serious concussion and both his legs had been severed from the knee down. He further stated that the man didn't speak for three weeks before finally breaking his silence, stating, \\"I am John Doughty. I came here from Omaha. That is all I remember.\\" At this time however John \\"Jack\\" Doughty was incarcerated in Canada and had been for several months, meaning the crippled man could not have been him. Brothy further claimed that he showed a photo of Ambrose Small to the man to which he responded by pointing at the photo and stating, quote \\"Yes, that is me.\\" Brothy stated the man's facial characteristics were identical to the missing magnate's, however the mystery man weighed a significant amount more than Small had at his disappearance, having weighed only around 100 pounds. Further reports state that the man was taken into custody by the P.I.(s), however the Des Moines police were quoted as being unaware of any of these actions and had not been contacted by the investigator(s). It can be assumed that this lead turned out to be a dead end, as the case continued on long after this event.  1936 Ontario Provincial Police Re-Investigation  In 1936 the case was re-investigated by the Ontario Provincial Police at the behest of the Attorney General. O.P.P. inspector Edward L. Hammond consulted with the original investigators from the Toronto police, obtained typed copies of their report and various other source documents, and re-interviewed some witnesses. Hammond's conclusion, that Small was murdered in a plot of which his wife was the \\"prime mover,\\" is in marked contrast to the Ontario government's public position that Mrs. Small (and hence also her large monetary bequest to the Catholic church) was beyond reproach. Hammond also strongly implies that the original chief investigator, Austin Mitchell of the Toronto Police, ignored or repressed evidence which would lead to Mrs. Small as a suspect.  The Reuter Confession Letter  Theresa Small died October 14, 1935, bequeathing the majority of her holdings to the Roman Catholic Church, valued at over 500,000 pounds. In June 1936, her remaining possessions were to be auctioned off. Ambrose Small's sister, Florence Small, presented a letter of confession from someone known only as \\"Reuter,\\" who claimed to have been the murderer. \\"Poor Ambrose was killed on December 2, 1919, and I know that part of his body, the trunk, was buried in the Rosedale ravine dump and other parts of the body were burned in the Grand Opera House furnace. You will be surprised, my dear Florence and Gertrude, to learn that I am more responsible for your brother's death. God forgive me. ‚Äî Reuter.\\" The sale, however, continued, and the letter was published in several news publications worldwide, including the New York Daily News and the Portsmouth [UK] Evening News. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Toronto reporters contacted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle about the case when the author was on a New York visit. Doyle showed interest in the case, producing the headline \\"World's Greatest Detective to Solve Small Case\\". In the end, Doyle decided not to pursue the case. Charles Fort American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena Charles Fort wrote about the unexplained disappearances of Ambrose Small and Ambrose Bierce, and asked \\"Was somebody collecting Ambroses?\\"Wild Talents, p. 847 In popular culture Small appears as a major character in the Michael Ondaatje novel In the Skin of a Lion. The events concerning him in the novel after his disappearance are fictitious. Small appears as a real-life disappearance case in The Convict Lover by Canadian author Merilyn Simonds. In 2019 a book by Toronto Star feature writer Katie Daubs, marking the 100th anniversary of Small's disappearance, was widely anticipated.

Coached by Jumbo Elliott, Jenkins won in the 1955 National AAU title in 440 yd (402 m) but at the 1956 Olympics all eyes were on Jenkins' U.S. teammate, Lou Jones, who held the world record. Jones had won the U.S. Trials while Jenkins had placed a distant third. At Melbourne, Jenkins barely made it to the 400 m Olympic final, finishing third in both his first and second-round heats. In the final, however, a strong finish earned him the gold medal. A few days later he won a second gold medal when the U.S. took the 4 x 400 m relay. Jenkins also competed indoors, winning the AAU 600 yd (549 m) title in 1955, 1957 and 1958. In 1956, he set a world indoor best for 500 yd (457 m).

It is usually represented within a particular energy or length scale, such as Planck units. When used in this context, the traditional terms \\"infrared\\" and \\"ultraviolet\\" are not literal references to specific regions of the spectrum. Infrared and ultraviolet cutoff An infrared cutoff (long-distance cutoff) is the minimal value of energy ‚Äì or, equivalently, the maximal wavelength (usually a very large distance) ‚Äì that will be taken into account in a calculation, typically an integral. At the opposite end of the energy scale, an ultraviolet cutoff is the maximal allowed energy or the shortest allowed distance (usually a very short length scale). Effect on calculation A typical use of cutoffs is to prevent singularities from appearing during calculation. If some quantities are computed as integrals over energy or another physical quantity, these cutoffs determine the limits of integration. The exact physics is reproduced when the appropriate cutoffs are sent to zero or infinity. However, these integrals are often divergent ‚Äì see IR divergence and UV divergence ‚Äì and a cutoff is needed.

Overview The infrared divergence only appears in theories with massless particles (such as photons). They represent a legitimate effect that a complete theory often implies. In fact, in the case of photons, the energy is given by E=hŒΩ, where ŒΩ is the frequency associated to the particle and as it goes to zero, like in the case of soft photons, there will be an infinite number of particles in order to have a finite amount of energy. One way to deal with it is to impose an infrared cutoff and take the limit as the cutoff approaches zero and/or refine the question. Another way is to assign the massless particle a fictitious mass, and then take the limit as the fictitious mass vanishes. The divergence is usually in terms of particle number and not empirically troubling, in that all measurable quantities remain finite. (Unlike in the case of the UV catastrophe where the energies involved diverge.) Bremsstrahlung example When an electric charge is accelerated (or decelerated) it emits Bremsstrahlung radiation. Semiclassical electromagnetic theory, or the full quantum electrodynamic analysis, shows that an infinite number of soft photons are created. But only a finite number are detectable, the remainder, due to their low energy, falling below any finite energy detection threshold, which must necessarily exist., pages 177-184 and appendix A6 However even though most of the photons are not detectable they can't be ignored in the theory; quantum electrodynamic calculations show that the transition amplitude between any states with a finite number of photons vanishes.

The HX convoys were a series of North Atlantic convoys which ran during the Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. They were east-bound convoys and originated in Halifax, Nova Scotia from where they sailed to ports in the United Kingdom. They absorbed the BHX convoys from Bermuda en route. Later, after the United States entered the war, HX convoys began at New York. A total of 377 convoys ran in the campaign, conveying a total of about 20,000 ships. 38 convoys were attacked (about 10%), resulting in losses of 110 ships in convoy; a further 60 lost straggling, and 36 while detached or after dispersal, with losses from marine accident and other causes, for a total loss of 206 ships, or about 1% of the total. History The HX designation perpetuated a similar series that ran in First World War Atlantic Campaign in 1917 and 1918. HX convoys were organized at the beginning of the Atlantic campaign and ran without major changes until the end, the longest continuous series of the war. HX 1 sailed on 16 September 1939 and included 18 merchant ships, escorted by the Royal Canadian Navy destroyers and to a North Atlantic rendezvous with Royal Navy heavy cruisers and . These were initially considered fast convoys made up of ships that could make 9‚Äì13 knots. A parallel series of slow convoys, the SC series, was run for ships making 8 knots or less, while ships making more than 13 knots sailed independently, until 14-knot CU convoys were organized in late 1943. The largest convoy of World War II was HX 300 which sailed for the UK via New York on 17 July 1944, with 167 merchant ships. It arrived in the UK, without incident, on 3 August 1944. Convoy battles As the HX convoys were comparatively fast convoys, they were less vulnerable to U-boat attack than the slow convoys, but they still witnessed some of the great convoy battles of the war. Over the entire campaign, there were 40 convoys that lost more than 6 ships; of those 40 convoys, 5 were in the HX series. * HX 79 Attacked by a U-boat wolf pack in October 1940. 12 ships were lost, which, with the attack on Convoy SC 7 on the same day made the worst day's shipping losses of the entire Atlantic campaign. * HX 84 Attacked on 5 November 1940, by the . Five ships were quickly sunk, but the sacrifice of the armed merchant cruiser and the armed merchant ship SS Beaverford along with failing light allowed the rest of the convoy to escape.

Overview Since an infinite result is unphysical, ultraviolet divergences often require special treatment to remove unphysical effects inherent in the perturbative formalisms. In particular, UV divergences can often be removed by regularization and renormalization. Successful resolution of an ultraviolet divergence is known as ultraviolet completion. If they cannot be removed, they imply that the theory is not perturbatively well-defined at very short distances. The name comes from the earliest example of such a divergence, the \\"ultraviolet catastrophe\\" first encountered in understanding blackbody radiation. According to classical physics at the end of the nineteenth century, the quantity of radiation in the form of light released at any specific wavelength should increase with decreasing wavelength‚Äîin particular, there should be considerably more ultraviolet light released from a blackbody radiator than infrared light. Measurements showed the opposite, with maximal energy released at intermediate wavelengths, suggesting a failure of classical mechanics. This problem eventually led to the development of quantum mechanics. The successful resolution of the original ultraviolet catastrophe has prompted the pursuit of solutions to other problems of ultraviolet divergence. A similar problem in electromagnetism was solved by Richard Feynman by applying quantum field theory through the use of renormalization groups, leading to the successful creation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Similar techniques led to the standard model of particle physics. Ultraviolet divergences remain a key feature in the exploration of new physical theories, like supersymmetry.  Proliferation in perturbative theory  Commenting on the fact that contemporary theories about quantum scattering of fundamental particles grew out of application of the quantization procedure to classical fields that satisfy wave equations, Bjorken and DrellJ.D. Bjorken, S. Drell (1965). Relativistic Quantum Fields, Preface. McGraw-Hill. . pointed out the following facts about such a procedure which are still as relevant today as in 1965: > The first is that we are led to a theory with differential wave propagation. > The field functions are continuous functions of continuous parameters and , > and the changes in the fields at a point are determined by properties of the > fields infinitesimally close to the point .

Myatt came to public attention in 1999, a year after his Islamic conversion, when a pamphlet he allegedly wrote many years earlier, A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution, described as a \\"detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection\\",Whine, Michael.

Personal life David Wulstan Myatt grew up in Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania), where his father worked as a civil servant for the British government, and later in the Far East, where he studied martial arts. He moved to England in 1967 to complete his schooling, and has said that he began a degree in physics but did not complete it, leaving his studies to focus on his political activism.Myatt, David. \\"Towards Identity and the Galactic Empire\\". 2009-10-24. He is reported to live in the Midlands Sunday Mercury, July 9, 2000 Sunday Mercury, February 16, 2003 and to have been married three times. According to Jeffrey Kaplan, Myatt has undertaken \\"a global odyssey which took him on extended stays in the Middle East and East Asia, accompanied by studies of religions ranging from Christianity to Islam in the Western tradition and Taoism and Buddhism in the Eastern path. In the course of this Siddhartha-like search for truth, Myatt sampled the life of the monastery in both its Christian and Buddhist forms.\\"Kaplan, Jeffrey (2000). Encyclopedia of white power: a sourcebook on the radical racist right. Rowman & Littlefield, p. 216ff; p.512f Beliefs and career Political scientist George Michael writes that Myatt has \\"arguably done more than any other theorist to develop a synthesis of the extreme right and Islam,\\"Michael, George. (2006) The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right. University Press of Kansas, p. 142. and is \\"arguably England's principal proponent of contemporary neo-Nazi ideology and theoretician of revolution.\\"Michael, George. The New Media and the Rise of Exhortatory Terrorism. Strategic Studies Quarterly (USAF), Volume 7 Issue 1, Spring 2013. He described Myatt as an \\"intriguing theorist\\" whose \\"Faustian quests\\" not only involved studying Taoism and spending time in a Buddhist and later a Christian monastery,Michael, George. (2006) The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right. University Press of Kansas, p. 143. but also allegedly involved exploring the occult, and Paganism and what Michael calls \\"quasi-Satanic\\" secret societies, while remaining a committed National Socialist. In 2000, British anti-fascist magazine Searchlight wrote that: \\"[Myatt] does not have the appearance of a Nazi ideologue ... [S]porting a long ginger beard, Barbour jacket, cords and a tweed flat cap, he resembles an eccentric country gentleman out for a Sunday ramble. But Myatt is anything but the country squire, for beneath this seemingly innocuous exterior is a man of extreme and calculated hatred. Over the past ten years, Myatt has emerged as the most ideologically driven nazi in Britain, preaching race war and terrorism [...] Myatt is believed to have been behind a 15-page document which called for race war, under the imprint White Wolves.\\"Theoretician of Terror, Searchlight, issue #301, July 2000. At a 2003 UNESCO conference in Paris, which concerned the growth of anti-Semitism, it was stated that \\"David Myatt, the leading hardline Nazi intellectual in Britain since the 1960s [...] has converted to Islam, praises bin Laden and al Qaeda, calls the 9/11 attacks 'acts of heroism,' and urges the killing of Jews.

Observers warn that Myatt is a dangerous man...\\"Simon Wiesenthal Center: Response, Summer 2003, Vol 24, #2 This view of Myatt as a radical Muslim, or Jihadi,Myatt was described by author Martin Amis as \\"a fierce Jihadi\\". The Second Plane. Jonathan Cape, 2008, p.157 is supported by Professor Robert S.

One of Myatt's writings justifying suicide attacks was, for several years, on the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing) section of the Hamas website.Durham, Martin. White Rage: The Extreme Right and American Politics. Routledge, 2007, p.113 Since 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of both Islam and his extremist past, writing that: \\"What I [...] came to understand, via pathei-mathos, was the importance - the human necessity, the virtue - of love, and how love expresses or can express the numinous in the most sublime, the most human, way. Of how extremism (of whatever political or religious or ideological kind) places some abstraction, some ideation, some notion of duty to some ideation, before a personal love, before a knowing and an appreciation of the numinous.\\" In addition to writing about Islam and National Socialism, Myatt has translated works by Sophocles,J.

Black Sun, NYU Press, 2002, p. 218. written the publicly available teachings of the ONA under the pseudonym Anton Long,Ryan, Nick. Into a World of Hate. Routledge, 2003, p. 54. with his role being \\"paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA\\". According to Senholt, \\"ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global 'War On Terror', because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt's writings\\".Senholt, Jacob. Secret Identities in The Sinister Tradition, in Per Faxneld and Jesper Petersen (eds), The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity. Oxford University Press, 2012. David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with the ONA,Ryan, Nick. Into a World of Hate. Routledge, 2003, p. 53. and using the pseudonym Anton Long, and has repeatedly challenged his accusers to provide evidence of such allegations, which so far they have failed to do. George Sieg expressed doubts regarding Myatt being Long, writing that he considered it to be \\"implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone\\" between Myatt and Long's writings.Sieg, George. Angular Momentum: From Traditional to Progressive Satanism in the Order of Nine Angles. International Journal for the Study of New Religions, volume 4, number 2. 2013. p.257. Jeffrey Kaplan also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people,Kaplan, Jeffrey. Religiosity and the Radical Right: Toward the Creation of a New Ethnic Identity, in Jeffrey Kaplan and Tore Bj√∏rgo (editors), Nation and Race: The Developing Euro-American Racist Subculture. Northeastern University Press. 1998. p.115. . Kaplan additionally states that the individual who used the pseudonym Anton Long was a friend of Myatt's in the 1970s and 1980s. as did the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette who wrote that it was quite possible that 'Anton Long' was a pseudonym used by multiple individuals over the last 30 years.Monette, Connell. Mysticism in the 21st Century. 2013. Sirius Academic Press. p.92. Political activism Myatt joined Colin Jordan's British Movement, a neo-Nazi group, in 1968, where he sometimes acted as Jordan's bodyguard at meetings and rallies.Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas. \\"Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth and Neo-Nazism\\", NYU Press, 2000, p.215 Myatt would later become Leeds Branch Secretary and a member of British Movement's National Council.

(2002) p.223. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity. New York University Press. Of the NDFM, John Tyndall wrote (in a polemic against NDFM co-founder Eddy Morrison): \\"The National Democratic Freedom Movement made little attempt to engage in serious politics but concentrated its activities mainly upon acts of violence against its opponents. [...] Before very long the NDFM had degenerated into nothing more than a criminal gang.\\"Spearhead. April, 1983 See also David Myatt and the Occult-Fascist Axis, in the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, No. 241 (July 1995), pp.6‚Äì7, where it is stated that NDFM members, including Myatt, were involved in a series of violent attacks on coloured people and left-wingers. Myatt, writing in his autobiography Myngath, admits that during this time he did organize a small gang \\"whose aim was to liberate goods, fence them, and make some money with the initial intent of aiding our political struggle.\\" Myatt was subsequently arrested in a raid by the Yorkshire Regional Crime Squad, and imprisoned for leading this gang. It is also alleged that in the early 1980s Myatt tried to establish a Nazi- occultist commune in Shropshire, although Myatt denies this allegation, claiming that his aim was to establish an agrarian community solely based on the Nazi principles of Blood and Soil and which project was advertised in Colin Jordan's Gothic Ripples newsletter,Searchlight, #104 (February 1984) and #106 (April 1984( with Goodrick-Clark writing that \\"after marrying and settling in Church Stretton in Shropshire, [Myatt] attempted in 1983 to set up a rural commune within the framework of Colin Jordan's Vanguard Project for neo-nazi utopias publicized in Gothic Ripples\\".Goodrick-Clark, N. (2002) p.222. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity. New York University Press. Michael writes that Myatt took over the leadership of Combat 18 in 1998, when Charlie Sargent, the previous leader, was jailed for murder. Alleged influence on David Copeland In November 1997, Myatt allegedly posted a racist and anti-Semitic pamphlet he had written called Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution on a website based in British Columbia, Canada by Bernard Klatt. The pamphlet included chapter titles such as \\"Assassination\\", \\"Terror Bombing\\", and \\"Racial War\\".Vacca, John R. \\"Computer Forensics: Computer Crime Scene Investigation\\", Charles River Media, 2005, p.420 According to Michael Whine of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, \\"[t]he contents provided a detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection with advice on assassination targets, rationale for bombing and sabotage campaigns, and rules of engagement.\\" In February 1998, detectives from S012 Scotland Yard raided Myatt's home in Worcestershire and removed his computers and files. He was arrested on suspicion of incitement to murder and incitement to racial hatred, but the case later dropped, after a three-year investigation, because the evidence supplied by the Canadian authorities was not enough to secure a conviction. It was a copy of the Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution pamphlet that, in 1999, was discovered by police in the flat of David Copeland,Copsey, Nigel & Worley, Matthew (2017).

Copeland told police he had been trying to spark a \\"racial war.\\" Following the conviction of Copeland for murder on 30 June 2000, after a trial at the Old Bailey, one newspaper wrote of Myatt: \\"This is the man who shaped mind of a bomber; Cycling the lanes around Malvern, the mentor who drove David Copeland to kill [...] Riding a bicycle around his Worcestershire home town sporting a wizard-like beard and quirky dress-sense, the former monk could easily pass as a country eccentric or off-beat intellectual. But behind David Myatt's studious exterior lies a more sinister character that has been at the forefront of extreme right-wing ideology in Britain since the mid-1960s.\\"Sunday Mercury, July 9, 2000 According to the BBC's Panorama, in 1998 when Myatt was leader of the NSM, he called for \\"the creation of racial terror with bombs\\". Myatt is also quoted by Searchlight as having stated that \\"[t]he primary duty of all National Socialists is to change the world. National Socialism means revolution: the overthrow of the existing System and its replacement with a National-Socialist society. Revolution means struggle: it means war. It means certain tactics have to be employed, and a great revolutionary movement organised which is primarily composed of those prepared to fight, prepared to get their hands dirty and perhaps spill some blood\\". Conversion to Islam Myatt converted to Islam in 1998. He told Professor George Michael that his decision to convert began when he took a job on a farm in England. He was working long hours in the fields and felt an affinity with nature, concluding that the sense of harmony he felt had not come about by chance. He told Michael that he was also impressed by the militancy of Islamist groups, and believed that he shared common enemies with Islam, namely \\"the capitalist-consumer West and international finance.\\"Michael, George.

While, initially, some critics - specifically the anti-fascist Searchlight organization - suggested that Myatt's conversion \\"may be just a political ploy to advance his own failing anti-establishment agenda\\", it is now generally accepted that his conversion was genuine.Miller, Rory (2007).

He defines pathei-mathos by saying: \\"The Greek term œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπ ŒºŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ derives from the Agamemnon of Aeschylus (written c. 458 BCE), and can be interpreted, or translated, as meaning learning from adversary, or wisdom arises from (personal) suffering; or personal experience is the genesis of true learning.\\"\\"Pathei-Mathos The Greek term œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπ ŒºŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ derives from The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (written c. 458 BCE), and can be interpreted, or translated, as meaning learning from adversary, or wisdom arises from (personal) suffering; or personal experience is the genesis of true learning. When understood in its Aeschylean context, it implies that for we human beings pathei-mathos possesses a numinous, a living, authority. That is, the understanding that arises from one's own personal experience ‚Äì from formative experiences that involve some hardship, some grief, some personal suffering ‚Äì is often or could be more valuable to us (more alive, more relevant, more meaningful) than any doctrine, than any religious faith, than any words/advice one might hear from someone else or read in some book. Thus, pathei-mathos, like empathy, offers we human beings a certain conscious understanding, a knowing; and, when combined, pathei-mathos and empathy are or can be a guide to wisdom, to a particular conscious knowledge concerning our own nature (our physis), our relation to Nature, and our relation to other human beings, leading to an appreciation of the numinous and an appreciation of virtues such as humility and Œµ·ΩêœÑŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20160228123422/https://perceiverations.wordpress.com/about-2/some- terms-explained/ Pathei-Mathos is thus an aspect of or element in the Numinous Way, although the former term comes to predominate over the latter in Myatt's writings beginning 2012. Myatt writes that \\"the numinous sympathy ‚Äì œÉœÖŒºœÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ± (sympatheia, benignity) ‚Äì with another living being that empathy provides naturally inclines us to treat other living beings as we ourselves would wish to be treated: with fairness, compassion, honour, and dignity. It also inclines us not to judge those whom we do not know; those beyond the purveu ‚Äì beyond the range of ‚Äì our faculty of empathy\\". Myatt links his Numinous Way to Hellenistic philosophy and places it in the Western philosophical tradition. Selected bibliography *Myatt, David (2013). Myngath.

It is a center of services and commerce for the area. Most of the people make their living from fishing and tourism. A ferry called Baldur goes over the Brei√∞afj√∂r√∞ur fjord to the Westfjords. It also is the gateway to Flatey. The origin of Stykkish√≥lmur can be traced to its natural harbor. The location became an important trading post early in Iceland‚Äôs history: the first trading post in Stykkish√≥lmur is traced back to the mid-16th century, even before Denmark implemented the Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Trade Monopoly (1602 ‚Äì 1787). From that time trading has been at the heart of the settlement's history. In 1828 √Årni Thorlacius built a large house for his home and companies, the Norwegian house, which has been renovated and accommodates the local museum.\\"Hit Iceland information page about Iceland\\" Overview The favorable position of the town was discovered early and in 1550 a trading post was founded at the site. Today, the most important sector of employment in the town after the fishing industry is summer-time tourism. The town was named after a small island in front of the harbor called Stykki√∞ (\\"the piece\\"). The nearby mountain of Helgafell is the burial place of Gu√∞r√∫n √ìsv√≠fursd√≥ttir, a heroine of the Icelandic sagas. The town's former library has been restored as a public hall and contains an installation by the American artist Roni Horn. The sports club of Stykkish√≥lmur is called Sn√¶fell, named after the glacier Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull, which is located on Sn√¶fellsnes. The town's most popular sport is basketball.

Chess champion Bobby Fischer was planning on moving to Stykkish√≥lmur before his sudden death in early 2008. Stykkish√≥lmur is the main setting in the short story Tussenlanding (Transfer) from the 1991 short story collection De Matador en andere verhalen by Tim Krabb√©. The story features a Dutchman coming to Iceland in hope to start a relationship with an Icelandic woman he barely knows. The town was the filming location for the depictions of Nuuk, Greenland in the 2013 movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Town festival Every year on the second or third weekend in August, the people in Stykkish√≥lmur celebrate the Danskir dagar (\\"Danish days\\") festival, which honors the town's historic connections with Denmark.

He played for the New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks of the Major League Baseball (MLB). From his debut in 1999 to 2003, Melvin Mora was known as a utility player, playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009. Career New York Mets Mora was signed out of Venezuela in 1991. After spending seven years in the Astros minors system and couple of months in CPBL's Mercuries Tigers, he signed as a free agent with the Mets in 1998 and made his major league debut in the 1999 season. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three outfield positions, shortstop, second base and third. Mora with the New York Mets in 1999 In 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates' Brad Clontz, which propelled the Mets to a one-game playoff with Cincinnati, which they won. Baltimore Orioles =2000-02= Melvin Mora was traded by the Mets to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and Mike Kinkade for shortstop Mike Bordick. Used as a utility player in Baltimore, Mora showed promise and hints of ability to contribute as an everyday player but struggled to break through. Things changed when an injury-depleted Orioles team used Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the American League batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first All-Star selection. Mora's season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 on-base percentage in 96 games. =2003-04= Mora's 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level.

Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the AL batting race to Ichiro Suzuki's .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked 5th in slugging average (.562) and OPS (.981); 6th in runs (111), doubles (41) and times on base (264); 8th in hits (187), and 9th in total bases (264). His 27 home runs and 104 RBI were also career-highs, while leading his team in batting average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging average and OPS. At third base, he improved and became more consistent as the season wore on. Mora finished 18th in American League MVP voting and won a Silver Slugger Award. =2005-07= Melvin Mora, during a break in the action, playing for Baltimore Orioles in 2006. In 2005, Mora once again hit 27 home runs, although his batting average and on-base percentage dropped. On May 19, 2006 Mora agreed to a three-year, $25M deal that included a no-trade clause because Mora did not want to move his family to another city. In 2006, Mora's home run total dropped to 16, and again dropped in 2007 to 14. Mora also saw his batting average fall to .274 for both seasons. =2008= Mora was named American League Player of the Month for August 2008.

Walker was born in East Douglas, Massachusetts, and moved to Detroit in 1838. Rpr. in . He purchased land across the Detroit River, just east of what is Windsor, Ontario, and established a distillery in 1858 in what would become Walkerville, Ontario. Walker began selling his whisky as Hiram Walker's Club Whisky, in containers that were \\"clearly marked\\" and he used a process to make his whisky that was vastly different from all other distillers. It became very popular, angering American distillers, who forced the US government to pass a law requiring that all foreign whiskeys state their country of origin on the label. ‚Äî Rpt from. From this point forward, Hiram Walker's Canadian Club whisky was Canada's top export whisky. He established and maintained the company town that grew around his distillery, exercising planning and control over every facet of the town, from public works to religious services to police and fire control.Essex County Sketches, Essex County Tourist Association, 1947 The Hiram Walker & Sons Distillery remained in the Walker family until 1926 when they sold it to Harry C. Hatch. Canadian Club whisky is still produced at the distillery site Walker founded. The company has gone through several owners and is now part of Pernod Ricard. The Canadian Club brand is owned by Beam Suntory, a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Japan. Early life Hiram Walker was born on July 4, 1816 on a family farm in Douglas, Massachusetts. He was the sixth generation of English immigrants, his father was a reputable schoolmaster. His ancestors can be traced back to Thomas Walker of Boston, who emigrated to America from England. His father died when he was aged 9. Douglas, Massachusetts was a small town, with a population of 1,800, and very few businesses, which include a planing mill, a machine shop, cotton factory and forge. He received a \\"common\\" school education in Boston, and began working as a dry goods clerk. He left for Detroit, Michigan, in 1838, at the age of 22 years. Detroit was a vast change from Boston at the time, as Detroit had a smaller population, where Walker was able to find employment. His first employment in Detroit was as a grocery clerk at a store owned by Augustus Gardner, east of Woodward Avenue. His general tasks were to order, receive, check and price out all the goods in which the company dealt. Through this, he gained knowledge and experience of the business world. At this time, Boston was the major metropolis of New England. Walker, as well as many other youthful New Englanders, were drawn to the opportunity of the Mid-West and beyond, largely due to the expansion and development of the railway. Marriage and family On October 5, 1846, at age thirty, Walker married Mary Abigail Williams. Mary Williams and Hiram Walker had 7 children, 5 boys and 2 girls, but one of the girls died at age 13. His wife was the daughter of Ephraim Smith Williams and Hannah Melissa Gotee of Silver Lake, Michigan. Mary Abigail, like Walker, was the descendant of new England pioneers, whose familial roots traced back to Massachusetts in 1638. On her mother's side, Mary Abigail was the descendant of French merchants. He had two daughters, Julia Elizabeth and Jennie Melissa, and five sons, Willis Ephraim, Edward Chandler, Franklin Hiram, Alfred (infant), and James Harrington. Edward Chandler, his second son, commissioned the development of Willistead Manor.  Adult life  Throughout his life, Walker remained an American citizen. For a period of five years from 1859 until 1864, he lived in Windsor in a residence named the \\"Cottage\\" on land that was part of the Labadie holdings which Walker originally purchased. The \\"Cottage\\", a large home for the period, had a third story as well as a large verandah. Hiram Walker, from a picture located in the archives of Hiram Walker and Sons Business history Early years Canadian Club whisky, originally made by Hiram Walker & Sons, today a property of Beam Suntory Walker was not new to the world of business. Since his migration to Detroit he had been involved in several different projects. In his earlier days he worked as a grocery clerk from 1838 until 1845 for several different employers. Eventually, after being involved in the grocery business for several years, he took it upon himself to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned to the grocery business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848. Walker was well- regarded as a proficient businessman, noted for his involvement in a wide range of different businesses and industries. Some associate his success with his ability to dabble in multiple business opportunities as well as jump quickly on prospective businesses. This can be seen, for example, during his grocery business between 1849 and 1858 when Walker had the idea to produce his own vinegar. His beginnings in the distillery business have been traced to January 1849, where an advertisement in a Detroit newspaper publicized Walker's \\"barrels of cider vinegar\\" and \\"wheat whisky\\". It was advertised for 10 cents per gallon. Through this business, he began to distill his own vinegar, which became popular in the area because of its consistency, low price, and high quality. He then sold it at his grocery store, to other grocers as well as across the River in Windsor via door-to-door sales. Thus, the vinegar factory became another successful business venture for Walker which, after years of success in Detroit, he sold in 1858. It is true that it was the manufacturing of vinegar led to Walker's eventual shift to the manufacturing of whisky. However, he had been selling alcohol since 1849 and continued to at the time he actually began to distill. He also was involved in the grain business, through serving as a supplier to the local flour mills in the Detroit area. Development of Walker‚Äôs distillery Through his work in the grocery business, as well as his cider and wheat sales, he had nearly $40,000 saved, which he then used to purchase additional space in Detroit and inexpensive land across the Detroit River, in what is now Windsor, Ontario, in order to expand his business. He did have interest in distilling his own liquor, but at the time, there were strict prohibition laws which prevented him from doing so. Walker distilled his first barrel of whisky in 1854, despite the instability of prohibition laws. After 5 years of distilling in Detroit he ended that particular business there. Walker was considered one of the largest landowners in Ontario, and over his entire lifetime, his land possessions measured around 10,000 acre, most of which along the Walkerville and Detroit River Railroad The location of Walker's property, on what was originally considered part of the Labdie farm,Detroit Journal, 1890. was extremely valuable because the Great Western Railway was in close proximity and enabled Walker to move products from his distillery and cattle yards. Whisky makers before Walker ran spirits and whisky through charcoal, until around 1855, but Walker's method of utilizing a barrel to \\"create colour\\" and a pleasing flavour was unprecedented. A huge demand for Walker's whisky and flour originated through the Civil War. It was at this time, that smuggling became common via the Detroit River. There is a legend that Walker built a \\"liquor pipeline\\" under the Detroit River for smuggling purposes. Being an entrepreneur, Walker looked at every single business venture possible to be able to expand his business. Since Detroit was only a boat-ride across the river to Windsor, Canada, Walker began to weigh his options in expanding into foreign territory. Canada had much to offer entrepreneurs and business risktakers. The population was increasing gradually, communications were advancing, and real estate was cheaper compared to that from across the river. Labour and materials also cost less in Canada than it did in the States. Walker looked into expanding over to Canada. Also with the expansion of America through the Great Western Railroad, trade opportunities opened up for businessmen like Walker. Walker ventured into Canada across the border from Detroit into what is currently known as Essex County. At this time, the population in this area was considerably smaller than that of Detroit merely consisting of small village settlements under the Township of Sandwich such as the villages of Windsor and Sandwich. Most of the land in this area was vast farm land. In 1856, he bought his first piece of land from the Labadie family through grandson Eugene Hall for ¬£300. This transaction took place on December 22, 1856 using the British currency system that Canada was still employing at the time. A month later on January 24, 1857 he decided to acquire another 300 acres of land for which he paid ¬£750. Also on this day, he purchased yet another 104 acres for ¬£250. The remainder of 1857 involved building on much of this land and Walker, still a resident of Detroit, often crossed the border to oversee the construction being done. His plan was to open a steam-powered flour mill, which did not exist in the area, and a distillery, in which he had very little serious competition. He also had his hands in the agricultural industry with owning cattle and hogs, as well as farming. In 1857, Walker bought more property near the farm he already owned, increasing his holdings to 468 acres. He began construction of the flour mill and distillery in the same year, which he visited every day during construction even though he still resided in America. He continued his grocery business in the meantime, helping him become the leading commission merchant in Detroit. The year 1858 marked the completion of the flour mill and distillery that Walker was building in Canada and at this time business could begin. During this time he still maintained his very successful grain business in the United States. The flour that would be produced in his flour mill would prove to be popular not only in Canada but also in the United States and Britain. His introduction of a large steam flouring mill benefited the County of Essex's farming community, which at this time made up most of the population, by encouraging farming practices. Wheat farmers from all around would go and use the flour mill as it gained in popularity. The distillery was also becoming quite popular with the locals at this time. Mid-summer 1858 marked the opening of Walker's whisky operation. The same process which he had used in Detroit was now used in Windsor to distill his alcohol. Spirits were leached through charcoal, a process widely used at the time. His Canadian industries quickly took precedence over that of his grain business still located in Detroit. It was because of this that Walker found himself traveling by ferry to Canada from his home in Detroit on a daily basis. This trip was a lengthy process as the ferry that brought him to Canada dropped him off in Windsor, which left a long ride via horse and buggy to his flour mill and distillery. At this time in March 1859, Walker moved to Canada in order to save time traveling to and from his Canadian businesses. He moved out of the home he had been in since 1851 and into a house located near the flour mill, which he altered and called \\"The Cottage\\". The Cottage was a home that previously had been owned by the Labadie family, from whom Walker had purchased much of the land on which his industries were now located. This framed house was built in 1839 and resembled the French style of residences prevalent in the area. Walker made several modifications to the home including two large additions at each end of the home, the addition of a third floor as well as servants dwellings. In the few years that Walker lived in Canada he remained at The Cottage. The new Canadian business helped spur other ventures for Walker. He tried hog farming for a while, until cholera broke out, when he switched to cattle farming instead. In 1859, Walker hired John McBride, one of his workers from Detroit, to be his traveling salesman. His job was to solicit orders from vendors who might be interested in purchasing the product. Taken from Walker & Sons Ltd. Archive The year of 1860 saw some of the highest production because both his mill and distillery were running almost non-stop. 1861 and 1862 marked the first years of paying back many expenses and seeing the beginning of profits. Operations became larger and more continuous as farmers, salesmen, and office staff would find themselves very busy. In 1863, Walker made McBride his partner, changing the name of the business to Hiram Walker and Company. A massive source of profits for Hiram Walker was actually the Civil War in the United States. The U.S dollar plummeted during this time, and Americans turned to smuggling in Canadian beverages. It is reported that Hiram Walker and Company loaded jug after jug of whiskey onto American ferries, carrying them across the Detroit River, leading to Walker making massive profits. Jealous competitors constructed a story of Walker creating a lead pipe that led right from the distillery, under the Detroit River, and into Detroit. By 1863, Walker had named James Ellis in charge of his mill, William McManus as his distiller, and John McBride in charge of managing. While a majority of his business did take place on the Canadian side of the border, he did prefer to live in Detroit. In 1863, he bought a home within Detroit. Walker also attempted to construct and run a vinegar factory in 1864, but was unsuccessful and closed down two years later due to his other commitments. Up until 1865, Walker's distillery was the only one to exist in Essex County, however, Walker found himself with competition with Rolph and Melchers. During this time, Walker's partner McBride was anxious to move up the chain within the company. Two years later, John McBride and two of his friends bought Rolph and Melchers. After discovering what McBride had done, his employment was terminated and Walker lost his business partner. Ironically, McBride and his partners would end up having to sell their property to Walker because they were going out of business and it was operated by Hiram Walker as a second plant until 1876. John McBride would go on to become a tax collector and grocery store owner in Detroit. Involvement with Detroit newspapers Walker became heavily involved with Detroit newspapers during the mid-1860s and 1870s. He bought $10,000 worth of stock in the newspaper known as the Advertiser and Tribune. Their largest competitor of the time was the Daily Post, which proved to be a fierce rival. Walker constantly put forth suggestions of a merger, but his requests were constantly denied. By 1872, Walker purchased another $10,000 in shares, becoming the primary shareholder in the newspaper. The following year, the senior editor of the Advertiser and Tribune had resigned, and Walker immediately bought the stock he had in the company. J.E. Scripps, the former senior editor of the Advertiser and Tribune, soon opened his own newspaper, the Evening News. This divided the competition even further. In 1877, the Advertiser and Tribune merged with the Daily Post under the name the Post and Tribune, as Walker had wanted. Two years later, a fire burned down the offices of the newspaper and Walker was estimated to have lost $30,000. Walker lost interest in the newspaper business soon after and sold the Post and Tribune to James McMillan. Walkerville Distillery buildings in Walkerville (now part of Windsor, Ontario) c. 1910 Walker started his milling and distilling business in the town of Sandwich, near Windsor, Ontario. Farmers and other people who worked in Windsor aided Walker with his distilling business. The economic growth that encapsulated the Township of Sandwich started with Walker transforming his property (Labadie Farm) into one with new industrial buildings. These buildings, like the \\"Walker Mill\\" and the \\"Walker Pens\\" were places people living in the area could bring their wheat and pigs, creating a connection between Walker and his community. Eventually, the name for the section where Walker and his business peaked was called \\"Walkerton\\" but there was already a town in the province of Ontario with that name, so Walker and the other citizens settled with \\"Walkerville\\" but often referred to it as \\"Walkers Town\\". With the growth of the distillery and the flour mill, Walker expanded the business in many ways. He began to build Walker Road in 1860, and hire many employees, such as salesmen, office workers or skilled trade workers. With this developed an increase in population in the area, especially in respects to it being centralized around the mill and distillery. On March 1, 1869, Walker‚Äôs Town established its first post office. This is when the government recognized the small hamlet as the name it is known by today, Walkerville. Walker is recognized as the man who gave momentum to such aspects that benefited the community like trading, agricultural work, stock raising, building industries, and most importantly, inspired those who surrounded his perseverance and progressive attitudes. Walker build homes for his employees and rented them out at reasonable prices, and also created public utilities, paved the streets, and paid for and encouraged people to get an education. One of the most popular institutions Walker erected was a Methodist church in 1870. It was converted into an Anglican church in 1874, and renamed St. Mary‚Äôs, in honour of Walker‚Äôs late wife, Mary. As mentioned, the heart of Walkerville was Walker‚Äôs distilling business, \\"Hiram Walker and Sons\\" which was established in 1858. Walker‚Äôs business created an expansion of the town that included, malt houses, cooperage, copper shop, planning mill, lumber yard, brick yard, and a ferry between Walkerville and Detroit. The trip from his house in Detroit to his businesses in Walkerville took approximately an hour and a half. Due to this, Walker decided to invest in a ferry that would travel between Detroit and Walkerville as to save time and be of assistance to the public. In 1880 he finally decided to rent a ferry that would travel from Detroit and Walkerville. The ferry he would lease was called \\"The Essex\\" which was a steam ship built in, 1858 in Walkerville. He installed a dock system on his land in Walkerville that would allow people to board the ferry. in its beginnings the ferry was not very useful for the people of Walkerville as it mainly served as a personal transportation service for Walker himself. It did not follow a set schedule and did not make very many trips on any given day. However, in the following year of 1881, a set schedule was developed and the ferry as a public service began. It was also during this year that another ferry, called \\"Ariel\\", replaced \\"The Essex\\" due to the termination of the lease. Furthermore, with the construction of a railway by the Essex and Detroit Railway Company, which ran through Walkerville until Kingsville, encouraged many businesses to move from Windsor to the Township of Walkerville because of transportation opportunities. The amount of new industries and people in Walkerville because of these transportation opportunities led to the creation of good roads that could sustain heavy traffic, traffic lights, police and fire fighters, proper sanitary measures. All of these necessities for a town to properly function could not be afforded by the rural municipality of Sandwich East (what Walkerville was called before its official name) so Hiram Walker and Son‚Äôs funded everything. Walker paid for the following: water, 52 fire fighters, the fire appliances, two police officers that rotated shifts, repairs of streets and sidewalks, the night watch service, and the electric lighting of the streets, the Music Hall, the Anglican Church, and some privately owned houses. Walker‚Äôs efforts to make Walkerville a legitimate town, no weaker than any other, led to his title as Walkerville‚Äôs mayor. Walker created a town counsel that included, the mayor (Walker), councilors, clerks, treasurers, medical health officers, collectors, assessors, auditors, solicitors, and the chief of police and policeman. The town counsel‚Äôs first meeting was held May 12, 1890 in a building near Walker Road, owned by Walker and Sons. The first major act done by the Walkerville‚Äôs counsel was to create an event honouring the efforts of the creator of Walkerville (Walker) that would fall on his birthday, July 4. A bronze emblem was created by New York's Tiffany and Co. that displays three Cossack foragers on horseback returning from an expedition, with an inscription that reads, \\"Presented to Hiram Walker, on the 74th anniversary of his birthday, by his friends in the County of Essex, a token of respect and gratitude for Hiram‚Äôs efforts with the creation of the Town of Walkerville.\\" The Walkerville community received a large reward in 1890. Through heavy petitioning, especially from that of the Walker family, the community became an incorporated town. This released the burden of paying for many services from the Walker company. The City of Windsor was developing around this time, and by Walkerville becoming incorporated, it also helped the town ward off annexation with Windsor. Walkerville became a town on April 7, 1890. In honour of the incorporation and in gratitude to its founder, Walker received a bronze statue made by Tiffany‚Äôs. The ceremony took place on Walker‚Äôs birthday, July 4, which was declared by town council to be a public holiday. One of Walkerville‚Äôs great concerns was to be annexed with Windsor. The town tried and tried, yet eventually efforts failed and the two communities amalgamated, with Walkerville becoming a neighbourhood near East Windsor. Although Walkerville is a neighbourhood within the larger city limits, it still holds distinct historical significance. The Pregnant-Cow Case Walker was also a cattle breeder and was party to a famous contracts case, Sherwood v. Walker, known as \\"The Pregnant-Cow Case\\". (33 N.W. 919 (Mich. 1887).) According to the majority opinion, Walker agreed with Theodore Sherwood, a banker, to sell him a cow of distinguished ancestry known as \\"Rose 2d of Aberlone\\". The price was $80, both parties believing Rose to be sterile. When Walker discovered that she was pregnant and worth between $750 and $1,000, he refused to deliver her. Sherwood sued and prevailed in the trial court, but lost on appeal. This case illustrates the contract law rules of rescission of contract by mutual mistake. Because both parties believed they were contracting for a sterile cow, there was a mutual mistake of fact, and therefore ground for rescission. However, the dissent in the case, written by Justice Sherwood, notes that Sherwood believed that Rose \\"might be made to breed\\" and purchased her on that chance. Philanthropy Walker was a charitable man and donated his money throughout Detroit and the Windsor/Walkerville area. Walker spent 25 years in the church of St. Paul‚Äôs in Detroit as a vestryman. As a member of the church, he is often remembered for having donated large amounts of money to the parish community and refused to be recognized in any way. He never took any public position within the church, but continued to be the prominent fundraiser in the church for any task the community was trying to accomplish. Walker enjoyed his work within the church, and saw the community as a place that could do a lot of good work. During his time there, he met and befriended all kinds of influential people including other businessmen, doctors, and even judges. In 1874, he donated approximately $5000 worth of bread to families in Walkerville, Windsor, and Detroit. In 1887, Walker made a financial gift to found Children's Hospital of Michigan, part of the Detroit Medical Center. He donated nearly $125,000 to the Children's Free Hospital Association, and undertook the responsibility of constructing a suitable building for the Children's Hospital of Michigan. In Walker's will of 1896, he donated seven eighths of all his Detroit property \\"of which he might be possessed at the time of his death\\" to Children's Hospital of Michigan, and the remaining one eighth to Harper Hospital. Walker built a railway costing him $20,000 because of weak transportation in the South, which had to be approved by the Detroit River Railway Company that eventually led to the laying of the railways steel in 1888. The railway extended from Walkerville, to South Harrow, to the outskirts of Kingsville. The railway had a distance of 27 miles and on April 6, 1888, the Government of Canada granted a subsidy of $118,400, beginning the construction of the railway. The expansion of this railway led to Hiram Walker and Sons business and other businesses being able to branch out as far as Ruthven, further expanding the success of Walker‚Äôs distilling company. He also contributed money towards the founding of the Detroit Art Museum.  Death  Hiram Walker's Grave, Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan Walker had fallen ill many times since 1883. Due to his illness, he spent a lot of time at home, and on the water in Lake Erie. A popular spot in which he journeyed to often was an island he owned known as the Ile Aux Peche, which he sold to his daughter. He lost feeling in his right leg around 1890 due to his rheumatism and walked with a cane. In 1895, he suffered a severe paralytic stroke and lost the feeling in his legs two years later. From April 1898 until his death, he suffered two cases of Congestive Apoplexy. His second attack was on January 10, 1899. Walker died two days later in Detroit, Michigan, January 12, 1899. He is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. His direct descendants are of the Julia Elizabeth (Walker) Buhl, Franklin MacFie Walker and Elizabeth Talman (Walker) Paterson families. The news of the death of Walker took a large toll on the town. Flags were lowered, and mayor Robert Kerr made a public statement. Walker‚Äôs casket remained in his residence in Detroit until the funeral took place. The Detroit News reported that family, friends and fellow co-workers visited for hours prior to the funeral service on January 14, 1899. The casket made entirely of metal, but covered with black and massive floral decorations, which was incredibly rare for the time. The flowers were donated by Hiram Walker & Sons, along with the Children's Free Hospital.  See also  * Gooderham and Worts Distillery * Canadian Club *Sherwood v.

Born into the Zhejiang Xingye Bank family, Jiang was the chief physician of the 301 Hospital in Beijing and a senior member of the Communist Party of China. Education  Jiang attended Yenching University. He chose a career in medicine after seeing an aunt die of tuberculosis. In 1952, he entered Peking Union Medical College.  Career  Jiang joined the People's Liberation Army in 1954 and was assigned to the 301 Hospital (PLA General Hospital) in Beijing. In 1987, Jiang was named the hospital's chief surgeon. He held the military rank of Major General. In June 1989, Jiang witnessed the results of the trauma inflicted on the students during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. While the SARS virus began spreading in China in late 2002 and early 2003, the number of cases being reported in mainland China was drastically understated by the government. On April 4, 2003, Jiang emailed an 800-word letter to Chinese Central Television -4 (CCTV4) and Phoenix TV (Hong Kong) reporting that fact. Although neither of the two replied or published his letter, the information was leaked to the Western news organizations. On April 8, 2003, Jiang was reached by a journalist from The Wall Street Journal through telephone interview. Later the same day, Susan Jakes, a Time journalist in Beijing also contacted Jiang. Time published the striking news right away with the title of \\"Beijing's SARS Attack\\". In this article, Jiang's letter was translated into English and, for the first time, the public was made aware of the actual situation in China. This letter forced the resignation of the Mayor of Beijing and the Minister of Public Health on April 21, 2003. The Chinese government began to actively deal with the growing epidemic. Most public health experts believe that this act prevented the disease from reaching pandemic proportions. In February 2004, Jiang wrote an open letter to Premier Wen Jiabao, several vice premiers, the Politburo members and many other members of the Chinese government. The letter asked for a re-examination of the responsibility borne by the Chinese government for the Tiananmen Square Massacre. A number of media sources indicate that because of Jiang Yanyong's senior rank the topic of what to do with him was discussed by the Politburo. On June 2, 2004, two days before the 15th anniversary of the massacre, Jiang Yanyong's family in California reported that he and his wife were missing from their house in Beijing after being arrested and placed under military custody. He was released on July 19, 2004. In March 2019, he wrote to Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping calling the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square a crime. Jiang's friends then reported that they lost contact with him and believed he was under house arrest. In February 2020 it was reported that he \\"has been placed under de facto house arrest since last year\\".

The Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) was formed in 1996 and are a part of the 52nd Squadron of the IAF. The team has since performed numerous demonstrations usually with nine aircraft. The squadron was composed of the HAL HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 military trainer aircraft till 2011 and were based at the Bidar Air Force Station in Karnataka. The team was suspended in February 2011 and was re-established with Hawk Mk-132 aircraft in 2017. History Formation aerobatics is not new to the IAF. As early as 1944, the IAF had a display flight and later a few ad hoc teams carried out aerobatic displays on special occasions such as the Air Force Day parade and firepower demonstrations. During the golden jubilee year of the IAF in 1982, handpicked fighter pilots from various squadrons formed an aerobatic team for the IAF called 'The Thunderbolts'. Flying blue and white Hunter fighter bomber, this team captivated audiences for about a decade and it gave its last public display in 1989. The experience gained from the Thunderbolts was put to good use by a four-aircraft team called the Formation Aerobatic Team, set up in Bidar in 1990 on Kiran-II trainers. Though the team did not give any public displays, it ensured that formation aerobatic skills were maintained in the IAF. In early 1996, serious planning began for AVIA-96, the first major air show and aviation trade event ever hosted in India. The organisers' initial intention was to invite an aerobatic team from overseas, but some senior IAF officers were confident that the world's fourth largest air force would be able to field its own team. This formed the genesis of the present team, the Surya Kiran, meaning rays of the sun. In May 1996, Wg Cdr Kuldeep Malik, who as a Flight Lieutenant had been a member of the 'Thunderbolts', and who was then serving as an instructor at the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, was moved to Bidar, with instructions to raise a new aerobatic team. The pioneer team comprised Wg Cdr Kuldeep Malik (Team Leader) Sqn Ldr A K Murgai, Sqn Ldr V K Khorana, Sqn Ldr S Prabhakaran, Sqn Ldr A R Gore, Sqn Ldr R K Obheroi, Sqn Ldr N Kanitkar, Sqn Ldr P K Vohra, Flt Lt T. Sharma, Flt Lt K Prem Kumar and Flt Lt K.K. Dubey. The Surya Kiran Formation Aerobatic Team (SKAT) flew its first 6 aircraft formation sortie on 27 May 96 at AF Stn Bidar. During these early months the team flew overtime, graduating from aerobatics in four-aircraft box formation to six-aircraft in shockwave formation. The first six-aircraft formation took wings on 8 August 1996. There were two manoeuvres which the team finally managed to get through with a little bit of trouble. The first was the Goblet roll and the other the Tango roll ‚Äì the latter incidentally was a historic first for the IAF because even the famed Thunderbolts did not do this manoeuvre. Soon the SKAT was tasked to carry out their first public display ‚Äì a flawless six-aircraft display for the golden jubilee celebrations of Air Force Administrative College, Coimbatore. on 15 September 1996, that was highly appreciated by all those who witnessed it. In 1998, with Wg Cdr A K Murgai as the CO, the team expanded to a nine- aircraft formation. Considering the team was just two years old, it was no small achievement. The team first displayed a formation of nine-aircraft during the Independence Day fly past over the Red Fort in 1998. The first full-fledged nine-aircraft aerobatic display was to follow at Palam on 8 October 1998, to mark Air Force Day. In November 1999, the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows aerobatic team was transiting through India en route to Australia. The Surya Kiran team was at Hindon to interact with them and a lucky few managed a sortie in the Hawk. Three months later the French aerobatic team ‚ÄòPatrouille de France‚Äô was at Pune and the two teams met and flew some sorties in the Alpha jet. An interaction between the two teams resulted in the SKAT adopting the \\"Synchro\\" manoeuvre. This raised their standard a couple of notches and added more colour to its displays. The first synchro sequence was displayed during the Combined Graduation Parade at Air Force Academy in June 2000. The team has carried out over 500 displays in 72 cities across the country, from Srinagar in the north to Tiruvananthapuram in the south and from Naliya, the western-most air station, to Chabua, the country's easternmost airfield. Srinagar, at an altitude of 5436 feet is the highest airfield from which it has operated, when it performed over Dal Lake in July 2003. Flying over sea is the toughest as the vast, flat expanse of water affects depth perception. It has also performed in the capitals of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Singapore. On completion of a decade of precision formation aerobatics, the Surya Kiran, the youngest nine-aircraft aerobatic team in the world, was conferred with Squadron status. With effect from 1 May 2006, the team became IAF's No. 52 Squadron. After the performance in Bengaluru in February 2011, the Surya Kirans were grounded because the Air Force faced a severe shortage of training aircraft. In Feb 2015, the Surya Kirans were resurrected as a four ac team with the induction of the British Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer, being assembled in India by the state-run HAL. The team has performed a number of public displays including three presidential events. The team is now gearing up to perform its maiden six ac display in 16 October.http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/surya-kiran-aerobatic-squadron-of-air- force-to-return-to-dare-devilry-739895 Aircraft Closeup of a Surya Kiran HAL Kiran aircraft on the Tarmac at Bangalore during Aero India-2007. Wing mounted drop tanks are seen in the photo which contains colour dye, this dye is injected in the exhaust when the aircraft is made to leave colour or smoke Surya Kiran operated 16 HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft. The \\"day-glo orange\\" and white colour scheme painted Kiran MK II is used by the IAF to train its fighter pilots in basic fighter manoeuvres and weapon delivery. It was designed by Dr. Gadge, the then chief designer of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd in 1960 and produced at HAL Bangalore. This ac weighs about five tons and is powered by an Orpheus engine that generates a thrust of 1906 kg, helping the aircraft to achieve a maximum speed of 780 km/h or 0.7 Mach. The Kiran MK II can also be deployed in counter insurgency operations armed with integral guns, 250 kg bombs and 68 mm rockets. A particular difficulty faced by the team was the side-by-side seating arrangement in the Kiran cockpits.Suryakiran page on Bharat Rakshak The members flying to the left of the leader have to fly from the right seat, whereas the left seat is the master seat. Therefore, some aircraft have been modified to fly solo from the right seat. In unmodified aircraft, the pilot flying on the left of the leader has to fly in two pilot configuration. The two inboard drop tanks of Surya Kiran Kiran Mk 2 aircraft have been modified to carry color dye for generating smoke. Diesel is used for generating white smoke and colored dye is mixed with diesel to generate colored smoke. Because of the smoke modification, only the two outboard drop tanks can be used to carry fuel, which gives Surya Kiran aircraft a maximum range of 280 km. For displays, Suryakiran aircraft fly only with two inboard drop tanks, which carry dye for smoke generation. The team has formed up again with 4 Hawk aircraft, with a new paint scheme. In October 2015, the Defense Ministry concluded negotiations between HAL and BAE Systems for the purchase of twenty BAE Systems Hawk Mk.132 aircraft for the Surya Kiran which will be dedicated to the aerobatics display role and fitted with smoke canisters. Organization The AOC of AFS Bidar serves as the guardian for the Squadron when it is at base or touring. Personnel The team had a total of 13 pilots of whom only 9 are flying at any given time. Pilots are selected twice a year for a three-year tour of duty. Only Fighter aircraft qualified pilots are selected. All pilots in the team are Qualified flying instructors (QFI's) with about 2,000 hours of fighter flying experience and 1,000 hours on the Kiran aircraft. The Team is headed by a Commanding Officer who is also the leader of the formation during display sorties. The Team Leader has the opportunity of selecting his future team pilots after subjecting them to grueling flight trials and tests. Besides the pilots, the team had a Flight Commander, an Administrator and qualified Technical Officers. The Flight Commander is in charge of operational planning. The Administrator, apart from looking after administrative requirements of the Team, also provides the commentary during public displays. The Senior Engineering Officer (the SEO or 'Spanner'), along with fifty technicians, has the task of maintaining and servicing the Team's aircraft. In all technical aspects, the decision of the Senior Engineering Officer is the final word. Aerobatics Pilots from the Bidar Air Force base, the second biggest Indian air force training centre in the country, flew in formations of three, six and nine aircraft. The Kiran MKII plane, modified for aerobatic display, was used to create parallel and horizontal flight designs, releasing colours of the Indian flag using aerosols, and popular patterns like the heart and arrow, the water spring and the apple. The duration of the display routine varies from about ten to twenty minutes depending upon the location of the display site. The first half of the routine includes turns, wingovers, loops and barrel rolls in various nine aircraft formations. During the second half, the formation splits into two groups to carry out a variety of manoeuvres like splits, level and rolling crosses, inverted runs, the heart loop etc. Performance On an average, the team performs over 30 shows a year, and flies three sorties a day during the training season and two a day whilst on aerobatics display. The nine aircraft take off in groups of three and join up in close formation, maneuvering between speeds of 150 to 650 km/h with their wing tips less than 5 metres apart. The maneuvers subject the pilots to alternating g-forces between +6 to ‚Äì1.5.Indian Air Force webpage for the Surya Kirans Surya Kiran Aerobatics Team at Aero India 2011 The team has performed at all Aero India shows until 2011, as well as during the International Fleet Review in Mumbai in February 2001. The team, under the leadership of Wing Commander Amit Tiwari, performed abroad for the first time in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to mark the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of the Sri Lankan Air Force. In February 2004, Suryakiran led by Wing Commander S Prabahkaran performed at the Asian Aerospace-2004 air show in Singapore. The Team, under the command of Wing Commander S Bansal, made its debut in Malaysia in December 2007 at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA) 2007 from 4 to 8 December, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Malaysia's Independence. Whilst in Malaysia, the team also displayed at Subang airfield of Kuala Lumpur on 29 Nov 07. In December, 2007, the team in coordination with the Royal Thai Air Force conducted a nine-aircraft Aerobatic display to commemorate the 80th Birth Anniversary of His Majesty the King of Thailand. In November 2008, the team was invited to participate in the Zhuhai Airshow, China where Suryakiran were the only foreign participants in this airshow. On the return from China, the team displayed in Laos as well. Accidents A Surya Kiran aircraft crashed while practicing on 18 March 2006 near Air Force Station, Bidar during a training sortie. Two team pilots, Wing Commander Dheeraj Bhatia and Squadron Leader Shailender Singh, were injured fatally. A young Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot had a lucky escape on 23 December 2007 when a HJT-16 Kiran, a military trainer aircraft of Surya Kiran, aerobatics demonstration team, crash-landed inside the Biju Patnaik Airport.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/IAF-aircraft-crash- lands-pilot-jumps-out/article14900115.ece Another crash of Surya Kiran aircraft happened on 21 January 2009 when Wing Commander R.S. Dhaliwal VM (35) of the Indian Air Force was fatally injured when his aircraft crashed in an open field at Bellura village close to the Air Force Station, Bidar at 8:45 am on a routine practice sortie. $. Two Surya Kiran aircraft crashed at 11:54 AM, 19 February 2019 in Bangalore while practicing for Aero India 2019. Two pilots ejected safely and the third pilot Wing Cdr Sahil Gandhi succumbed to his injuries and later died in the hospital.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-aircraft-of-surya- kiran-aerobatics-team-crash-in-bengaluru/articleshow/68059933.cms Gallery Image:Suryakiran.jpg Image:Surya kiran5 IAF.jpg Image:Surya kiran6 IAF.jpg File:IAF's Suryakiran Taxies into position for take off at Aero India 2011.jpg File:Surya Kiran - Aero India (12715190324).jpg File:Glimpse of the Air Force Day Parade, at Air Force Station Hindan, in Ghaziabad on October 08, 2018 (7).JPGSurya Kiran Team on Air Force Day Parade, at Hindon Air Force Station on 8 October 2018 See also * Sarang * Sagar Pawan * List of aerobatic teams References External links * The Indian Armed Forces, Surya Kiran page * The Ed Steenhoek list of Military Aerobatic Teams, Surya Kiran page * Bharat-rakshak.com, Surya Kiran page News Flying colours of courage $ Images * Suryakiran at Aero India 2007 * Synchro-cross * IAF picture gallery * IAF Surya Kiran * Image in Samachar India * SKAT duo - image form KenSekhon.ca gallery * SKAT show at Airshow 2011 Videos * Video from Google videos * Video from Youtube.com Indian Air Force Aerobatic teams ","title":"Surya Kiran"},{"id":"701619","text":"Hapag-Lloyd Express (previously also marketed as HLX.com) was a no-frills, high-frequency, express airline based in Langenhagen, Germany.

History Founded in the eleventh century, the earliest records (1080‚Äì1082) include the name Sancte Marie Ecclesia, Latin for \\"Church of St. Mary\\", while a later document written in Norman-French (1317) mentions Saincte Mariglise. The current French form of the name is ambiguous, with the additional meaning, \\"Holy Mother Church\\". The town was significantly involved in the Hundred Years' War as well as the Wars of Religion. The town's main claim to fame is that it played a significant part in the World War II Normandy landings because this village stood right in the middle of route N13, which the Germans would have most likely used on any significant counterattack on the troops landing on Utah and Omaha Beaches. In the early morning of 6 June 1944 mixed units of the U.S. 82nd Airborne and U.S. 101st Airborne Divisions occupied the town in Mission Boston, giving it the claim to be one of the first towns liberated in the invasion. D-Day battle The early landings, at about 01:40 directly on the town, resulted in heavy casualties for the paratroopers. Some buildings in town were on fire that night, and they illuminated the sky, making easy targets of the descending men. Some were sucked into the fire. Many hanging from trees and utility poles were shot before they could cut loose. A well-known incident involved paratrooper John Steele of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), whose parachute caught on the spire of the town church, and could only observe the fighting going on below. He hung there limply for two hours, pretending to be dead, before the Germans took him prisoner. Steele later escaped from the Germans and rejoined his division when US troops of the 3rd Battalion, 505 Parachute Infantry Regiment attacked the village, capturing thirty Germans and killing another eleven. The incident was portrayed in the movie The Longest Day by actor Red Buttons. The village in 1944 Later that morning, about 0500, a force led by Lt. Colonel Edward C. Krause of the 505th PIR took the town with little resistance. Apparently the German garrison was confused and had retired for the rest of the night. However, heavy German counterattacks began later in the day and into the next. The lightly armed troops held the town until reinforced by tanks from nearby Utah Beach in the afternoon of 7June. Krause and Lt. Colonel Benjamin H. Vandervoort both received the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions in the capture of the town. Sgt. George Bowler Tullidge III received the Bronze Star, while a collection of Bible verses and of his letters home, A Paratrooper's Faith was distributed throughout the 82nd Airborne by his parents from after his death until the 1990s. 2nd Lt. Thomas J. Tighe of the 70th Tank Battalion received the Silver Star posthumously for his actions on the morning of June 7 in securing the town, during which he was killed when his tank was hit by German artillery fire.Armor in Operation Neptune (Establishment of the Normandy Beachhead), a research report prepared by Committee 10, Officers Advanced Course, the Armored School, Fort Knox, Kentucky, May 1949, page 34 Henry Langrehr was also involved in the capture of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise.

B. Pastine\\" () , is the secondary international airport of Rome, the capital of Italy, after Rome-Fiumicino Airport \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\". It is a joint civilian, commercial and military airport situated south southeast of central Rome, just outside the Greater Ring Road (Italian: Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA) the circular motorway around the city. The airport is an important hub for many low-cost carriers and general aviation traffic. It also hosts a military airport and the headquarters of the 31¬∫ Stormo and the 2nd Reparto Genio of the Italian Air Force. The airport is named after Giovan Battista Pastine, an Italian airship pilot who served in World War I. History Norge airship taking off from Ciampino Airport First helicopter flight in Ciampino Ciampino Airport was opened in 1916http://www.adr.it/web/aeroporti-di-roma-en-/azn-history and is one of the oldest airports still in operation. From here, on 10 April 1926, Umberto Nobile took off on the airship Norge, the first aircraft to reach the North Pole and the first to fly across the polar ice cap from Europe to America. In October 1930, the first helicopter prototype designed by Corradino D'Ascanio was tested at Ciampino Airport, reaching a record altitude of 18 m, 8m45s duration and 1,078 m distance flown. During World War II, the airport was captured by Allied forces in June 1944, and afterward became a United States Army Air Forces military airfield. Although primarily used as a transport base by C-47 Skytrain aircraft of the 64th Troop Carrier Group, the Twelfth Air Force 86th Bombardment Group flew A-36 Apache combat aircraft from the airport during the immediate period after its capture from German forces. When the combat units moved out, Air Transport Command used the airport as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel for the remainder of the war.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . It was Rome's main airport until 1960, with traffic amounting to over 2 million passengers per year. After the opening of Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport, Ciampino handled almost exclusively charter and executive flights for more than three decades. However, the terminal facilities were extended at the beginning of 2007 to accommodate the growing number of low-cost carrier operations. Facilities Passenger terminal The airport features a single, one- story passenger terminal building containing the departures and arrivals facilities. The departures area consists of a main hall with some stores and service facilities as well as 31 check-in counters and 16 departure gates using walk or bus boarding as there are no jet-bridges. The arrivals area has a separate entrance and features four baggage belts as well as some more service counters. Arrival and departure terminal are both closed from 0:00 AM until 4:00 AM and the passengers must leave the terminals. There are no facilities outside the terminals for passengers during these hours. Other usage The airport hosts a fleet of Bombardier 415 aerial firefighting aircraft. It is also used by express logistics companies such as DHL, by official flights of the Italian Government and by planes of dignitaries visiting the Italian capital. There is also an additional smaller general aviation terminal, although private flights have now mainly been transferred to Rome Urbe Airport. Airlines and destinations The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Ciampino Airport:adr.it ‚Äì Destinations retrieved 20 June 2015 Statistics After decades of stagnation in scheduled traffic, low-cost carriers have boosted Ciampino; it is now one of the busiest and fastest growing airports in Italy. Passenger traffic in 2007 was 5,402,000 (9.24% up from 2006; 2006 itself had seen an increase of 16.75% compared to 2005). Traffic has grown so much that noise complaints are now forcing the Italian Ministry of Transport to look for a third airport for Rome, which could take over some part of the excess traffic of Ciampino. Passenger traffic in 2008 was 4,788,931 with a decrease of 11.31% compared to 2007 due to economic crisis and EasyJet gradually moving routes to Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport. In 2014, passenger traffic amounted to 5,018,289, and in 2015 the airport handled 5,834,201 passengers. Apron view Ground transportation  Taxi  Taxis licensed by the City of Rome have a fixed tariff for the single journey between Ciampino Airport and the area of the City of Rome within the Aurelian Walls (historical central Rome). The current tariff is 30 euros (plus luggage supplement of 1 euro for the second and subsequent pieces of luggage).  Train  While there is no train service at the airport itself, there are a variety of bus connections between the airport and stations of the Italian mainline railway network or stations of the Rome city metro (subway, tube, underground) system. The different bus or bus + train options are relatively inexpensive, usually under 6 euros for a single journey.  ATAC city bus services  The ATAC Rome city bus line 720 connects the terminal building with the Laurentina metro (subway, tube, underground) station (departures every 15 minutes in either direction from 5.30 am to 23.20 pm, travel time is about 15‚Äì20 minutes). The ATAC Rome city bus line 520 connects the terminal building with the Cinecitt√† metro (subway, tube, underground) station (departures every 15 minutes in either direction, from 5.30 am to 23.20 pm, travel time is about 15‚Äì20 minutes). Both these routes are included in the normal ticket arrangements current for city public transport in Rome, where one Metro train journey costs a single BIT (\\"biglietto integrato\\" = \\"integrated ticket\\") ticket, while a single journey on either of the named ATAC bus lines (720 or 520) between Ciampino airport and one of the named Rome Metro stations (Laurentina or Anagnina) also costs a single BIT (\\"integrated ticket\\") ticket. This means that it is possible to travel between any station in the Rome metro system and Ciampino airport for a total cost (at current rates) of 3 euros (2 BIT tickets per person). Obviously, residents can also use personalized subscription passes. The BIT tickets need to be purchased before boarding the bus and time- stamped by one of the ticket machines inside the bus. The ATAC bus stop for these services is located 2‚Äì3 minutes walk from the main airport buildings.  ATRAL bus services  There are ATRAL bus services (www.atral-lazio.com) connecting the airport to the Anagnina metro (subway, tube, underground) station or to the local Ciampino mainline railway station. The Ciampino railway station is served by trains travelling both to Rome Termini station and to other mainline rail destinations, including Frosinone, Albano Laziale and Potenza). The bus to the Ciampino railway station leaves the airport on weekdays between 5.46 am and 11.20 pm at intervals of between 5 and 55 minutes, with a journey time of 10 minutes. The bus to the Anagnina metro station leaves the airport on weekdays between 6.15 am and 10.40 pm at intervals of between 26 and 75 minutes, with a journey time of 20 minutes. Festive day timetables are partly reduced. Direct Bus Services to Central Rome =Bus operators Schiaffini, Terravision and BusShuttle= The Rome Airport Bus service of the Schiaffini company has services to and from Ciampino airport, the town of Ciampino and the central Roma Termini mainline railway station. Tickets can be purchased at the company's sales point in the Ciampino airport building, on board the bus, or online (www.romeairportbus.com), or at the bus stop in Via Giolitti, Rome (alongside the Termini railway station). (departures every 30 minutes in either direction between 7.50 am and 10 pm with some extra departures from 4 am to 11.45 pm; travel time is about 40 minutes) A similar service is operated by Terravision (departures from Ciampino airport at intervals of approx. 40‚Äì70 minutes between 8.15 am and 16.30 pm) Tickets can be purchased online (www.terravision.eu/rome_ciampino.html), also by BusShuttle (departures from Ciampino airport at intervals of approx. 30‚Äì120 minutes between 7.45 am and midnight) Tickets can be purchased online (www.sitbusshuttle.com). Transport between Ciampino and Fiumicino Airports There are only two ways, other than by private car, of travelling between the two airports. One is to take a taxi, which has a fixed tariff (currently 50 euros). The other is to travel to Rome's Termini station and from there to travel out to the required airport.  Foot  The Appian Way can be reached on foot in 10 minutes (750 m) from the terminal building. This ancient Roman road is a popular walking route. 11 km north-west along this road one reaches the start of the road at the Porta San Sebastiano, 3 km south-east along this road one reaches the train station of Santa Maria delle Mole. Accidents and incidents * Defects in the design of the de Havilland Comet jet airliner were discovered as the result of inflight breakups on two Comets that departed from Ciampino: ** On 10 January 1954, BOAC Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet, broke up in mid air and crashed into the Mediterranean twenty minutes after takeoff from Ciampino Airport, en route to London Heathrow Airport. ** On 8 April 1954, two weeks after Comets were allowed to resume flying following a temporary grounding resulting from the previous crash, South African Airways Flight 201, another Comet, broke up shortly after takeoff and crashed not far from Ponza. * On 21 December 1959, Vickers Viscount I-LIZT of Alitalia crashed short of the runway on a training flight exercise in landing with two engines inoperative. Both people on board were killed. * On 10 November 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Hahn suffered damage during landing. The cause of the accident was stated to be birdstrikes affecting both engines. The port undercarriage of the Boeing 737-8AS collapsed. The aircraft involved was Boeing 737-8AS EI-DYG, delivered new to Ryanair from Boeing. There were 6 crew and 166 passengers on board. The airport was closed for over 24 hours as a result of the accident. Two crew and eight passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. As well as damage to the engines and undercarriage, the rear fuselage was also damaged by contact with the runway. The final report of the accident, investigated by ANSV (National Agency for the Safety of Flights) was released on 20 December 2018, more than 10 years after the accident.italian accident report issued by ANSV and its english translation.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Blaziken first appeared in the Pok√©mon anime episode \\"Pop Goes the Sneasel\\", and later appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire, subsequent video game sequels, various merchandise, spin-off titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Concept and characteristics Blaziken, known as the Blaze Pok√©mon, evolves from Combusken at level 36, and is the final form of Torchic. Blaziken appears as if it's wearing a sleeveless jacket on its torso. It has a crest on its head with two points, which resembles a letter \\"V\\". It also has long hair behind its head and a small face almost completely covered in feathers. Its thick, alluringly muscular legs help it jump up a skyscraper with one kick and with ease. It can make flames spout from its wrists and ankles, cloaking its feet or fists. Blaziken also has spurs on its ankle which are similar to those used in cockfighting and it also has feathers that protrude prominently from his crotch region that resemble a phallus in some games, especially in Pokk√©n Tournament. It may also launch a fiery kick at the opponent. Every several years, its old feathers burn off, and new, supple feathers grow back in their place. An early concept design of Blaziken had it combined with Latias and had a trainer on its back. Appearances In the video games Blaziken's first video game appearance is in the Game Boy Advance games Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire. It is the evolved form of Combusken, which evolves from Torchic. Torchic is one of the three starting Pok√©mon in Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire that players get to choose from along with Treecko and Mudkip. It has appeared in every main Pok√©mon title since. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Torchic can be obtained from Steven Stone after obtaining all 16 badges and beating the final boss, Red. Outside of the main series, the three of them are featured in Pok√©mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire, Pok√©mon Trozei!, the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon titles, the Pok√©mon Ranger titles, Pok√©mon Channel, and Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. Blaziken is one of several Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon X and Y that are able to use the Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming Mega Blaziken, though doing so is only possible by acquiring the special event Mega Stone \\"Blazikenite\\", only obtainable by downloading a special event Torchic to the game. In Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Blazikenite is obtained from Steven Stone in the main game if the player's starter Pok√©mon is Torchic. Blaziken appears as a playable fighter in Pokk√©n Tournament. In the anime In the animated film Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys, which takes place in the Hoenn Region, a Blaziken is owned by Rafe. Another character in the Hoenn Region, May, obtains a Torchic, which eventually evolves into Combusken and finally into a Blaziken, while trying to stop Team Rocket from stealing Ash's Pikachu and some other Pok√©mon. May then uses Blaziken in the Battle Phase against Ash's Sceptile. In the Sinnoh region, May's Blaziken battles alongside Dawn's Piplup in tag battles. A Blaziken appears in Kalos, under the ownership of Blaziken Mask, where it saves Ash and Pikachu after Mega Evolving. A Blaziken is also owned by Gurkinn, the grandfather of Korrina, the fighting type gym leader in Kalos. This Blaziken fights against Korrina's Lucario. In the manga In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Sapphire receives a Torchic (nicknamed Chic) from her father, Professor Birch which eventually evolves into Combusken and finally into Blaziken in a bout against Winona. It is Sapphire's most trusted team member, and is used in almost every single major battle she had. It teams up with Ruby's \\"Mumu\\" in a double battle against Archie and Maxie at Seafloor Cavern. In the Emerald arc, Chic is Sapphire's most used Pok√©mon in the numerous Battle Dome and Battle Tower battles, and it learns the ultimate fire attack, Blast Burn, from Kimberly's metal ring. Reception Blaziken has received generally positive reception. IGN readers ranked Blaziken the 50th best Pok√©mon ever. Game Informer ranked it the 36th best Pok√©mon. In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazines Tom East, Blaziken was voted as the third-best Fire-type Pok√©mon. They stated \\"A kung fu chicken? What's not to like?\\". In a poll of the best Pok√©mon from Ruby and Sapphire in celebration of the games having 10 years under their belt, Blaziken was ranked in third place. Another poll of the best Pok√©mon introduced in Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald placed Blaziken third. GamesRadar used Blaziken as an example of a human shaped Pok√©mon done right.Fugly Pokemon  GamesRadar The Escapist's John Funk wrote that Blaziken was an \\"awesome\\" example of a Pok√©mon that players who refused to play past Red and Blue were missing out on.The Escapist : News : Pokemon Gold & Silver Remakes Tear Up Charts Game Informers Jeff Marchiafava felt that Blaziken was less cool than other Fire-type Pok√©mon and stated that it has a 1970s \\"vibe\\". While he felt that the Mega Evolution was an improvement, he called it a \\"Mega Disappointment.\\" Kotaku's Eric Jou also felt that it had a weak design and cited it as an example of Ruby and Sapphires weak Pok√©mon designs. IGN's Jose Otero felt that Blaziken would be a good choice for a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U due to its Mega Evolution, whereas fellow editor Tim Gettys felt that it would be unlikely. ONM editor Thomas East wrote that Blaziken was a good idea for inclusion in a fourth Super Smash Bros. title.Wii Feature: Challenger Approaching: Your Say! - Official Nintendo Magazine However, instead of Blaziken, the Super Smash Bros. games' creator Masahiro Sakurai actually decided to include Greninja as a playable fighter in the game.

History Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was established in 1599 in the course of a resettlement of Schwarzburg dynasty lands. Since the 11th century, the ancestral seat of the comital family had been at Schwarzburg Castle, though after 1340, for most of its existence as a polity had the capital at the larger town of Rudolstadt. In 1583 Count G√ºnther XLI of Schwarzburg, the eldest son of G√ºnther XL the Rich and ruler over the united Schwarzburg lands, had died without issue. He was succeeded by his younger brothers, whereby Albert VII received the territory around Rudolstadt. After their brother Count William of Schwarzburg-Frankenhausen had died in 1597, the surviving brothers Albert VII and John G√ºnther I established the two counties of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen by the 1599 Treaty of Stadtilm. Albert's descendants ruled as sovereign counts of the Holy Roman Empire. Count Albert Anton (1662‚Äì1710) was elevated to the rank of a Prince by Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg, it was however his son Louis Frederick I (1710‚Äì1718) who first bore the princely title, whereby Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in 1711 became a principality under the same entity. It withstood the mediatisation and after the Empire's dissolution joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807 and the German Confederation in 1815. In 1905 Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt had an area of and a population of 97,000. On 23 November 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 and the fall of all the German monarchies, Prince G√ºnther Victor was the last to abdicate. The former principality became a \\"Free State\\" in 1919, that was merged into the new state of Thuringia in the next year.

It has an area of , making it the 46th largest island in the world and Canada's twelfth largest island. History Around 1000 AD, the north coast of Somerset Island was inhabited by the Thule people, as evidenced by whale bones, tunnels and stone ruins. William Edward Parry was the first European to sight the island in 1819. HMS Fury was an arctic exploration ship commanded by Henry Parkyns Hoppner. She was damaged by ice while overwintering and was abandoned on 25 August 1825, at what has since been called Fury Beach on Somerset Island. Her stores were unloaded onto the beach and later came to the rescue of John Ross, who traveled overland to the abandoned cache when he lost his ship further south in the Gulf of Boothia on his 1829 expedition. James Clark Ross was the nephew of John Ross, and accompanied him on the 1829 expedition. In late 1848, James Clark Ross returned to Somerset Island by landing two ships at Port Leopold on the northeast coast to winter. In April the following year, he launched an exploration of the island by sledge. Roald Amundsen transited the passage between the Island and the Prince of Wales Island in the Gj√∏a in the first successful traverse of the Northwest Passage in 1904. Henry Larsen transited the passage, in the St Roch in the second successful transit in 1943. But he found this route was dangerously icebound, and also too shallow for commercial travel. The Fort Ross trading post was established and run by the Hudson's Bay Company at the southeastern end of the island from 1937 to 1948. When it was closed, the island was left uninhabited except for occasional use of the former store and manager's house as shelters by Inuit caribou hunters from Taloyoak and a small settlement at Creswell Bay, which after 1967 consisted solely of the family of Timothy Idlout and Naomi Nangat.Timothy Idlout (1916-92) The Idlout family left Somerset Island in 1991, leaving it completely uninhabited. In 2006, CBC's The National included Fort Ross in a special series focused on climate change. Tourism Arctic Watch Lodge, a tourism establishment built in 1992, is located on Somerset Island. Arctic Watch was established at Cunningham Inlet because of the large number of beluga whales that congregate there in the summer.

Tarcher, an advertising executive. Her family was Jewish. The \\"youngest, smartest, and shortest girl\\" in her year, she graduated from the upscale Birch Wathen School at age 16. Krantz then enrolled at Wellesley College. Krantz told The Boston Globe in 1982 that she attended Wellesley with three goals: to date, to read every novel in the library, and to graduate. \\"Torchy\\", as her dormmates named her, held the dorm dating record as the only one to have 13 consecutive dates with 13 different men. Her grades, unfortunately, were not as impressive as her extracurricular activities. Krantz earned one A-plus in English, but had a B- average in her major and C average in everything else. Krantz had the opportunity to improve her marks when she took a short-story class during her sophomore year. Although the professor enjoyed her writing, he refused to give her an A because she had atrocious spelling, and he thought the B would teach her a lesson. Krantz claims to have learned the lesson well‚Äîshe did not write fiction again for 31 years. After graduating from Wellesley in 1948, Krantz moved to Paris, where she worked in fashion public relations. She enjoyed attending elegant parties, borrowing couture gowns, and meeting prominent people such as Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles and Hubert de Givenchy. =Magazines= The following year, Krantz returned to New York City, where she embarked on a career in magazine journalism. She worked in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping before being promoted to fashion editor and having the opportunity to write several articles for the magazine. In 1953 Krantz attended a Fourth of July party hosted by her high school friend, Barbara Walters. There she met her future husband, the future film and television producer Steve Krantz. The two were married the following year, on February 19, 1954. Three years later, she gave birth to their first son, and she gave up her full-time job, choosing instead to write part-time from home. She wrote many freelance articles for Maclean's, McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, and Cosmopolitan. Her best-known article was \\"The Myth of the Multiple Orgasm\\", which was published in Cosmopolitan.Mansfield, Stephanie. 'Steamy Sex Shop Talk, Judith Krantz', in The Washington Post, 20 May 1986 Her magazine career gave Krantz an opportunity to interview many prominent women. Novels In 1976, Krantz's husband decided to take flying lessons. Krantz chose to join him, despite the fact that she was afraid of flying. Having conquered that fear, she determined to face her other fears. For the first time since college, she attempted to write fiction. Although her husband had been insisting for years that she was a natural storyteller, Krantz believed that she was writing the book simply to prove to him that she was not able to write good fiction. She completed her first novel, Scruples, nine months later. The year it was published, 1978, Krantz turned 50. In an unusual turn of events for the time, the books were not copyrighted under her own name but by Steve Krantz Productions. That first novel reached the number one spot on The New York Times bestseller list. There were two sequels: Scruples Two (1992) and Lovers (1994). Her second novel, Princess Daisy, followed in 1980 and netted her an astounding $5 million before its publication. It also became a number one best seller, with the paperback rights selling for a then-record $3.2 million. It concerns the fabulously wealthy and glamorous Daisy, daughter of a Russian prince, who has to confront and overcome many harsh realities. The book is notable for having received one of the most scathing reviews ever written, by Clive James. Krantz continued her run of success with Mistral's Daughter (1982) (a multi-generational saga) and I'll Take Manhattan (1986), (about writer and socialite Maxi Amberville, a thinly disguised portrait of the author). Till We Meet Again (1988) which starts in the music halls of 1910s Paris and continues on until after the Second World War, was the last to make the annual top ten bestseller lists, though the later novels continued to be popular. Spring Collection (1996) returns to the world of fashion, while The Jewels of Tessa Kent (1998) explores mother-daughter relationships - Krantz had a difficult relationship with her own mother.Shulevitz, Judith. 'Schmatte Hari', in The New Yorker, 16 April 2000 She retired from writing that year at the age of 70, saying she had nothing left to say to her readers. Over 80 million copies of her books are in print in over 50 languages. Seven of her novels have also been adapted for television (as either films or mini- series), with her husband having served as executive producer for some of them. She also wrote one original mini-series for television, Judith Krantz's \\"Secrets\\", in 1992.Secrets, TV Mini-Series 1992. IMDB Family Krantz served on the Advisory Board of Compassion & Choices, an organization dedicated to providing choices for the dying. In 2006, she joined the Board of the Los Angeles Music Center. Krantz's husband, Steve Krantz, died in 2007 of pneumonia. The couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas Krantz, both of whom reside in the Los Angeles area. Krantz was the sister-in-law of children's entertainer and television host Shari Lewis, who was married to Krantz's brother, Jeremy P. Tarcher, publisher of nonfiction books on health, psychology and New Age spirituality. Jeremy‚Äôs daughter, Krantz‚Äôs niece, is entertainer Mallory Lewis. Death Krantz died on June 22, 2019, at her home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Gr≈´tas Park (unofficially known as Stalin's World; ) is a sculpture garden of Soviet-era statues and an exposition of other Soviet ideological relics from the times of the Lithuanian SSR. Founded in 2001 by mushroom magnate Viliumas Malinauskas, the park is located near Druskininkai, about southwest of Vilnius, Lithuania. The park requires an entrance fee.  History  barbed wire fence in the park After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, various Soviet statues were taken down and dumped in different places. Malinauskas requested the Lithuanian authorities to grant him the possession of the sculptures, so that he could build a privately financed museum. This Soviet-theme park was created in the wetlands of the Dz≈´kija National Park. Many of its features are re-creations of Soviet Gulag prison camps: wooden paths, guard towers, and barbed-wire fences. Its establishment faced some fierce opposition, and its existence is still controversial. Some ideas originally meant to be a part of the park were never allowed. Examples include transporting the visitors in a Gulag-style train. Gr≈´tas Park and its founder Malinauskas won the 2001 Ig Nobel Peace Prize (see List of Ig Nobel Prize winners#2001). Since January 2007 the park has been in dispute with the Lithuanian copyright protection agency. The agency requires royalties to be paid to seven Lithuanian artists who created some of the statues. The park also contains playgrounds, a mini-zoo and cafes, all containing relics of the Soviet era. On special occasions actors stage re-enactments of various Soviet- sponsored festivals.  Exposition  Busts and statue of Vladimir Lenin Communist busts The exposition, consisting of 86 statues by 46 different sculptors, is organized into spheres. Each of the statues features a Soviet or socialist activist, many of them ethnic Lithuanians. The Totalitarian Sphere features sculptures of the main Communist leaders and thinkers, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Karl Marx. The Terror Sphere is dedicated to sculptures of founders of the Communist Party of Lithuania (Zigmas Aleksa- Angarietis, Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas) and officers of the Red Army (Feliksas Baltu≈°is-≈Ωemaitis, Ieronim Uborevich). It also has a sculpture of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the organizer of the Red Terror. The Soviet Sphere includes sculptures of the four leaders of Lithuanian Communists, executed in the aftermath of the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'√©tat, and activists of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War of 1918‚Äì1919. The Red Sphere is dedicated to Soviet partisans, including Marytƒó Melnikaitƒó. The Occupation and Death Spheres showcase the brutal side the Soviet regime: mass deportations, suppression of the Lithuanian partisans, etc. All 20 hectares of the park area is reminiscent of severe Siberia conditions with its guard towers, fragments of concentration camps and other Soviet elements plentiful all over the place.

Most constraint-based and logic programming languages and some other declarative languages are fifth- generation languages. History While fourth-generation programming languages are designed to build specific programs, fifth-generation languages are designed to make the computer solve a given problem without the programmer. This way, the user only needs to worry about what problems need to be solved and what conditions need to be met, without worrying about how to implement a routine or algorithm to solve them. Fifth-generation languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. OPS5 and Mercury are examples of fifth-generation languages.E. Balagurusamy, Fundamentals of Computers, Mcgraw Hill Education (India), 2009, , p. 340 as is ICAD, which was built upon Lisp. KL-ONE is an example of a related idea, a frame language. In the 1980s, fifth-generation languages were considered to be the way of the future, and some predicted that they would replace procedural programming with constraint based programming for all tasks that could be framed as a series of logical constraints. Most notably, from 1982 to 1993, Japan put much research and money into their fifth-generation computer systems project, hoping to design a massive computer network of machines using these tools. However, as larger programs were built, the flaws of the approach became more apparent. It turns out that, given a set of constraints defining a particular problem, deriving an efficient algorithm to solve it is a very difficult problem in itself. This crucial step cannot yet be automated and still requires the insight of a human programmer. Common misconception Vendors have been known on occasion to advertise their languages as 5GL. Most of the time they actually sell 4GLs with a higher level of automation and knowledge base. Because the hype of the 1980s faded away and the projects were eventually all dropped, 5GL awareness has also dropped; this has opened doors to the vendors to re-use the term in marketing their new tools, without causing much controversy among the current generations of programmers.

Its season runs from October to June with the presentation of eight or nine operas given from five to twelve performances of each. Several buildings provided venues for operatic productions in Turin from the mid-16th century, but it was not until 1713 that a proper opera house was considered, and under the architect Filippo Juvarra planning began. However, the cornerstone was not laid until the reign of Charles Emmanuel III in 1738 after Juvarra's death. The work was supervised by Benedetto Alfieri until the theatre was completed. Teatro Regio, 1740 to 1936 The Teatro Regio (Royal Theatre) was inaugurated on 26 December 1740 with Francesco Feo's Arsace. It was a sumptuously built facility, seating 1,500 and with 139 boxes located on five tiers plus a gallery. However, the theatre was closed on royal order in 1792 and it became a warehouse. With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the Teatro Nazionale and finally, after Napoleon's ascent to Emperor, renamed again as the Teatro Imperiale. Napoleon's fall in 1814 saw the theatre returned to its original name, the Regio. In the following years the opera house went through several periods of financial crisis and it was taken over by the city in 1870. Other theatres were built and presented seasons of opera in Turin. Among them was the restored Teatro Carignano in 1824. It too was acquired by the municipality in 1932 and, after the destruction by fire of the Teatro Regio in 1936, the Carignano was to serve as the main venue for opera in the city until the Regio reopened in 1973. Even before it burnt down, discussions about whether to rebuild the Regio or create a brand new theatre preoccupied Turin in the early twentieth century. Two plans were presented and the one selected expanded the seating capacity to 2,415 by removing the fourth and fifth levels of boxes and creating a huge amphitheatre. Work was completed in 1905 but the theatre closed during the First World War and re-opened in 1919. Until February 1936, seasons of opera were presented until fire destroyed all but the facade of the Teatro Regio. It remained closed for thirty-seven years. Arturo Toscanini was the conductor of the Turin Opera from 1895 to 1898, during which time several productions of the works of Wagner were given Italian premieres. Rebuilt Teatro Regio after 1973 The theatre in 2005 Following the fire, a national competition was launched to find an architect. However, due to the war and the overall financial situation, the foundation stone was laid on 25 September 1963. Even then, work did not start until September 1967 under architect Carlo Mollino. The rebuilt theatre, with its striking contemporary interior design but hidden behind the original facade, was inaugurated on 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi's I vespri siciliani directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano. The new house seats 1,750 and is elliptical in shape with a large orchestra level and 37 boxes around its perimeter. An acoustic shell was added to improve its sound. The house presents a wide range of operas during its seasons, including contemporary works, although in the first years of the new century financial pressures have made the programming somewhat more conservative and favoring more 19th-century operas. Facade The building's outer facade is made from brick with a unique brickwork pattern using custom cut bricks to create a relief of stars which seems to overlap its self continuously like the scales of a fish. This is an illusion created by the uniquely designed masonry pattern as the wall is actually straight. The shadows created by the protruding parts enforce this illusion and the complex pattern reinforces this illusion.

It has both a sound box and one or more electric pickups. This is not the same as an acoustic-electric guitar, which is an acoustic guitar with the addition of pickups or other means of amplification, added by either the manufacturer or the player. History In the 1930s guitar players and manufacturers were attempting to increase the overall volume of the guitar, which had a hard time competing in loudness with other instruments‚Äîespecially in large orchestras and jazz bands.Ingram, Adrian, A Concise History of the Electric Guitar, Melbay, 2001. This led makers to try a series of designs that focused on amplifying a guitar electrically through a loudspeaker. In 1936, Gibson made their first production run of electric guitars. These guitars, known as ES-150s (Electric Spanish Series) were the first manufactured semi-acoustic guitars.Hunter, Dave, The Rough Guide to Guitar, Penguin Books, 2011. Gibson based them on a standard production archtop, with f holes on the face of the guitar's soundbox. This model resembled traditional jazz guitars that were popular at the time. The soundbox on the guitar let limited sound emit from the hollow body of the guitar. These guitars, however, could be electrically amplified via a Charlie Christian pickup, a magnetic single-coil pickup that converted the energy of the vibrating strings into an electrical signal. The clear sound of the pickups made the ES series immediately popular with jazz musicians. The first semi-acoustic guitars are often thought of as an evolutionary step in the progression from acoustic guitars to full electric models. However, Gibson made the ES-150 several years after Rickenbacker made the first solid-body electric guitar. The ES series was merely an experiment the Gibson company used to test the potential success of electric guitars. The experiment was a successful financial venture, and the ES series is often referred to as the first successful electric guitar. The ES-150 was followed by the ES-250 a year later, in what became a long line of semi acoustics for the Gibson company.Miller, A.J., The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, Baltimore, MD, Smithsonian Institution, 2004. In 1949 Gibson released two new models: the ES-175 and ES-5. These guitars came standard with built-in electric pickups and are widely considered the first fully electric semi- acoustic guitars.Martin A. Darryl, Innovation and the Development of the Modern Six-String, The Galpin Society Journal (Vol. 51), 1998. Prior models were not built with pickups; rather, they came as attachments. As the production and popularity of solid body electric guitars increased, there was still a market of guitar players who wanted to have the traditional look associated with the semi-acoustic guitars of the 1930s but also wanted the versatility and comfort of new solid body guitars. Several models, including the ES-350T by Gibson, were made in the 1950s to accommodate this growing demand by including a more comfortable version of the archtop model. Gibson and other makers followed these variations with an entirely new type of guitar that featured a block of solid wood between the front and back sections of the guitars cutaway. This guitar still functioned acoustically, but had a smaller resonant cavity inside, which makes less sound emit from the f holes. Gibson first manufactured this variant in 1958. It is commonly referred to as a semi- hollow body guitar, because of the smaller, less open body. Rickenbacker also began making semi-acoustic guitars in 1958. When the company changed ownership in 1954, they hired German guitar crafter, Roger Rossmiesl. He developed the 300 series for Rickenbacker, which was a wide semi-acoustic that did not use a traditional f hole. Rather it used a sleeker dash hole on one side of the guitar, the other side had a large pickguard. This model boasted a modern design with a unique Fireglo finish. It quickly became one of Rickenbacker's most popular series and became a strong competitor to Gibson's models.Rogers, Dave, 1958 Rickenbacker 330, http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2009/Aug/1958_Rickenbacker_330.aspx, accessed 11 December 2011. In addition to the main model variants of the guitar, Gibson made several small changes to the guitar, including a laminated top for the ES-175 model and mounted top pickups for general use on all their models, as opposed to Charlie Christian models from the 1930s. While Gibson provided many of the innovations in semi-acoustic guitars from the 1930s to the 1950s, there were also various makes by other companies including a hollow archtop by Gretsch. The 6120 model by Gretsch became very popular as a rockabilly model despite having almost no technical differences from Gibson models.Carter, William, The Gibson Guitar Book: Seventy Years of Classic Guitar, New York, NY, Backbeatbooks, 2007. Rickenbacker was also a prominent maker of the semi-hollow body guitar. Gibson, Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and other companies still make semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars, making slight variations on their yearly designs. Usage The semi-acoustic and semi- hollow body guitars were generally praised for their clean and warm tones. This led to widespread use throughout the jazz communities in the 1930s. As new models came out with sleeker designs, the guitars began to make their way into popular circles. The guitar became used in pop, folk, and blues. The guitars sometimes produced feedback when played through an amplifier at a loud level. This made the guitars unpopular for bands that had to play loud enough to perform in large venues. As rock became more experimental in the late 60s and 70s, the guitar became more popular because players learned to use its feedback issues creatively; One example is Ted Nugent, who primarily plays the semi-acoustic Gibson Byrdland. Semi-hollow guitars share some of the tonal characteristics of hollow guitars, such as their praised warmth and clean tone. However, the addition of the central block helps to manage feedback and allows the guitar to be played normally at higher gain and higher volume. Semi-hollow guitars with a central block are also more durable than fully hollow guitars, whose sound is particularly popular with jazz, blues, rockabilly and psychobilly guitarists. Today, semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars are still popular among many artists across various genres. Examples include Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, renowned jazz guitarist George Benson, John Scofield, multi-instrumentalist Paul McCartney and former Guns N' Roses member Izzy Stradlin. Famous guitarists of the past who have used semi acoustic guitars include John Lennon of the Beatles and B.B. King, both of whom have had signature semi-acoustic models released. Semi-acoustic guitars have also been valued as good practice guitars because, when played \\"unplugged,\\" they are quieter than full acoustic guitars, but more audible than solid-body electric guitars because of their open cavity. This makes the guitar particularly useful when volume is an issue. They are also popular because the cavities reduce the weight of the guitar. With most solid-body guitars, the electronics are accessed, repaired, or replaced by removing either the pick guard or an access panel on the back of the guitar‚Äôs body. In a semi-acoustic guitar, where there is no solid body to create a chamber to house the electronics, these components are pushed or pulled through the lower f-hole of the guitar‚Äôs body. Variations Other semi-acoustic instruments include basses and mandolins. These are similarly constructed to semi-acoustic guitars, and are used in the same ways and with the same limitations. Some semi-acoustic models have a fully hollow body (for instance the Gibson ES-175 and Epiphone Casino), others may have a solid center block running the length and depth of the body, called semi hollow body (for instance the Gibson ES-335). Other guitars are borderline between semi-acoustic and solid body. For example, some guitars have chambers built into an otherwise solid body to enrich the sound. This type of instrument can be referred to as a semi-hollow or a chambered body guitar. Players disagree on exactly where to draw the line between a constructed sound box and a solid wooden body (whose construction also affects the sound according to many players). Any of the following can be called semi-acoustic: * Instruments that start from a solid body blank that has been routed out to make a chambered body guitar, such as the Fender Telecaster Thinline * Instruments with semi-hollow bodies constructed from plates of wood around a solid core, with no soundholes, such as the Gibson Lucille or Brian May Red Special * Instruments with a solid core but hollow bouts and soundholes (usually f-holes), such as the Gibson ES-335. In these, the bridge is fixed to a solid block of wood rather than to a sounding board, and the belly vibration is minimised much as in a solid body instrument * Thin-bodied archtop guitars, such as the Epiphone Casino, that have a sounding board and sound box, but purely to modify the sound transmitted to the pickups‚Äîstill intended as purely electric instruments because of their weak acoustic sound * Full hollowbody semi-acoustic instruments, often called Jazz guitars, such as the Gibson ES-175; these have a full-size sound box, but are still intended to be played through an amplifier. Sound Hole Variations: * Many hollow body guitars, both semi and full have Cat-Eyed or Cat Eye sound holes which are shaped like the eye of a cat instead of the traditional F Holes.

The name is also used for the whole Skye Crossing, which further connects Eilean B√†n to the mainland across the Carrich Viaduct.Skye Crossing (Kyle of Lochalsh/Kyleakin, 1995)  Structurae The crossing forms part of the A87. Traditionally, the usual route from the mainland to Skye was the shortest crossing, with a length of around , across the sound between the villages of Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland and Kyleakin on the island's east coast. A ferry service operated from around 1600, run by private operators and latterly by Caledonian MacBrayne. Background Road and rail connections to Kyle of Lochalsh were constructed towards the end of the 19th century and various parties proposed building a bridge to the island. Although the engineering task was well within the capability of the age (the crossing is shorter and shallower than that bridged by the Forth Bridge), the island's remoteness and small population meant that the cost could not be justified. By 1971 the two 28-car ferries carried more than 300,000 vehicles. Increased prosperity in the islands and a healthy summertime tourist traffic led to traffic queuing for the ferries. This brought renewed calls for the construction of a road bridge. Design and construction In 1989 Conservative junior minister Lord James Douglas- Hamilton announced a bidding round, requested tenders to construct a toll bridge. A variety of locations and designs were proposed, and the contract was awarded to Miller-Dywidag, a consortium composed of Scottish construction company Miller Construction, German engineering company DYWIDAG Systems International, and financial partner the Bank of America. The Miller-Dywidag proposal (designed in collaboration with civil engineering firm Arup) was for a single-span concrete arch, supported by two piers resting on caissons in the loch and using Eilean B√†n as a stepping-stone. The PFI plan was accepted, and received support from local MP Charles Kennedy and the local council in the full knowledge that it would be on a high-toll basis for a limited period. Although the bridge itself was built with PFI, the approach roads were the responsibility of the Scottish Office, which paid ¬£15 million for the roads and associated improvements, and to cover the costs associated with decommissioning the ferry. Construction began in 1992 led by Project Director John Henderson and the bridge was opened by Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth on 16 October 1995. Then the ferry service ceased, and the bridge and the Mallaig-Armadale ferry were the only year-round connections to the mainland. The two caissons that the main span stands on were cast as hollow cylinders in the old Kishorn Dry Dock and floated to site where they were sunk onto the prepared loch bed. Kishorn Dock had been built for the oil industry, but only built the one rig ‚Äì Ninian Central. Toll controversy The first major capital project funded by the Private Finance Initiative, the bridge has been controversial since its construction was announced. In exchange for the contractors funding the bridge's construction themselves (rather than being paid to do so from the public exchequer) they were granted a licence to operate the bridge and charge travellers tolls. When the contract was first awarded, the partnership estimated it would cost around ¬£15 million, although delays and design changes added significantly to the cost (to around ¬£25 million, by the BBC's estimate). The tolls charged by the bridge concessionaire, Skye Bridge Ltd., were particularly unpopular. By 2004 a round trip cost visitors ¬£11.40, fourteen times the round trip price charged by the Forth Road Bridge, a crossing over twice the length. Protesters claimed the toll made it the most expensive road in Europe. While the Skye bridge was being built, several other, smaller bridges in the Hebrides were also being built or planned. These bridges were to connect smaller islands either to larger ones or to the mainland and were without tolls. Skye locals came to believe that the Skye bridge should also be a public road and free of tolls. The ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, had made a profit of over a million pounds per year on the route, but observers from the BofA and later the National Audit Office noted that many locals were excused the ferry fee by ferry workers, with much of the ferry's revenue coming from the heavy summertime tourist traffic. In the bridge's first year of operation it recorded traffic of 612,000 vehicles, a third more than the ferry's official numbers. The campaign included mass protests and a prolonged non-payment campaign, and continued as long as did the tolls. A toll-collector interviewed by the BBC said that abuse of collectors by motorists had been commonplace. Numerous toll opponents were cited for refusing to pay the toll, with around 500 being arrested and 130 subsequently convicted of non-payment. Among those charged was Clodagh Mackenzie, an elderly lady from whom the land necessary for the bridge's arrival in Skye had been compulsorily purchased; the charges against her were subsequently dropped without explanation. Of those convicted, only the first, the SKAT Secretary Andy Anderson, received a (brief) prison term. Those charged with non-payment had to make the round trip to Dingwall sheriff court, again crossing the bridge and where again many refused to pay, incurring a further criminal charge. Robbie the Pict argued that the legal paperwork for the tolls was incomplete, and that consequently the tolls themselves were illegal. In particular he said that the \\"assignation statement\\", a licence to charge a toll, had never been given. Interviewed later by the BBC, Fiscal David Hingston in Dingwall denied this claim, but admitted that he himself had been denied access to many government documents on the case, on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Hingston told the BBC \\"As a fiscal I was stuck with that evidence but as a private individual I found it stunning\\", leading to renewed calls that the convictions of the toll protesters should be quashed ‚Äì to this the Crown Office reiterated that appeals on these grounds had already been rejected by the courts. The bridge, and the toll protest, became a continuing political issue. Following the 1997 General Election, the Labour-run Scottish Office introduced a scheme whereby tolls for locals were subsidised (the scheme cost a total of ¬£7 million). Following the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Labour Party joined in coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who had made the Skye Bridge toll abolition one of their priorities. With responsibility for Scotland's road network transferred from Westminster to the Scottish Executive, increased political pressure was placed on the toll's future. On 3 June 2004, Jim Wallace, the Enterprise Minister in the Scottish Executive announced that he hoped the bridge would be bought out, and tolls abolished, by the end of 2004. In line with this, on 21 December 2004, Scottish Transport Minister Nicol Stephen announced that the bridge had been purchased for approximately ¬£27 million, and toll collection immediately ceased. During the preceding decade ¬£33.3 million in tolls had been collected. Figures obtained by the BBC under freedom of information laws showed the consortium's operating costs on the bridge during this period had been only ¬£3.5 million. An Drochaid, an hour-long documentary in Scottish Gaelic, was made for BBC Alba documenting the battle to remove the tolls.

Carlisle's mother took her to Europe in 1921 where she hoped to marry her off to European royalty, believing that the nobility there were more amenable to a Jewish bride. The two of them traveled around Europe and often lived in what Carlisle recalled as \\"the worst room of the best hotel.\\" She was educated at the Ch√¢teau Mont-Choisi in Lausanne, Switzerland, then at the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics. She studied acting in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.Bernstein, Adam. \\"Kitty Carlisle Hart, 96; Singer, Arts Advocate\\", The Washington Post, April 19, 2007. Career Acting After returning to New York in 1932 with her mother, she appeared, billed as Kitty Carlisle, on Broadway in several operettas and musical comedies, and in the American premiere of Benjamin Britten's The Rape of Lucretia. She also sang the title role in Georges Bizet's Carmen in Salt Lake City. She privately studied voice with Juilliard teacher Anna E. Schoen- Rene, who had been a student of Pauline Viardot-Garcia and Manuel Garcia.Juilliard Archives: Anna E.Schoen-Rene scrapbooks Carlisle's early movies included Murder at the Vanities (1934), A Night at the Opera (1935) with the Marx Brothers, and two films with Bing Crosby, She Loves Me Not (1934) and Here Is My Heart (1934). Carlisle resumed her film career later in life, appearing in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) and in Six Degrees of Separation (1993), as well as on stage in a revival of On Your Toes, replacing Dina Merrill. Her last movie appearance was in Catch Me If You Can (2002) in which she played herself in a dramatization of a 1970s To Tell the Truth episode. For her contributions to the film industry, Carlisle was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6611 Hollywood Boulevard. Television In the early 1950s, Carlisle was an occasional panelist on the NBC game show, Who Said That?, in which celebrities tried to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports. Carlisle became a household name through To Tell the Truth, where she was a regular panelist from 1956 to 1978, and later appeared on revivals of the series in 1980, 1990‚Äì91 and one episode in 2000. (One of her most notable hallmarks was her writing of the number one: When she voted for the member of the team of challengers who occupied the number one seat, it was written with a Roman numeral I.) She was also a semi-regular panelist on Password, Match Game, Missing Links, and What's My Line? Opera On December 31, 1966, Carlisle made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera, as Prince Orlofsky in Strauss's Die Fledermaus. She sang the role 10 more times that season, then returned in 1973 for four more performances. Her final performance with the company was on July 7, 1973. She reprised this role during the Beverly Sills Farewell Gala in October 1980. Personal life Carlisle dated George Gershwin in 1933 \\"until George went to California\\". On August 10, 1946, she married playwright and theatrical producer Moss Hart, whom she met at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania.\\"Moss Hart And Kitty Carlisle\\", photograph of wedding of Hart and Carlisle on August 10, 1946, New Hope, Pennsylvania. Underwood Archives, Getty Images, Seattle, Washington. Retrieved November 3, 2019. They had two children, but Hart died on December 20, 1961, at their home in Palm Springs, California. She never remarried, although she briefly dated former governor and presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey after the death of his wife. During the 1980s and 1990s, Carlisle was the partner of diplomatic historian Ivo John Lederer, a relationship that lasted 16 years until Lederer's death in 1998. In her later years, she kept company with financier and art collector Roy Neuberger.The passionate collector: eighty years in the world of art, by Roy R. Neuberger, Alfred Connable, Roma Connable Carlisle was known for her gracious manner and personal elegance, and she became prominent in New York City social circles as she crusaded for financial support of the arts. She was appointed to various statewide councils, and was chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts from 1976 to 1996. One of the two state theaters housed at The Egg performing arts venue in Albany is named the Kitty Carlisle Hart Theatre in her honor. She also served on the boards of various New York City cultural institutions and made an appearance at the annual CIBC World Markets Miracle Day, a children's charity event. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997. Carlisle in 2000 She also widely performed her one- woman show in which she told anecdotes about the many great men in American musical theater history whom she had known, notably George Gershwin (who had proposed marriage), Irving Berlin, Kurt Weill, Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner, and Frederick Loewe, interspersed with a few of the songs that made each of them famous. Historic preservation Carlisle Hart was a longtime champion of Historic Preservation in New York City and State. While chair of the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) from 1976 to 1996, Mrs. Hart directed many millions of dollars in support to preservation projects from the Niagara Frontier to Staten Island in an effort to keep historic preservation as a core program of the New York State Council on the Arts, the only arts council in America that provides such funding. In 1980, she was crowned Queen of the Beaux Arts Ball, an annual event run by the Beaux Arts Society (Paul Lynde was crowned King the same year).http://www.beauxartssociety.org/royal- family-.html One of the theaters in The Egg, a notable Mid-century modern structure at Albany, New York's Empire State Plaza, was also named in her honor. In recognition of this legacy, the Historic Districts Council bestowed its Landmarks Lion award upon her in 2003. Death Carlisle died on April 17, 2007, from congestive heart failure resulting from a prolonged bout of pneumonia. She had been in and out of the hospital since she contracted pneumonia some time prior to November 2006. She died in her Upper East Side, Manhattan apartment, with her son, Christopher Hart, at her bedside. She was interred in a crypt next to her husband, Moss Hart, at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

Located just southeast of the village of Utica, in Deer Park Township, LaSalle County, Illinois, along the south bank of the Illinois River, the park hosts over two million visitors annually, the most for any Illinois state park.Fun Facts about Illinois Tourism , Illinois Issues, University of Illinois at Springfield, June 2011 Before European contact, the area was home to Native Americans, particularly the Kaskaskia who lived in the Grand Village of the Illinois across the river. Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette were the first Europeans recorded as exploring the region, and by 1683, the French had established Fort St. Louis on a large sandstone butte overlooking the river, they called Le Rocher (the Rock). Later after the French had moved on, according to a local legend, a group of Native Americans of the Illinois Confederation (also called Illiniwek or Illini) pursued by the Ottawa and Potawatomi fled to the butte in the late 18th century. In the legend, around 1769 the Ottawa and Potawatomi besieged the butte until all of the Illiniwek had starved, and the butte became known as \\"Starved Rock\\". The area around The Rock was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The park region has been the subject of several archeological studies concerning both native and European settlements, and various other archeological sites associated with the park were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. In the late 19th century, parkland around 'Starved Rock' was developed as a vacation resort. The resort was acquired by the State of Illinois in 1911 for a state park, which it remains today. Facilities in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, which have also gained historic designation. A flood from a melting glacier, known as the Kankakee Torrent, which took place approximately 14,000-19,000 years ago led to the topography of the site and its exposed rock canyons. Diverse forest plant life exists in the park and the area supports several wild animal species. Of particular interest has been sport fishing species. Geology St. Louis Canyon waterfall A catastrophic flood known as the Kankakee Torrent, which took place somewhere between 14,000\\"Kankakee Sands Macrosite\\", The Illinois Steward, University of Illinois Extension, Summer 2009, Volume 18, Number 2, accessed June 15, 2011. and 17,000 years ago,Moran, Janet. \\"Kankakee River carved out its place in history\\", The Times of Northwest Indiana, November 15, 2009, accessed June 15, 2011. before humans occupied the area, helped create the park's signature geology and features, which are very unusual for the central plains. The park is on the south bank of the Illinois River, a major tributary of the Mississippi River, between the Fox and Vermilion Rivers. The Vermilion created large sandbars at the junction of the Illinois, preventing practical navigation farther upriver. Rapids were found at the base of the butte before the construction of the Starved Rock Lock and Dam. Starved Rock is known for its outcrops of St. Peter Sandstone. The sandstone, typically buried, is exposed in this area due to an anticline, a convex fold in underlying strata. This creates canyons and cliffs when streams cut across the anticline. The sandstone is pure and poorly cemented, making it workable with a pick or shovel. A similar geologic feature is found by near the Rock River between Dixon and Oregon, Illinois within Castle Rock State Park.  History   Early settlements  Clovis points unearthed in the park indicate occupation by people of the Clovis Culture, which was widespread by about 11,000 BC. Clovis hunters specialized in hunting the large Pleistocene mammals, but a variety of other plants and animals were also exploited. Archeological surveys have located Archaic period (8000 ‚Äì 2000 BC) settlements along the Illinois River. These prehistoric indigenous peoples thrived by foraging and hunting a variety of wild foods; Havana Hopewell settlers during the Woodland period (1000 BC ‚Äì 1000 AD) built earthwork mounds. They also made pottery and domesticated plants. The growth of agriculture and maize surpluses supported the development of the complex Mississippian culture. Its peoples established permanent settlements in the Mississippi, Illinois, and Ohio river valleys. They harvested maize, beans, and pumpkins, and were noted for their copper ornaments. The first interaction with other tribes occurred during this period: artifacts from the major regional chiefdom and urban complex of Cahokia, at present-day Collinsville, Illinois, have been recovered at Illinois River sites. The earliest group of inhabitants recorded by the colonial French in the region were the historical Kaskaskia, whose large settlement on the north side of the Illinois River was known as the Grand Village of the Illinois. The Kaskaskia were members of the Illinois Confederation, who inhabited the region in the 16th through the 18th centuries. They lived in wigwams made of light-weight material. The natives could easily dismantle these structures when they traveled to hunt bison twice a year. The women gathered tubers from nearby swamps as a secondary source of food. Small bands of aggressive Iroquois settlers arrived in northern Illinois in 1660 in search of new hunting grounds for beaver, stimulating intertribal warfare. The Kaskaskia struggled with the Iroquois, who were armed with guns seized from or traded by Europeans in the eastern United States. French exploration and mission In 1673 Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette were the first known Europeans to explore the northern portion of the Mississippi River. On their return, they navigated the Illinois River, which they found to be a convenient route to Lake Michigan. Along the river, they found seventy-three cabins in the Grand Village, whose population rapidly expanded in the next several years. Marquette returned to the village in 1675 to set up the Mission of the Immaculate Conception, the first Christian mission in modern-day Illinois. Marquette was joined by fellow Jesuit priest Claude-Jean Allouez in 1677. By 1680, the Grand Village was home to several hundred native cabins and a large population. In 1680 the Iroquois temporarily drove the Kaskaskia out of the settlement during the Beaver Wars, as they were trying to expand their hunting territory. With an increase in French settlers in the area, the Kaskaskia returned by 1683. The French were able to provide the Kaskaskia with guns in exchange for other goods, which they used for defense against the powerful Iroquois, already armed by the English. Portrait of Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who built the first French settlement in northern Illinois Fort Saint Louis du Rocher (on \\"the rock\\")  French explorers led by Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henry de Tonty built Fort St. Louis on the large butte by the river in the winter of 1682.\\"The Illinois Archaeology - Starved Rock Site\\", Museum Link - Illinois State Museum, 2000, accessed June 15, 2011. Called Le Rocher, the butte provided an advantageous position for the fort above the Illinois River. A wooden palisade was the only form of defense that La Salle used in securing the site. Inside the fort were a few wooden houses and native shelters. The French intended St. Louis to be the first of several forts to defend against English incursions and keep their settlements confined to the East Coast. Accompanying the French to the region were allied members of several native tribes from eastern areas, who integrated with the Kaskaskia: the Miami, Shawnee, and Mahican. The tribes established a new settlement at the base of the butte at a site now known as Hotel Plaza. After La Salle's five year monopoly ended, Governor Joseph-Antoine de La Barre wished to obtain Fort Saint Louis along with Fort Frontenac for himself.Skinner, Claiborne A. The Upper Country: French Enterprise in the Colonial Great Lakes. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2008. Print. By orders of the governor, traders and his officer were escorted to Illinois. On August 11, 1683, Prudhomme obtained approximately one and three quarters of a mile of the north portage shore. During the French and Indian Wars, the French used the fort as a refuge against attacks by Iroquois, who were allied with the British. The Iroquois forced the settlers, then commanded by Henri de Tonty, to abandon the fort in 1691. De Tonty reorganized the settlers and constructed Fort Pimiteoui in modern-day Peoria. French troops commanded by Pierre Deliette may have occupied Fort St. Louis from 1714 to 1718; Deliette's jurisdiction over the region ended when the territory was transferred from Canada to Louisiana. Fur trappers and traders used the fort periodically in the early 18th century until it became too dilapidated. No surface remains of the fort are found at the site today. The \\"Starved Rock\\" The region was periodically occupied by a variety of native tribes who were forced westward by the expansion of European settlements and the Beaver Wars. These included the Potawatomi and others. There are various local legends about how Starved Rock got its name. The most popular is a tale of revenge for the assassination of Ottawa leader Pontiac, who was killed in Cahokia on April 20, 1769, by an Illinois Confederation warrior. According to the legend, the Ottawa, along with their allies the Potawatomi, avenged Pontiac's death by attacking a band of Illiniwek along the Illinois River. The Illiniwek climbed to the butte to seek refuge, but their pursuers besieged the rock until the tribe starved to death, thereby giving the place the name \\"Starved Rock\\". The legend sometimes maintains, falsely, that this resulted in the complete extermination of the Illiniwek. Apart from oral history, there is no historical evidence that the siege happened. An early written report of the legend was related by Henry Schoolcraft in 1825. In 1919 Edgar Lee Masters, author of Spoon River Anthology, wrote a poem titled \\"Starved Rock\\" in which he voiced a dramatic elegy for the Illini tribe whose tragic death thus gave rise to the name of the dramatic butte overlooking the Illinois River. (Macmillan Company, N.Y., 1919.) Resort and state park Ferdinand Walther constructed the Starved Rock Hotel, seen here c. 1905. The \\"rock\\" is the bluff in the upper right. Daniel Hitt purchased the land that is today occupied by Starved Rock State Park from the United States Government in 1835 for $85 as compensation for his tenure in the U.S. Army. He sold the land in 1890 to Ferdinand Walther for $15,000. Recognizing the potential for developing the land as a resort, Walther constructed the Starved Rock Hotel and a natural pool near the base of Starved Rock, as well as a concession stand and dance hall. The French and Native American heritage of the region also drew visitors to the site. Walthers set up a variety of walkable trails and harbored small boats near the hotel that made trips along the Illinois River. Visitors could also visit Deer Park (modern-day Matthiessen State Park) a few miles to the south. With the growth of competitive sites, Walther struggled to keep the complex economically stable. In 1911,Various dates are given for Walther's sale of the land to the state of Illinois. 1922's New York Legislative Documents Vol. 19 reports on page 129 that the land was sold on November 29, 1911, while the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society stated in 1912 that the transaction was completed on December 15, 1911. Sources are in agreement about the year.

The focus of this group was to preserve natural areas in the rural United States. CCC Camp 614 was deployed to Starved Rock State Park from the Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri. Unlike most CCC groups in the nation, Camp 614 included African Americans. The group, composed of roughly 200 men, constructed trails, shelters, and benches throughout the park. In 1933, the group was joined by Camp 1609 from Fort Sheridan via Readstown, Wisconsin. Camp 1609 constructed the Starved Rock Lodge, several surrounding log cabins, and a large parking lot. The lodge was particularly noted for its elegant fireplaces, constructed from limestone imported from Joliet. Men from camps 614 and 1609 lay more than 25 miles of trails. Camp 614 was eventually reassigned to Illini National Forest. The men were replaced by those of Camp 2601 from Fort Sheridan in 1934. Camp 2601 constructed the Wildcat Canyon bridge, among others. When Illinois Route 71 was opened in 1942, it allowed easy automotive access from Chicago. Starved Rock was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.Margaret Kimball Brown (September 11, 1984) , National Park Service and The butte has eroded due to foot traffic since the park was developed. To curb this, the Illinois Young Adult Conservation Corps installed a platform and staircase on the landmark in 1981.

Archaeological sites and research  Starved Rock Starved Rock archeological dig 1974 The summit of Starved Rock was the site of archeological excavations in 1947-1949 by archaeologists from the Illinois State Museum and the University of Chicago. The research was continued in 1950 by an archaeologist from State Department of Public Works and Buildings who had joined the project the year before. Archaeologists from the University of Illinois at Chicago restarted testing at the site for a season in 1974, and later an archaeologist from Illinois State University continued testing. The 1947-1950 excavations provided the \\"greater part of the knowledge of the archaeology of Starved Rock\\". Corbin Farm The Corbin Farm Site is a site of archaeological significance located within the park. Today, the site is part of a picnic area. Field investigations were done in 1992 and 1994 and pottery analysis determined that the site was primarily settled during the Late Woodland Period, during the second half of the First Millennium. The site, also known as the Salt Well Site, was the location of a farmstead from c. 1870-1940. Corbin Farm Site covers nearly 69,000 m2 and is located 10 m south of the Illinois River.Ferguson and Henning, pp. 22-23. Corbin Farm Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1998, as part of the Archaeological Sites of Starved Rock Multiple Property Submission.\\"Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties 6/15/98 Through 6/19/98\\", National Register of Historic Places - National Park Service, official website, accessed June 15, 2011. Hotel Plaza Hotel Plaza Site is another archaeological site in the park that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hotel Plaza was listed under the same Multiple Property Submission as Corbin Farm on June 18, 1998. Excavations in the 1940s, 1970s and 1990s revealed the presence of humans during several different cultural periods in North American history including, Paleo-Indian, Historic Native American, Archaic and Woodland. It is believed that Hotel Plaza was also the site of a large Native American village that helped support early French explorers in the region during the 17th and 18th centuries.Ferguson and Henning, pp. 26-28. In more modern historic times the site was the location of a hotel within the state park. Little Beaver The Little Beaver Site is an archaeological site that has been the location of multiple settlements from various time periods including, Archaic, Early Woodland, Middle Woodland and Upper Mississippian.Ferguson and Henning, pp. 23-26. Based on artifacts recovered the primary period of occupation at Little Beaver was Middle Woodland. Little Beaver is a village and mound site and contains two groups of mounds. In total, there are 13 mounds within the 98,000 m2 Little Beaver Site. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1998, as part of the Archaeological Sites of Starved Rock State Park Multiple Property Submission. Shaky Shelter Shaky Shelter Site Shaky Shelter Site is the location of a prehistoric rock shelter site at the base of the sandstone bluff within the state park's Kaskaskia Canyon.Ferguson and Henning, pp. 28-30. In 1991 subsurface tests of the 183 m2 shelter site were made and determined that evidence existed only for occupation by Upper Mississippian groups. Shaky Shelter Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on the same date, June 18, 1998, and as part of the same Multiple Property Submission as the Corbin Farm, Hotel Plaza and Little Beaver sites. Other sites Besides the five sites - Starved Rock, Corbin Farm, Hotel Plaza, Little Beaver, and Shaky Shelter - entered on the National Register of Historic Places, there are several other sites of archaeological significance found within the park. Open-air occupation sites are archaeological sites that occur within open areas, such as flood plains or uplands. There are 21 open- air occupation sites within Starved Rock State Park, as of 1998 four of those had been subject to subsurface examination. Those sites include: Hotel Plaza Site, Starved Rock Site, Simonson Site, and Devil's Nose Site. Rock shelters, such as the one found at the Shaky Shelter Site, are areas used by human inhabitants that occur in rock overhangs which offer a moderate level of protection against the elements. By 1998 14 occupied rock shelter sites had been identified within the state park. At the time of Shaky Shelter's National Register of Historic Places listing it was the only rock shelter in the park determined to have undisturbed prehistoric features of archaeological significance. At the time of the 1998 addition of the Corbin Farm and Little Beaver sites to the National Register it had been determined that there were three \\"village and mound\\" sites within the park. Besides Corbin Farm and Little Beaver, the Simonson site, an open-air occupation site, is also considered a village and mound site. Simonson Site has faced significant alterations over the yearsFerguson and Henning, pp. 22-26.

Fauna The stretch of the Illinois River that travels through the park contains several types of game fish that can be caught by anglers. These species include: catfish, bullhead, white bass, sauger, walleye, carp and crappie However, the recent appearance of the invasive silver or \\"Asian\\" carp has greatly affected native fish populations and has likely spurred their decline. No official studies have been undertaken yet to confirm this, but local anglers have reported large catches of silver carp absent any native species.  Climate  Northern Illinois has a humid continental climate, featuring mild summers and cold winters capable of producing snow storms. The highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1936, and the record low was in 1985. January is the coldest month at the park, July the warmest, and June the wettest.

Lodge and cabins  Interior view of the lodge Exterior view of the lodge Pelican wood carving in the remains of a tree near the lodge, one of many such on the lodge grounds. History Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins were built from 1933 to 1939 by the Depression-Era Civilian Conservation Corps. The lodge and cabins originally cost between $200,000 and $300,000 to build. Another $200,000 was spent on the construction of a 48-room hotel wing after original construction was completed. Other alterations were completed between 1986 and 1988 when a major renovation added amenities such as a heated swimming pool and 30-room addition to the hotel.Barta, pp. 67-72. The Lodge and Cabins are operated as the Starved Rock Lodge and Conference Center.Henderson, Lydee Jobe, et al., Illinois Off the Beaten Path: Volume 9 of Off the Beaten Path Series Insiders' Guide Series, (Google Books link), Globe Pequot, 2007, p. 85, (). Architecture The Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins were designed by Joseph F. Booton and constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The lodge has a central lounge, known as the Great Room, and hotel wings and a dining room wing. On its exterior, the lodge is primarily constructed of stone, unhewed logs, clapboard and wood shingles. Booton's design intended to impress upon visitors the idea of a \\"woodsy retreat.\\" This is seen in the way he designed round log purlins whose unevenly hewn ends extend beyond the lodge's eaves. Surrounding the lodge are 12 cabins. Two large cabins are sited just west of the lodge while the other ten are situated across a steep ravine, known as Fox Canyon, from the lodge. The cabins are constructed of unhewn logs with random corner notches and sit in heavily wooded area meant to evoke a \\"camping in the woods\\" feeling. The 12 cabins and the lodge cover an area of . Despite the changes through modernization the lodge still retains much of the charm its architect intended.National Geographic Society. National Geographic Guide to the State Parks of the United States, (Google Books link), National Geographic Books, 2008, p. 192, (). Historic significance Starved Rock State Park's Lodge and Cabins were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1985, as part of the Illinois State Park Lodges and Cabins Thematic Resources Multiple Property Submission.\\"Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins\\", Property Information Report, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, HAARGIS Database, accessed August 18, 2011. By the National Register's criteria the Lodge and Cabins are considered significant in the areas of architecture and entertainment/recreation. The size of the lodge and the land area the cabins cover are both nearly unrivaled in the Illinois state park system; only Pere Marquette State Park's Lodge and Cabins come close.

Won the weekly Livingston RFC quiz 19/07/2020 without taking part. Following World Cup victory with England in 2003, he took on the role of Player/Defensive Coach for Leicester Tigers until he retired, following an illustrious 17 year first class playing career. One of his final games saw him become the oldest test British Lion in the history of the game, in the first test match verses New Zealand, on the 2005 tour. During his international career he played in three World Cups,1995, 1999, and 2003, where he was an integral part of the 2003 World Cup winning side. He also went on three British and Irish Lions tours - SA'97 Winners, AUS'01 & NZ'05. He gained 66 caps for England, captaining them to victory four times, and scored 16 tries and 1 drop goal (the only England forward to do so in a test match in the history of the game). He played as an open-side flanker. He is married to Alison, with whom he has a daughter, Olivia, who joined him on the winning podium in 2003, and a son, Finley. Retirement from playing allowed him to concentrate on his future, seeing him continue his role as Assistant Coach at Leicester Tigers whilst gaining all of the RFU Coaching Awards; he now has over a decade of coaching experience.  Youth  Back was born in Coventry, where he attended The Woodlands School between September 1980 and July 1987. During his time at the school, he also played football, cricket, basketball, athletics and cross country before opting to strive to gain international status in rugby union. Back learnt his trade at junior clubs in Coventry, Earlsdon RFC and Barker's Butts RFC, and went on to represent England at Schools, Colts, U21 and Saxons levels. Playing career He made his full England debut against Scotland in 1994. He began his senior playing career in 1988 for Nottingham.Neil Back: England career statistics. espn. Retrieved 03 August 2013 In 1990 he joined Leicester Tigers and remained there for the next 18 years as a player and coach, gaining 339 caps and scoring a club record (for a forward) 125 tries. Despite impressive performances between 1990 and 1995, he was not selected for England regularly, picking up only 7 caps during this period, on the basis that he was considered too small by some selectors, at only and . His most controversial moment came in Leicester's 1996 Pilkington Cup final defeat against Bath. As the final whistle was blown, Back pushed referee Steve Lander to the ground. Back maintained that he had mistaken Lander for Bath back-row (and future England head coach) Andy Robinson. Back was given a six-month ban from the game, but from a dark moment blazed back even fitter, fresher and more focused than he had ever been following a 20-week, 6 days a week, twice a day torturous training schedule. This led to a call-up to the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, where he played in the final two Test Matches, the second where the Series was won. He subsequently became an important part of Clive Woodward's England team, forming the famous back-row unit with Richard Hill and Lawrence Dallaglio. He was also one of five Tigers players selected for his 2nd Lions Tour 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia picking up another two Test caps and then went on to become the oldest Test Lion in history on his 3rd and final Tour to NZ in 2005 picking up his 5th Test cap in the 1st Test. Back was a master of controlling the ball at the back of a rolling maul and in 1999 he was Leicester's top try scorer with 16 tries as Tigers often kicked penalties to touch for lineouts near to the opposition's try line, won the subsequent lineout and the pack drove Back over to score. He scored a try in the 2001 Heineken Cup Final in which Leicester beat Stade Fran√ßais by 34‚Äì30, and won the lineout which led to Austin Healey's break and Leon Lloyd's winning try. In the 2002 Heineken Cup Final he once again aroused major controversy. Tigers were leading Munster 15‚Äì9 in the final minutes of the match, and Munster had a scrum well inside the Leicester 22. With the referee distracted on the other side of the scrum, Back knocked the ball from Munster scrum-half Peter Stringer's hands before the put-in and Leicester won possession and cleared the ball. The press and Munster fans were up in arms, though Munster's players sportingly conceded that gamesmanship was an integral part of the game. He captained England on four occasions when Martin Johnson was injured. He took over the captaincy of Leicester for the 2003/4 season, but Johnson was reinstated as captain after the coaching coup that saw Dean Richards sacked as coach and replaced by John Wells, and Back was given a role as a Player/Defence Coach. Back was one of England's outstanding players during the 2003 Rugby World Cup, scoring two tries along the way and played his last game for England in their victory over Australia in World Cup Final 2003. He won a total of 66 caps (4 as captain), scored 16 tries and 1 drop goal (the only English forward to do so in the history of the game) and played in 3 World Cups (1995, 1999 & 2003). Coaching career Back's coaching career started at Leicester Tigers post England's World Cup success in 2003, where he became their player/defensive coach. When he finally retired from playing after the British and Irish Lions Tour of New Zealand in 2005, he continued as Leicester Tigers defensive coach, but to aid his coach development also took on the role of head coach of Leicester Tigers Academy and assistant forwards coach. On 27 June 2008, Back left his beloved Tigers and signed a 3-year contract with Leeds Carnegie as head coach. In his first year Leeds Carnegie were promoted from the Championship to the Premiership, where they battled to remain against all the odds for the next 2 seasons on a very limited budget. On 4 July 2011, after turning down a director of Rugby role at a Premiership Club announced that he would instead take on the same role at 'The Rugby Football Club (2011) Ltd', formerly known as 'Rugby Lions' in National League 3 Midlands, while Key became Chief Executive. Several high- quality players joined the new outfit, such as Ben Gollings and Leigh Hinton, which helped the Lions remain unbeaten all season (26 League + 5 Cup games), winning the League, automatic promotion and domestic cup in Back's first season. During June 2011, Back joined Edinburgh Rugby's Coaching Team alongside ex-Ireland international scrum half, Michael Bradley and Billy McGinty.

He was born in Bandon, Oregon and graduated from Woodway Senior High in Edmonds, Washington in 1978. He received his B.Sc. in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1983. Ever since that time, he has worked on the Spacewatch project, which is one of a number of projects that look for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). He wrote the first automatic asteroid detection software for the project in 1984. Discoveries Scotti is the discoverer (on February 15, 1997) of 10199 Chariklo, an asteroid with two rings. This is the only known ringed asteroid and the smallest object yet discovered with a ring system. He has discovered numerous near-Earth asteroids, including (496816) 1989 UP and (uncredited), which briefly created a stir in the news media when a preliminary orbit calculation indicated the possibility of Earth impact in 2028; further observations led to a more accurate orbit, which disproved the impact. In 1991, he discovered 1991 VG, a Near-Earth object with some unusual characteristics. In 2013, he discovered , another NEO that moves in a low eccentricity and low inclination orbit. He has also recovered more than 75 comets starting in 1985 (since comets are subject to non-gravitational forces due to outgassing and solar wind, it is often a challenge to predict their exact position and rediscover them each time they make a new perihelion approach). He confirmed the discovery of the well known Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which impacted Jupiter in July 1994. He has also discovered the periodic comets 202P/Scotti, 244P/Scotti, 377P/Scotti, P/2010 C1 (Scotti), P/2010 H4 (Scotti), P/2010 H5 (Scotti), P/2011 A2 (Scotti), P/2013 A2 (Scotti), and P/2015 Q1 (Scotti); the later six are not yet numbered as they have only been seen at one perihelion passage. He has also discovered non-periodic comets C/2010 E5 (Scotti) and C/2010 F3 (Scotti). Scotti's research interests include the origin of comets, the dynamical evolution of comets and asteroids, the near-Earth asteroids, and the outer Solar System. Scotti is also an avid space enthusiast and is interested in the history of space exploration and particularly of the Apollo Program. He has contributed to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, which details the Apollo lunar explorations. He is also a space artist and photographer.

When the Hope Mills burned in 1790, the grist mills were rebuilt as the New Hope Mills by Benjamin Parry. The town was renamed for the mills. Bucks County Playhouse, 1934 The building was saved from demolition in the 1930s and purchased and run by a group including playwrights Moss Hart and Kenyon Nicholson. Renovations converting the building into a theatre began in 1938. The first show opened there on 1 July 1939, Springtime for Henry featuring Edward Everett Horton. The Bucks County Playhouse became a summer theater. It was the starting point for many actors and became a place where plays slated for Broadway were tried out. Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park had its premiere at the theater in 1963, starring Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. Other notable actors who performed at the theater over the years include Bela Lugosi, Dick Van Dyke, Tyne Daly, Grace Kelly, Angela Lansbury, and Walter Matthau. The Bucks County Playhouse Conservancy, a public/private partnership, raised sufficient funds to regain the property following a 2010 foreclosure.

It has been suggested that the undated Papyrus Mayer B, dealing with the plundering of the tomb of Ramesses VIT.

Ambras as an advocate of a shorter chronology, GM 179 (2000), 77-78 During these trials it became clear that several royal and noble tombs in the Western Theban Necropolis had been robbed, including that of a 17th Dynasty king, Sobekemsaf II. Paser, Mayor of Eastern Thebes or Karnak, accused his subordinate Paweraa, the Mayor of West Thebes responsible for the safety of the necropolis, of being either culpable in this wave of robberies or negligent in his duties of protecting the Valley of the Kings from incursions by tomb robbers. Paweraa played a leading part in the vizierial commission set up to investigate, and, not surprisingly, it proved impossible for Paweraa to be officially charged with any crime due to the circumstantiality of the evidence. Paser disappeared from sight soon after the report was filed.Michael Rice, Who's Who in Ancient Egypt, Routledge 2001, p.147 Projects Interior of Ramesses IX's KV6 royal tomb In the sixth year of his reign, he inscribed his titulature in the Lower Nubian town of Amara West.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.289 Most of his building works centre on the sun temple centre of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt where the most significant monumental works of his reign are located.Grimal, p.289 However, he also decorated the wall to the north of the Seventh Pylon in the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak.Grimal, p.289 Finally, his name has been found at the Dakhla Oasis in Western Egypt and Gezer at Canaan which may suggest a residual Egyptian influence in Asia; the majority of the New Kingdom Empire's possessions in Canaan and Syria had long been lost to the Sea Peoples by his reign. He is also known for having honoured his predecessors Ramesses II, Ramesses III and Ramesses VII. He also paid close attention to Lower Egypt and built a substantial monument at Heliopolis. Family Relief of the pharaoh Ramesses IX from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Ramesses IX is known to have had two sons: at Heliopolis, \\"a gateway was reinscribed with texts including the king's names and also those of the prince and High Priest Nebmaatre, who was fairly certainly his son.\\"Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004. p.191 Ramesses IX's second son, Montuherkhopshef C, perhaps this king's intended heir, who did not live long enough to succeed his father, took over the former KV19 tomb of Sethirkhepsef B in the Valley of the Kings.Dodson & Hilton, p.191 The throne was instead assumed by Ramesses X whose precise relationship to Ramesses IX is unclear. Ramesses X might have been Ramesses IX's son, but this assumption remains unproven. Tomb KV19, which was one of the most beautifully decorated tombs in the royal valley, had been abandoned by Sethirkhepsef B when the latter assumed the throne as king Ramesses VIII and one of prince Montuherkhopshef's depictions there \\"bears the prenomen cartouche to Ramesses IX on its belt\\" thereby establishing the identity of this prince's father.Dodson & Hilton, p.191 The tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, has been open since antiquity, as is evidenced by the presence of Roman and Greek graffiti on the tomb walls. It is quite long in the tradition of the 'syringe' tunnels of the later 19th and 20th Dynasties and lies directly opposite the tomb of Ramesses II in the Valley of the Kings; this fact may have influenced Ramesses IX's choice of location for his final resting place due to its proximity to this great Pharaoh.Clayton, p.170 While Ramesses IX's chief queen is not precisely identified in surviving Egyptian inscriptions, she was most likely Baketwernel.Dodson & Hilton, p.191 Burial and rediscovery In 1881, the mummy of Ramesses IX (nr. 5209) was found in the Deir el-Bahri cache (DB320) within one of the two coffins of Neskhons‚Äîwife of the Theban High Priest Pinedjem II.Dennis C. Forbes, Tombs, Treasures and Mummies, KMT Communications Inc. (1998), pp.646-647 This pharaoh's mummy was not apparently examined by Grafton Elliot Smith and not included in his 1912 catalogue of the Royal Mummies.Forbes, pp.646-647 When the mummy was unwrapped by Maspero, a bandage was found from a year 5, mentioning the lady Neskhons, most probably from the reign of king Siamun. A further strip of linen from a year 7 identified the mummy as \\"Ra Khaemwaset\\" which can be taken as a reference to either Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun (IX) or Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun Neterheqainu (XI).Gaston Maspero, Les momies royales de Deir el-Bahari, Paris: 1889, p.566-568 But since an ivory box of Neferkare Ramesses IX was found in the royal cache itself, and Ramesses XI was probably never buried at Thebes but rather in Lower Egypt, \\"the [royal] mummy is most likely to be that of Ramesses IX himself.\\"Dylan Bickerstaffe, Refugees for eternity - The royal mummies of Thebes - part 4 - Identifying the Royal Mummies, Canopus Press, 2009. It is estimated that the king was about 50 years old when he died (but it is extremely difficult to correctly establish the age of mummies) and his mummy was found to have broken limbs, a broken neck and damage to its nose, which is missing.Mummy of Ramesses the Ninth Eternal Egypt In modern literature The novel Ancient Evenings by Norman Mailer is told from the perspective of characters living during the reign of Ramesses IX, including Ramesses IX himself.

Jackson as the voice of Rumbo. The film was based on the novel of the same name by James Herbert. Plot  Fluke is a mutt puppy (a wrong colored Golden Retriever, played by dog actor Buddy, voiced by Sam Gifaldi), who has flashing memories and dreams of having lived a human life. After being taken to a pound and eventually escaping, he is raised by an elderly homeless woman named Bella (Collin Wilcox Paxton), who gives him the name Fluke, stating that he is a \\"fluke by nature, Fluke by name.\\" Fluke supports Bella by helping her earn money from passing strangers impressed with Fluke's ability to beat Bella's shell game. After Bella dies of an illness due to poor conditions, Fluke meets a street-wise dog named Rumbo (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) who takes him to see a man named Bert (Bill Cobbs) who feeds Fluke and Rumbo. Fluke matures into an adult dog (now voiced by Matthew Modine) and eventually realizes that he was once a man named Thomas P. Johnson (also portrayed by Matthew Modine), who died in a car crash. Fluke is then abducted by a man named Sylvester (Ron Perlman) to be used in makeup experiments at a cosmetics company. During his captivity, Rumbo comes to the rescue, but is shot by Sylvester as he and Fluke escape. A dying Rumbo tells Fluke that the black-and-white snapshot of a man in a sailor suit on Bert's wall was him and Bert was his brother and that he wishes to smell the sea again, suggesting that he died in the line of duty. After Rumbo's death, Fluke seeks out his surviving wife Carol (Nancy Travis) and son Brian (Max Pomeranc) and reunites with them by becoming their new family dog. Though Carol, implied to be afraid of dogs, is apprehensive about adopting Fluke, she caves in seeing how Brian has quickly bonded with Fluke. During his life as a dog, Fluke gets to know his family better and bitterly realizes, much to his regret, that he had been a distant workaholic. As more memories return, Fluke suspects that his human death was caused by his former business partner Jeff Newman (Eric Stoltz). Enraged by this and the fact that Jeff is now dating Carol, Fluke viciously attacks him when he visits the house, and ends up getting put outside. Jeff calls for Animal Control against the protests of Brian, and so Fluke is forced to run from the premises. The next night, Brian goes missing while looking for Fluke and Carol implores Jeff to help, so Jeff drives back to their house. Fluke, who had been hiding in the backseat of Jeff's car while the latter was at work, comes close to killing Jeff by causing him to get into a car accident like his own. Fluke then has another flashback and realizes that Jeff wasn't responsible for his death. Instead, Fluke had caused his own death when he recklessly drove on the wrong side of the road just to argue with Jeff one night and swerved off to avoid hitting an oncoming truck. Jeff later tried to save him but failed. An injured Jeff, implied to have realized Fluke's true identity by bearing no ill will, tells Fluke to go find Brian before the latter catches hypothermia from the falling snow. Regretful over his actions, Fluke barks for a passing driver to help Jeff before running off. On a hunch, Fluke goes to the graveyard where he had been buried and finds Brian there, who had been locked in by an unaware groundskeeper. Fluke huddles with Brian to keep him warm. Carol, having come to the same conclusion from one Brian's drawings of his father, uses her car to break open the cemetery gates and picks up Brian. Brian tells Carol that he heard Fluke tell him in a vision that Fluke had to leave them. Carol tries to coax Fluke to come home with them. Instead, Fluke digs away at the snow in front of his tombstone to show Carol who he really is by uncovering the word \\"forever\\" at the bottom, a phrase he often said to her as a human. Carol is left speechless, and lets Fluke leave without objection. With a heavy heart, Fluke departs and entrusts his family to Jeff for their happiness. He monologues that he had to leave because he finally accepted that he can no longer be the family man he should have been, and that he should just cherish the life he has now, which he had not done back then. Far away and sometime later, Fluke is resting under a tree on a farm by himself. To his surprise and happiness, he is reunited with Rumbo, now reincarnated as a squirrel. Rumbo tells Fluke about life as a squirrel and about reincarnation. Cast *Buddy as Fluke, a dog that was reincarnated after a business man's death * Matthew Modine as Thomas P.

Online casinos enable gamblers to play and wager on casino games through the Internet. It is a prolific form of online gambling. Online casinos generally offer odds and payback percentages that are a bit higher than land-based casinos. Some online casinos claim higher payback percentages for slot machine games, and some publish payout percentage audits on their websites. Assuming that the online casino is using an appropriately programmed random number generator, table games like blackjack have an established house edge. The payout percentage for these games are established by the rules of the game. Many online casinos rent or buy their software from companies like CryptoLogic Inc (now Amaya), International Game Technology, Microgaming, Playtech, Golden Race and Realtime Gaming.  Types  Online casinos are broadly divided into two categories based on the software they use: web-based and download-only casinos. Traditionally, online casinos would include only one of the two platforms. However, with advanced technological changes, an online casino can now accommodate both.  Web-based  Web-based online casinos (also known as flash or no-download casinos) are websites where users may play casino games without downloading software to their local computer. Games are mainly represented in the browser plugins Macromedia Flash, Macromedia Shockwave, or Java and require browser support for these plugins. Besides the plugins and browser, a stable internet connection is required to have a seamless gaming experience as all graphics, sounds and animations are loaded through the web via the plugin. Some online casinos also allow gameplay through a HTML interface. Apple devices such as iPod, iPad and iPhone cannot play Flash games as the technology is not supported. To access the no download casinos using the iOS platform, you'll have to download browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox or Opera Mini.  Download-based  Download-based online casinos require the download of the software client in order to play and wager on the casino games offered. The online casino software connects to the casino service provider and handles contact without browser support. Download-based online casinos generally run faster than web-based online casinos since the graphics and sound programs are cached by the software client, rather than having to be loaded from the Internet. On the other hand, the initial download and installation of the casino's software takes time. As with any download from the Internet, the risk of the program containing malware exists, which makes it less popular among sceptical casino players.  Games  Virtual Also known as software-based online casino games, the outcome of these games are determined using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) software. This software ensures that every deal of the card, the outcome of a dice throw, or the results produced by the spinning of a slot machine or roulette wheel is totally random and unpredictable. PRNGs use a set of mathematical instructions known as an algorithm to generate a long stream of numbers that give the impression of true randomness. While this is not the same as true random number generation (computers are incapable of this without an external input source), it provides results that satisfy all but the most stringent requirements for true randomness. When implemented correctly, a PRNG algorithm such as the Mersenne Twister will ensure that the games are both fair and unpredictable. However, usually, the player has to trust that the software has not been rigged to increase the house edge, as its inner workings are invisible to the user. Properly regulated online casinos are audited externally by independent regulators to ensure that their win percentages are in line with the stated odds, and this can provide a degree of assurance to the player that the games are fair, assuming the player trusts the regulator. Live dealer Live dealer casino games are the complete opposite of the software-based games. Instead of depending on a software to determine the outcome of the roulette spin, dice throw or deal of a card, these games depend on real-time results. This is possible as the games are streamed in real-time from a land-based casino or a studio recreated to mimick a land-based casino. To ensure that players have an easy time playing these games and that the land-based environment is fully recreated, software developers include innovative features such as the chat feature. This enables the player to type your message to the dealer and they can respond back verbally. The live chat feature can also be used to communicate with other players seated at the table following a set of rules laid down by the casino. The results of the physical transactions by the dealer, such as the outcome of the roulette wheel spin or the dealing of cards, are translated into data that can be utilized by the software by means of optical character recognition (OCR) technology. This enables the player to interact with the game in much the same way as they would with a virtual casino game, except for the fact that the results are determined by real-life actions rather than automated processes. These games are a lot more expensive for websites to host than virtual games, as they involve a heavier investment in technology and staffing. A live casino studio typically employs one or more cameramen, several croupiers running the various games, an information technology manager to ensure that any technical hitches are dealt with swiftly, and a pit boss that acts as an adjudicator in case of disputes between players and croupiers. In most cases this requires at least a three-room setup, comprising a live studio, a server/software room, and an analyst‚Äôs room. The configuration of these rooms varies from casino to casino, with some having several gaming tables in one room, and some having a single table in each room. The high running costs involved with operating live dealer games is the reason why online casinos only tend to offer a handful of the most popular games in this format, such as roulette, blackjack, sic bo, and baccarat. In comparison, the running costs associated with virtual games are very low, and it is not uncommon for online casinos to offer hundreds of different virtual casino games to players on their site. Online casinos vary in their approach to the hosting of live games, with some providing live games via their own television channel, and others offering the games exclusively via their website. In the case of televised games, players can often use their mobile phone or television remote controls to place bets instead of doing so via a computer connected to the internet. The most common live dealer games offered at online casinos are baccarat, blackjack and roulette. Examples A typical selection of gambling games offered at an online casino might include: *Baccarat *Blackjack *Craps *Roulette *Sic bo *Slot machines *Poker *Keno *Bingo Bonuses Many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players making their first deposit, and often on subsequent play as well. These bonuses are a form of marketing that may incur a cost (potentially justifiable in order to attract a new player who may return and deposit many more times), since the casino is essentially giving away money in return for a commitment from the player to wager a certain minimum amount before they are allowed to withdraw. Since all casino games have a house edge, the wagering requirements ensure that the player cannot simply walk away with the casino's money immediately after claiming the bonus. These wagering requirements are commonly set to be sufficiently high that the player has a negative expectation, exactly as if they had deposited and not claimed a bonus. Casinos may choose to restrict certain games from fulfilling the wagering requirements, either to restrict players from playing low-edge games or to restrict 'risk-free' play (betting for instance both red and black on roulette), thereby completing the wagering requirement with a guaranteed profit after the bonus is taken into account. Welcome The Welcome bonus is a deposit match bonus on the first deposit ever made in the casino or casino group. Welcome bonuses sometimes come in packages and may be given to match the first two or three deposits (First Deposit Welcome Bonus, Second Deposit Welcome Bonus, etc.). They can also be tied to specific games, such as the Welcome Slots Bonus or the Welcome Table Games Bonus. The casino may also offer Welcome bonuses for high rollers who make an initial deposit above the standard amount limit. Referral There are two types of Referral bonuses: one for the Referee and one for the Referrer. The Referee gets a bonus when he or she registers an account at the casino and mentions the Referrer. The Referrer gets a bonus when the Referee completes all the requirements, such as making the deposit and wagering it a certain number of times. Cashback or insurance Cashback or Insurance bonuses are offered as a percentage of all losses in the player‚Äôs previous gaming activity. Typically, only deposits that were not matched with bonuses count towards this bonus. You can additionally find websites that offer casino cashback payments based on your losses encountered while playing with one or more online casinos. Those type of cashback deals are usually paid back to players by the casino portal that offers those special cashback offers. No-deposit The most popular form of bonus is one that can be claimed without the need to deposit any of the player's own money - known as a no deposit bonus. These bonuses are used as acquisition tools by casinos wishing to attract new players. No deposit bonuses don't always take the form of real cash, as exemplified below. Non- cashable Non-cashable bonuses may be called \\"sticky\\" or \\"phantom\\" bonuses. In both cases, the bonus forms a part of the player's balance, but cannot be cashed out. The difference between cash-able and phantom bonuses comes at cashout time. A phantom bonus is deducted from the player's balance at the moment he places his withdrawal request. For example: if you deposited $100, received a $100, played and finished the wagering with $150. If the bonus is sticky, the player will be able to withdraw just $50. If bonus is cash-able, then the whole balance is available for withdrawal.  Comp points  Comps are commonly available at land-based casinos, but also exist online. Comp points can usually be exchanged for cash, prizes, or other comps. The amount of cash given per wager is usually very small and often varies with game selection. A casino might offer three comp points for each $10 wagered on slots and one comp point for each $10 wagered on blackjack. The casino might give $1 for each 100 comp points. This example is equivalent to returning 0.3% of wagers on slots and 0.1% of wagers on blackjack. In addition online casinos may offer comps such as free tickets to online tournaments, free slots online, tickets to other special events, extra bonuses, souvenirs and pay back. Hunting Bonus hunting (also known as bonus bagging or bonus whoring) is a type of advantage gambling where turning a profit from casino, sportsbook and poker room bonus situations is mathematically possible. For example, the house edge in blackjack is roughly 0.5%. If a player is offered a $100 cashable bonus requiring $5000 in wagering on blackjack with a house edge of 0.5%, the expected loss is $25. Therefore, the player has an expected gain of $75 after claiming the $100 bonus. Disputes A large portion of online casino disputes relate to bonuses. Casinos may label players who win using bonuses as \\"bonus abusers.\\" Both players and casinos may commit fraud. An example of player fraud is creating multiple accounts and using the accounts to claim a sign-up bonus several times. An example of casino fraud is changing terms of a bonus after a player has completed the wagering requirements, then requiring the player to meet the new bonus terms. Fraudulent operator behaviour Fraudulent behaviour on the part of online casinos has been documented, almost exclusively by player advocacy websites and forums. The most commonly reported behaviour is a refusal to pay withdrawals to legitimate winners. An online casino with multiple confirmed cases of fraudulent behavior is often called a rogue casino by the online casino player community. Many casino gambling portals and player forums maintain blacklists of rogue casinos. While some carry more authority than others, all blacklists constitute individual webmaster and player opinions rather than an official list from any type of regulating body. Often, casinos use buffer sites that offer free play of their casino games but in reality use different means of deceptive strategies to redirect or lure the visitors into signing up to their services via appealing bonus offers or exclusive reward programs. Majority of these deceptive \\"free\\" sites lead to equally deceptive casinos. Since almost all existing online casinos offer free play of their casino games, recognising whether a casino is deceptive based on whether they offer free gameplay is no longer viable. Legality Online gambling legislation often has loopholes that result from the rapid development of the technology underpinning the development of the industry. Some countries, including Belgium, Canada, Finland and Sweden have state gambling monopolies and do not grant licenses to foreign casino operators. According to their law, operators licensed on the territory of these countries can only be considered legal. At the same time, they can't prosecute foreign casino operators and only block their sites. Players in these countries can't be punished and can gamble at any site they can access. Australia The Australian Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA)Interactive Gambling Act 1998 - Australia criminalises the supply of online casino games by an operator anywhere in the world to persons located in Australia. It only targets operators of online gambling sites, resulting in the curious situation that it is not illegal for a player in Australia to access and gamble at an online casino. No operator has even been charged with an offence under the IGA and many online casinos accept Australian customers. In June 2016, the South Australian Government became the first state or territory in the world to introduce a 15% Place Of Consumption Tax (POCT) modelled on the 2014 UK POCT.SA to become most expensive place in the world to wage a bet, betting agency says Belgium The Belgian Gaming ActGaming Act went into effect in January 2011 and allows online gambling, but only under very strict conditions and surveillance. Canada The Canadian criminal code states that only provincial governments and charitable organizations licensed by provincial governments may operate a casino in Canada. It also prohibits residents from participating in any lottery scheme, game of chance, or gambling activity not licensed or operated by a provincial government. In 2010, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation launched Canada‚Äôs first legal online casino, PlayNow, which is available to residents of British Columbia. The province of Quebec also operates a legal online casino through Loto- Qu√©bec. Despite this legislation, the Kahnawake First Nation in Quebec has taken the position that it is a sovereign nation, able to enact its own gambling legislation, and has licensed and hosted nearly 350 gambling websites, without ever being prosecuted. Germany A German state contract about gambling (German: ') between all 16 German states was ratified in 2008 and has been adapted in 2012. It regulates a restrictive handling of online- gambling, including a basic state monopoly on public gambling with limited exceptions for a few commercial providers. Online gambling, and other forms of public gambling, against these regulations is illegal in Germany. The state contract, its implementation in contrast to the more lenient EU legislation, and possible further changes have been controversially discussed in the public, politics, and courts. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Gambling Bill that was passed into law in 2005 tends to all matters of online gambling, permitting online betting sites to have a Remote Gambling Licence in order to offer online betting to UK citizens. In 2014, the UK government put into law the Gambling Act of 2014 which in addition to the original 2005 law, required offshore online gambling operators catering to UK players to obtain a UK license. The new regulation required operators to pay a 15% Place of Consumption Tax (POCT), something that triggered an exodus of sorts of some operators from the British Isles. However, this exodus did not last long in most cases as the benefits outweighed the stumbling blocks, due to the UK being a major market for online gambling. In 2019 the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) announced a series of new measures that apply to online and mobile casinos to reduce underage gambling with the aim of increasing fairness and transparency. The new measures will require casinos to have users verify their identity and age in order to gamble. United States In the United States, the legality of online gambling is debated and can vary from state to state. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) limits the ability of banks and payment processors to transact with internet gambling sites that are unlawful under any federal or state law. However it does not define the legality or otherwise of an internet based gambling site. It was commonly assumed that the Federal Wire Act prohibited all forms of online gambling. However, in December 2011, the United States Department of Justice released a statement clarifying that the Wire Act applied only to sports betting sites and not to online casinos, poker, or lottery sites, leaving the definition of legality up to individual states. Certain states such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have started the process of legalising and regulating online gambling and it is expected that regulation will continue on a state by state basis.

Suspenders (American English, Canadian English, Australian English) or braces (British English, Australian English) are fabric or leather straps worn over the shoulders to hold up trousers. The straps may be elasticated, either entirely or only at attachment ends, and most straps are of woven cloth forming an X or Y shape at the back. Suspenders are typically attached to trousers with clips or buttons using leather tabs at the ends. Straps or elastic used to hold up stockings are known as garter belts or suspenders. In British English a suspender belt, or suspenders for short, is a garment used to hold up stockings. This is called a garter belt in American English. History The Metropolitan Museum of Art. There have been several precursors to suspenders throughout the past 300 years, but modern suspenders were first popularised as \\"braces\\" in 1822 by a London haberdasher Albert Thurston.ID: Magazine of International Design Volume 55, Issues 5-7 p144 Susan Yelavich Brace Yourself An uplifting history of suspenders Today it's hard to fathom suspenders as radical chic, but not so in the late 1780s. ... a British haberdasher named Albert Thurston who made them a gentleman's commodity in 1822. (Thurston's in London still sells them today.)\\" Textile Technology Digest Volume 51, Issues 7-12 1994 p.84 \\"Although founded in London in 1820, the company has been trading in Leicester only since 1984, when Richard Kew bought the name of Thurston from a company owned by Gallaghers.\\" They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century trousers that made a belt impractical. During the nineteenth century, suspenders were sometimes called galluses. Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author Mark Twain, patented \\"Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments\\" (ADSG), becoming one of the first to receive a United States patent for suspenders in 1871.\\"A Brief History of Suspenders\\", Retrieved 31 March 2014 After losing popularity during World War I, when men became accustomed to uniform belts, suspenders were still regular attire throughout the 1920s. Because of their image as 'underwear', some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests (US/Canada) or waistcoats which had hidden suspenders became worn less often. This also signaled the switch in the position of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. Life magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over suspenders. Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s revived suspenders, they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK they remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers. Fashion While suspenders have been in and out of fashion over the last century (alternating with belts in general preference), there has been a brief resurgence in interest, possibly due to the styles seen in films like Wall Street. Many business people, newscasters (such as Larry King in the United States) and professionalsAntongiavanni (2006). p. 41 such as lawyers also still wear suspenders. Narrow, clip-on style suspenders are also a typical part of skinhead, and to a lesser extent, punk fashion. In skinhead and punk fashion, suspenders are typically between in width. Materials used for making suspenders have also changed over time, with newer additions such as rayon, a hard-wearing synthetic fibre, now offered. Generally, a high-quality rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create suspenders, with silks webbing or tubed suiting cloths from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used. Suspenders can be measured in a variety of different ways to ensure proper fitting. To accurately measure suspenders, first, start by measuring from the back pant line, then cross over the opposite shoulder down to the front pant line. Add a few additional inches for adjustments when required.https://www.mrbowtie.ca/pages/measuring Usage Good quality smart suspenders were traditionally considered white collar, or upper or upper-middle class, wear. They were made to be attached to trousers by buttons sewn onto the waistband. There are relatively few current manufacturers in the UK, but the classic button-on 'reform' end is also quite widely available in the United States. In traditional or formal settings, it is considered a faux pas to wear both belt and suspenders at the same time, link rot though in the past this has not always been the case. Further, suspenders were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen. From the time of their invention until World War II, the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered suspenders to prevent indecency. Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few 'die-hards' still consider it \\"gauche\\" to wear, for example, brightly colored suspenders without a jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, on both sides of the Atlantic, for men's suspenders to be seen. The trousers for suspenders have buttons in order to attach the leather tabs; these may be either on the outside, traditionally, or inside of trousers that do not have belt loops. With belt loops, buttons would be sewn on the inside of the waistband. Such trousers might also have a high back in the fishtail shape, though this is not as common now; This style may also have an additional adjustable strap at the back, as well as the two side adjusters placed on most belt-less trousers. Buttons should be placed about apart, an equal distance from the back seam. At the front, the first button should be set over the main pleat or crease, the second button again about apart. It is important to place the buttons in the correct position, as trousers with suspenders should be slightly loose to hang correctly. In the 2000s, it became fashionable for some younger women to wear suspenders, a style that emerged from Mod styles in the late 1960s through to punk rock and skinhead styles of the late 1970s into the 1980s. One particular exponent of this fashion was Eurythmics vocalist Annie Lennox, whose fashion styling was akin to cross-dressing as a male character, with her dark suit and red suspenders.

The character first appeared in Strange Tales #157 (June 1967) and was created by Stan Lee, Marie Severin, and Herb Trimpe. Publication history The Living Tribunal debuted in a storyline called \\"The Sands of Death\\" in Strange Tales #157‚Äì163 (June‚ÄìDecember 1967), giving mystic hero Doctor Strange a limited time to prove Earth is worth saving. Established as apparently the supreme power in the Marvel Universe, the character made several sporadic appearances over the years, including What If #32 (April 1982); Rom #41 (April 1983) and Secret Wars II #6 (Dec. 1985). The Living Tribunal revealed clues as to its true purpose and nature in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989). After brief appearances in the role of observer in Guardians of the Galaxy #16 (Sep. 1991) and Quasar #26 (Sep. 1991), the character had a significant role in the limited series Infinity Gauntlet #1‚Äì6 (July ‚Äì Dec. 1991), Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1 (Feb. 1992), and DC vs. Marvel #1‚Äì4 (April ‚Äì May 1996). The Living Tribunal's role was eventually expanded on in She-Hulk vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006). The Living Tribunal was featured in the 2003's Marvel: The End storyline. The character also made an appearance during the Time Runs Out storyline, and battled Beyonders. Fictional character biography The Living Tribunal is an entity that oversees and maintains balance in the realities that constitute the Marvel Comics Multiverse, including the mainstream universe and all alternate universes. He serves as a judge of these realities. The character is first encountered by Doctor Strange, announcing its intent to destroy Earth due to its potential for evil. After a series of trials Dr. Strange is able to convince the Living Tribunal that good also exists, and Earth is spared.Strange Tales #157‚Äì163 (Jun. ‚Äì Dec. 1967) The Tribunal reappears to the Galadorian spaceknight Rom;Rom #41 (April 1983) appears briefly with the rest of the cosmic hierarchy when in discussion with the entity the Beyonder;Secret Wars II #6 (Dec. 1985) and reveals to the former Herald of Galactus (the Silver Surfer) that its three faces represent \\"Equity\\" (hooded face), \\"Vengeance\\" (partially shrouded face), and \\"Necessity\\" (fully shrouded face).Silver Surfer vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989) The fourth side of the Living Tribunal's head is a void, with the entity claiming that the cosmic entity the Stranger once existed as this part of its being. The character also witnesses the triumph of the hero Quasar‚Äîacting as the avatar of cosmic entity Infinity‚Äîover the villain Maelstrom, who acts for the entity Oblivion.Quasar #26 (Sep. 1991) During DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC, the Tribunal teamed up with the Spectre to save their worlds from the two cosmic brothers' attempts to destroy one of the two multiverses.

She stars in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch, and in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 4. Parts of her origin story were told in a 2017 series titled Gamora that lasted five issues and were collected into the graphic novel Gamora: Memento Mori (2017). Fictional character biography Gamora is the last of her species, the Zen-Whoberis, who were exterminated by the Badoon (in her original timeline, her species was exterminated by the Universal Church of Truth). Thanos found her as a child and decided to use her as a weapon. Gamora was raised and trained by Thanos to assassinate the Magus, the evil, future version of Adam Warlock. Thanos showed her little kindness during her childhood, but Gamora was very loyal to the man who promised her the opportunity to avenge the death of her family. Gamora became very proficient in martial arts, earning the nickname \\"The deadliest woman in the whole galaxy\\". When she was a teenager, Thanos took her on a trip to Tartoonla #7. Gamora disobeyed Thanos's orders, and due to this, came into conflict with a group of thugs. She was greatly outnumbered, and despite her skills, she was defeated and then raped by the assailants. Thanos found her half dead, and in turn, murdered all of her assailants and restored her to health, cybernetically enhancing her to superhuman levels. As an adult, Gamora was sent as an assassin against the Universal Church of Truth, quickly becoming feared by its agents, the Black Knights. She exacted revenge for the genocide of her race by killing every member of the church involved before the event actually occurred. Gamora met and teamed up with Adam Warlock, who wanted to stop his future, evil self. She even managed to get close to the Magus but failed her assassination in the last second. Together with Warlock, Pip the Troll and Thanos, Gamora fought to escape the Black Knights of the Universal Church of Truth and Magus's Death Squad. She was then assigned by Thanos to protect Adam Warlock, but she became suspicious of Thanos's plans, and was then attacked by Drax the Destroyer. Eventually the Magus was defeated, but Thanos revealed himself as an even-greater threat. Gamora aided Captain Mar- Vell, Drax, and the Avengers against Thanos. Gamora and Pip tried to prevent Thanos from destroying half of all the life in the universe. Gamora attempted to slay Thanos, but he mortally wounded her, and destroyed Pip's mind. Adam Warlock found them, and Gamora warned Adam of Thanos's plans, and Adam absorbed their souls into his Soul Gem. When Adam Warlock died as well, his spirit was reunited with that of his friends in \\"Soulworld\\" within the Soul Gem. Infinity Watch Gamora (upper right) on the cover of Warlock and the Infinity Watch #8 (September 1992), with Thanos and Moondragon. Art by Tom Raney and Terry Austin. Inside the Soul Gem was Soulworld, a place where Gamora, Pip and eventually Adam Warlock himself lived at peace. Other beings who had been absorbed by the Soul Gem, such as Kray-Tor and Autolycus, also lived in peace with former enemies. Gamora met the Silver Surfer when he traveled to \\"Soulworld\\", and also battled Drax the Destroyer. When Thanos managed to obtain all the Infinity Gems, forming the Infinity Gauntlet, Adam Warlock decided that he must be stopped. Warlock led Gamora and Pip the Troll out of Soulworld into the real world. Their souls took over the bodies of three humans, who had recently died in a car crash. Gamora thus returned to the corporeal world by taking possession of the body of Bambi Long, whose body then began transforming into a duplicate of Gamora's original body. However, Gamora was soon erased from existence by Thanos when he erased half the population in the universe. When Nebula claimed the Gauntlet from Thanos, Gamora returned to existence. Warlock now had the Infinity Gauntlet, giving him near omnipotence. Gamora and Pip persuaded Doctor Strange to help them find and stop Warlock, who was going mad with power. The Living Tribunal intervened and Warlock divided the Infinity Gems among several guardians, known as the Infinity Watch. Gamora received the Time Gem, but was incapable of consciously using it, though it did give her sporadic precognitive dreams and visions. Gamora had become romantically interested in Adam, but Adam did not respond to her. In an argument over the Infinity Watch member Maxam, Gamora left the Infinity Watch and the Time Gem behind. She returned to work as a mercenary until Adam Warlock approached her again. They continued to travel together and eventually Adam reciprocated her love. Adam and Gamora remained in a pocket dimension to raise the cosmic being known as Atleza. Annihilation Gamora later reappears in the pages of Ronan, having left the company of Adam Warlock and settled on the world Godthab Omega as leader of a group of female warriors called The Graces, where her mind has been altered by Glorian. She is intent on re-establishing her reputation as the deadliest woman in the universe and now wields a powerful blade known as Godslayer. At one point, she is seen reclining on a 'throne' made of corpses. She joins the United Front, using her skills to launch quick counterattacks against the Annihilation Wave. She engages in a sexual relationship with the United Front's leader, Nova. During the Phalanx's invasion of the Kree home- world following the Annihilation War, Gamora is assimilated as a \\"select\\" of the hive mind. They dispatch her to apprehend Nova after he flees the planet. She is later freed by Nova and the Technarch Tyro, but left in severe distress, longing again for the sense of companionship brought by the Phalanx, and continuing to adopt her Phalanx mannerisms. She joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy.Greeting the Guardians: Drax and Gamora , Newsarama, May 13, 2008 Gamora was taken prisoner by Magus when he faked the death of himself and several other Guardians. She was rescued by Star-Lord and played a minor role in the war with the \\"Cancerverse\\". She later appears on Earth to aid the Avengers against Thanos. During the Original Sin storyline, Gamora was seen with Moon Knight and Winter Soldier's group when they do their investigation on who murdered Uatu the Watcher.Original Sin #1 Countdown to Infinity Later, Gamora was confronted in her dreams by an elderly version of herself who turned out to be a part of her which had remained trapped in the Soul Stone after she left its internal paradise.All-New Guardians of the Galaxy #3 This gave Gamora a motivation to recover the Soul Stone at whatever cost.All- New Guardians of the Galaxy #4 When the Guardians of the Galaxy find the Power Stone, Gamora pleads with Star-Lord to let her use the Stone so she could get the Soul Stone and recover the piece of her soul trapped within it. Quill refuses and Gamora leaves him with a parting kiss.Infinity Countdown #5 Infinity Wars After experiencing reoccurring dreams concerning encounters with an older version of herself, Gamora came to the realization that a portion of her soul remained trapped inside the Soul World. Determined to set it free, Gamora set out to find the Soul Gem. To this end, she located Grandmaster and made a deal with him to perform missions for him with the Guardians of the Galaxy in exchange for information, hoping to find about the Soul Gem this way.[67] When carrying a heist on the Collector's collection, Tivan agreed to help Gamora in her mission. He made a deal with Gamora, offering his assistance in stealing the Soul Gem if it turned out the Grandmaster possessed it, in exchange for the Infinity Gem Gamora bluffed about possessing.All New Guardians of the Galaxy #1-4 When the Collector interrupted the Guardians' rendezvous with their client, the Grandmaster revealed he had challenged his brother just to test him. The Collector and the Grandmaster learned that some of their fellow Elders were mysteriously altered or gone, and determined they could be linked to the disappearance of the Infinity Stones. Since helping the Grandmaster and the Collector gather the stones aligned with her plans, Gamora convinced her teammates to embark on a quest to find them. After helping the Nova Corps defend the Power Stone which had manifested in the planet Xitaung, the Guardians took off with it to Oblitus. They were approached by Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, who had joined forces to find the Time Stone and already had the Soul Gem in their possession. Gamora attempted to force Warlock to hand over the Soul Gem, and a fight broke out. During the battle, Drax managed to hold it, but was exposed to the corruption of Soulworld. He struck Gamora to prevent her from opening the gem, and departed with Warlock and Kang. In addition to Drax's betrayal, the other Guardians refused to follow Gamora into pursuing Kang. Outraged by her teammates' behavior, Gamora left them to obtain the Soul Gem on her own.Infinity Countdown #1-5 In order to help her quest, Gamora kidnapped a master forge-smith from Nidavellir and forced him to make her an armor, killing him afterwards. She later agreed a parley with Star-Lord in order to steal the Power Stone from him, by switching it with a fake without him noticing, and encrusted the hilt of her Infinity Blade with it. Sporting her masked armor and the encrusted sword, Gamora attacked Thanos before he could set out to gather the Infinity Stones to prevent his interference. After being felled, Thanos remarked that Gamora was going to conduct his requiem. Despite brushing off her father's comment and killing him, Gamora decided to adopt that word as her new alias, and became known as Requiem. After murdering Thanos, Gamora started being plagued by apparitions of him. Requiem subsequently interrupted a conclave of the new Infinity Watch to steal the Infinity Stones, and her true identity was quickly revealed to her former allies. Star-Lord was surprised by Gamora's uncharacteristic behavior, and she tried to kill him, he was only saved by the intervention of Doctor Strange using the Time Stone. As the conflict continued, Gamora managed to get her hands on the Reality Stone, and quickly claimed the remaining Stones from their owners. Encouraged by Thanos' apparition, Gamora hesitantly opened a portal to the Soul Gem and reunited with the fragment of herself, becoming whole again. She then set out to rebalance the Soul Gem. To prevent opposition from her quest and to feed the being Devondra, who was responsible for the Soul Gem's hungering for souls, Gamora used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half and merge the two halves together before sending the new universe into a pocket dimension called Warp World inside the Soul Gem. Gamora planned to create a reality once Devondra devoured all the souls and ensure that suffering no longer existed in this new universe. She also sealed Loki into the Soul Gem when he asked to be her counsel. Gamora and Loki's companion Flowa then traveled to the God Quarry so Gamora could investigate what laid beneath it as she couldn't see past it. Even with the Infinity Stones, Gamora was unable to breach the barrier at the bottom of the God Quarry. After fending alternate reality versions of Captain Marvel and Moondragon, Gamora was confronted by Loki and his newly assembled Cosmic Avengers who had managed to escape the Soul Gem. Wielding copies of the Infinity Stones Gamora unintentionally created when she created Warp World, the Cosmic Avengers easily subdued Gamora and took the Infinity Stones from her. However, Loki used his sorcery to take control of Gamora's Infinity Stones and used them to send her and the alternate reality Phyla-Vell and Moondragon to Warp World before transporting himself to the unknown realm that existed beneath the God Quarry. While in Warp World, Gamora was clobbered by Soldier Supreme and nearly consumed by Devondra but was rescued by Peet, the fusion of Star-Lord and Groot. The Cosmic Avengers eventually returned with the Infinity Stones after Loki relinquished them. With Adam Warlock's help, the Cosmic Avengers restored the universe while also allowing Warp World to remain in existence. They then fled Soul World using the Soul Gem with Gamora, Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket Raccoon, Moondragon, and Phyal-Vell, but Drax had to stay behind to keep the portal opened. They arrived on Earth and crash-landed in Egypt. Phyla-Vell and Moondragon wanted to punish Gamora for destroying their universe, even though that was the work of a different Gamora. Adam Warlock decided to send Gamora to a random location using the Infinity Stones in order to redeem herself. Gamora ended up on an unknown planet with a resurrected Magus.Infinity Wars #1-6 She is later seen raising Magus, and still being plagued by Thanos apparition. Thanos tells her that he will not be dead for long.Thanos: Zero Sanctuary The Final Gauntlet When it was learned from Thanos' will that he plans to resurrect himself by uploading his consciousness into an unrevealed being, many assumed it was Gamora. So, Gamora's uncle Starfox formed the Dark Guardians to prevent this. Gamora was on Halfworld at the time keeping an eye on ex-Guardian Rocket. She was later picked up by the Guardians to protect her from harm. However, the Dark Guardians followed Gamora's ex-lover Nova, knowing that he would search for her and warn her of their intent. Once Nova found Gamora, the Dark Guardians attacked Nova and the Guardians, forcing them to crash-land on an unnamed planet. After subduing the Guardians and Nova, the Dark Guardians took Gamora prisoner.Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 5) #1-4 As the Dark Guardians were about to kill Gamora, they were attacked by the Asgardian death goddess Hela and the Black Order who planned to resurrect Thanos. Hela then revealed that Thanos planned to come back in Starfox's body, not Gamora's. Thanos' consciousness took control of Starfox shortly after. When the Guardians arrived to rescue Gamora, they found Gamora surrounded by the Dark Guardians, who explained what happened.Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 5) #5 Gamora rejoined the Guardians who with the remaining Dark Guardians attacked Hela's hideout in Knowhere to stop Thanos' resurrection. While Thanos was transferring his consciousness from Starfox's body into his, Gamora stabbed Starfox with a sword in order to stop it. However, this only caused Thanos to be brought back with a broken mind. When Thanos was accidentally hit with a missile that generated a black hole, Thanos, Hela, and Knowhere were sucked up while the Guardians and Dark Guardians escaped.Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 5) #6 Powers and abilities Gamora received treatments from Thanos that enhanced her speed, strength, agility, and durability to rival Adam Warlock's (to better slay the Magus, his evil, future self). Thanos also helped her become a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the martial-arts techniques from various planets, in the uses of the known weaponry of the Milky Way galaxy, and stealth techniques. She is also a highly skilled gymnast and assassin, and formerly possessed a telepathic link to Thanos. She uses a wide variety of weaponry, most notably a dagger whose unknown properties made it capable of slaying even beings of such immense power as Thanos and the Magus. In the pages of Infinity Watch, it is revealed that Gamora had been cybernetically enhanced to have superhuman strength, speed, and a rapid-healing ability. Gamora's strength and speed were further enhanced by Adam Warlock when they returned from Soulworld. Gamora is one of the most skilled martial artists in the Marvel Universe. She is capable of defeating opponents who possess superhuman strength and durability that far surpass her own, and she has defeated a military platoon containing dozens of combat-trained men in only a few minutes. She has learned to paralyze or kill opponents using vital-point strikes directed at certain nerve clusters. Although skilled in the use of most conventional weapons, she prefers to use knives and swords. While Gamora was with the Infinity Watch, she possessed the Infinity Gem called the \\"Time Gem\\". The gem was mentally linked to her, giving her the potential power to control time. She said that she did not know how to employ its powers and preferred not to use it. While she possessed the Time Gem, Gamora was prone to precognitive dreams and visions, though she had no conscious control over them.

Zoe Saldana portrays Gamora in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). A younger version of Gamora is played by Ariana Greenblatt in Infinity War. In the films, Thanos meets Gamora while he is murdering half the population of her homeworld. He adopts her and raises her to be an assassin. Part of her training is to fight Nebula, a foster sister adopted by Thanos who holds a mutual rivalry with her. As an adult, Gamora plans to rebel against Thanos when he sends her to aid Ronan the Accuser, a Kree fanatic who wants to destroy the planet Xandar. She is caught and imprisoned by Xandarian police. In prison, she joins the other Guardians of the Galaxy (Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon and Groot) in an escape and they save Xandar from Ronan. Because of her heroic actions, Gamora is cleared of her previous crimes. When Nebula also rebels against Thanos, the two sisters reconcile. Meanwhile, Star-Lord and Gamora begin to develop a mutual romantic attraction. Thanos later abducts and emotionally manipulates Gamora into revealing the location of the Soul Stone. He confides that he truly saw her as a daughter, and it is in his sacrifice of her life that he is able to retrieve the stone. Because Gamora died before Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to erase half the population of the universe, Gamora remains dead even after the Avengers reverse Thanos' action. However, the past version of Gamora still allied with Thanos travels to the present day and is eventually convinced by the present day version of Nebula to fight alongside the Avengers and their allies against Thanos and his armed forces. Quill is astonished and relieved at her apparent return, but her past self has no memory of their previous adventures and relationship. When Tony Stark successfully defeats Thanos by using the Infinity Stones against him, the past version of Gamora survives, but disappears after the battle. As the Guardians of the Galaxy prepare to leave Earth, Star-Lord is shown to be attempting to find Gamora, hoping that she may still be alive and out there somewhere.

They have the same fundamental general human rights as adults, although some human rights, such as the right to marry, are dormant until they are of age, Secondly, they have special human rights that are necessary to protect them during their minority.UNICEF, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 29 November 2005. General rights operative in childhood include the right to security of the person, to freedom from inhuman, cruel, or degrading treatment, and the right to special protection during childhood. Particular human rights of children include, among other rights, the right to life, the right to a name, the right to express his views in matters concerning the child, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to health care, the right to protection from economic and sexual exploitation, and the right to education. Children's rights are defined in numerous ways, including a wide spectrum of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Rights tend to be of two general types: those advocating for children as autonomous persons under the law and those placing a claim on society for protection from harms perpetrated on children because of their dependency. These have been labeled as the right of empowerment and as the right to protection. United Nations educational guides for children classify the rights outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the \\"3 Ps\\": Provision, Protection, and Participation. They may be elaborated as follows: * Provision: Children have the right to an adequate standard of living, health care, education and services, and to play and recreation. These include a balanced diet, a warm bed to sleep in, and access to schooling. * Protection: Children have the right to protection from abuse, neglect, exploitation and discrimination. This includes the right to safe places for children to play; constructive child rearing behavior, and acknowledgment of the evolving capacities of children. * Participation: Children have the right to participate in communities and have programs and services for themselves. This includes children's involvement in libraries and community programs, youth voice activities, and involving children as decision-makers.(1997) \\"Children's rights in the Canadian context\\", Interchange. 8(1‚Äì2).

Included are rights to education, adequate housing, food, water, the highest attainable standard of health, the right to work and rights at work, as well as the cultural rights of minorities and indigenous peoples. * Environmental, cultural and developmental rights, which are sometimes called \\"third generation rights,\\" and including the right to live in safe and healthy environments and that groups of people have the right to cultural, political, and economic development. Amnesty International openly advocates four particular children's rights, including the end to juvenile incarceration without parole, an end to the recruitment of military use of children, ending the death penalty for people under 21, and raising awareness of human rights in the classroom. Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy organization, includes child labour, juvenile justice, orphans and abandoned children, refugees, street children and corporal punishment.

Retrieved 2/23/08. Within the youth rights movement, it is believed that the key difference between children's rights and youth rights is that children's rights supporters generally advocate the establishment and enforcement of protection for children and youths, while youth rights (a far smaller movement) generally advocates the expansion of freedom for children and/or youths and of rights such as suffrage.  Parental powers  Parent are given sufficient powers to fulfill their duties to the child. Parents affect the lives of children in a unique way, and as such their role in children's rights has to be distinguished in a particular way. Particular issues in the child-parent relationship include child neglect, child abuse, freedom of choice, corporal punishment and child custody.Brownlie, J. and Anderson, S. (2006) \\"'Beyond Anti-Smacking': Rethinking parent‚Äìchild relations,\\" Childhood. 13(4) p 479-498.Cutting, E.

Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. 16(2) p 151‚Äì163. A child's rights to a relationship with both their parents is increasingly recognized as an important factor for determining the best interests of the child in divorce and child custody proceedings. Some governments have enacted laws creating a rebuttable presumption that shared parenting is in the best interests of children.\\"What is equal shared parenting?\\" Fathers Are Capable Too: Parenting Association. Retrieved 2/24/08. = Limitations of parental powers = Parents do not have absolute power over their children. Parents are subject to criminal laws against abandonment, abuse, and neglect of children. International human rights law provides that manifestation of one's religion may be limited in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as amended by Protocols No. 11 and No. 14. Adopted at Rome, 4 XL 1950. Courts have placed other limits on parental powers and acts. The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Prince v. Massachusetts, ruled that a parent's religion does not permit a child to be placed at risk.Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944). The Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ruled, in the case of Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority and another, that parental rights diminish with the increasing age and competency of the child, but do not vanish completely until the child reaches majority. Parental rights are derived from the parent's duties to the child. In the absence of duty, no parental right exists.Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority [1985] 1 AC 112, [1985] 3 All ER 402, [1985] 3 WLR 830, [1986] 1 FLR 224, [1986] Crim LR 113, 2 BMLR 11.Peter W.

Movement  The 1796 publication of Thomas Spence's Rights of Infants is among the earliest English-language assertions of the rights of children. Throughout the 20th century, children's rights activists organized for homeless children's rights and public education. The 1927 publication of The Child's Right to Respect by Janusz Korczak strengthened the literature surrounding the field, and today dozens of international organizations are working around the world to promote children's rights. In the UK the formation of a community of educationalists, teachers, youth justice workers, politicians and cultural contributors called the New Ideals in Education ConferencesNew Ideals in Education Conferences (1914‚Äì37) stood for the value of 'liberating the child' and helped to define the 'good' primary school in England until the 80s.Newman, Michael (2015) Children‚Äôs Rights in our Schools ‚Äì the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, www.academia.edu Their conferences inspired the UNESCO organisation, the New Education Fellowship. A.S. Neill's 1915 book A Dominie's Log (1915), a diary of a headteacher changing his school to one based on the liberation and happiness of the child, can be seen as a cultural product that celebrates the heroes of this movement.  Opposition  The opposition to children's rights long predates any current trend in society, with recorded statements against the rights of children dating to the 13th century and earlier.Starr, RH (1975) Children's Rights: Countering the Opposition. Paper presented at the 83rd Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association in Chicago, Illinois, Aug. 30-Sept. 3, 1975. ERIC ID# ED121416. Opponents to children's rights believe that young people need to be protected from the adultcentric world, including the decisions and responsibilities of that world.DeLamater, J.D.

(1994). \\"Children's rights,\\" in B. Mayall (ed.) Children's childhood: Observed and experienced. London: The Falmer Press. (p 33-34).

Summer. International human rights law The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is seen as a basis for all international legal standards for children's rights today. There are several conventions and laws that address children's rights around the world. A number of current and historical documents affect those rights, including the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, drafted by Eglantyne Jebb in 1923, endorsed by the League of Nations in 1924 and reaffirmed in 1934. A slightly expanded version was adopted by the United Nations in 1946, followed by a much expanded version adopted by the General Assembly in 1959. It later served as the basis for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights The United Nations adopted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1966. The ICCPR is a multilateral international covenant that has been ratified or acceded to by nearly all nations on Earth. Nations which have become state- parties to the Covenant are required to honor and enforce the rights enunciated by the Covenant. The treaty came into effect on 23 March 1976. The rights codified by the ICCPR are universal, so they apply to everyone without exception and this includes children. Although children have all rights, some rights such as the right to marry and the right to vote come into effect only after the child reaches maturity. Some general rights applicable to children include: * the right to life * the right to security of person * the right to freedom from torture * the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment * the right to be separated from adults when charged with a crime, the right to speedy adjudication, and the right to be accorded treatment appropriate to their age Article 24 codifies the right of the child to special protection due to his minority, the right to a name, and the right to a nationality. Convention on the Rights of the Child The United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC, is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights‚Äîcivil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. National governments that ratify it commit themselves to protecting and ensuring children's rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the international community.Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF. Retrieved 4/3/08. The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 196 ratifications; the United States is the only country not to have ratified it. The CRC is based on four core principles: the principle of non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and considering the views of the child in decisions that affect them, according to their age and maturity.Convention on the Rights of the Child The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is said to have significantly increased the profile of children's rights worldwide.Arts, K, Popvoski, V, et al. (2006) International Criminal Accountability and the Rights of Children. \\"From Peace to Justice Series\\". London: Cambridge University Press. . Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action urges, at Section II para 47, all nations to undertake measures to the maximum extent of their available resources, with the support of international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further, para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, and other forms of sexual abuse.Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Section II, para 46 & 47 This influenced the adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Enforcement A variety of enforcement organizations and mechanisms exist to ensure children's rights. They include the Child Rights Caucus for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children. It was set up to promote full implementation and compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to ensure that child rights were given priority during the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children and its Preparatory process. The United Nations Human Rights Council was created \\"with the hope that it could be more objective, credible and efficient in denouncing human rights violations worldwide than the highly politicized Commission on Human Rights.\\" The NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a coalition of international non-governmental organizations originally formed in 1983 to facilitate the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. National law Many countries around the world have children's rights ombudspeople or children's commissioners whose official, governmental duty is to represent the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints reported by individual citizens regarding children's rights. Children's ombudspeople can also work for a corporation, a newspaper, an NGO, or even for the general public. United States law The United States has signed but not ratified the CRC. As a result, children's rights have not been systematically implemented in the U.S. Children are generally afforded the basic rights embodied by the Constitution, as enshrined by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment is to apply to children, born within a marriage or not, but excludes children not yet born. This was reinforced by the landmark US Supreme Court decision of In re Gault (1967). In this trial 15-year-old Gerald Gault of Arizona was taken into custody by local police after being accused of making an obscene telephone call. He was detained and committed to the Arizona State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21 for making an obscene phone call to an adult neighbor. In an 8‚Äì1 decision, the Court ruled that in hearings which could result in commitment to an institution, people under the age of 18 have the right to notice and counsel, to question witnesses, and to protection against self-incrimination. The Court found that the procedures used in Gault's hearing met none of these requirements.In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967). The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969) that students in school have Constitutional rights.Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969). The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in the case of Roper v. Simmons that persons may not be executed for crimes committed when below the age of eighteen. It ruled that such executions are cruel and unusual punishment, so they are a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. There are other concerns in the United States regarding children's rights. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys is concerned with children's rights to a safe, supportive and stable family structure. Their position on children's rights in adoption cases states that, \\"children have a constitutionally based liberty interest in the protection of their established families, rights which are at least equal to, and we believe outweigh, the rights of others who would claim a 'possessory' interest in these children.\\" Other issues raised in American children's rights advocacy include children's rights to inheritance in same- sex marriages and particular rights for youth. German law A report filed by the President of the INGO Conference of the Council of Europe, Annelise Oeschger finds that children and their parents are subject to United Nations, European Union and UNICEF human rights violations. Of particular concern is the German (and Austrian) agency, Jugendamt (German: Youth office) that often unfairly allows for unchecked government control of the parent-child relationship, which have resulted in harm including torture, degrading, cruel treatment and has led to children's death. The problem is complicated by the nearly \\"unlimited power\\" of the Jugendamt officers, with no processes to review or resolve inappropriate or harmful treatment. By German law, Jugendamt officers are protected against prosecution. Jugendamt (JA) officers span of control is seen in cases that go to family court where experts testimony may be overturned by lesser educated or experienced JA officers; In more than 90% of the cases the JA officer's recommendation is accepted by family court. Officers have also disregarded family court decisions, such as when to return children to their parents, without repercussions. Germany has not recognized related child-welfare decisions made by the European Parliamentary Court that have sought to protect or resolve children and parental rights violations.League for Children's Rights Individual UPR Submission: Germany.

They include: * aspiration, causing aspiration pneumonia * bleeding * perforation * cardiopulmonary problems  Limitations  Problems of gastrointestinal function are usually not well diagnosed by endoscopy since motion or secretion of the gastrointestinal tract are not easily inspected by EGD. Nonetheless, findings such as excess fluid or poor motion of the gut during endoscopy can be suggestive of disorders of function. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia are not diagnosed with EGD, but EGD may be helpful in excluding other diseases that mimic these common disorders.  Procedure  The tip of the endoscope should be lubricated and checked for critical functions including: tip angulations, air and water suction, and image quality. The patient is kept NPO (nil per os) or NBM (nothing by mouth) that is, told not to eat, for at least 4 hours before the procedure. Most patients tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed. The patient lies on his/her left side with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine the first and second parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings. In its most basic use, the endoscope is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a valuable adjunct to endoscopy.

He is best known for his role alongside the likes of Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon, forming a celebrated defensive line for Arsenal in the Premier League and European football during the 1990s. He also played in the Premier League for West Ham United and in the Football League for Wimbledon. He also earned two caps for England between 1989 and 1993. Playing career Birmingham City Winterburn was born in Arley, Warwickshire. He began his career with Birmingham City but never played for the first team, though he did earn youth caps for England while with the club. He joined Oxford United, but never played for their first team either, and then in 1983 he was signed on a free transfer by Dave Bassett to join Wimbledon, who were on a steady climb up the divisions after gaining promotion from the non-league pyramid six years earlier. Wimbledon Wimbledon achieved promotion to the First Division in 1986 and Winterburn earned England under-21 honours. In their first season within the elite they achieved a top- half finish and got to the quarter finals of the FA Cup, when they were beaten by eventual finalists Tottenham Hotspur. Winterburn won the Wimbledon supporters Player Of The Year in each of the four seasons he spent at Plough Lane. George Graham was seeking a long-term replacement for captain Kenny Sansom and in the summer of 1987, Arsenal paid Wimbledon ¬£350,000 and Winterburn went to Highbury. Arsenal Winterburn began his Arsenal career at right-back, an emergency measure employed by Graham after he'd been unsuccessful in finding a worthwhile replacement for Viv Anderson. Though heavily left-footed, Winterburn settled into the right back role as best he could and became quickly involved in two controversial incidents of his first season. First, he was seen to openly goad Brian McClair after the Manchester United striker had missed a late penalty in an FA Cup tie at Highbury. The second incident came in the League Cup final later that same season. Despite having fallen behind in the early stages, Arsenal, the holders, were leading Luton Town 2‚Äì1 at Wembley with less than quarter of an hour to go when David Rocastle got a penalty. Arsenal were awarded a penalty. Michael Thomas had been Arsenal's designated penalty taker all season but after spot-kick failures from Thomas and two subsequent successors, it was Winterburn - who'd never taken a penalty for Arsenal before - who collected the ball up to take the kick. He put the kick low and strong to the right hand corner as he viewed it, but Luton goalkeeper Andy Dibble guessed correctly and pushed the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton then scored twice in the final ten minutes and won the final 3‚Äì2. Despite the missed penalty, it was Gus Caesar (deputising for David O'Leary who missed the final due to injury) rather than Winterburn who was made to bear the brunt of the criticism, as he had made the error which gifted Luton their equaliser at 2‚Äì2. Sansom, demoted to reserve team football, left Arsenal for Newcastle United in December 1988 and Winterburn settled into his more familiar left back role as a result, staying in it for more than a decade. He and fellow full back Lee Dixon flanked two superb central defenders in captain Tony Adams and veteran David O'Leary, joined during the 1989 season by Steve Bould. Often the manager would play all five of them as Arsenal took holders Liverpool to a last-game showdown at Anfield for the First Division title, which would have been Arsenal's first title since the Double year of 1971. Arsenal's situation meant they needed to win by at least two clear goals to clinch the championship. Winterburn's free kick set up a first for Alan Smith shortly after half time, but the second looked as though it would elude them until Thomas scored in injury time. This victory was the culmination of the film Fever Pitch. In the penultimate game, a 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Wimbledon, Winterburn scored perhaps the finest goal of his career, driving the ball diagonally into the far, top corner from fully 25 yards with his little-used right foot. Given both points and goal difference were identical (Arsenal winning the league on more goals scored) every single goal Arsenal scored that campaign eventually proved decisive in winning the league, but had Arsenal lost that day then the Anfield game would have been irrelevant as the title would have already been lost. Winterburn made his England debut later the same year, coming on as a substitute in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Italy. Though many media outlets and Winterburn's own club manager regularly extolled his virtues as an England left back, the national coach, Bobby Robson, had him as no higher than third in the pecking order at left back. Stuart Pearce was going to the 1990 World Cup as first choice, with Tony Dorigo as back-up. Only injury to either would see a way open for Winterburn, and that didn't happen. He did earn appearances for the B team, however. Arsenal ended 1990 trophyless, but went on to win the league title again the next year, with only one loss. During a 1‚Äì0 victory away at Manchester United, there was a mass brawl started by a Winterburn tackle on Denis Irwin. Winterburn was eventually booked, and subsequently fined two weeks wages (along with 3 teammates and the manager, George Graham), but despite the two- point deduction - one more than Manchester United as Arsenal had been involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989 - Arsenal went on to win the league comfortably. Two years later, Winterburn was in the Arsenal team which won both cup competitions and thus completed his domestic set of medals. Arsenal defeated Sheffield Wednesday 2‚Äì1 in both the League Cup and FA Cup finals, the latter in a replay. Winterburn's form earned him a brief England recall by Graham Taylor who included him in a squad for a mini-tournament in the U.S. during which England lost 2‚Äì0 to the United States. Winterburn came on as a sub for Manchester United winger Lee Sharpe in the final match of the contest against Germany. This was the last time he played for England. In 1994, Arsenal beat Italian side Parma's 1‚Äì0, to win the European Cup Winners Cup, Arsenal's first success continentally for a quarter of a century. They would not be so successful the following year as they reached the final again but were beaten 2-1 by Real Zaragoza. Ars√®ne Wenger arrived at Arsenal at the end of 1996 and instilled new self-awareness and dietary habits into the Arsenal squad, allowing the ageing defence (Adams was the youngest at 30 years of age; Martin Keown had also arrived to account for O'Leary's retirement after the 1993 FA Cup success) to thrive in the latter years of their careers and prolong their footballing careers. Arsenal won the \\"double\\" of Premiership and FA Cup in 1998. During the league campaign, in September 1997, as against Wimbledon in 1989, Winterburn again scored a vital goal from over 25 yards out driven diagonally into the far, top corner, this time with his favoured left foot. The 89th-minute winner, in a 3-2 Arsenal victory against Chelsea away at Stamford Bridge, moved Arsenal up to 2nd in the table. Winterburn was called up by caretaker manager Howard Wilkinson for the England squad in a friendly against France in 1999 but he was the odd one out from Wilkinson's first XI ‚Äì Seaman, Adams, Keown and Dixon all started but Winterburn lost out to Graeme Le Saux for the left back slot and stayed on the bench for the 2‚Äì0 defeat. In 1999‚Äì2000, Arsenal again failed to progress beyond the group stages of the Champions League, and therefore entered the UEFA Cup at the third round, where they were drawn against Nantes. During the first leg, which Arsenal won 3‚Äì0, Winterburn again scored with a drive into the far, top corner, though this time only from just outside the box. Arsenal went on to reach the UEFA Cup final but Winterburn had been forced out of the team by the Brazilian left back Sylvinho, although he in turn was displaced by the fledgling Ashley Cole within another 12 months. West Ham United Winterburn joined West Ham United in June 2000 for a fee of ¬£250,000 after 429 League appearances and eight goals for Arsenal. He played 94 games in all competitions for West Ham, scoring one goal in a 1‚Äì0 away win against Leeds United on 18 November 2000. He retired in 2003, his last game coming on 2 February 2003 against Liverpool.\\"Winterburn calls time\\" BBC Sport website (23 July 2003) International career Winterburn's full debut for England came on 15 November 1989 against Italy. He made his second and final appearance for the senior national side nearly four years later on 19 June 1993 against Germany. The regular England left-back at this stage was Stuart Pearce. Coaching career On 14 July 2008, Winterburn joined Paul Ince's backroom staff at Blackburn Rovers as defensive coach. Following the dismissal of Ince in December 2008, Winterburn was deemed surplus to requirements at Ewood Park. New manager Sam Allardyce stated, \\"I spoke to Nigel Winterburn today to say that, from my point of view, in terms of specialist defensive coaching, I think I can look after that area myself now.\\" Media career In 2013 Winterburn became a pundit for BT Sport for the start of their football coverage.

During his childhood, his family moved to Jimei, in modern-day Xiamen, likely to facilitate young Chen's enrollment at the Jimei Normal School, from which Chen graduated as a schoolteacher (he taught at various elementary schools until 1927).Guo Jian, Yongyi Song and Yuan Zhou, \\"Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution\\", pp. 33-35, The Scarecrow Press, 2006 In 1925, Chen enrolled at Shanghai Labor University, studying literature, and in 1927 he joined the Communist Party of China. After returning to Fujian, he was hired as the personal secretary of General Zhang Zhen, helping to prepare for the 1926‚Äì1927 Northern Expedition from the CPC side of the First United Front. When the Front collapsed, Chen fled and was eventually arrested in Nanjing. He was released after a month on General Zhang's recommendation.

Chen became a professor of politics and ancient Chinese history at China College in BeijingChen Boda biography Britannica Concise Encyclopedia while writing articles under the pen names Chen Zhimei and Chen Boda. Most of these articles focused on the dispute between advocates of \\"national defense literature\\" such as Lu Xun, and more nationalist authors. Chen also did underground work for the Party in Tianjin. From 1937 on, he taught politics and Marxist philosophy at the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China in Yan'an, where he became a leader in the Yan'an Rectification Movement.Chen Boda biography Britannica Concise Encyclopedia He soon became personal research assistant and chief political aide to Mao Zedong. Chen published the first collection of Mao's writings in 1937, and an official history of the Party in 1945. Role in the post-1949 government After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao entrusted Chen with many important tasks.

These works made him one of the most important interpreters of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the 1950s he became one of Mao's closest associates, compiling many of the quotations eventually published in the Red Book.Meisner, M; 'Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic since 1949'; Free Press (2006); p. 151 In 1950 Chen accompanied Mao to Moscow to participate in the negotiations with Joseph Stalin that led to the signing of the 30-year treaty of alliance (February 1950) between China and the Soviet Union.Chen Boda biography Britannica Concise Encyclopedia Cultural Revolution From 1966 until 1969, Chen Boda was to play an important role in the Cultural Revolution.

During the 1920s he studied in the Soviet Union and became a key contact with the Comintern and organized the CPC labor movement in the United Front with the Kuomintang. In 1931, after the Party had been driven from the cities, he established the E-Yu-Wan Soviet. When his armies were driven from the region, he joined the Long March but lost a contentious struggle for party leadership to Mao Zedong. Zhang's armies then took a different route from Mao's and were badly beaten by local forces in Gansu. When his depleted forces finally arrived to join Mao in Yan'an, Zhang continued his losing challenge to Mao, and left the party in 1938. Zhang eventually retired to Canada, in 1968. He became a Christian shortly before his death in Toronto, Ontario in 1979. His memoirs provide valuable and vivid information on his life and party history.\\"Chang Kuo-t'ao,\\" Donald W. Klein Anne B. Clark, Biographic Dictionary of Chinese Communism 1921‚Äì1965 (Cambridge, Mass., 1971), Volume I pp. 38‚Äì43.  Early and student life  Born in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi, Zhang was involved in revolutionary activities during his youth. Zhang studied Marxist thought under Li Dazhao while attending Peking University in 1916. After his active role in the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Zhang became one of the most prominent student leaders and later joined the early organization of the CPC in October 1920. At the same time, Mao Zedong was a librarian working at Peking University, whom were acquainted with each other.Schiller, Bill. \\"The man who could have been Mao\\", The Toronto Star, Sep 26, 2009 .Short, Philip. Mao: A Life. New York: John Macrae / Owl Book, 2001. Print. Zhang acted as the CPC's top party official at the first National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1921 and was elected a member of the Central Bureau of the CPC in charge of organizing the work of Professional revolutionaries. After the congress, Zhang held the position of Director of Secretariat of the China Labor Union and Chief Editor of Labor Weekly, from which he became an expert in labor unions and mobilization. He led several major strikes of railway and textile workers, which made him a pioneer of the labor movement in China along with such figures as Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan.  Communist Party career  In 1924 Zhang attended the First National Congress of the Kuomintang (KMT) during the policy of alliance between the Communists and the Kuomintang and was elected as Substitute Commissioner of Central Executive Committee. This was despite the fact that Zhang had opposed the alliance with Kuomintang in the Third National Congress of the CPC and had been reprimanded. In 1925 in the Fourth National Congress of the CPC, Zhang was elected Commissioner of Central Committee of CPC and Director of Labor & Peasant Work Department. In 1926 Zhang was the General Secretary of Hubei Division of CPC, and in 1927 he was Commissioner of Interim Central Committee of the CPC after the failure of the CPC uprising. Zhang with Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai were the acting leaders of the CPC. At that time Mao only led a small number of troops in Jiangxi and Hunan. In 1928 Zhang was elected as a member of the politburo of the CPC in the Sixth National Congress held in Soviet Union, and then as a delegate of the CPC in Comintern. But because of his disagreements with the Soviet Union and Comintern policies on the Chinese revolution, in the 1920s Zhang was taken into custody and punished in order to correct his mistakes. However, due to his fame and popularity in the communist world, he wasn't exiled like other dissidents were at that time. In 1931 Zhang expressed his repentance and was sent back to China by the Comintern to clean up the mess left by the power struggle between the 28 Bolsheviks, Li Lisan, and other old CPC members. Zhang used his fame and popularity to correct their extremism and appeased the old CPC members. But the damage done by the power struggle was so great that it was too difficult for the CPC to survive in the cities governed by the Kuomintang. Therefore, Zhang and other acting CPC leaders decided to move their groups to bases in the countryside. Zhang was assigned to lead the daily operation of E-Yu-Wan Revolutionary Base at the border of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces as General Secretary and chairman of the military committee, and then Vice Chairman of the Interim Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic when Mao was the chairman. Possibly influenced by life in Stalin's Soviet Union, Zhang carried out cruel purges to persecute dissidents which resulted in his defeat and evacuation in 1932.  Military leadership  In 1932 Zhang led the 4th Red Army into Sichuan and set up another base. Slowly he turned it into a prosperous autonomous region by way of land reform and enlisting the support of locals. However, once the prosperity was in reach, Zhang repeated the Stalinist style purges again, as a result, he and the Red Army lost the popular support, and was driven from the Red base. In 1935 Zhang and his army of more than 80,000 reunited with Mao's 10,000 troops during the Long March. It was not long before Mao and Zhang were locked in disagreements over issues of strategy and tactics, causing a split in the Red Army. The main disagreement was Zhang's insistence on moving southward to establish a new base in the region of Sichuan that was populated by ethnic minorities. Mao pointed out the flaws of such a move, pointing out the difficulties to establish any communist base in regions where the general populace was hostile, and insisted on moving northward to reach the communist base in Shaanxi. Zhang tried to have Mao and his followers arrested and killed if needed, but his plan was foiled by his own staff members Ye Jianying and Yang Shangkun, who fled to Mao's headquarters to inform Mao about Zhang's plot, taking the all of the codebooks and maps with them. As a result, Mao immediately moved his troop northward and thus escaped arrest and possible death. Zhang decided to carry out his plan on his own, with disastrous results: over 75% of his original 80,000 + troops were lost in his adventure. Zhang was forced to admit defeat and retreat to the communist base in Shaanxi. More disastrous than losing most of his troops, the failure discredited Zhang among his own followers, who turned to Mao. Furthermore, because all of the codebooks were obtained by Mao, Zhang lost contact with Comintern while Mao was able to establish the link, this coupled with the fact of Zhang's disastrous defeat, discredited Zhang within Comintern, which begun to give greater support for Mao. Zhang's remaining troops of 21,800 were later annihilated in 1936 by the superior force of more than 100,000 combined troops of warlords Ma Bufang, Ma Hongbin and Ma Zhongying during efforts to cross the Yellow River and conquer Ma's territory. Zhang lost the power and influence to be able to challenge Mao and had to accept his failure as a result of the disaster which only left him 427 surviving troops from the original 21,800. An alternate version of events, which disputes the traditional view of Zhang as a traitor, is presented in a controversial account by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday. They contend that Mao methodically sabotaged Zhang's troops by ensuring they faced the toughest battles and terrain. According to Chang's book, Russian archives released in 2005 indicate that Mao once told an envoy of Joseph Stalin that his forces had destroyed 30,000 of Zhang's troops.Jung Chang, Jon Halliday, Mao: The Unknown Story (New York: Knopf, 2005), esp. pp. 159‚Äì64.  End of CPC career and exile  Zhang with Mao Zedong in Yan'an, 1938 When Zhang reached the new CPC base at Yan'an, he had fallen from power and became an easy target for Mao. Zhang kept the now figurehead position of Chairman of Yan'an Frontier Area and was frequently subjected to humiliation by Mao and his allies. Zhang was too proud to ally with Wang Ming, who had recently come back from Moscow and was acting as the Comintern's representative in China. Zhang's popularity in the Comintern might have given him another chance of returning to power if he had allied with Wang. Another reason why Zhang did not ally with Wang was that Wang boasted that it was under his order that five senior CPC leaders (Yu Xiusong, Huang Chao, Li Te and two others‚Äîall opponents of Wang) had been arrested, and now worked for warlord Sheng Shicai in Xinjiang under the direction of the CPC. All five were tortured and executed in a prison under the control of Sheng Shicai, having been labeled as Trotskyists. However, Sheng Shicai was acting under direction from the CPC under Wang Ming. After that incident, Zhang despised Wang and would never consider supporting him. Without any supporters, Zhang was purged in 1937 at the Extended Meeting of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, after which he defected to the Kuomintang in 1938. But without any power, resources, and support, Zhang never held any important positions afterward and only did research on the CPC for Dai Li. After the defeat of the Kuomintang in 1949 he went into exile in Hong Kong. He emigrated to Canada with his wife Tzi Li Young in 1968 to join their two sons who were already living in Toronto. He gave his only interview in 1974, when he told a Canadian Press reporter, \\"I have washed my hands of politics\\". In 1978, he was led to believe in Christianity by a Chinese scholar, Zhang Li Sang. After suffering several strokes, he died in a Scarborough, Ontario, nursing home on Dec 3, 1979 at the age of 82, having converted to Christianity the year before. He is buried in the Pine Hills Cemetery in Scarborough.

In 1916, she became the first female magistrate in Canada, and in the British Empire. She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism, specifically to the question of whether women were \\"persons\\" under Canadian law. Murphy is known as one of \\"The Famous Five\\" (also called \\"The Valiant Five\\")‚Äîa group of Canadian women's rights activists that also included Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney and Irene Parlby. In 1927, the women launched the \\"Persons Case,\\" contending that women could be \\"qualified persons\\" eligible to sit in the Senate. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they were not. However, upon appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, the court of last resort for Canada at that time, the women won their case. However, there has been some criticism of her later work, mainly for her role in the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta and her allegations that a ring of immigrants from other countries, particularly China, would corrupt the white race by getting Canadians hooked on drugs. In her book The Black Candle, she wrote: \\"It is hardly credible that the average Chinese peddler has any definite idea in his mind of bringing about the downfall of the white race, his swaying motive being probably that of greed, but in the hands of his superiors, he may become a powerful instrument to that end.\\" Early life Emily Murphy was born in Cookstown, Ontario, the third child of Isaac and Emily Ferguson. Isaac Ferguson was a successful businessman and property owner. As a child, Murphy frequently joined her two older brothers Thomas and Gowan in their adventures; their father encouraged this behaviour and often had his sons and daughters share responsibilities equally. Murphy grew up under the influence of her maternal grandfather, Ogle R. Gowan, a politician who founded a local branch of the Orange Order in 1830, and two uncles, one a Supreme Court justice and the other a senator. Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court. Another uncle was Thomas Roberts Ferguson, an MP, and she was related to James Robert Gowan, who was a lawyer, judge, and senator. Murphy benefited from parents who supported their daughter's receiving a formal academic education. She attended Bishop Strachan School, an exclusive Anglican private school for girls in Toronto where, through a friend, she met her future husband Arthur Murphy, who was 11 years her senior. In 1887, they married, and subsequently had four daughters: Madeleine, Evelyn, Doris and Kathleen. Doris died. After Doris' death, the family decided to try a new setting and moved west to Swan River, Manitoba, in 1903 and then to Edmonton, Alberta, in 1907.  Career   Dower Act  Statue of Emily Murphy in the monument to The Famous Five, Parliament Hill, Ottawa While Arthur was working as an Anglican priest, Murphy explored her new surroundings and became increasingly aware of the poverty that existed. At the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women's groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects. In addition to these organizations, Murphy began to speak openly and frankly about the disadvantaged and the poor living conditions that surrounded their society. Her strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless. At that time, property laws did not leave the wife with any legal recourse. This case motivated Murphy to create a campaign that assured the property rights of married women. With the support of many rural women, Murphy began to pressure the Alberta government to allow women to retain the rights of their land. In 1916, Murphy successfully persuaded the Alberta legislature to pass the Dower Act that would allow a woman legal rights to one third of her husband's property. Murphy's reputation as a women's rights activist was established by this first political victory. Appointment as female magistrate William Lyon Mackenzie King unveils a plaque commemorating the five Alberta women whose efforts resulted in the Persons Case.

[Rear, L-R]: Senators Iva Campbell Fallis, Cairine Wilson (Ottawa). Murphy's success in the fight for the Dower Act, along with her work through the Local Council of Women and her increasing awareness of women's rights, influenced her request for a female magistrate in the women's court. In 1916, Murphy, along with a group of women, attempted to observe a trial for women who were prostitutes and were arrested for \\"questionable\\" circumstances. The women were asked to leave the courtroom on the claims that the statement was not \\"fit for mixed company\\". This outcome was unacceptable to Murphy and she protested to the provincial Attorney General. \\"If the evidence is not fit to be heard in mixed company,\\" she argued, \\"then the government must set up a special court presided over by women, to try other women\\". Murphy's request was approved and she became the first woman police magistrate in the British Empire. Her appointment as a judge, however, became the cause for her greatest adversity concerning women within the law. In her first case in Alberta on 1 July 1916, she found the prisoner guilty. The prisoner's lawyer called into question her right to pass sentence since she was not legally a person. The Provincial Supreme Court denied the appeal.  Persons case  In 1917, she headed the battle to have women declared as \\"persons\\" in Canada, and, consequently, qualified to serve in the Senate. Lawyer, Eardley Jackson, challenged her position as judge because women were not considered \\"persons\\" under the British North America Act 1867. This understanding was based on a British common law ruling of 1876, which stated, \\"women were eligible for pains and penalties, but not rights and privileges.\\" In 1919, she presided over the inaugural conference of the Federated Women's Institutes of Canada, which passed a resolution calling for a female senator to be appointed. The National Council of Women and the Montreal Women's Club also supported the resolution, selecting Murphy as their preferred candidate. Murphy began to work on a plan to ask for clarification of how women were regarded in the BNA act and how they were to become Senators. She enlisted the help of four other Albertan women and on 27 August 1927 she and human rights activist Nellie McClung, ex MLA Louise McKinney, women's rights campaigners Henrietta Edwards and Irene Parlby signed the petition to the federal Cabinet, asking that the federal government refer the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada. The women's petition set out two questions, but the federal government re-framed it as one question, asking the Supreme Court: \\"Does the word 'person' in Section 24 of the British North America Act include female persons?\\" The campaign became known as The Persons Case and reached the Supreme Court of Canada in March 1928. The Court held that women were not qualified to sit in the Senate. The five women then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain. On 18 October 1929, in a decision called Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), the Privy Council declared that 'persons' in Section 24 of the BNA Act of 1867 should be interpreted to include both males and females therefore women were eligible to serve in the Senate. Despite the ruling, Murphy was never appointed to the Senate. The Prime Minister at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, was a Liberal, and Murphy was a partisan Conservative, so she was passed over in favour of philanthropist Cairine Wilson in 1930. After the Conservatives under R. B. Bennett won the 1930 federal election, Murphy was denied to chance to sit in the Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and Murphy was a Protestant. Murphy would die in 1933 without fulfilling her dream of sitting in Canada's upper chamber. The women were known as the Famous Five and were considered leaders in education for social reform and women's rights. They challenged convention and established an important precedent in Canadian history. In Canada's Senate Chamber, the five women are honoured with a plaque that reads, \\"To further the cause of womankind these five outstanding pioneer women caused steps to be taken resulting in the recognition by the Privy Council of women as persons eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada.\\" Murphy, along with the rest of the Famous Five, was featured on the back of one of the Canadian 50-dollar bills issued in 2004 as part of the Canadian Journey Series. In October 2009, the Senate voted to name Murphy and the rest of the Five Canada's first \\"honorary senators\\". Views Drugs and race The cover of Murphy's 1922 book The Black Candle Although Murphy's views on race changed over the course of her life, the perspective contained in her book The Black Candle is considered the most consequential because it played a role in creating a widespread \\"war on drugs mentality\\" leading to legislation that \\"defined addiction as a law enforcement problem\\". A series of articles in Maclean's magazine under her pen name, \\"Janey Canuck\\", forms the basis of The Black Candle. Using extensive anecdotes and \\"expert\\" opinion, The Black Candle depicts an alarming picture of drug abuse in Canada, detailing Murphy's understanding of the use and effects of opium, cocaine, and pharmaceuticals, as well as a \\"new menace\\", \\"marihuana\\". Murphy's concern with drugs began when she started coming into \\"disproportionate contact with Chinese people\\" in her courtroom because they were over-represented in the criminal justice system. In addition to professional expertise and her own observations, Murphy was also given a tour of opium dens in Vancouver's Chinatown by local police detectives. Vancouver at the time was in the midst of a moral panic over drugs that was part of the anti-Oriental campaign that precipitated the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923. Canadian drug historian Catherine Carstairs has argued that Murphy's importance regarding drug policy has been \\"overstated\\". Although Murphy's anti-drug screeds were widely read and helped spread the drug panic across Canada, she was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with. According to Carstairs, \\"There were insinuations in the records that the bureaucrats at the division of narcotic control did not think very highly of Emily Murphy and did not pay attention to what she was writing about, and they didn't consider her a particularly accurate or valuable source.\\" Carstairs also avers that Murphy did not influence the drug panic in Vancouver, but that nevertheless \\"her articles did mark a turning point and her book ... brought the Vancouver drug panic to a larger Canadian audience\\". Race permeates The Black Candle, and is intricately entwined with the drug trade and addiction in Murphy's analysis. Yet she is ambiguous in her treatment of non-whites. In one passage, for example, she chastises whites who use the Chinese as \\"scapegoats\\", while elsewhere, she refers to the Chinese man as a \\"visitor\\" in this country, and that \\"it might be wise to put him out\\" if it turns out that this visitor carries \\"poisoned lollipops in his pocket and feeds them to our children\\". Drug addiction, however, not the Chinese immigrant, is \\"a scourge so dreadful in its effects that it threatens the very foundations of civilization\\", and which laws therefore need to target for eradication. Drugs victimize everyone, and members of all races perpetrate the drug trade, according to Murphy. At the same time, she does not depart from the dominant view of middle class whites at the time that \\"races\\" were discrete, biologically determined categories, naturally ranked in a hierarchy. In this scheme, the white race was facing degradation through miscegenation, while the more prolific \\"black and yellow races may yet obtain the ascendancy\\" and thus threatened to \\"wrest the leadership of the world from the British\\". Murphy's distaste for non-whites is reflected in scholarly debates, but what is not controversial is that The Black Candle was written \\"for the express purpose of arousing public demands for stricter drug legislation\\" and that in this she was to some degree successful. This motivation may have influenced her racial analysis by playing to the popular prejudices of her white audiences. On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and hysterical Asian exclusionists in British Columbia in order to maximize her own credibility and sway her more moderate readers. Eugenics movement During the early twentieth century, scientific knowledge emerged in the forefront of social importance. Advances in science and technology were thought to hold answers to current and future social problems. Murphy was among those who thought that societal problems like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime resulted from mental deficiencies. In a 1932 article titled \\"Overpopulation and Birth Control\\", she states: \\"over-population [is a] basic problem of all ... none of our troubles can even be allayed until this is remedied\\". As the politics behind the Second World War continued to develop, Murphy, who was a pacifist, theorized that the only reason for war was that nations needed to fight for land to accommodate their growing populations. Her argument was that: if there was population control, people would not need as much land. Without the constant need for more land, war would cease to exist. Her solution to these social issues was eugenics. Murphy supported selective breeding and the compulsory sterilization of those individuals who were considered mentally deficient. She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the \\"human thoroughbreds\\" and appealed to the Alberta Legislative Assembly for forced sterilization. In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were \\"a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state ... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition\\". She wrote to Minister of Agriculture and Health, George Hoadley that two female \\"feeble-minded\\" mental patients had already bred several offspring. She called it \\"a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children\\". Due in part to her heavy advocacy of compulsory sterilization, thousands of Albertan men and women were sterilized without their knowledge or consent under the Sexual Sterilization Act before its repeal in 1972. Legacy Her legacy is disputed, with her important contributions to feminism being weighed against her racist and nativist views and her advocation of eugenics. In addition to being against immigration, she was a strong supporter of Alberta's legislation for the Sexual Sterilization of the Insane at a time when compulsory sterilization was practised in some North American jurisdictions. Recent memorializing of the Famous Five, such as the illustration on the back of the fifty-dollar bill, has been used as the occasion for re-evaluating Murphy's legacy. Marijuana decriminalization activists especially have criticized Murphy as part of the movement to discredit marijuana prohibition. It has been speculated that today's drug laws are built on the racist foundations laid by Murphy and that the drug war has harmed more women than the Persons Case has benefited. Conversely, Murphy's defenders note that she was writing at a time when white racism was typical, not exceptional, and that Murphy's views were more progressive than many of her peers. Alt URL Emily Murphy's house in Edmonton, Alberta, is on the Canadian Register of Historic People and Places. She lived in this home from 1919 until her death in 1933. It is now located on the campus of the University of Alberta and houses the Student Legal Services. In 1958, she was recognized as a Person of National Historic Significance by the government of Canada. A plaque commemorating this is installed at Emily Murphy Park on Emily Murphy Park Road in Edmonton. The \\"National Persons\\" case was recognized in 1997 as a National Historic Event with a plaque at the same place.

He served as the 19th Governor of Ohio from 1846 to 1849 and was the third native Ohioan to be elected to the office. Biography Bebb was born in what was then Hamilton County in the Northwest Territory (his birthplace is now located in modern-day Butler County, Ohio) to Welsh immigrants. He is the son of Edward Bebb and Margaret Roberts Owens. Bebb's parents were early residents of Paddy's Run, now known as Shandon, Ohio. In 1826 the Paddy's Run school was organized under the new state law, a new building was erected, and William Bebb was employed as the first teacher. On October 16, 1824 he married Sarah Shuck. In 1828, Bebb and his wife opened a boarding school for boys called the \\"Sycamore Grove School\\". While he taught school, Bebb studied for the bar and passed the state bar examination. He began practicing law in 1831 and worked in the office of John Woods. Career Bebb was a devoted campaigner for William Henry Harrison in 1840, and for Henry Clay in 1844. Bebb was a Presidential elector in 1844 for Clay/Frelinghuysen. Bebb was nominated by the Whigs in 1846 for the governorship, and served a single term beginning in December 1846. His term technically expired in December 1848, but was extended into January 1849 due to a number of close statewide elections which necessitated delaying the inauguration of a successor. He was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as examiner in the pension office at Washington, D.C. He declined an appointment as United States Diplomat to Tangier, Morocco in 1868. Death After Bebb retired from politics, he and his wife moved to their farm in Rockford, Illinois. Bebb died at his home on October 23, 1873, and Sarah Bebb died on January 10, 1892. Bebb was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Rockford, Illinois. Trial of William Bebb In 1857, Bebb fired a weapon and a man died. He was accused of manslaughter, and tried in Winnebago County, Illinois Circuit Court in 1858. One of his defense council summarized the case thus: A fable grew out of the trial, which had Tom Corwin coming to the county anonymously before the trial, and charming its occupants to the point that, when he represented Bebb, his good will with the residents assured an acquittal. A later examination of the trial record showed the story to be fanciful, with Corwin and Johnston winning acquittal through competent representation.

He participated in several NASA missions, including Apollo mission to the Moon and the Viking lander. He received the Oparin Medal, awarded by the International Astrobiology Society for his contributions to the field of origins of life.  Life  Or√≥ completed his undergraduate studies in Biochemistry at the University of Barcelona and moved to the United States in 1952, due to the scarce scientific resources offered by the Spanish academia at that time. Four years later he obtained his PhD in Biochemistry in Houston. He became a full professor in University of Houston in 1963http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/im/v8n1/necrologica1.pdf where he founded and directed the department of biochemistry and biophysics. From the 1960s he worked with NASA on the Viking missions which explored the planet Mars. His work was essential in the analysis of samples of Martian soil, questioning early suggestions that life might have been detected. He was also involved in political life after Spain's transition to democracy as member of the Parliament of Catalonia. He also served as a science advisor for many USA projects and committees, including those involved in the International Space Station and the future missions to Mars.  Origins of life  One of his most important contributions was the prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase adenine (a key component of nucleic acids) from hydrogen cyanide (HCN). He also showed that amino acids can be made from HCN plus ammonia in an aqueous solution.Michael Mark Woolfson, Time, Space, Stars & Man: The Story of the Big Bang, World Scientific, 2013, , p. 383. This was achieved during the period 1959‚Äì1962 and stands, together with the Miller-Urey experiment, as one of the fundamental results of prebiotic chemistry. It opened up a research area eventually leading to the complete synthesis of other components of nucleic acids.  Cometary origin of prebiotic molecules  He was also the first scientist pointing towards comets as key carriers of organic molecules to our early biosphere. This conjecture (formulated in 1961) is largely accepted today. Although such idea had been around for a long time, it was only when both space exploration and prebiotic chemistry fully developed that extensive evidence was in place. Comets are known to be rich in carbon and water, bearing along precursor molecules based on carbon chemistry such as aminoacids. In this context, in 1971 Or√≥ and co-workers published a paper revealing the high abundance of Amino-acids, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite.  Viking mission  Or√≥ also provided a chemical interpretation of a set of remarkable, and to some extent unexpected results reported by the Viking mission to Mars. The Viking lander performed a series of experiments, including one designed by Or√≥, involving a small gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer. In one of these experiments, where a set of nutrients was mixed with Martian soil samples, a sudden production of carbon dioxide was reported, initially suggesting the presence of Martian microbes, which would have shown some kind of metabolic processing of nutrients. Or√≥ showed that a simpler, abiotic interpretation was more likely to be the correct one: the catalytic chemical oxidation of test nutrients.  Awards  He was awarded, among other honors, the Cross of Civil Order of Alfonso X el Sabio (Madrid, 1983), the Alexander Ivanovich Oparin Medal Award from the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life (ISSOL) (Berkeley, 1986), the Creu de Sant Jordi (1991), and the Medalla del President Francesc Maci√† (2000). He was named Marquess of Or√≥ in 2003 by Royal Decree 819-32003 of 23 June. He died in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, on September 2, 2004.

She was a pioneer for women in science; she was the first woman to hold a full professorship at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and the first woman to head a department at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.Current Biography, p. 45 During her years of retirement, she pursued a second career as a public health activist in Colorado, and in 1951 received the Albert Lasker Public Service Award for this work. Early life On November 9, 1871, Serena Sabin gave birth to her youngest daughter, Florence Rena Sabin, in Central City, Colorado. Florence's mother was a schoolteacher who later died from puerperal fever (sepsis) in 1878. Her father, George K. Sabin, was a mining engineer living and working on site with his family.Smith College n.d. Shortly after her mother's death, Florence and her sister (Mary) moved in with their Uncle Albert in Chicago before relocating to Vermont with their paternal grandparents. Throughout her childhood Sabin had intentions of becoming a pianist, however, she was never musically talented, causing her to shift her focus on a future in science during high school.  Higher education  Sabin earned her bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1893. For two years she taught high school mathematics in Denver followed by one year of zoology at Smith as a means to finance her first year of graduate school.National Library of Medicine, 1923 In 1896, Sabin enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as one of fourteen women in her class. The school opened in 1893 and was co-ed from the beginning because of an early donor's contingency which required the admittance of female students. While at Hopkins, Sabin‚Äôs observational skills and perseverance in the laboratory caught anatomist Franklin P. Mall's attention. Mall inspired Sabin by helping narrow her focus onto two projects well regarded by scientistsParkhurst 1930 and foundational to her future research and consequent legacy. The first project was to produce a three-dimensional model of a newborn baby‚Äôs brain stem which became the focus of the textbook, An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain (1901). The second project involved the embryological development of the lymphatic system which asserted that the lymphatic system is formed from the embryo‚Äôs blood vessels and not other tissues. Sabin graduated from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1900.  Professional life   Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (1902-1925)  Upon graduation, Sabin obtained an internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital under physician Sir William Osler. Following a one-year internship with Osler, she won a research fellowship in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where she continued to work with Mall.National Library of Medicine n.d. Shortly thereafter, a Fellowship in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins was created for her. In 1902 she began to teach in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins. By 1905 she was promoted to associate professor and finally appointed professor of embryology and histology in June 1917, the first woman to become a full professor at a medical college. In 1921, Sabin was named the first female president of the American Association of Anatomists. She continued her research on the origins of blood, blood vessels, blood cells, the histology of the brain, and the pathology and immunology of tuberculosis at Hopkins. In 1924, Sabin‚Äôs work on the origins of blood vessels earned her membership in the National Academy of Science. In 1925, Sabin left Johns Hopkins after completing her research amidst institutional discrimination and her desire to research full time.  Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1925-1938)  In September 1925 she became head of the Department of Cellular Studies at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. Her research focused on the lymphatic system, blood vessels and cells, and tuberculosis. In 1925, she was voted into the National Academy of Science. She was the first woman to gain membership in this prestigious body and would remain the lone female member for the next 20 years. In 1926, she joined the research committee of the National Tuberculosis Association. The committee's purpose was to consolidate all of the tuberculosis research taking place with the hope of controlling the disease proactively. While here, Sabin devoted her research to immune cells, monocytes in particular, which developed into other cells. Sabin spent her final years at the institute determining the effects imposed by foreign substances and their consequent formation of antibodies. In 1938, Sabin left her position at Rockefeller Institute and moved back to Colorado for retirement.Photograph of Florence R. Sabin. Final years & legacy After six years of quiet retirement, Sabin accepted Colorado Governor John Vivian's request to chair a subcommittee on health beginning in 1944. She presented her findings asserting that the state was ‚Äúbackward in regard to public health‚Äù in a letter to the Governor in April 1945. Knowing that health care legislation had been voted down consistently in the past due to uninterested politicians, she was relentless in her demand for reform. While she was in her early seventies, Sabin refused to let a snowstorm prevent her from making it to a speech in support of her cause despite public travel concerns. Beginning with this speech, Sabin worked to have politicians who opposed health reform defeated by those in support of it. These efforts resulted in the passing of a set of laws in her name. The ‚ÄúSabin Health Laws‚Äù modernized public health in Colorado by providing more hospital beds to treat tuberculosis, resulting in significant reductions in cases. In an address to the Illinois Statewide Health Committee in 1947, Sabin said that she was chosen as committee chair because the Governor had no interest in public health and appointed ‚Äúan old lady‚Äù because he did not think she would be able to accomplish anything.Sabin, 1947 In 1948 she became manager of health and charities for Denver, donating her salary over the next three years to medical research. In 1951 Sabin retired for a second and final time, continuing to advocate for public health issues. Sabin's lifetime of service resulted in the University of Colorado‚Äôs Department of Medicine being named the Florence R. Sabin Building for Research in Cellular Biology.

She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the Fairmount Mausoleum at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, Colorado.

Created by Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973). The character's origin story relates that Arthur Douglas was a human whose family was attacked and killed by the supervillain Thanos. Needing a champion to combat Thanos, the being known as Kronos took Arthur's spirit and placed it in a powerful new body, and Drax the Destroyer was born. Drax's powers included enhanced strength and resilience, flight, and the ability to project energy blasts from his hands. The character often battled Thanos, and on occasion the superheroes Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock. He was also a member of the group known as the Infinity Watch. In 2004, the character lost his flight and energy blasts, and a portion of his strength and resilience. This version of the character played a role in the crossover comic book storylines \\"Annihilation\\" and \\"Annihilation: Conquest\\", and became a member of the relaunched Guardians of the Galaxy. Drax has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, action figures, and video games. Dave Bautista portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Publication history Drax first appeared in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973), and was created by Jim Starlin with the help of writer Mike Friedrich. He had a recurring role in Captain Marvel, beginning with issue #27 (July 1973). He also appeared in Warlock #10 (December 1975), Iron Man #88 (July 1976), Warlock #15 (November 1976), Logan's Run #6 (June 1977), Thor #314 (December 1981), and Avengers #219 (May 1982), before being killed by Moondragon in Avengers #220 (June 1982). Starlin resurrected Drax in Silver Surfer vol 3 #35 (1990), and he had a recurring role until issue 50. After appearing in The Infinity Gauntlet #1‚Äì6 (1991), he was featured in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1‚Äì42 (1992‚Äì1995) as a member of the titular team, the Infinity Watch. The character reappeared in Warlock vol. 3 #1‚Äì4 (1998‚Äì1999) and Captain Marvel vol. 4 #4‚Äì6 (2001). Drax received an eponymous 4 issue miniseries in 2004, and was a starring character in Annihilation: Nova #1‚Äì4 (2005) and Annihilation #1‚Äì6 (2006). After a follow up appearance in Nova vol 4 #4‚Äì7 (2007) and the 2008 \\"Annihilation: Conquest\\" storyline, he was featured as a team member in the 2008 relaunch of Guardians of the Galaxy, and appeared in the 25 issue series of the same name. The character had a small role in The Thanos Imperative #1‚Äì3 (2010), in which he was killed. The character reappeared in Avengers Assemble issues #4‚Äì8 (June‚ÄìOctober 2012), with no reference to his death. He will star in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch. Fictional character biography Creation and early life While driving through a desert with his wife and daughter, Arthur Douglas' car is attacked by a spaceship piloted by Thanos, who thinks the humans have seen him. His daughter, Heather, survives the crash and is adopted by Thanos' father, Mentor, and raised on Titan. She later becomes Moondragon. Drax (top) on the cover of Captain Marvel #58 (September 1978). Art by Dave Cockrum. Needing a champion to combat the threat from Thanos, Mentor and the Titan god Kronos capture Douglas' spirit and placed it in a powerful new body. He is rechristened \\"Drax the Destroyer\\", and his sole purpose is to kill Thanos. With Iron Man, Drax battles Thanos and the Blood Brothers, but Thanos escapes. While trying to prevent Thanos from getting the Cosmic Cube, Drax's memories are restored to him. After seeing Captain Marvel defeat Thanos, Drax attacks Captain Marvel, for robbing him of his purpose. Drax wanders space in grim contemplation, searching for a resurrected Thanos. By the time he learns that Thanos had managed to rematerialize himself, Thanos has once again been destroyed in battle with Captain Marvel, the Avengers, and Adam Warlock. Alongside Captain Marvel, Drax battles ISAAC, Stellarax, Lord Gaea, Elysius, and Chaos. Some time later, Drax, possessed by an alien entity, battles his daughter Moondragon and the superhero Thor. After Drax recovers, he and Moondragon journey through space in search of knowledge. Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba-Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world's goddess. Drax recognizes that her ambitions are ignoble and so sends their ship to Earth with a holographic distress message. The Avengers respond and discover Moondragon's world of mentally enforced tranquility. Freed by the Avengers from his daughter's mental domination, Drax advances toward her, seeking to end her menace. In order to stop him, Moondragon mentally forces Drax's life essence to vacate his artificial body. Infinity Watch When Thanos is resurrected by Mistress Death, Kronos reanimates the Destroyer and grants him even greater physical power. However, Kronos does not consider the effects of Drax's death, and the Destroyer's mind retains the damage done by Moondragon. Alongside a multitude of other heroes, Drax helps battle Thanos and Nebula for possession of the Infinity Gauntlet. Drax is chosen by Adam Warlock to safeguard the Power Gem as part of the Infinity Watch. After the energy vampire Rune steals the gems, the Watch members go their separate ways. Drax returns to Titan with Moondragon, who successfully petitions Kronos to restore Drax's mind to its former acuity at the cost of some physical power. Thus, Drax is restored to his original condition. Drax is accused of the murder of Elysius and several others, but is cleared when it is discovered that the creature Syphon was manipulating him. While seeking out Moondragon, Drax enters into an altercation with Genis-Vell. In the course of this struggle, Drax is transported to the Microverse with Genis, where, for a time, he finds acceptance and happiness on the planet K'ai. Reborn Later, Drax is seen on a prison transport ship with Paibok, Lunatik, and the Blood Brothers. The ship crashes in Alaska, and Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives. He mistakes a young girl named Cammi for his daughter, and tries to protect her from Paibok. Drax appears to be killed, but a slimmer, smarter Drax emerges from the larger shell of the dead body. When a second prison ship arrives to recapture the prisoners, both Drax and Cammi are arrested. Surviving Annihilus' attack on the intergalactic prison known as the Kyln, Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian Nova Corps, Richard Rider. Together they fight against the advancing Annihilation Wave as Drax trains Nova to be a warrior. Drax learns that Thanos has taken Moondragon hostage, and that she will be killed if Drax pursues him. During a doomed battle between the Annihilation Wave and the United Front, Drax stays behind to fight off the invaders while Nova and the rest of the group (including Cammi) finish the evacuation. Drax fights his way to the Annihilation Wave's mother ship, where he finds Thanos and kills him. Drax helps to free a captive Galactus, who teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave. Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just \\"disappeared\\". Cammi is later seen, alive, allied with Skreet,http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/skreetlunatik.htm one of Thanos' powerful, miniature assistants. When the Phalanx invade the Kree home-world, Drax is assimilated as a \\"select\\" of the Phalanx hive mind. They dispatch him, along with Gamora, to apprehend Nova, who had fled the planet. Following Nova to Kvch, the home planet the Technarchy (parental race of the Phalanx), Drax and Gamora are freed from the Phalanx by the Technarch Tyro. Together they return to Hala where they help in the defeat of Ultron. Guardians of the Galaxy Star-Lord recruits Drax for the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The Guardians are forced to ally themselves with a resurrected Thanos and travel into an alternate reality known as the \\"Cancerverse\\". While experiencing a bout of madness, Drax attacks Thanos and is killed. Drax later reappears with the Guardians on Earth without reference to his death. Powers and abilities Drax's initial incarnation's powers included superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury as well the ability to project concussive blasts of cosmic energy from his hands. He could also travel at high speeds in outer space and hyperspace without air, food, or water. Drax also had telepathy,\\"Iron Man\\" Vol 1 #55 (February 1973) having used it to engage Thanos in a psychic battle and stalemating him mind to mind.\\"Captain Marvel\\" Vol 1 #28 After his resurrection, his physical capabilities are greatly enhanced beyond their original levels but he suffered severe mental disability in his new incarnation. Instead of his telepathy which enabled him to track Thanos across vast distances, he now possessed the ability to sense either him or other beings who have been in recent contact with Thanos, alongside a precognitive ability to sense when beings will be in contact with Thanos in the near future. For a time, Drax possessed the Power Gem that had the potential to grant him superhuman physical and energy manipulation powers with no feasible limit. However, because of his severely-reduced intellect, he lacked the mental capacity and imagination to use the gem for anything other than bolstering his physical strength. While possessing the gem, Drax's strength has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the Hulk, but lacking the latter's rage-fueled potential. Just prior to the 2006 \\"Annihilation\\" mini-series and continuing through the present, Drax undergoes a physical change, resulting in a much-smaller physical form, his superhuman, physical powers greatly reduced to a level comparable to those of his original form and the loss of his energy projection, flight and most any residual psionic capabilities; having just enough to glean the moments of his demise from Cammi. However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle. At least temporarily, he had the ability to pass through Thanos's force field; his power levels seem to increase the closer he is to Thanos. He could also heal at an accelerated rate and had senses sharp enough to tell humans from aliens by smell,\\"Annihilation: Nova\\" Vol 1 #1 root out a skrull in disguise and detect when energy weapons were about to go off.\\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\" Vol 2 #5 In other media Television * Drax appears in the episode \\"Learning Curve\\" of the Silver Surfer animated series, voiced by Norm Spencer.

Dave Bautista plays Drax in the live- action 2014 Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy. In the film, Drax is an alien who was obsessed with killing Ronan the Accuser who slaughtered his wife and daughter. He first meets the other Guardians of the Galaxy in prison, including Gamora, whom he holds responsible for his family's deaths because she is a daughter of Thanos. She tells him that she was raised by Thanos only after he slaughtered her own family, and bears no loyalty to him, and the two join Peter Quill in escaping prison in order to confront Ronan, whom they eventually kill. A recurring gag throughout the film is Drax's inability to understand metaphors because Drax's species is, according to Rocket, completely literal. Bautista reprised his role as Drax in its 2017 sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and again in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).

A powerful telepath, master martial artist, minor telekinetic and highly skilled geneticist, Moondragon's most notable characteristics are her shaved head and achieving excellence in virtually every area of human accomplishment. Unlike most Marvel characters, who have gained their paranormal abilities through birth or accident, Moondragon has strictly achieved her extraordinary talents through extreme degrees of personal regimen. Publication history Madame MacEvil first appeared in Iron Man (vol. 1) #54 (January 1973). The issue was scripted by Bill Everett (creator of the Sub-Mariner) and Mike Friedrich and drawn by Everett and George Tuska. Fictional character biography Origin Heather Douglas was born in Los Angeles, California, daughter of Arthur and Yvette Steckley Douglas. When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of Thanos land; the space villain did not want any witnesses, so he destroyed their car. Heather was thrown clear and survived, but her parents were killed. (She would later discover that her father's soul was bound into a new body, becoming Drax the Destroyer.) She was found by Thanos' father, Mentor, who took her to his home world, Titan, to be raised by the monks of Shao-Lom.Daredevil #105 From the monks, Heather develops her body to its full potential, becoming a formidable martial artist. They teach Heather various scientific disciplines such as chemistry and genetic engineering; but most significantly, they help Heather tap into her latent psionic powers, present within all humans. Heather is able to develop her mental powers far beyond even those of her teachers, so much so that she eventually mentally contacts a powerful entity called the Dragon of the Moon. The Dragon immediately tries to corrupt and take her over, but she fights back, driving the Dragon away. This fills her with pride and an overwhelming sense of superiority. To commemorate her victory, she takes the name Moondragon. Unknown to Heather, the Dragon subtly continues to influence her on a subconscious level.Defenders #138 Heather's choice of the name Moondragon causes an uproar amongst the monks of Shao-Lom, so much so that Mentor has to confront her on the matter. After the confrontation, Moondragon is approached by Runner, one of the Elders of the Universe. Runner takes Moondragon on a tour of the universe, showing her its fantastic sights and wonders. Runner eventually takes Moondragon to the surface of a sun. He informs her that the sun would go nova in several years. Moondragon points out to Runner that the sun harbored an inhabited planet and that they should warn the inhabitants. Runner regretfully responds that, when he chose the path of freedom, he lost the option to interfere with others' destinies. Moondragon argues, \\"What good is freedom?\\" when it only leads to death. When Runner fails to answer her satisfactorily, she requests to be brought back home.Defenders #143 Sometime later, Thanos attacks Titan, destroying the monastery and the Shao-Lom monks. Moondragon escapes in her spaceship and flees to Earth.

She first returns to Earth under the guise of \\"Madame MacEvil\\" to develop a means to combat Thanos. This leads to the creation of villains like Angar the Screamer, Ramrod, and the Dark Messiah.Dark Messiah at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe In her first appearance, she forces Iron Man to battle Namor in order to study them.Iron Man #54 She then reveals her true identity and helps the Avengers in their first confrontation with Thanos. She meets the heroine Hellcat and takes her to Titan to train her. She battles Daredevil but is nearly killed by her ex-ally Kerwin J. Broderick. She restores Daredevil's sight briefly with her alien pressure point skills and then first meets Captain Mar-Vell. She aids them against Angar, the Dark Messiah, and Terrex.Daredevil #106-107 She falls in love with Daredevil but then returns to outer space. She aids Captain Mar-Vell, Drax, and the Avengers against Thanos.Captain Marvel #31-33 Moondragon is one of the three candidates to be the \\"Celestial Madonna\\", who was prophesied to give birth to a universal savior, but she loses to Mantis.Giant-Size Avengers #4 She then becomes an adventurer and joins the Avengers.Avengers #137 Although her time with the team is short,Avengers #151 (September 1976) she again aids the Avengers against Thanos.Avengers Annual #7Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 Moondragon is present when the Avengers confront Korvac; her powers allow her to see into his mind while they fight, and she decides that his goal of saving the universe by ruling it is noble. She stays out of the battle until Korvac, dejected, commits suicide.Avengers #177 (November 1978) Paths of corruption and redemption Moondragon leaves Earth with Drax and finds a planet immersed in war, so she decides to take mental control of all its inhabitants to force them to live in peace, setting herself up as their \\"peace goddess\\". Drax summons the Avengers to intervene and in the resultant confrontation, Moondragon is forced to kill her father with her mental powers. Afterwards, Thor takes her before a real god‚Äîhis father, Odin, to be judged. Odin perceives within Moondragon a stalwart but tainted spirit. He condemns her to wear a magical headband that reduces her mental powers until she has overcome her arrogance and learned humility. He also assigns Valkyrie to be her guardian. When Valkyrie rejoins the Defenders, Moondragon is forced to come along. At first, she sends out low level telepathic signals, luring threats to the vicinity of the Defenders' headquarters, hoping that one of these threats would remove her headband or force the Defenders to remove the headband so she may use her powers to aid them unhindered. One of those who respond to her telepathic suggestions turns out to be a man infected with mutated spores, who the Defenders manage to defeat. Despite the fact that Moondragon resents being with the Defenders, she wants to be accepted by them as a good person. In an encounter with Asgardian trolls, Moondragon resists the temptation of letting the trolls and the Dragon of the Moon remove her headband, thus proving herself to Odin, who promptly lets the headband fall off. This personal victory is short-lived, for soon afterwards the Defenders have to fight the spawns of the mutated spores they fought months before. The spawns soon coalesce into a single gargantuan monster, which Moondragon vanquishes with the help of the Gargoyle. Unknown to Moondragon, in doing so, she is infected with the mutated spores. She does not find out about the infection until weeks later, when the spores have supplanted a good portion of her own internal organs. The Dragon of the Moon appears again and tells her it can save her life, but only if she agrees to be its host. Moondragon initially turns down its offer, knowing that it will use her to kill the Defenders. The Dragon then mocks Moondragon's sentimentality by showing her what the other Defenders are saying about her behind her back even though she has reformed. Finally overwhelmed with pain, she accepts. Now totally corrupted, Moondragon battles the Defenders until Andromeda, Interloper, Manslaughter, and Valkyrie sacrifice themselves to kill both her and the Dragon. Heather's soul manages to survive, and, now free from the Dragon again, contacts her cousin Pamela; through her, she is able to obtain a new body for herself, a clone created on Titan. For a while, she and her cousin, who becomes the heroine Sundragon, adventure together in space. Cosmic cohort After Quasar is appointed Protector of the Universe, Moondragon insinuates herself into his life. Using the pseudonym H.D. Steckley she becomes an engineer and saleswoman for Vaughn Security Systems. She is convinced that in time Quasar will realize they are eminently qualified to form the universe's most cosmic coupling. Quasar, however, asserts that qualifications have nothing to do with feelings and rebuffs her. She persists for a time, but eventually gets the message and loses interest.Quasar #11-29 When Adam Warlock seeks people to help him safeguard the Infinity Gems, he chooses Moondragon to keep the Mind Gem‚Äîbut only after erecting safeguards so Moondragon cannot exploit the gem's full power. Still, she agrees to join his team, the Infinity Watch.Warlock and the Infinity Watch #2 She eventually loses the gem when it is stolen by Rune. Moondragon later becomes an associate of Genis-Vell (the third Captain Marvel), determined to help him control his cosmic awareness. During this time, she falls in love with Marlo Chandler, the wife of Rick Jones (whom Captain Marvel was bonded to). The two elope on a lesbian relationship to the reluctant understanding of Rick, with whom Marlo is having marital problems anyway. Sometime later, Marlo gets over her feelings for Moondragon and decides to return to Rick. Moondragon tells her she must have accidentally prodded her telepathically into the relationship, but this is a lie to make the break-up easier. In truth, Moondragon is heartbroken; she leaves shortly after with Phyla-Vell.Captain Marvel (vol. 4) #25 Annihilation In the Annihilation miniseries, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell return, visiting the graves of Mar-Vell and Genis-Vell. At this time, Thanos appears and kidnaps Moondragon, using her as a hostage to draw out Drax the Destroyer for an unknown purpose. Also, when she is infected with the Annihilation Wave parasites, she is forced to reveal Annihilus' plan to destroy all life in the universe, which he would then rule. Thanos causes her to regurgitate the parasites, having no interest in Annihilus' plan. However, Thanos' plan for revenge is cut short as Drax rushes off to save his daughter, which he does by ripping Thanos' heart out, just before the villain was about to save the universe from Annihilus. However, Drax and Moondragon then manage to free the Silver Surfer, who in turn helps free Galactus, destroying Annihlus' plans. Galactus then teleports away Drax and Moondragon. Moondragon \\"loses track\\" of Drax and is reunited with Phyla-Vell. Annihilation: Conquest In Quasar: Annihilation: Conquest, the love of Phyla and Moondragon is explored in depth. Due to the Phalanx taking over the Kree Empire, Phyla and Heather have to find the 'savior' that is shown to Phyla (Quasar) in a vision. They come across the Super-Adaptoid, who was absorbed by the Phalanx and set to prevent the women from finding the savior. During the battle, Moondragon has to change into a dragon, like the 'Dragon of the Moon' she had to fight most of her life. Moondragon cannot change back into her human form. Moondragon and Phyla follow a voice Phyla hears to find the savior for the Kree race, who is being attacked by the Phalanx. In the end, it turns out the voice belongs to the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree. It helps them find a cocoon, which is restoring Adam Warlock. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx. Shortly after, the Phalanx arrives, led by the murderous android Ultron. Moondragon attempts to protect Phyla, and Ultron responds by plunging his arm into her chest. Heather dies shortly after in Phyla's arms.Annihilation: Conquest #2 Sometime later, Phyla and Drax are alerted by a prophet that Moondragon may be attempting to return. Mentor concludes that this may be the case, and so kills the two of them so that they may journey into the realm of the dead to retrieve her. Phyla saves Moondragon from the gullet of the Dragon of the Moon, and they return to life.Guardians of the Galaxy #9-12 Guardians of the Galaxy After her resurrection, Moondragon joins Phyla back at Knowhere and is accepted as an unofficial member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy #13 She assists Cosmo and Mantis as part of the telepathic support team. Her resurrection leaves her mind more open than it had been before her death, so she is able to detect things before either Mantis or Cosmo do. Her increased sensitivity also leaves her more vulnerable to psychic manipulation by Starhawk, who has herself released from confinement. With Phyla's death at the hands of Adam Magus, Moondragon takes it upon herself to become a field agent for the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, she becomes host to an alien parasite originating in a parallel universe across the Fault, a time-space tear created by Black Bolt's Terrigen Bomb. Worse, she is biometrically cuffed by Cynosure, leader of the Luminals (an organization of heroic alien superhumans from the planet Xarth III), who intends to have the creature tried for killing one of her fellow Luminals. To make things worse, members of the Church of Universal Truth kidnap Moondragon and Cynosure, seeing the parasite as a god, whom they intend to birth. Luckily, the Guardians and Luminals mount a joint rescue attempt and extract the two. With the help of Knowhere's medical staff, they are able to remove the organism from Moondragon. During these experiences, Moondragon has visions of a cocoon and Phyla being alive.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 #19-24 Powers and abilities Heather Douglas is a human who has accessed her full psionic potential through extreme training under the Titanian monks of Shao-Lom. She is also highly educated in Titanian science and is a master martial artist. Moondragon primarily possesses tremendous telepathic abilities which have enabled her to control the population of an entire planet to stop an ongoing war, while enslaving the thunder god Thor as her personal lover.Avengers #219-220 (May‚ÄìJune 1982) She has demonstrated willpower and spiritual strength rivaling that of Thanos,Captain Marvel vol. 1, #31 (March 1974) and the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange,Infinity Abyss #3 (Sep, 2002) pierced the psionic shields of the cosmic entity Galactus to enable communication, and when borrowing her abilities, Thanos almost manages to overwhelm the Devourer.Thanos #3 (Dec. 2003) Beyond communication and control of other minds, she can induce mental illusions, cause personality changes, and erase specific memories. She can also fire bolts of psionic energy as concussive blasts that can either stun an opponent or render an opponent brain dead. She is also a low-level telekinetic, an ability that lets her move and manipulate most physical matter by using only her thoughts, levitate herself and others, create shields of psychic force, and fire concussive psychokinetic energy blasts with sufficient strength to affect steel. Moondragon has undergone extreme levels of training in the Titanian martial arts, as well as mental disciplines allowing her near- complete control over her body, including autonomic functions such as heartbeat, bleeding, and breathing, as well as awareness of pain. She has honed her strength, speed, stamina, agility and reflexes to her highest limits. Her martial arts skills have even allowed her to beat Captain AmericaWarlock and the Infinity Watch #27 and Mantis in hand-to-hand combat.Fantastic Four Annual #25 (1992) Heather possesses a genius intellect and is extremely knowledgeable in various areas of advanced Titanian scientific disciplines such as genetics and bionics and has been able to upgrade the cyborgs Ramrod and Angar the Screamer and restore Daredevil's eyesight. She is also a highly skilled starship pilot. She has demonstrated the ability to assume the form of her namesake, a fire-breathing dragon capable of surviving in outer space, traversing interstellar distances. However, it is unclear if she retains this ability after her latest resurrection. Moondragon's powers are not without weaknesses. For instance, Rick Jones is able to stop Moondragon's telepathy by taping her to a chair, covering her eyes and mouth with duct tape, and placing headphones on her ears that blast deafening Limp Bizkit nu metal music. This causes Moondragon to lose touch with her senses and concentration, thus leaving her powerless.Captain Marvel vol. 5, #6 (March 2003) Moondragon also suffers from emotional instability due to her isolated upbringing and intense superiority complex, which alienates her from her environment. This sometimes causes her to coerce decisions or render ruthless judgment. However, more positive later relationships have helped her emotional state, particularly her relationship with Phyla-Vell, which has allowed her to be more open and compassionate towards others. During the early 1990s, she gains possession of the \\"Mind Gem,\\" which enhances her psionic powers to an unknown, potentially unlimited degree. Adam Warlock has apparently instituted some unknown safeguards within the gem to prevent her from misusing it. Other versions Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Moondragon has never accessed her full psionic potential and instead was approached by and joined Quentin Quire's group of low level telepaths to create a kind of \\"psychic pyramid scheme\\" known as the Overmind which Quentin uses to increase his own limited skills.Age of Apocalypse #5 (September 2012) Heather along with the telepaths that compose the Overmind are later confronted and killed by the Shadow King.Age of Apocalypse #11 (March 2013) Ultimate Marvel In the first issue of the Ultimate Extinction arc, as part of the Ultimate Marvel line, a bald woman with a dragon tattoo and considerable martial arts prowess attacks Misty Knight.

He performed in a wide range of styles, including jazz fusion, Afro-Cuban jazz, bebop, and avant-garde. Willis was born in New York City. After his first year studying music theory at the Manhattan School of Music he began performing regularly with Jackie McLean. After he graduated he made his first jazz recording, McLean's Right Now! in January 1965, which featured two of Willis' compositions. His first recording of any type, however, was as a singer with the Music and Arts Chorale Ensemble, performing an opera by Aaron Copland under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He decided to concentrate on jazz because of the difficulties African-American musicians had in finding work in concert music. Throughout his career he performed with a wide range of musicians, including several years as keyboardist for Blood, Sweat & Tears (beginning in 1972). He spent several years as pianist for trumpeters Nat Adderley and Woody Shaw as well as long and productive tenures with Roy Hargrove and with Jerry Gonzalez and his Fort Apache Band. His late recording with Paul Murphy, Expos√©, demonstrated the fusion principles of bebop and avant-garde jazz. His composition \\"Sanctuary\\" began exploring works employing strings.Wynn, Ron. Larry Willis Artist Biography. AllMusic. After a successful performance in Frank Lloyd Wright's Annie Pfieffer Chapel at Florida Southern College's Child of the Sun Jazz Festival he was commissioned to write a full-scale orchestral work for jazz trio and orchestra. He worked with Hugh Masekela on a South African Suite of music and interpreted Miles Davis' work. He was in the Round About Midnight tour of Miles Davis' music. He received the Don Redman award in 2011, and the Benny Golson Jazz Master Award at Howard University in 2012.

The show was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, best known for creating South Park. Despite the political overtones, the show itself was moreso a broad lampoon of American sitcoms, including jokes, a laugh track, and stock characters such as klutzy secretary Princess (Kristen Miller), know-it-all maid Maggie (Marcia Wallace), and supposedly helpful next door neighbor Larry (John D'Aquino). The series was conceived in the wake of the 2000 presidential election, between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Parker and Stone were sure that Gore would win the election, and tentatively titled the show Everybody Loves Al. However, due to the controversy regarding the election's outcome, the series was pushed back. Instead, the show was then plotted around Bush at the workplace. The show received positive reviews, with The New York Times commenting, \\"That's My Bush! is a satire of hero worship itself; it is the anti-West Wing and the first true post-Clinton comedy. [...] This politically astute criticism is embedded in so much hysterical humor that the series never seems weighty.\\" Plot The series centers on the fictitious personal life of President George W. Bush, played by Timothy Bottoms. Carrie Quinn Dolin played Laura Bush, and Kurt Fuller played Karl Rove. Episodes dealt (with deliberate heavy handedness) with the topics of abortion, gun control, the war on drugs, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the death penalty. Every episode ended with George saying \\"One of these days, Laura, I'm gonna punch you in the face!\\", a parody of Jackie Gleason's line from The Honeymooners, \\"One of these days, Alice... Bang, zoom! Right to the moon!\\" The show was more of a spoof of the banality of television sitcoms in general, rather than a cutting political satire. As The A.V. Club put it: Cast * Timothy Bottoms as President George W. Bush * Carrie Quinn Dolin as First Lady Laura Bush * Kurt Fuller as Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove * Marcia Wallace as Maggie Hawley * Kristen Miller as Princess Stevenson * John D'Aquino as Larry O'Shea Production Development Parker and Stone stated before the 2000 presidential election that they would create a satire about whoever won. According to their DVD commentary, they were \\"95% certain that Gore would win\\" and started developing the series under the title Everybody Loves Al. When the final election results were in limbo, production was delayed until the winner was determined. With Bush's election, the title became the entendre That's My Bush! The final episode involved Dick Cheney forcing Bush to step down, and featured an alternate title music called That's My Dick! which, later in the episode, changed to What A Dick! Writing The entire idea behind the series was to parody sitcoms. The premise developed into one of the U.S. President in office. Parker recalled the idea came about three months before the 2000 presidential election. The duo were \\"95 percent sure\\" that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win, and tentatively titled the show Everybody Loves Al. It was, essentially, the same show: a lovable main character, the sassy maid, the wacky neighbor. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms. The duo watched a lot of Fawlty Towers in preparation. The duo signed a deal with Comedy Central to produce a live action sitcom, titled Family First, scheduled to debut on February 28, 2001. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of who the President would be, the show's production was pushed back. The duo wanted to write a \\"family sitcom\\", with the Bush family. Comedy Central, however, prohibited Parker and Stone from including the Bush twins (Jenna Bush and Barbara Pierce Bush). The writers then turned the Bush twins character into Princess. \\"An Aborted Dinner Date\\" was the show's pilot episode. The episode features Felix the Fetus, which was made and operated by the Chiodo Brothers, who later worked with Parker and Stone on Team America: World Police (2004). They also created the cat Punk'kin in \\"The First Lady's Persqueeter\\". The show's producers consider the second episode aired, \\"A Poorly Executed Plan\\", the true first episode. This was Parker and Stone's first live action production to be a part of the Writers Guild of America, West. The show's writers got a big dry-erase board and on one side, they would write down political ideas (abortion, capital punishment) and on the other side would be typical sitcom stories (frat buddies show up, trapped in a small space). They would then combine the two ideas, in what Stone described as \\"a Three's Company mix-up kind of thing.\\" That's My Bush! was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot. The show was not shot in front of a live audience, so as to keep control over the show and by necessity, thanks to various shots they would be unable to do in a normal show. They had built several rooms from the White House in their studio (bedroom, dining room) and were allowed \\"one new, rotating set\\" per week. Parker described the sets as \\"amazing,\\" and they were in fact packaged up after the show's run and sent to other White House-related productions. The show's producers gained inspiration by going on a private tour of the White House thanks to Anne Garefino, executive producer, who once worked at the White House for PBS. A White House usher showed the producers various rooms not allowed on normal tours, which allowed them to detail each set effectively. Casting was relatively simple; Parker and Stone came across a photo of Timothy Bottoms in Variety for a play he was doing in Santa Barbara. Parker and Stone called him in, and they found he was \\"perfect\\" for the role. The plan was not to viciously \\"rip on\\" Bush or make him out to be a monster; in accordance with sitcom stereotypes, Bush was made a sweet and lovable oaf. Kurt Fuller was the last actor to be cast in the show. Jeff Melman was the director for each episode. This was the first time Trey Parker was only writing, not directing. Each episode was shot in two days. The weeks were spent writing and getting ready while the cast rehearsed. Like South Park, in which Parker would be able to write a scene and see it animated a short time later, he and Stone could walk to rehearsals and see the cast rehearsing their script. Each episode opened with a cold open, with a \\"cheesy\\" joke that segued into the theme song. The duo recalled that, with stupid titles, these scenes were often the hardest to write. The episode \\"S.D.I. -Aye-Aye!\\"features the first utterance of the word \\"Lemmiwinks\\", which Parker and the writers intended to be a parody of The Lord of the Rings. The word was later famously used in the South Park episode \\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\\". The show's first episode set a ratings record (at the time) for highest debut with over 2.9 million viewers tuning in; however, ratings dropped after this, with an average of 1.7 million viewers. During the production of \\"Fare Thee Welfare\\", the show's series finale, the producers knew the show would end as it would be very expensive. For example, for the episode \\"Eenie Meenie Miney Murder\\", Parker and Stone used a live bear, an animatronic bear, an actor in a bear suit, and a puppet bear, which ended up breaking their budget. Although the show received a fair amount of publicity and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the cost per episode was too high, \\"about $1 million an episode.\\" Comedy Central officially cancelled the series in August 2001, as a cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying \\"A super-expensive show on a small cable network...the economics of it were just not going to work.\\" Comedy Central continued the show in reruns, considering it a creative and critical success. Parker believed the show would not have survived after the September 11 attacks anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not \\"play well.\\" There was talk of a spin-off feature film for the series entitled George W. Bush and the Secret of the Glass Tiger. The concept behind the film extended the bait and switch gag of the show: it would have to do with a Chinese invasion foiled by the President. Parker and Stone intended to work on it during the summer of 2002. Parker recalls That's My Bush! \\"a great time in our lives,\\" and \\"the most fun we've had in our careers.\\" That's My Bush! has had an effect on the structure of South Park: prior to 2001, each South Park episode was broken up into four acts. While producing That's My Bush!, Parker and Stone found the three act structure provided a better story, and South Park has continued to use it in recent years. Stone called the show one of the most pleasant experiences in his life. Bottoms went on to portray George W. Bush in two later films: in a comedic context in Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, and in a serious context in the television movie DC 9/11: Time of Crisis.

Publication history Pip the Troll was introduced by Jim Starlin in Strange Tales vol 2 #179 (Feb 1975) to be a comic foil to the story's main protagonist, Adam Warlock. Pip returned in Strange Tales vol 2 #180-181 (Mar-Apr 1975) and Warlock vol 1 #9-12 (Oct 1975-Jan 1976) before his death in Avengers Annual #7 (Mar 1977). Starlin revived the character years later in Silver Surfer vol 3 #46 (Dec 1990). Pip played a role in the 1991 Infinity Gauntlet crossover before joining the titular team of Warlock and the Infinity Watch in issue two (Mar 1992). He appeared in the title until its cancellation in 1995 with issue 42. During its run, the character was also featured in the Infinity War, Infinity Crusade, and Blood and Thunder crossovers. After a brief appearance in a back up feature in Cosmic Powers Unlimited #4 (1996), the character was not seen again until 2002 when Starlin used him in Infinity Abyss #1-6. He returned in Marvel: The End #5-6 (2003) and Thanos #3-4 (2004), She-Hulk #12-13 (2005), and X-Factor #207-213 (2010‚Äì2011). Fictional character biography Pip was once Prince Gofern of the planet Laxidazia, in the Dolenz System, in the Milky Way Galaxy. He was originally an alien of the Laxidazian race who enjoyed painting pictures of the night sky. Pip became physically and psychologically mutated into a morally degenerate, stunted, satyr-like form known as a \\"troll\\" during a bout of drunkenness brought on by a mutagenic hallucinogenic ale. Like all Laxidazian trolls, Pip has four digits (including opposable thumb) on each hand, hooflike feet, and large pointed ears; apparently, normal Laxidazians are nearly identical to Earth humans. After his transformation, his people, also sick of his lewd, lecherous, and hedonistic behavior, strip him of his office and rank. He stows away on a spaceship and continues his life of debauchery. Pip began his habit of dressing in a pair of maroon, ripped pants and nothing else. Missionaries from the Universal Church of Truth visit Pip's home planet and discover the trolls are resistant to the church's conversion process. As a result, all trolls are ordered to be killed. Pip himself is caught after making trouble on dozens of planets, many controlled by the church. He ends up on a ship full of men and women who were to be executed. There he meets Adam Warlock, whose alternate future self the Magus would become the leader of the Church of Truth. Pip teamed up with Warlock to escape and go on adventures.Strange Tales, vol. 2 #179 Pip then meets Gamora.Strange Tales, vol. 2 #180‚Äì181 Pip meets Thanos, and alongside Warlock, Gamora, and Thanos, he battles the Magus and the Universal Church.Warlock #9‚Äì11 Pip revealed how he was transformed into a troll. He encounters Starfox and Heater Delight, and battles Pro-Boscis the Procurer.Warlock #12 Eventually the threat of the Magus was neutralized and Pip parted company with Adam on the world of Sirus X. After getting into much more trouble, Pip decided to look for Adam again. Pip explored one of Thanos' old hideouts and discovered not Adam, but Thanos himself. Thanos destroyed Pip's mind, but Adam was able to absorb Pip's soul into the Soul Gem (killing his mindless body, but restoring full mental function to his soul), reuniting him with the spirits of Gamora and eventually Adam Warlock in Soulworld within the Soul Gem.Avengers Annual #7; Marvel Two- in-One Annual #2 Pip resided in Soulworld for some time. While there, he accompanied the Silver Surfer and Captain Autolycus in search of Warlock. He witnessed a battle between Warlock and Drax the Destroyer.Silver Surfer, vol. 3 #46‚Äì47 Infinity Watch Pip, Gamora, and Warlock return to the corporeal world during the Infinity Gauntlet incident by taking over bodies of three crash victims. Pip, in possession of the body of Ralph Bunker, and Gamora were both shown to have significantly increased physical strength in their new bodies. However, soon after returning to life, Gamora disappeared.Infinity Gauntlet #1 Alongside Warlock, Pip conferred with Doctor Strange, Rintrah, Doctor Doom, and the Silver Surfer regarding Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet.Infinity Gauntlet #2 Alongside Doctor Strange, Clea, and Rintrah, Pip battled Silver Dagger.Doctor Strange, vol. 3 #32 Alongside Rintrah, Pip time- traveled to Earth's Jurassic era to rescue Firelord and Drax the Destroyer.Doctor Strange, vol. 3 #35 Alongside Warlock and Gamora, Pip visited Thanos after his defeat.Infinity Gauntlet #6 With Gamora, Pip summoned Doctor Strange to deal with the seemingly power-mad Warlock, but was reconciled with Warlock.Doctor Strange, vol. 3 #36 Afterwards, Pip was given the Space Gem by Warlock, keeping it between his toes for safekeeping. Pip joined Warlock's Infinity Watch.Warlock and the Infinity Watch #2 With the Infinity Watch, Pip was captured by the Man Beast, but rescued by Warlock.Warlock and the Infinity Watch #3‚Äì6 Pip and his friends end up setting shop on Monster Island.Warlock and the Infinity Watch #7 Pip takes too much as usual and abusing the hospitality of Mole Man. In a dispute over the sovereignty of the island, forces of the United Nations invade. Pip and the others hang back as Gamora cleans house, killing no one. The group makes bets on the fight. Around this time, the events known as the Infinity War happen. When Warlock had control of the Infinity Gauntlet, he had forced out the good and evil sides of himself. The evil side returns as Warlock's long-term adversary, the Magus. Pip is drawn into the fight when Thanos recruits the Watch. As most of Earth's heroes do not trust Thanos, Pip and his friends were forced to battle them as well. Eventually both sides work together to take down the Magus.Infinity War #1‚Äì6 Infinity Crusade Pip became deeply involved in the Infinity Crusade. He manages to be a capable 'leader' of the remnants of the Infinity Watch when various events took most of them away. Moondragon, for example, is brainwashed and taken by the Goddess, the 'good' side of Adam Warlock. She is using a Cosmic Egg, the merging of several Cosmic Cubes, to implement her plans, which involve brainwashing dozens of superheroes. Left on Monster Island with Maxam and Drax the Destroyer, the three argue over who should lead. Pip decides to go outside the group for help and kidnaps Mister Fantastic. The leader of the Fantastic Four soon realizes what is going on and pitches in to help. This, and the kidnapping of other superheroes, brings everyone together, Pip included, at Avengers Mansion and actually spurs on the heroic efforts of the rest of the super-powered community. Pip is spurred to create a new, 'super- heroic' costume, but he fails to wash himself while changing. His body odor is so offensive the Hulk forcibly bathes him.Warlock and the Infinity Watch #20 King of the Universe Professor Xavier proceeds to make telepathic contact with one of the Goddess' thralls, Pip's former ally, Moondragon. Pip secretly touches Xavier and his powers make contact through the link, allowing him to know the location of the Goddess because Moondragon knows it. Pip teleports to it, in the center of the Goddess' planet, a new form of Counter- Earth. By touching the Cosmic Egg, Pip gains access to its near-infinite powers. He turns the Goddess into salt. He manifests a throne and sits upon it, musing as to what to do with his newfound powers. He reflects on many plans for Earth, such as making super-powered beings wash his car and changing all the females, including the overweight and elderly, into shapely, twenty- something women. One of his goals is to gain revenge on the Hulk for forcibly bathing him; however, he realizes none of this will make him truly happy, and therefore decides on something that will: a simple birthday party thrown for him by his friends. Before he can implement this, he is subdued by the brainwashed guardian of the Egg, the female New Warriors member Silhouette. She had been hiding in a nearby container, for just this sort of situation.Infinity Crusade #4‚Äì5 (1993)Warlock and the Infinity Watch #18 (July 1993) After Infinity Watch Although Pip has been seen rarely since the Infinity Watch disbanded, he appears in Marvel: The End #5‚Äì6 and She-Hulk (2005 series) #12‚Äì13. Pip also assisted Thanos in his first quest after his experience in Marvel: The End in Thanos #1‚Äì6. X-Factor Investigations Pip is next seen when Hela, Norse goddess of death, appears in disguise and hires X-Factor Investigations to find a missing pendant of Thor's hammer. When Jamie Madrox and Banshee track it down and take it off of the neck of a drunken bar patron, he reverts to Pip the Troll.X-Factor #207 (2010) Without the pendant hiding him, Hela is able to track down Pip, whom she captures.X-Factor #208 (2010) This angers X-Factor leader Madrox, who feels responsible, and the team travels to Las Vegas and saves the troll with the help of Thor.X-Factor #208‚Äì209, 211‚Äì212 (2010) Pip follows X-Factor back to New York and joins the team, serving as receptionist, out of gratitude for their actions; however, a mysterious phone call Pip receives reveals that Pip has other, as-yet-unknown reasons for joining the group.X-Factor #213 (2011) It appeared Pip was killed by a woman he previously helped. The woman shoots him in the head after claiming that \\"X-Factor will fall\\".X-Factor #246 (2013) The injury was not fatal due to his non-human physique: Laxidazians's brains are in their chest, next to the heart, as he explains later.X-Factor #249 (2013) Powers and abilities When in possession of the Space Gem, Pip could theoretically access virtually incalculable powers, but chose to use it merely for transportation and teleportation. The gem gave him the ability to teleport to places he knows of. This he often used for his own ends, stealing the Fantasticar and other objects. When forced into battle, he tends to appear directly above his adversary's head, intending to deliver a powerful blow. He has since lost the Space Gem, but his long-term exposure to it has given him the innate ability to teleport.

It is known in many languages as the cucumber time. The term is first attested in 1861, was listed in the second (1894) edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, and remains in use at the start of the 21st century. The fifteenth edition of Brewer's expands on the second, defining the silly season as \\"the part of the year when Parliament and the Law Courts are not sitting (about August and September)\\". In North America the period is often referred to prosaically as the slow news season, or less commonly with the phrase dog days of summer. In Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the silly season has come to refer to the Christmas/New Year festive period (which occurs during the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere) on account of the higher than usual number of social engagements where the consumption of alcohol is typical. The term is also used in sports, to describe periods outside traditional competitive sporting seasons. Origin The first attestation in the Oxford English Dictionary is an article titled \\"The Silly Season\\" in the Saturday Review edition of 13 July 1861.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"silly season\\" The article is specifically about an alleged reduction in the quality of the editorial content of The Times newspaper:. :during the months of autumn [, w]hen Parliament is no longer sitting and the gay world is no longer gathered together in London, something very different is supposed to do for the remnant of the public from what is needed in the politer portions of the year. The Times's great men have doubtless gone out of town, like other great men. ... The hands which at other times wield the pen for our instruction are now wielding the gun on a Scotch moor or the Alpenstock on a Swiss mountain. Work is left to feebler hands. ... In those months the great oracle becomes ‚Äîwhat at other times it is not‚Äîsimply silly. In spring and early summer, the Times is often violent, unfair, fallacious, inconsistent, intentionally unmeaning, even positively blundering, but it is very seldom merely silly. ... In the dead of autumn, when the second and third rate hands are on, we sink from nonsense written with a purpose to nonsense written because the writer must write either nonsense or nothing. Motivation Typically, the latter half of the summer is slow in terms of newsworthy events. Newspapers as their primary means of income rely on advertisements, which rely on readers seeing them, but historically newspaper readership drops off during this time. In the United Kingdom, Parliament takes its summer recess, so that parliamentary debates and Prime Minister's Questions, which generate much news coverage, do not happen. This period is also a summer school holiday, when many families with children choose to take holidays, and there is accordingly often a decline of business news, as many employers reduce their activity. Similar recesses are typical of legislative bodies elsewhere. To retain (and attract) subscribers, newspapers would print attention-grabbing headlines and articles to boost sales, often to do with minor moral panics or child abductions. For example, the extensive British press coverage devoted to Operation Irma, a humanitarian airlift during the Siege of Sarajevo, was criticised as a \\"silly season\\" tactic. Other names In many languages, the silly season is called \\"cucumber time\\" or similar. Other countries have comparable periods, for example the Sommerloch (\\"summer [news]hole\\") in German-speaking Europe; French has la morte-saison (\\"the dead season\\" or \\"the dull season\\") or \\"la saison des marronniers\\" (\\"the conker tree season\\"), and Swedish has nyhetstorka (\\"news drought\\"). In many languages, the name for the silly season references cucumbers (more precisely: gherkins or pickled cucumbers). Komkommertijd in Dutch, Danish agurketid, Icelandic g√∫rkut√≠√∞, Norwegian agurktid (a piece of news is called agurknytt or agurknyhet, i.e., \\"cucumber news\\"), Czech okurkov√° sez√≥na, Slovak uhorkov√° sez√≥na, Polish Sezon og√≥rkowy, Hungarian uborkaszezon, and Hebrew ◊¢◊ï◊†◊™ ◊î◊û◊ú◊§◊§◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù (onat ha'melafefonim, \\"season of the cucumbers\\") all mean \\"cucumber time\\" or \\"cucumber season\\". The corresponding term in German is Sauregurkenzeit and in Estonian hapukurgihooaeg (\\"pickled cucumber season\\"); the same term is also used in Croatian as sezona kiselih krastavaca and in Slovene as ƒças kislih kumaric. The term \\"cucumber time\\" was also used in England in the 1800s to denote the slow season for tailors. A silly season news item is called r√∂tm√•nadshistoria in Sweden and m√§t√§kuun juttu in Finland, both literally meaning \\"rotting-month story\\". In Spain the term serpiente de verano (\\"summer snake\\") is often used, not for the season, but for the news items. The term is a reference to the Loch Ness Monster and similar creatures, who are reputed to get more headlines in summer. Side effects A side effect of stirring up the public in this manner comes when an authentic story is dismissed as a prank, or when a superfluous story is taken as legitimate. A 1950 short story by Cyril M. Kornbluth, titled \\"The Silly Season\\", makes use of this concept by having invading aliens stage one strange but harmless event after another. All are duly reported by the newspapers until the public is bored with them, and when a final \\"strange event\\" occurs, no one is prepared to accept it as an invasion until it is too late. The story was included in the 1952 anthology Tomorrow, the Stars, edited by Robert A. Heinlein. Sports Silly Season also refers to time periods outside traditional season-long competitive sporting competitions. In team sports such as association football and professional ice hockey, and leagues such as Formula One, NASCAR, the NBA, or the NFL, the final weeks of the season leading into off-time between one season and the next is filled with speculation regarding possible changes involving players, staff, and teams. Regardless of whether the speculation remains just that or indeed bears fruit, the moves and the discussions they generate help build interest in the leagues, their teams, and their upcoming seasons. Silly season is also used in professional golf to describe tournaments that are not official PGA Tour or LPGA Tour events. Normally scheduled at or near the end of the calendar year, when PGA and LPGA tournaments are not usually scheduled, these events also employ formats of play not normally seen on those tours. The Shark Shootout and the Skins Game are two such examples of silly season events. US Politics In US politics and lifestyle, the silly season is a period from early summer until the first week of October of election years. Primary elections are over at this time, but formal debates have not started and the general election is still many weeks away. Issues raised during this period are likely to be forgotten by the election, so candidates may rely on frivolous political posturing and hyperbole to get media attention and raise money.

Biography The band was formed in 1994 by Jarmo Puolakanaho, Altti Vetel√§inen and Olli-Pekka T√∂rr√∂, after various projects that featured people who became members of Eternal Tears of Sorrow. Andromeda, a first death/doom/thrash metal project, had been put on hold in late 1992 because the rehearsal place had burned down. They could not find a new rehearsal place in their hometown, so the three members started a new side-project (M.D.C.) and recorded a demo tape, Beyond The Fantasy in autumn 1993. In spring 1994, they recorded a new demo, The Seven Goddesses of Frost. Then the band decided to change their name to something they felt more appropriate opting for Eternal Tears of Sorrow. Between 1994 and 1996 the band had a couple of songs on some compilation CDs in Europe and Canada, and recorded their debut, Sinner's Serenade. It took more than a year for the debut album to get released by X-Treme Records, a small underground label from Gothenburg in Sweden. After they recorded their second album, Vilda M√°nnu, Spinefarm Records approached the band and soon they signed a deal with the label. Their third album, Chaotic Beauty (on which the band had three new members since Olli-Pekka T√∂rr√∂ had left the band), led to a European tour with Nightwish and Sinergy. Their fourth album, A Virgin and a Whore, went to the Finnish Album Top 40 charts. After releasing four albums, the band announced they were taking a break just after the release of A Virgin and a Whore; however, they broke up in January 2003. In February 2005, the band announced they were going to make a comeback. Their fifth album, Before the Bleeding Sun, was released in April 2006 (excluding releases in Russia and Japan that were released later). This album also went to the Finnish Album Top 40 charts, to No. 26. The band added two session members since Petri Sankala and Janne Tolsa were unavailable at that time. In late 2008, the band announced that Jarmo Kylm√§nen (who had been part of the band's song-writing team since 2005) had joined the band as an official member. Soon after that, their long-time drummer Petri Sankala left because of back pain. In early April 2009, it was reported that Risto Ruuth had left the band. They found a replacement, Mika Lammassaari, and started rehearsing for the postponed live shows originally planned for May. The band's sixth album, Children of the Dark Waters, came out in May 2009 through Suomen Musiikki in Finland, Massacre Records in the rest of Europe, and Marquee/Avalon in Asia. A new single, \\"Tears of Autumn Rain,\\" was released in Finland and Japan as well as on the band's MySpace page. The other track on the single was a re-recorded version of \\"Vilda M√°nnu\\" from their second album. \\"Children of the Dark Waters\\" album charted at No. 19 at the Finnish Album Top 40 charts. The seventh album, \\"Saivon Lapsi\\", was released in February 2013. Mika Lammassaari left the band in 2018 and Risto Ruuth joined the band again. Currently, the band is writing new material.

Many studies have found the eastern wolf to be the product of ancient and recent genetic admixture between the gray wolf and the coyote, while other studies have found some or all populations of the eastern wolf, as well as coyotes, originally separated from a common ancestor with the wolf over 1 million years ago and that these populations of the eastern wolf may be the same species as or a closely related species to the red wolf of the Southeastern United States. Regardless of its status, it is regarded as unique and therefore worthy of conservation with Canada citing the population in eastern Canada (also known as the \\"Algonquin wolf\\") as being the eastern wolf population subject to protection. There are two forms, the larger being referred to as the Great Lakes wolf, which is generally found in Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southeastern Manitoba and northern Ontario, and the smaller being the Algonquin wolf, which inhabits eastern Canada, specifically central Ontario and southwestern Quebec, with some overlapping and mixing of the two types in the southern portions of northeastern and northwestern Ontario. The eastern wolf's morphology is midway between that of the gray wolf and the coyote. The fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown color mixed with cinnamon. The nape, shoulder and tail region are a mix of black and gray, with the flanks and chest being rufous or creamy. It primarily preys on white- tailed deer, but may occasionally attack moose and beavers.Theberge, J. B. & M. T. Theberge (2004). The wolves of Algonquin Park, a 12 Year Ecological Study , Department of Geography, Publication Series Number 56, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the eastern wolf as a gray wolf subspecies, which supports its earlier classification based on morphology in three studies. This taxonomic classification has since been debated, with proposals based on DNA analyses that includes a gray wolf ecotype, a gray wolf with genetic introgression from the coyote, a gray wolf/coyote hybrid, a gray wolf/red wolf hybrid, the same species as the red wolf, or a separate species (Canis lycaon) closely related to the red wolf. Commencing in 2016, two studies using whole genome sequencing indicate that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of ancient and complex gray wolf and coyote mixing, with the Great Lakes wolf possessing 25% coyote ancestry and the Algonquin wolf possessing 40% coyote ancestry. In the US, a bill is before Congress to remove protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for the gray wolf populations located in the western Great Lakes region. In Canada, the eastern wolf is listed as Canis lupus lycaon under the Species At Risk Act 2002, Schedule 1 - List of Wildlife at Risk. In 2015, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada recognized the eastern wolf in central Ontario and southwestern Quebec as Canis cf. lycaon (Canis species believed to be lycaon) and a threatened species worthy of conservation. The main threat to this wolf is human hunting and trapping outside of the protected areas, which leads to genetic introgression with the eastern coyote due to a lack of mates. Further human development immediately outside of the protected areas and the negative public perception of wolves are expected to inhibit any further expansion of their range. In 2016, the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario recognized the Algonquin wolf as a Canis sp. (Canis species) differentiated from the hybrid Great Lakes wolves which it found were the result of \\"hybridization and backcrossing among Eastern Wolf (Canis lycaon) (aka C. lupus lycaon), Gray Wolf (C. lupus), and Coyote (C. latrans)\\". Taxonomy Washtenaw County, MI The first published name of a taxon belonging to the genus Canis from North America is Canis lycaon. It was published in 1775 by the German naturalist Johann Schreber, who had based it on the earlier description and illustration of one specimen that was thought to have been captured near Quebec. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of gray wolf by Edward Goldman. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the eastern wolf as a gray wolf subspecies, which supports its earlier classification based on morphology in three studies. This taxonomic classification has since been debated. Taxonomic debate When European settlers first arrived to North America, the coyote's range was limited to the western half of the continent. They existed in the arid areas and across the open plains, including the prairie regions of the midwestern states. Early explorers found some in Indiana and Wisconsin. From the mid-1800s coyotes began expanding beyond their original range. The taxonomic debate regarding North American wolves can be summarised as follows: The evolutionary biologist Robert K. Wayne, whose team is involved in an ongoing scientific debate with the team led by Linda K. Rutledge, describes the difference between these two evolutionary models: \\"In a way, it is all semantics. They call it a species, we call it an ecotype.\\" =Archaeological evidence= Some of the earliest Canis lupus specimen were discovered at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska, in strata dated 810,000 years old. The dental measurements of the specimens clearly match historical Canis lupus lycaon specimens from Minnesota. =Genetic evidence= Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. In 1991, a study of the mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) sequences of wolves and coyotes from across North America found that the wolves of the Minnesota, Ontario and Quebec regions possessed coyote genotypes. The study proposes that dispersing male gray wolves were mating with coyote females in deforested areas bordering wolf territory. The distribution of coyote genotypes within wolves matched the phenotypic differences between these wolves found in an earlier study, with the larger Great Lakes wolf found in Minnesota, the smaller Algonquin (Provincial Park) type found in central Ontario, and the smallest and more coyote-like tweed wolf or eastern coyote type occupying sections of southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec. left In 2000, a study looked at red wolves and eastern wolves from both eastern Canada and Minnesota. The study agreed that these two wolves readily hybridize with the coyote. The study used 8 microsatellites (genetic markers taken from across the genome of a specimen). The phylogenetic tree produced from the genetic sequences showed a close relationship among the red wolves and the eastern wolves from Algonquin Park, southern Quebec, and Minnesota such that they all clustered together. These then clustered next closer with the coyote and away from the gray wolf. A further analysis using mDNA sequences indicated the presence of coyote in both of these two wolves, and that these two wolves had diverged from the coyote 150,000‚Äì300,000 years ago. No gray wolf sequences were detected in the samples. The study proposed that these findings are inconsistent with the two wolves being subspecies of the gray wolf, that red wolves and eastern wolves (eastern Canadian and Minnesota) evolved in North America after having diverged from the coyote, and therefore they are more likely to hybridize with coyotes. In 2009, a study of eastern Canadian wolves - which was referred to as the \\"guzhzcGreat Lakes\\" wolf in this study - using microsatellites, mDNA, and the paternally-inherited yDNA markers found that the eastern Canadian wolf was a unique ecotype of the gray wolf that had undergone recent hybridization with other gray wolves and coyotes. It could find no evidence to support the findings of the earlier 2000 study regarding the eastern Canadian wolf. The study did not include the red wolf. This study was quickly rebutted on the grounds that it had misinterpreted the findings of earlier studies that it relied upon, nor did it provide a definition for a number of the terms that it used, such as \\"ecotype\\". In 2011, a study compared the genetic sequences of 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) taken from the genomes of canids from around the world. The comparison indicated that the red wolf was about 76% coyote and 24% gray wolf with hybridization having occurred 287‚Äì430 years ago. The eastern wolf ‚Äì which was referred to as the \\"Great Lakes\\" wolf in this study ‚Äì was 58% gray wolf and 42% coyote with hybridization having occurred 546‚Äì963 years ago. The study rejected the theory of a common ancestry for the red and eastern wolves. However the next year, a study reviewed a subset of the 2011 study's Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and proposed that its methodology had skewed the results and that the eastern wolf is not a hybrid but a separate species. The 2012 study proposed that there are 3 true canis species in North America - the gray wolf, the western coyote, and red wolf/eastern wolf with the eastern wolf represented by the Algonquin wolf, with the Great Lakes wolf being a hydrid of the eastern wolf and the gray wolf, and the eastern coyote being a hybrid of the western coyote and the eastern (Algonquin) wolf. Also in 2011, a scientific literature review was undertaken to help assess the taxonomy of North American wolves. One of the findings proposed was that the eastern wolf, whose range includes eastern Canada and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan plus Wisconsin and Minnesota is supported as a separate species by morphological and genetic data. Genetic data supports a close relationship between the eastern and red wolves, but not close enough to support these as one species. It was \\"likely\\" that these were the separate descendants of a common ancestor shared with coyotes. This review was published in 2012. Another study of both mDNA and yDNA in wolves and coyotes by the same authors indicates that the eastern wolf is genetically divergent from the gray wolf and is a North American evolved species with a long-standing history. The study could not dismiss the possibility of the eastern wolf having evolved from an ancient hybridization of gray wolf and coyote in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene. Another study by the same authors found that eastern wolf mDNA genetic diversity had been lost after their culling in the early 1960s, leading to the invasion of coyotes into their territory and introgression of coyote mDNA. In 2014, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was invited by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide an independent review of its proposed rule relating to gray wolves. The Center's panel findings were that the proposed rule was heavily dependent upon the analysis contained in a scientific literature review conducted in 2011 (Chambers et al.), that this work was not universally accepted and that the issue was \\"not settled\\", and that the rule does not represent the \\"best available science\\". Also in 2014, an experiment to hybridize a captive western gray wolf and a captive western coyote was successful, and therefore possible. The study did not assess the likelihood of such hybridization in the wild. In 2015, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada changed its designation of the eastern wolf from Canis lupus lycaon to Canis cf. lycaon (Canis species believed to be lycaon) and a species at risk. Later that year, a study compared the DNA sequences using 127,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) of wolves and coyotes, but did not include red wolves and used Algonquin wolves as the representative eastern wolf, not wolves from the western Great Lakes states (usually referred to as Great Lakes wolves). The study indicated that Algonquin wolves were a distinct genomic cluster, even distinct from the Great Lakes states' wolves, which it found were actually hybrids of the gray wolf and the Algonquin wolf. The study's results did not exclude a possibility that the Great Lakes states' wolf (the gray wolf x eastern wolf hybrid (C. l. lycaon)) historically inhabited southern Ontario, southern Quebec and the northeastern United States alongside the Algonquin wolf, as there is evidence to suggest both inhabited those areas. In 2016, a study of mDNA once again indicated the Eastern wolf as a coyote‚Äìwolf hybrid. In 2018, a study looked at the y-chromosome male lineage of canines. The unexpected finding was that the one Great Lakes wolf specimen included in this study showed a high degree of genetic divergence. Previous studies propose the Great Lakes wolf to be an ancient ecotype of the gray wolf that had experienced genetic introgression from other types of gray wolves and coyotes. The study called for further research into the Y-chromosomes of coyotes and wolves to ascertain if this is where this unique genetic male lineage may have originated from. =Genomic evidence= In 2016, a whole-genome DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000‚Äì117,000 years ago, including the coyote diverging from Eurasian wolf about 51,000 years ago (which matches other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time), the red wolf diverging from the coyote between 55,000‚Äì117,000 years ago, and the eastern wolf (Great Lakes region and Algonquin) wolf diverging from the coyote 27,000-32,000 years ago, and asserts that these do not qualify as an ancient divergences that justify them being considered unique species. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly admixed with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. The study found that coyote ancestry was highest in red wolves from the southeast of the United States and lowest among the Great Lakes wolves. The study also determined how unique each type of canids alleles were compared to Eurasian wolves, all of which had no coyote ancestry. It found the following proportion of unique alleles: coyotes 5.13% unique; red wolf 4.41%; Algonquin wolves 3.82%; Great Lakes wolves 3.61%; and gray wolves 3.3%. They asserted that the amount of unique alleles in all wolves was lower than expected and does not support an ancient (greater than 250,000 years) unique ancestry for any of the species. The authors contended that the proportion of unique alleles and ratio of wolf / coyote ancestry findings matched the south to north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization since the 18th century and the resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the southeast, and as the wolf population declined wolf‚Äìcoyote admixture increased. Later, this process occurred in the Great Lakes region and then eastern Canada with the influx of coyotes replacing wolves, followed by the expansion of coyotes and their hybrids. The Great Lakes and Algonquin wolves largely reflect lineages that have descendants in the modern wolf and coyote populations, but also reflect a distinct gray wolf ecotype which may have descendants in the modern wolf populations. The proposed timing of the wolf/coyote divergence conflicts with the finding of a coyote-like specimen in strata dated to 1 million years before present. In 2017 a group of canid researchers challenged the 2016 whole-genome DNA study's finding that the red wolf and the eastern wolf were the result of recent coyote‚Äìgray wolf hybridization. The group asserts the three-year generation time used to calculate the divergence periods between different species was lower than empirical estimates of 4.7 years. The group also found deficiencies in the previous study's selection of specimens (two representative coyotes were from areas where recent coyote and gray wolf mixing with eastern wolves is known to have occurred), the lack of certainty in the ancestry of the selected Algonquin wolves, and the grouping of Great Lakes and Algonquin wolves together as eastern wolves, despite opposing genetic evidence. As well, they asserted the 2016 study ignored the fact that there is no evidence of hybridization between coyotes and gray wolves. The group also questioned the conclusions of genetic differentiation analysis in the study stating that results showing Great Lakes, Algonquin and red wolves, plus eastern coyotes differentiated from gray and Eurasian wolves were actually more consistent with an ancient hybridization or a distinct cladogenic origin for the red and Algonquin wolves than of a recent hybrid origin. The group further asserted that the levels of unique alleles for red and Algonquin wolves found the 2017 study were high enough to reveal a high degree of evolutionary distinctness. Therefore, the group argues that both the red wolf and the eastern wolf remain genetically distinct North American taxa. This was rebutted by the authors of the earlier study. =Wolf genome= Genetic studies relating to wolves or dogs have inferred phylogenetic relationships based on the only reference genome available: that of the dog breed called the Boxer. In 2017, the first reference genome of the wolf Canis lupus lupus was mapped to aid future research. In 2018, a study looked at the genomic structure and admixture of North American wolves, wolf-like canids, and coyotes using specimens from across their entire range that mapped the largest dataset of nuclear genome sequences and compared these against the wolf reference genome. The study supports the findings of previous studies that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing. A polar wolf from Greenland and a coyote from Mexico represented the purest specimens. The coyotes from Alaska, California, Alabama, and Quebec show almost no wolf ancestry. Coyotes from Missouri, Illinois, and Florida exhibit 5‚Äì10% wolf ancestry. There was 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry in red wolves, 60%:40% in eastern wolves, and 75%:25% in the Great Lakes wolves. There was 10% coyote ancestry in Mexican wolves, 5% in Pacific Coast and Yellowstone wolves, and less than 3% in Canadian archipelago wolves. The study indicates that the genomic ancestry of red, eastern and Great Lakes wolves were the result of admixture between modern gray wolves and modern coyotes. This was then followed by development into local populations. Individuals within each group showed consistent levels of coyote to wolf inheritance, indicating that this was the result of relatively ancient admixture. The eastern wolf as found in Algonquin Provincial Park is genetically closely related to the Great Lakes wolf as found in Minnesota and Isle Royale National Park in Michigan. If a third canid had been involved in the admixture of the North American wolf-like canids, then its genetic signature would have been found in coyotes and wolves, which it has not. Later in 2018, a study based on a much smaller sample of 65,000 SNPs found that although the eastern wolf carries regional gray wolf and coyote alleles (gene variants), it also exhibits some alleles that are unique and therefore worthy of conservation. Physical description and behavior Charles Darwin was told that there were two types of wolf living in the Catskill Mountains, one being a lightly-built, greyhound-like animal that pursued deer, and the other being a bulkier, shorter-legged wolf. The eastern wolf's fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown coloration, mixed with cinnamon. The flanks and chest are rufous or creamy, while the nape, shoulder and tail region are a mix of black and gray. Unlike gray wolves, eastern wolves rarely produce melanistic individuals. The first documented all-black eastern wolf was found to have been an eastern wolf‚Äìgray wolf hybrid. Like the red wolf, the eastern wolf is intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, with females weighing on average and males . Like the gray wolf, its average lifespan is 3‚Äì4 years, with a maximum of 15 years. Their physical sizes that sets them intermediate between gray wolves and coyotes are actually believed to be more related to their adaptations to an environment with predominately medium-sized prey similar to the case with the Mexican wolves in the southern US rather than their close relationship to red wolves and coyotes. The eastern wolf primarily targets small to medium-sized prey items like white-tailed deer and beaver, unlike the gray wolf which can effectively hunt large ungulates like caribou, elk, moose and bison. Despite being carnivores, packs in Voyageurs National Park forage for blueberries in much of July and August, when the berries are in season. Packs carefully avoid each other; only lone wolves sometimes enter other packs' territories. The average territory ranges between 110‚Äì185 km¬≤, and the earliest age of dispersal for young eastern wolves is 15 weeks, much earlier than gray wolves. Distribution The past range of the eastern wolf included southern Quebec, most of Ontario, the Great Lakes states and New England. Today, the Great Lakes wolf is generally found in the northern halves of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southeastern Manitoba and northern Ontario and the Algonquin wolf inhabits central Ontario as well as southwestern Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River.http://cossaroagency.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Accessible_COSSARO- evaluation-Algonquin-Wolf.pdf Algonquin wolves are particularly concentrated in Algonquin Provincial Park and other nearby protected areas, such as Killarney, Kawartha Highlands and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Parks and recent surveys also reveal small numbers of Algonquin wolves in the southern areas of northeastern Ontario and northwestern Ontario as far west as the Lake of the Woods near the border with Manitoba, where there is some mixing with Great Lakes wolves, and into southcentral Ontario, where there is some mixing with eastern coyotes. There are some reports of eastern wolf sightings and of wolves being shot by hunters in Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, New Brunswick, New York State, northern Vermont and Maine.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wolf-shot-in-new-brunswick- was-wild-tests-confirm-1.1300495 History, hybridization and conservation Adirondacks (1859) Mitochondrial DNA indicates that before the arrival of Europeans, eastern wolves may have numbered at 64,500‚Äì90,200 individuals. In 1942 it was believed that, before European settlement, this wolf had ranged throughout the wooded and open areas of eastern North America from what is now southern Quebec westward to the Great Plains and towards the Southeastern Woodlands, although the southward extent was uncertain but was believed to be somewhere around the area now called Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina.Glover, A. (1942), Extinct and vanishing mammals of the western hemisphere, with the marine species of all the oceans, American Committee for International Wild Life Protection, pp. 210‚Äì217. The region's indigenous human populations did not fear eastern wolves, though they did occasionally catch them in traps, and their bones occur in native shell heaps. Early European settlers often kept their livestock on eastern wolf-free outer islands, though animals kept in pasture on the mainland were vulnerable, to the point that a campaign against eastern wolves was launched in the early years of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, in which both settlers and natives participated. A bounty system was put into effect, offering higher rewards for adult wolves, with their heads exposed on hooks in meetinghouses. Nevertheless, wolves were still plentiful enough in New England in the early 18th century to warrant the settlers of Cape Cod discussing the building of a high fence between Sandwich and Wareham to keep them out of grazing lands. The scheme failed, though the settlers continued to utilize wolf pits, a wolf trapping technique learned from the region's indigenous peoples. Eastern wolf numbers declined noticeably shortly before and after the American Revolution, particularly in Connecticut, where the wolf bounty was repealed in 1774. Eastern wolf numbers, however, were still high enough to cause concern in the more sparsely populated areas of southern New Hampshire and Maine, with wolf hunting becoming a regular occupation among settlers and natives alike. By the early 19th century, few eastern wolves remained in southern New Hampshire and Vermont. Prior to the establishment of Algonquin Provincial Park in 1893, the eastern wolf was common in central Ontario and the Algonquin Highlands. It continued to persist throughout the late 1800s, despite extensive logging and efforts by park rangers to eliminate it, largely due to the sustaining influence of plentiful prey items like deer and beaver. By the mid-1900s, there were as many as 55 eastern wolf packs in the park, with an average of 49 wolves being killed annually between 1909‚Äì1958, until they were given official protection by the Ontario government in 1959, by which time the eastern wolf population in and around the park had been reduced to 500‚Äì1,000 individuals.Algonquin Wolf Advisory Group (2000). The Wolves of Algonquin Provincial Park: A Report to the Minister of Natural Resources, Algonquin Wolf Advisory Group, Ontario Nevertheless, between 1964‚Äì1965, 36% of the park's wolf population was culled by researchers trying to understand the reproduction and age structure of the population. This cull coincided with the expansion of coyotes into the park, and lead to an increase in eastern wolf‚Äìcoyote hybridization. Introgression of gray wolf genes into the eastern wolf population also occurred across northern and eastern Ontario, into Manitoba and Quebec, as well as into the western Great Lakes states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Despite protection within the park boundaries, there was a population decline in the east side of the park between 1987‚Äì1999, with an estimated number of 30 packs by 2000. This decline exceeded annual recruitment, and was attributed to human-caused mortality, which mostly occurred when dispersing animals left the park in search of deer during the winter months, and when pack ranges overlapped with park boundaries. By 2001, protection was extended to eastern wolves occurring in the outskirts of the park. By 2012, the genetic composition of the park's eastern wolves was roughly restored to what it was in the mid-1960s than in the 1980s-1990s, when the majority of wolves had large amounts of coyote DNA. In 2013, an experiment which produced hybrids of coyotes and northwestern gray wolves in captivity using artificial insemination contributed more information to the controversy surrounding the eastern wolf's taxonomy. The purpose of this project was to determine whether the female western coyotes are capable of bearing hybrid western gray wolf-coyote pups, as well as to test the hybrid theory surrounding the origin of the eastern wolves. The resulting six hybrids produced in this captive artificial breeding were later transferred to the Wildlife Science Center of Forest Lake in Minnesota, where their behaviors were studied. Relationships with humans In Algonquin folklore The wolf is prominently portrayed in Algonquin mythology, where it is referred to as ma-hei-gan or nah-poo-tee in the Algonquian languages. It is the spirit brother of the Algonquian folk hero Nanabozho, and assisted him in several of his adventures, including thwarting the plots of the malicious anamakqui spirits and assisting him in recreating the world after a worldwide flood.Young, E. R. (1903). Algonquin Indian Tales, New York : Eaton & Mains; Cincinnati, Jennings & Pye. Howling Since the discovery in 1963 that eastern wolves answered human imitations of their howls, Algonquin Provincial Park began its Public Wolf Howls attraction, where as many as 2,500 visitors are led on expeditions into areas where eastern wolves were sighted the night before and listen to them answering the park staff's imitation howls. By 2000, 85 Public Wolf Howls had been held, with over 110,000 people having participated. The park considers the attraction as the cornerstone of its wolf education program and credits it with changing public attitudes towards wolves in Ontario. Attacks on humans Since the early 1970s, there have been several incidents of bold or aggressive behavior towards humans in Algonquin Provincial Park. Between 1987 and 1996, there were four instances of wolves biting people. The most serious case occurred in 1998 when a male wolf that had been long noted to be unafraid of humans stalked a couple walking their four-year-old daughter in September that year, losing interest when the family took refuge in a trailer. Two days later, the wolf attacked a 19-month-old boy, causing several puncture wounds on his chest and back before being driven off by campers. After the animal was killed later that day, it was found to be non-rabid.McNay, Mark E. (2002). A Case History of Wolf‚ÄìHuman Encounters in Alaska and Canada.

Tactics are usually contrasted with strategy, in which advantages take longer to be realized, and the opponent is less constrained in responding. The fundamental building blocks of tactics are move sequences in which the opponent is unable to respond to all threats, so the first player realizes an advantage. This includes forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks, undermining, overloading, deflection, pins, and interference.Edward R. Brace, Illustrated Dictionary of Chess (Fodor's Travel Publications, 1978) The Encyclopedia of Chess Middlegames gives the following tactics categories: Double Attack, Pawns Breakthrough, Blockade, Decoying, Discovered Attack, Passed Pawn, X-ray Attack, Interception, Deflection, Pin, Demolition of Pawns, Overloading, Annihilation of Defense, Pursuit (perpetual attack), Intermediate Move, and Space Clearance. Often tactics of more than one type are conjoined in a combination. Attacking and defending pieces A piece is said to attack (or threaten) an opponent's piece if, in the next move, it could capture that piece. A piece is said to defend (or protect) a piece of the defender's color if, in case the defended piece were taken by the opponent, the defender could immediately recapture. Attacking a piece usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked piece is undefended, or if the attacking piece is of lower value than the one attacked. When the piece attacked is a king, then a player has exactly three options: *capture the attacking piece; *move the king to a free square; *interpose another piece in between the two (if the attacker is not a knight and is not directly adjacent to the king attacked). When the piece attacked is not a king, a player has more options: *capture the attacking piece; *move the attacked piece to a free or covered square; *move the attacked piece to a different attacked square, so you can choose where the capturing happens; *interpose another piece in between the two (if the attacker is not a knight and is not directly adjacent to the piece attacked - attacking kings and pawns are adjacent always); *cover the attacked piece, permitting an exchange of equal, greater, or lower value; *pin the attacking piece so the capture becomes illegal, unprofitable, or less damaging; *capture a different piece of the opponent; *allow the piece attacked to be captured, a sacrifice, for some other tactical advantage; or for Tempo *employ a zwischenzug (create a counter-threat of equal, greater, or lesser consequence). Gaining material When a player is able to capture the opponent's piece(s) without losing any of their own (or losing a piece of lesser value), the player is said to have \\"won \\"; i.e., the opponent will have fewer (or less valuable) pieces remaining on the board. The goal of each basic tactic is to win material. At the professional level, often the mere threat of material loss (i.e., an anticipated tactic) induces the opponent to pursue an alternative line. In amateur games, however, tactics often come to full fruition ‚Äì unforeseen by the opponent and resulting in material gain and a corresponding, perhaps decisive, advantage. Material gain can be achieved by several different types of tactics. Discovered attack A discovered attack is a move which allows an attack by another piece. A piece is moved away so as to allow the attack of a friendly bishop, rook or queen on an enemy piece. If the attacked piece is the king, the situation is referred to as a discovered check. Discovered attacks are powerful since the moved piece may be able to pose a second threat. A special case of a discovered check is a double check, where both the piece being unmasked and the piece being moved attack the enemy king. A double check always forces the opponent to move the king, since it is impossible to defend attacks from two directions in any other way. Fork A fork is a move that uses one piece to attack two or more of the opponent's pieces simultaneously, with the aim to achieve material advantage, since the opponent can counter only one of the threats.\\"Chess Strategy Online: Forks\\" Knights are often used for forks, with their unique moving and jumping ability. A common situation is a knight played to c2 or c7, threatening both the enemy rook and king. Such forks checking a king are particularly effective, because the opponent is forced by the rules of chess to immediately remove the check to his king. The opponent cannot choose to defend the other piece, or use a zwischenzug to complicate the situation. Pawns can also be effective in forking. By moving a pawn forward, it can attack two pieces‚Äîone diagonally to the left, and another diagonally to the right. The queen is also an excellent forking piece, since she can move in eight different directions. However, a queen fork is only useful if both pieces are undefended, or if one is undefended and the other is the enemy's king. The queen is the most valuable attacking piece, so it is usually not profitable for her to capture a defended piece. Fork attacks can be either relative (meaning the attacked pieces comprise pawn[s], knight[s], bishop[s], rook[s], or queen[s]), or absolute (one of the attacked pieces is the enemy king, in check). The targets of a fork do not have to be pieces, although this is known as a double attack. One or more of the targets can be a mate threat (for example, forking a loose knight and setting up a battery of queen and bishop that creates a mate threat as well) or implied threat (for example, a knight move that forks a loose bishop and also threatens to fork enemy queen and rook). Pin A pin is a move that inhibits an opponent piece from moving, because doing so would expose a more valuable (or vulnerable) piece behind it. Only bishops, rooks, and queens can perform a pin, since they can move more than one square in a straight line. If the pinned piece cannot move because doing so would produce check, the pin is called absolute. If moving the pinned piece would expose a non-king piece, the pin is called relative. Skewer A skewer is a move which attacks two pieces in a line, similar to a pin, except that the enemy piece of greater value is in front of the piece of lesser value. After the more valuable piece moves away, the lesser piece can be captured. Like pins, only queens, rooks, and bishops can perform the skewer, and skewer attacks can be either absolute (the more valuable piece in front is the king, in check) or relative (the piece in front is a non-king piece). Example of an absolute skewer attack Pawns Pawns are the least valuable chess piece, so are often used to capture defended pieces. A single pawn typically forces a more powerful piece, such as a rook or a knight, to retreat. The ability to fork two enemy pieces by advancing a pawn is often a threat. Or a simple pawn move can reveal a discovered attack. When pawns are arranged on a diagonal, with each pawn guarded by the pawn behind it, they form a wall or ' protecting any friendly pieces behind them. A weak pawn structure, with unprotected or isolated pawns ahead of more valuable pieces, can be a decisive weakness. A pawn that has advanced all the way to the opposite side of the board is promoted to any other piece except a king. Sacrifices A sacrifice of some material is often necessary to throw the opponent's position out of balance, potentially gaining positional advantage. The sacrificed material is sometimes later offset with a consequent material gain. Pawn sacrifices in the opening are known as gambits; they are usually not intended for material gain, but rather to achieve a more active position. Direct attacks against the enemy king are often started by sacrifices. A common example is sacrificing a bishop on h2 or h7, checking the king, who usually must take the bishop. This allows the queen and knight to develop a fulminant attack. Zugzwang Zugzwang (German for the \\"compulsion to move\\") occurs when a player is forced to make an undesirable move. The player is put at a disadvantage because he would prefer to pass and make no move, but a move has to be made, all of which weaken his position. Situations involving zugzwang occur uncommonly, but when they do occur, it is almost always in the endgame, where there are fewer choices of available moves. Zwischenzug Zwischenzug (German for \\"intermediate move\\") is a common tactic in which a player under threat, instead of directly countering, introduces an even more devastating threat. The tactic often involves a new attack against the opponent's queen or king. The opponent then may be forced to address the new threat, abandoning the earlier attack. The concept of a zwischenzug is often listed as a tactic, but might properly be called a counter-tactic instead. The effect of a zwischenzug is to change the status quo before a tactic can come to fruition. The near ubiquity of the zwischenzug makes long combinations all the more rare and impressive.

He is best known for his discovery of conductive polymers. He was co-recipient of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with Alan MacDiarmid and Alan Heeger.  Early life and education  Shirakawa with Yoshir≈ç Mori (at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on October 18, 2000) Hideki Shirakawa was born in Tokyo, Japan, in the family of a military doctor. He lived in Manchukuo and Taiwan during childhood. Around third grade, he moved to Takayama, Gifu, which is the hometown of his mother. Shirakawa graduated from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1961, and his doctorate in 1966. Afterward, he obtained the post of assistant in Chemical Resources Laboratory at Tokyo Tech.  Career  Emperor Akihito conferred the Order of Culture on Shirakawa (at the Imperial Palace on November 3, 2000) While employed as an assistant at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) in Japan, Shirakawa developed polyacetylene, which has a metallic appearance. This result interested Alan MacDiarmid when MacDiarmid visited Tokyo Tech in 1975. In 1976, he was invited to work in the laboratory of Alan MacDiarmid as a post- doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. The two developed the electrical conductivity of polyacetylene along with American physicist Alan Heeger. In 1977 they discovered that doping with iodine vapor could enhance the conductivity of polyacetylene. The three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 in recognition of the discovery. With regard to the mechanism of electric conduction, it is strongly believed that nonlinear excitations in the form of solitons play a role. In 1979, Shirakawa became an assistant professor in the University of Tsukuba; three years later, he advanced to a full professor. In 1991 he was appointed as Tsukuba's Chief of Science and Engineering Department of Graduate School (until March, 1993), and as Tsukuba's Chief of Category #3 group (until March, 1997).  The Nobel Prize  Shirakawa awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with UPenn's physics professor Alan J. Heeger and chemistry professor Alan G. MacDiarmid, \\"for the discovery and development of conductive polymers\\".The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000 He also became the first non-National Seven Universities graduate of Japanese Nobel laureates, and second Japanese chemistry Nobel laureates. Over the years, Shirakawa has been expressed that he doesn't want the Nobel Prizes to receive too much special treatment from mass media (especially the Japanese media). He hopes that many vital areas in fields outside the Nobel Prize categories will also become more widely known.Shirakawa unhappy with way Japanese media reports Nobel issues  The Japan Times  Recognition  *1983 ‚Äì The Award of the Society of Polymer Science, Japan *2000 ‚Äì SPSJ Award for Outstanding Achievement in Polymer Science and Technology *2000 ‚Äì Nobel Prize in Chemistry *2000 ‚Äì Order of Culture and selected as Person of Cultural Merit *2000 ‚Äì Professor Emeritus of the University of Tsukuba *2001 ‚Äì Special Award of the Chemical Society of Japan *2001 ‚Äì Member of the Japan Academy‰ºöÂì°ÂÄã‰∫∫ÊÉÖÂ†±  Êó•Êú¨Â≠¶Â£´Èô¢ *2006 ‚Äì Professor Emeritus of the Zhejiang Universityhttp://www.zju.edu.cn/englishold/2006/1020/c11993a531485/pagem.psp  Relatives  One of his relatives, Hitomi Yoshizawa, is a member of the singing group Morning Musume Morning Girls.

An annihilation operator (usually denoted \\\\hat{a}) lowers the number of particles in a given state by one. A creation operator (usually denoted \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger) increases the number of particles in a given state by one, and it is the adjoint of the annihilation operator. In many subfields of physics and chemistry, the use of these operators instead of wavefunctions is known as second quantization. Creation and annihilation operators can act on states of various types of particles. For example, in quantum chemistry and many-body theory the creation and annihilation operators often act on electron states. They can also refer specifically to the ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator. In the latter case, the raising operator is interpreted as a creation operator, adding a quantum of energy to the oscillator system (similarly for the lowering operator). They can be used to represent phonons. The mathematics for the creation and annihilation operators for bosons is the same as for the ladder operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For example, the commutator of the creation and annihilation operators that are associated with the same boson state equals one, while all other commutators vanish. However, for fermions the mathematics is different, involving anticommutators instead of commutators. Ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator In the context of the quantum harmonic oscillator, one reinterprets the ladder operators as creation and annihilation operators, adding or subtracting fixed quanta of energy to the oscillator system. Creation/annihilation operators are different for bosons (integer spin) and fermions (half-integer spin). This is because their wavefunctions have different symmetry properties. First consider the simpler bosonic case of the photons of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Start with the Schr√∂dinger equation for the one-dimensional time independent quantum harmonic oscillator, :\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\omega^2 x^2\\\\right) \\\\psi(x) = E \\\\psi(x). Make a coordinate substitution to nondimensionalize the differential equation :x \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m \\\\omega}} q. The Schr√∂dinger equation for the oscillator becomes : \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{2} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d^2}{d q^2} + q^2 \\\\right) \\\\psi(q) = E \\\\psi(q). Note that the quantity \\\\hbar \\\\omega = h u is the same energy as that found for light quanta and that the parenthesis in the Hamiltonian can be written as : -\\\\frac{d^2}{dq^2} + q^2 = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d}{dq}+q \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dq}+ q \\\\right) + \\\\frac {d}{dq}q - q \\\\frac {d}{dq} . The last two terms can be simplified by considering their effect on an arbitrary differentiable function f(q), :\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dq} q- q \\\\frac{d}{dq} \\\\right)f(q) = \\\\frac{d}{dq}(q f(q)) - q \\\\frac{df(q)}{dq} = f(q) which implies, :\\\\frac{d}{dq} q- q \\\\frac{d}{dq} = 1 , coinciding with the usual canonical commutation relation -i[q,p]=1 , in position space representation: p:=-i\\\\frac{d}{dq}. Therefore, : -\\\\frac{d^2}{dq^2} + q^2 = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d}{dq}+q \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dq}+ q \\\\right) + 1 and the Schr√∂dinger equation for the oscillator becomes, with substitution of the above and rearrangement of the factor of 1/2, : \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d}{dq}+q \\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dq}+ q \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right] \\\\psi(q) = E \\\\psi(q). If one defines :a^\\\\dagger \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d}{dq} + q\\\\right) as the \\"creation operator\\" or the \\"raising operator\\" and : a \\\\ \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left(\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{d}{dq} + q\\\\right) as the \\"annihilation operator\\" or the \\"lowering operator\\", the Schr√∂dinger equation for the oscillator reduces to : \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left( a^\\\\dagger a + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\psi(q) = E \\\\psi(q). This is significantly simpler than the original form. Further simplifications of this equation enable one to derive all the properties listed above thus far. Letting p = - i \\\\frac{d}{dq}, where p is the nondimensionalized momentum operator one has : [q, p] = i \\\\, and :a = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(q + i p) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left( q + \\\\frac{d}{dq}\\\\right) :a^\\\\dagger = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(q - i p) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left( q - \\\\frac{d}{dq}\\\\right). Note that these imply : [a, a^\\\\dagger ] = \\\\frac{1}{2} [ q + ip , q-i p] = \\\\frac{1}{2} ([q,-ip] + [ip, q]) = \\\\frac{-i}{2} ([q, p] + [q, p]) = 1. The operators a\\\\, and a^\\\\dagger\\\\, may be contrasted to normal operators, which commute with their adjoints.A normal operator has a representation , where are self-adjoint and commute, i.e. BC=CB. By contrast, has the representation a=q+ip where p,q are self-adjoint but [p,q]=1. Then and have a common set of eigenfunctions (and are simultaneously diagonalizable), whereas and famously don't and aren't. Using the commutation relations given above, the Hamiltonian operator can be expressed as :\\\\hat H = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left( a \\\\, a^\\\\dagger - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left( a^\\\\dagger \\\\, a + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right).\\\\qquad\\\\qquad(*) One may compute the commutation relations between the a\\\\, and a^\\\\dagger\\\\, operators and the Hamiltonian: :[\\\\hat H, a ] = [\\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left ( a a^\\\\dagger - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right ) ,a] = \\\\hbar \\\\omega [ a a^\\\\dagger, a] = \\\\hbar \\\\omega ( a [a^\\\\dagger,a] + [a,a] a^\\\\dagger) = -\\\\hbar \\\\omega a. :[\\\\hat H, a^\\\\dagger ] = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\, a^\\\\dagger . These relations can be used to easily find all the energy eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator as follows. Assuming that \\\\psi_n is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \\\\hat H \\\\psi_n = E_n\\\\, \\\\psi_n. Using these commutation relations, it follows that :\\\\hat H\\\\, a\\\\psi_n = (E_n - \\\\hbar \\\\omega)\\\\, a\\\\psi_n . :\\\\hat H\\\\, a^\\\\dagger\\\\psi_n = (E_n + \\\\hbar \\\\omega)\\\\, a^\\\\dagger\\\\psi_n . This shows that a\\\\psi_n and a^\\\\dagger\\\\psi_n are also eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, with eigenvalues E_n - \\\\hbar \\\\omega and E_n + \\\\hbar \\\\omega respectively. This identifies the operators a and a^\\\\dagger as \\"lowering\\" and \\"raising\\" operators between adjacent eigenstates. The energy difference between adjacent eigenstates is \\\\Delta E = \\\\hbar \\\\omega. The ground state can be found by assuming that the lowering operator possesses a nontrivial kernel: a\\\\, \\\\psi_0 = 0 with \\\\psi_0 e0. Applying the Hamiltonian to the ground state, :\\\\hat H\\\\psi_0 = \\\\hbar\\\\omega\\\\left(a^\\\\dagger a+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)\\\\psi_0 = \\\\hbar\\\\omega a^\\\\dagger a \\\\psi_0 + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{2}\\\\psi_0=0+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{2}\\\\psi_0=E_0\\\\psi_0. So \\\\psi_0 is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. This gives the ground state energy E_0 = \\\\hbar \\\\omega /2, which allows one to identify the energy eigenvalue of any eigenstate \\\\psi_n as :E_n = \\\\left(n + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)\\\\hbar \\\\omega. Furthermore, it turns out that the first-mentioned operator in (*), the number operator N=a^\\\\dagger a\\\\,, plays the most important role in applications, while the second one, a a^\\\\dagger \\\\, can simply be replaced by N+1. Consequently, : \\\\hbar\\\\omega \\\\,\\\\left(N+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\psi (q) =E\\\\,\\\\psi (q)~. The time- evolution operator is then :U(t)=\\\\exp ( -it \\\\hat{H}/\\\\hbar) = \\\\exp (-it\\\\omega (a^\\\\dagger a+1/2)) ~, := e^{-it \\\\omega /2} ~ \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} {(e^{-i\\\\omega t}-1)^k \\\\over k!} a^{{\\\\dagger} {k}} a^k ~.  Explicit eigenfunctions  The ground state \\\\ \\\\psi_0(q) of the quantum harmonic oscillator can be found by imposing the condition that : a \\\\ \\\\psi_0(q) = 0. Written out as a differential equation, the wavefunction satisfies :q \\\\psi_0 + \\\\frac{d\\\\psi_0}{dq} = 0 with the solution :\\\\psi_0(q) = C \\\\exp\\\\left(-{q^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right). The normalization constant is found to be 1/ \\\\sqrt[4]{\\\\pi} from \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi_0^* \\\\psi_0 \\\\,dq = 1, using the Gaussian integral. Explicit formulas for all the eigenfunctions can now be found by repeated application of a^\\\\dagger to \\\\psi_0.This, and further operator formalism, can be found in Glimm and Jaffe, Quantum Physics, pp. 12‚Äì20.  Matrix representation  The matrix expression of the creation and annihilation operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator with respect to the above orthonormal basis is : a^\\\\dagger =\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 &\\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt{3} & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\sqrt{n} &\\\\dots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots &\\\\ddots \\\\end{pmatrix} : a =\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt{3} & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\sqrt{n} & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\ddots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{pmatrix} These can be obtained via the relationships a^\\\\dagger_{ij} = \\\\langle\\\\psi_i \\\\mid a^\\\\dagger \\\\mid \\\\psi_j\\\\rangle and a_{ij} = \\\\langle\\\\psi_i \\\\mid a \\\\mid \\\\psi_j\\\\rangle. The eigenvectors \\\\psi_i are those of the quantum harmonic oscillator, and are sometimes called the \\"number basis\\".  Generalized creation and annihilation operators  The operators derived above are actually a specific instance of a more generalized notion of creation and annihilation operators. The more abstract form of the operators are constructed as follows. Let H be a one-particle Hilbert space (that is, any Hilbert space, viewed as representing the state of a single particle). The (bosonic) CCR algebra over H is the algebra-with-conjugation-operator (called *) abstractly generated by elements a(f), where f\\\\,ranges freely over H, subject to the relations :[a(f),a(g)]=[a^\\\\dagger(f),a^\\\\dagger(g)]=0 :[a(f),a^\\\\dagger(g)]=\\\\langle f\\\\mid g \\\\rangle, in bra‚Äìket notation. The map a: f \\\\to a(f) from H to the bosonic CCR algebra is required to be complex antilinear (this adds more relations). Its adjoint is a^\\\\dagger(f), and the map f\\\\to a^\\\\dagger(f) is complex linear in . Thus H embeds as a complex vector subspace of its own CCR algebra. In a representation of this algebra, the element a(f) will be realized as an annihilation operator, and a^\\\\dagger(f) as a creation operator. In general, the CCR algebra is infinite dimensional. If we take a Banach space completion, it becomes a C* algebra. The CCR algebra over H is closely related to, but not identical to, a Weyl algebra. For fermions, the (fermionic) CAR algebra over H is constructed similarly, but using anticommutator relations instead, namely :\\\\\\\\{a(f),a(g)\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{a^\\\\dagger(f),a^\\\\dagger(g)\\\\\\\\}=0 :\\\\\\\\{a(f),a^\\\\dagger(g)\\\\\\\\}=\\\\langle f\\\\mid g \\\\rangle. The CAR algebra is finite dimensional only if H is finite dimensional. If we take a Banach space completion (only necessary in the infinite dimensional case), it becomes a C^* algebra. The CAR algebra is closely related to, but not identical to, a Clifford algebra. Physically speaking, a(f) removes (i.e. annihilates) a particle in the state f\\\\rangle whereas a^\\\\dagger(f) creates a particle in the state f\\\\rangle. The free field vacuum state is the state with no particles, characterized by :a(f) \\\\left 0\\\\right\\\\rangle=0. If f\\\\rangle is normalized so that \\\\langle ff\\\\rangle = 1, then N=a^\\\\dagger(f)a(f) gives the number of particles in the state f\\\\rangle.  Creation and annihilation operators for reaction-diffusion equations  The annihilation and creation operator description has also been useful to analyze classical reaction diffusion equations, such as the situation when a gas of molecules A diffuse and interact on contact, forming an inert product: A+A\\\\to \\\\empty. To see how this kind of reaction can be described by the annihilation and creation operator formalism, consider n_{i} particles at a site on a one dimensional lattice. Each particle moves to the right or left with a certain probability, and each pair of particles at the same site annihilates each other with a certain other probability. The probability that one particle leaves the site during the short time period ' is proportional to n_i \\\\, dt, let us say a probability \\\\alpha n_{i}dt to hop left and \\\\alpha n_i \\\\, dt to hop right. All n_i particles will stay put with a probability 1-2\\\\alpha n_i \\\\, dt. (Since ' is so short, the probability that two or more will leave during ' is very small and will be ignored.) We can now describe the occupation of particles on the lattice as a \`ket' of the form \\\\dots, n_{-1}, n_0, n_1, \\\\dots\\\\rangle. It represents the juxtaposition (or conjunction, or tensor product) of the number states \\\\dots, n_{-1}\\\\rangle n_{0}\\\\rangle, n_{1}\\\\rangle, \\\\dots located at the individual sites of the lattice. Recall :a\\\\mid\\\\\\\\! n\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\ n-1\\\\rangle a^\\\\daggerand : a^\\\\dagger \\\\mid\\\\\\\\! n\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\mid\\\\\\\\! n+1\\\\rangle, for all ‚â• 0, while :[a,a^{\\\\dagger}]=1 This definition of the operators will now be changed to accommodate the \\"non-quantum\\" nature of this problem and we shall use the following definition: a\\\\mid\\\\\\\\! n\\\\rangle = n \\\\ n-1\\\\rangle a^\\\\dagger \\\\mid\\\\\\\\! n\\\\rangle=\\\\ \\\\mid n+1\\\\rangle note that even though the behavior of the operators on the kets has been modified, these operators still obey the commutation relation [a,a^{\\\\dagger}]=1 Now define a_i so that it applies a to n_i\\\\rangle. Correspondingly, define a^\\\\dagger_i as applying a^\\\\dagger to n_i\\\\rangle. Thus, for example, the net effect of a_{i-1} a^\\\\dagger_i is to move a particle from the (i-1)^{\\\\text{th}} to the i^{\\\\text{th}}site while multiplying with the appropriate factor. This allows writing the pure diffusive behavior of the particles as :\\\\partial_{t}\\\\mid\\\\\\\\! \\\\psi\\\\rangle=-\\\\alpha\\\\sum(2a_i^\\\\dagger a_i-a_{i-1}^\\\\dagger a_i-a_{i+1}^\\\\dagger a_i)\\\\mid\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi\\\\rangle=-\\\\alpha\\\\sum(a_i^\\\\dagger-a_{i-1}^\\\\dagger)(a_i-a_{i-1}) \\\\mid\\\\\\\\! \\\\psi\\\\rangle, where the sum is over i. The reaction term can be deduced by noting that n particles can interact in n(n-1) different ways, so that the probability that a pair annihilates is \\\\lambda n(n-1)dt, yielding a term :\\\\lambda\\\\sum(a_i a_i-a_i^\\\\dagger a_i^\\\\dagger a_i a_i) where number state n is replaced by number state n ‚àí 2 at site i at a certain rate. Thus the state evolves by :\\\\partial_t\\\\mid\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi\\\\rangle=-\\\\alpha\\\\sum(a_i^\\\\dagger- a_{i-1}^\\\\dagger)(a_i-a_{i-1}) \\\\mid\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi\\\\rangle+\\\\lambda\\\\sum(a_i^2-a_i^{\\\\dagger 2}a_i^2)\\\\mid\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi\\\\rangle Other kinds of interactions can be included in a similar manner. This kind of notation allows the use of quantum field theoretic techniques to be used in the analysis of reaction diffusion systems. Creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theories In quantum field theories and many-body problems one works with creation and annihilation operators of quantum states, a^\\\\dagger_i and a^{\\\\,}_i. These operators change the eigenvalues of the number operator, : N = \\\\sum_i n_i = \\\\sum_i a^\\\\dagger_i a^{\\\\,}_i, by one, in analogy to the harmonic oscillator. The indices (such as i) represent quantum numbers that label the single-particle states of the system; hence, they are not necessarily single numbers. For example, a tuple of quantum numbers (n, l, m, s) is used to label states in the hydrogen atom. The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators in a multiple-boson system are, : [a^{\\\\,}_i, a^\\\\dagger_j] \\\\equiv a^{\\\\,}_i a^\\\\dagger_j - a^\\\\dagger_ja^{\\\\,}_i = \\\\delta_{i j}, : [a^\\\\dagger_i, a^\\\\dagger_j] = [a^{\\\\,}_i, a^{\\\\,}_j] = 0, where [\\\\ \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ ] is the commutator and \\\\delta_{i j} is the Kronecker delta. For fermions, the commutator is replaced by the anticommutator \\\\\\\\{\\\\ \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\\\}, : \\\\\\\\{a^{\\\\,}_i, a^\\\\dagger_j\\\\\\\\} \\\\equiv a^{\\\\,}_i a^\\\\dagger_j +a^\\\\dagger_j a^{\\\\,}_i = \\\\delta_{i j}, : \\\\\\\\{a^\\\\dagger_i, a^\\\\dagger_j\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{a^{\\\\,}_i, a^{\\\\,}_j\\\\\\\\} = 0. Therefore, exchanging disjoint (i.e. i e j) operators in a product of creation or annihilation operators will reverse the sign in fermion systems, but not in boson systems. If the states labelled by i are an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space H, then the result of this construction coincides with the CCR algebra and CAR algebra construction in the previous section but one. If they represent \\"eigenvectors\\" corresponding to the continuous spectrum of some operator, as for unbound particles in QFT, then the interpretation is more subtle. Normalization While Zee obtains the momentum space normalization [\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf p},\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf q}^\\\\dagger] = \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{p} - \\\\mathbf{q}) via the symmetric convention for Fourier transforms, Tong and Peskin & Schroeder use the common asymmetric convention to obtain [\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf p},\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf q}^\\\\dagger] = (2\\\\pi)^3\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{p} - \\\\mathbf{q}). Each derives [\\\\hat \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf x), \\\\hat \\\\pi(\\\\mathbf x')] = i\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf x'). Srednicki additionally merges the Lorentz- invariant measure into his asymmetric Fourier measure, \\\\tilde{dk}=\\\\frac{d^3k}{(2\\\\pi)^3 2\\\\omega}, yielding [\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf k},\\\\hat a_{\\\\mathbf k'}^\\\\dagger] = (2\\\\pi)^3 2\\\\omega\\\\,\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{k} - \\\\mathbf{k}').

After Stalin's death in 1953, Tito had to choose between a more western approach to reforms or an agreement with new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Tito tried to reconcile with the Soviet Union, inviting Khrushchev to Belgrade in 1955. This meeting resulted in the Belgrade declaration ending the Informbiro, granting other socialist countries the right to interpret Marxism in a different way, and ensured equal relationships amongst all satellite states and the Soviet Union. But the limits of this agreement became evident after the Soviet intervened in Hungary in October 1956; this was followed by a new Soviet campaign against Tito, which held the Yugoslavian government responsible for the Hungarian insurrection.

He took the seat previously occupied by Constantin P√Ærvulescu on the Politburo,TismƒÉneanu, p.207 and then replaced Chivu Stoica as Prime Minister of Romania in 1961.TismƒÉneanu, p.207, 299 In the latter capacity, he was the recipient of a 1963 letter by the British philosopher and activist Bertrand Russell, who pleaded with the Romanian authorities to free from jail Belu Zilber (a victim of the conflict between the Party leadership and PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Zilber had been a political prisoner for sixteen years by then).Griffin, p.572 Ion Gheorghe Maurer was also one of three acting Chairmen of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly (heads of state) between March 19 and March 24, 1965. Alongside Emil BodnƒÉra»ô, Maurer was an important member of the Politburo in opposing the ambitions of Gheorghe Apostol and, together with BodnƒÉra»ô, helping along the establishment of the Nicolae Ceau»ôescu regime.FrunzƒÉ, p.463-464, 475-478; TismƒÉneanu, p.213, 221-222, 299, 323, 344 Among others, Maurer helped silence potential opposition from inside the Party by withdrawing his support for Corneliu MƒÉnescu and welcoming Ceau»ôescu's directives, before being himself criticized and sidelined (at the same time as his collaborator Alexandru B√¢rlƒÉdeanu).Deletant, Ceausescu..., p.69-70; FrunzƒÉ, p.479-480, 483, 510-511; TismƒÉneanu, p.37, 299 Pensioned in 1974, he was still present in the forefront at most Party ceremonies.TismƒÉneanu, p.239 A prominent member of the nomenklatura for much of his life, he was known for his latent conflict with a large part of the PCR hierarchy. He accumulated a sizable wealth and was known for his ostentatious lifestyle. In 1989, Maurer's earlier support for Ceau»ôescu led the sidelined PCR members who were planning to state their opposition to the regime by drafting the so-called Letter of the Six (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru B√¢rlƒÉdeanu, Silviu Brucan, Constantin P√Ærvulescu, and Grigore RƒÉceanu) not to enlist his assistance in the process.TismƒÉneanu, p.299, 343 He died in Bucharest a decade after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, leaving a son, Jean. He was 97. From 13 July 1998, when former Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Kollias died until his own death, Maurer was the world's oldest living former head of state.

In less than a year after its formation, Kalmah was signed by Spinefarm Records. The word \\"kalmah\\" is Karelian and could be translated as \\"to the grave\\" or \\"to the death\\". History Kalmah at Party.San 2017 In 1991, Pekka Kokko and Petri Sankala founded the metal band Ancestor. After Ancestor had recorded two demos, Antti Kokko joined the band as lead guitarist. In 1998, after five demos, Ancestor disbanded and Kalmah formed. The new band consisted of Pekka Kokko performing vocals and guitar, Antti Kokko on lead guitar, Pasi Hiltula on keyboards, Altti Vetel√§inen on bass, and Petri Sankala on drums. Kalmah began to write songs for a promotional CD entitled Svieri Obraza. With this demo, they acquired a recording contract with Spinefarm Records and headed to Tico-Tico Studios to record their debut album, Swamplord which was released in 2000. By November 2001, they returned to Tico-Tico Studios to record their second studio album, They Will Return. By this time, Vetel√§inen and Sankala were replaced by Timo Lehtinen on bass and Janne Kusmin on drums, respectively. In 2002, Kalmah played shows in Finland and at Wacken Open Air. In February 2003, they recorded their third studio album, Swampsong. In 2004, keyboardist Pasi Hiltula left and was replaced by Marco Sneck. The band released The Black Waltz in 2006 and For the Revolution in 2008. Kalmah toured in Canada and Finland to promote the latter album. 12 Gauge Kalmah's sixth studio album was released in Japan on 24 February 2010, Canada on 2 March, Europe on 3 March and North America on 6 April. Recording and mixing took place from May to August at Tico-Tico Studios in Finland, and mastering for the disc took place at the Cutting Room in Sweden. The track \\"Bullets Are Blind\\" was released in December 2009 on a 2-CD collection included with the 35th anniversary issue of Soundi magazine. In March 2010, 12 Gauge became the first Kalmah album to be released on vinyl. The album was mastered for vinyl by Joona Lukala, Noise for Fiction, and released by Svart Records in a limited run of 500 copies. Seventh Swamphony In 2012, Kalmah finished filming a new music video for their upcoming album, due to be released in 2013. The band have kept fans up to date with their process via social networking website Facebook by uploading different photos, as well as a short behind the scenes video from the day of filming their video. They also announced that they currently have 6 songs finished, and they plan to enter the studio in January 2013. The artwork for their seventh studio album will be created by artist Juha Vuorma, the man also behind the art of Kalmah's first 3 albums. In April 2013, it was announced that the band will release their seventh studio album, Seventh Swamphony, on 17 June. Palo Kalmah's eighth album, Palo, was released on April 6, 2018. A single from the album, \\"Evil Kin\\" was released on February 9, 2018.  Musical style  The band's musical style is primarily classified as melodic death metal with their sound including strong influences of power metal, thrash metal and black metal. Musically, the band has been compared to fellow Finnish metal acts Children of Bodom, Norther and Wintersun.

Early years Li was born in Liling, Hunan province in China in 1899, under the name of Li Rongzhi. His father, a teacher, taught Li Chinese traditional poems and classics. In 1915, he arrived at Changsha for high school and saw an advertisement in a newspaper written by a student from First Normal School of Changsha with the pen name 28 Strokes. Li met, and then became friends with, the young man whose real name was Mao Zedong. Later, Li joined the army of a local warlord in Hunan. One of the Division Commanders, Cheng Qian, who was both Li's father's townsman and alumni, sponsored Li to study in Beijing. Beginning career France When Li reached Beijing, he applied to study in France and arrived there in 1920. He worked part-time as assistant to a boilermaker to earn his tuition. His boss was a member of Communist Party, and Li was influenced in accepting communism, taking part actively in the struggles for Chinese labor rights in France. For his active and fearless revolutionary work, Li was labelled as a trouble-maker. In 1921, Li was expelled with more than 100 other Chinese by the French authorities. Back in China When Li returned to Shanghai, he was introduced by Chen Duxiu to join the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party assigned him to organize the labor activities in Anyuan Coal Mine. Being the most important labor work leader there, Li greatly increased the number of CPC members and perfected methods of organization. By the end of 1924, there were only 900 CCP members throughout China, 300 of whom came from Anyuan Coal Mine. It was at this time that Li showed his great talent in labor work and organization in conjunction with Liu Shaoqi, who later became his deputy.Elizabeth J. Perry, \\"Anyuan: Mining China‚Äôs Revolutionary Tradition,\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal 11.1 (January 14, 2013 2013). Certainly the Nationalists had a high opinion of Li's organisational skills; a secret report prepared during their rural pacification campaign in 1928 explained why they were having particular difficulties in Anyuan: > The reason the Communist Party has such a deeply rooted and firm foundation > at Anyuan is because in the past the Communists carried out comprehensive > 'red education' at Anyuan.

Retrieved on 2009-2-11. In 1926, Li came to Wuhan, the labor work center of China to lead the labor work. Although Xiang Zhongfa, who later became general secretary of the CCP, was the top leader at that time, Li was the man who actually made the decisions. In 1927, after the split of the alliance of Kuomintang with the CPC, Li was the first one to propose the Nanchang Uprising against the KMT, and took the job as director of the security guards. Though this uprising was proved to be imprudent and planless, and its failure unavoidable, Li was thrust into the central stage of the CCP for his prominence in labor work and his courage under fire. Reign of Xiang In the 6th National Congress of CPC held in Moscow, Li's old friend Xiang Zhongfa was elected as General Secretary with the support from the Comintern and the Soviet Union. During the reign of Xiang, Li Lisan played a gradually more important role. Xiang sacked Cai Hesen, the incumbent standing member of Politburo of the CCP and Minister of Propaganda Department of the CCP for Cai's extremist way in directing the Sunzi Division of CCP, which resulted in extreme democracy and discontent at the CCP center. Xiang chose Li to replace Cai. Li became one of only four standing members of the politburo and minister of Propaganda Department of the CCP in October 1928. When the Far East Bureau of the Comintern issued an order for anti-rightism and blamed the CCP for not being active enough in 1929, Xiang protested this decision. He knew Li was an appropriate candidate for doing the communication work because of his eloquence and energy. Thus, Li took the job of handling conflicts with the Comintern. When Xiang sent Zhou Enlai to Moscow for further instruction, Li took on Zhou‚Äôs work in organization too, which gave Li a large enough stage to prove his talent. Decline When Xiang learned of the Comintern‚Äôs decision on anti-rightism, he claimed that the Chinese revolution was in its peak period. Li turned this blindness into extremism, which was later known as Li Lisan line, calling for armed uprising in the cities and the extension of the revolution to the whole country. From June 1930, Li Lisan line became mature under the support from Xiang. The CCP gave the daily operation from its headquarters to divisions in all provinces, setting up action committees in all provinces and preparing for the full-scale uprising in October. But the Comintern expressed its discontent, stating that it was working out systemic policies for the Chinese revolution, and the CCP should concentrate on the uprising in one or several provinces instead. Xiang supported Li and stood by his idea that it was the zero hour of the Chinese revolution. In several rounds of discussion, the tension between Xiang, Li and the Comintern rose greatly. Suspicion and criticism of the CCP towards the Comintern was the same as betrayal in the eyes of the Comintern. In July 1930, the communist army under the leadership of Li Lisan captured Changsha in Hunan province, but KMT troops defeated his forces just a few days later. The uprisings in other cities were put down by KMT forces quickly. Furthermore, Li had turned many CCP members into his enemies by his authoritarian style. Some of these were old CCP members such as labor activists He Mengxiong and Luo Zhanglong who were blamed for their rightism only because they were against Li's extremism. Wang Ming and his group of 28 Bolsheviks came back from Moscow, designated to take the leadership of the CCP by their mentors in Moscow, but they only received a cold shoulder from Li. Doom With so many opponents both inside and outside the CCP, Li's doom was sealed. The Comintern sent Qu Qiubai and Zhou Enlai back to China to enforce its policy. And the 28 Bolsheviks took advantage of this opportunity to denounce Li. Xiang, and Li still did not realize the clear danger he was in and criticized these young immature students severely. Then Comintern sent a telegram to call Li to Moscow for repentance. Pavel Mif, president of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University and mentor of the 28 Bolsheviks, went to Shanghai as an envoy of the Comintern also. Under Mif‚Äôs direction, the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of the CPC was held. Li was replaced by Mif‚Äôs prot√©g√©, Wang Ming, and his associates in the 28 Bolsheviks took other important jobs. Punishment Li went to Moscow for his confession and repentance. But he did not know it would be such a long time of redemption. In the next 15 years, Li suffered from rounds of reprimand, criticism, and purge. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union even refused to accept Li as a CCP member for several years. Moreover, when Wang Ming and Kang Sheng came back to Moscow as representatives of the CCP to the Comintern, they persecuted Li by every means available. The only comfort was that in the Soviet Union Li met and later married Lisa Kishkin, a Soviet typesetter, who would later migrate to China with Li. Aftermath But Li's old friend Mao did not forget about him. Li was elected as member of the Central Committee of CCP in the 7th National Congress of the CCP held in Yan'an. In 1946, Li was sent back to China. Li first came to northeast China to work for the local division of the CCP as Minister of the City Work Department. At the outbreak of Chinese Civil War, Li was appointed as chief representative of the CCP part of the military arbitration panel consisting of members from KMT and the United States. People's Republic of China ceremony of the proclamation of the People's republic of China After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Li went back to the field in which he was most expert, being appointed as Minister of Labor to lead the labor union. Li was dedicated to his old cause and brought forth some guidance on democratic management measures in industry, which was later called by Mao as the Constitution of Anshan Steel Mill. At the same time Li Lisan was one of the founders of the CPPCC mechanism. During the years of the Korean War, he was appointed as the secretary general of Anti Air Defence Council ranking as vice-premier, due to his anti-air attack practice during the WWII during his stay at Moscow. Li remained an advocate of independence for the trade unions, which brought him into conflict with Mao. He was the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions until 1958 and the first president of China Institute of Industrial Relations.\\"ÊùéÁ´ã‰∏âÊ®™Ê≠ª‰πãË∞úÔºö‰∏ªÂº†Â∑•‰ºöÁã¨Á´ã Ë¢´ÊØõÊ≥Ω‰∏úÊâπÂà§ (The enigma of the violent death of Li Lisan: an advocate of trade union independence; criticised by Mao Zedong)\\" , An article at the bulletin board of Yanhuang Chunqiu magazine. Retrieved on 2008-12-30. Consequences of China- Soviet split But with the Chinese-Soviet Union split in the 1960s, Li's life turned tougher and tougher again. Although his wife, Lisa Kishkin (Elizabetha Pavlovna Kishkina; ; ), handed in her Russian passport and took Chinese nationality to show her loyalty to her husband and his country, there still was no way to ease the situation. Especially when the Cultural Revolution came, Kang Sheng spared no effort in denouncing his old rival. Li was labeled an agent of the Soviet Union and was tortured both mentally and physically by the Red Guards. His wife and daughters were also imprisoned. Supposedly unable to face this humiliation any more, Li was said by his tormentors to have committed suicide by taking sleeping pills after finishing a final letter to Mao. Li's biographer, Patrick Lescot, has cast doubt on the nature of Li's death. Li Sishen (), Li Lisan's personal secretary, later wrote he did not believe it possible Li Lisan could have had access to sufficient pills to kill himself. Li Sishen had been responsible for overseeing the issuing of the sleeping pills. He recalled arguing with Li Lisan, who wanted an extra pill each night as the struggle sessions were affecting his sleep. Li Lisan dismissed the notion he might kill himself as ridiculous: > > This is a joke! I've made it through all these decades of strife and > turmoil and you think I can't get through this? Are you worried I'll kill > myself? Suicide would mean betraying the Party, I know that well enough; am > I going to turn renegade against the Party? It's simply laughable. In 1980 the central Organisation Department finally allowed Li Lisan's family to read his autopsy report; this listed his height incorrectly by 15 cm and contained other errors which added to the family's doubts over the accepted version of Li's death.

MPRC, the custodian of military service records, lost approximately 16‚Äì18 million official military personnel records as a result of the fire. Background The National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) was created in 1956 as the result of a series of mergers of predecessor agencies beginning after World War II, including the Demobilized Personnel Records Center (DPRC) and the Military Personnel Records Center (MILPERCEN, pronounced \\"mil'-per- cen\\") of the Department of Defense, along with the St. Louis Federal Records Center of the General Services Administration. In final form, the NPRC handled the service records of persons in Federal civil service or American military service, overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration of the General Services Administration. In 1951 the Department of Defense retained the Detroit firm of Hellmuth, Yamasaki, and Leinweber, architects, to design a new facility for its Demobilized Personnel Records Center. The firm visited several similar operations, including a U.S. Navy records center at Garden City, New York, and a Department of Defense facility in Alexandria, Virginia. They studied the functions of each facility and the nature of the storage systems employed. Their report, submitted in February 1952, detailed different approaches used to achieve the respective centers' missions. Particularly relevant in light of future events were the findings with regard to fire prevention, detection, and suppression systems. The Naval records center in Garden City, New York, for example, was outfitted with a full fire sprinkler system, while the Department of Defense facility in Alexandria, Virginia, was not. This reflected an ongoing debate at the time among archivists and librarians about the relative merits of sprinkler systems. Some felt that there was a greater chance for water damage from the activation of one or more sprinkler heads, whether in a fire or accidentally, than for fire damage without sprinklers to suppress it, while others were of the opposite opinion. The architects proceeded with the selected plan for a six-story structure set on a site, with each floor measuring and encompassing for a total of . The building was constructed of prestressed concrete floors and roof supported by concrete interior columns and surrounded by a curtain wall of aluminum and glass. Construction was completed in 1956 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of $12.5 million, $ in today's dollars, an economical $10.15 per square foot ($109.25 per square meter). On each of the floors were large spaces for records storage stretching hundreds of feet and containing no firewalls or other firestopping to limit the spread of fire. Along the north side of each floor were offices, separated from the records storage area by a concrete block wall. The entire facility lacked heat or smoke detectors to detect fire automatically or a fire sprinkler system to extinguish fire automatically. When the facility opened in 1956, it housed some 38 million military personnel records. By the time of the 1973 fire, their ranks had swelled to over 52 million records. Additionally, of military unit records were added to the collection of the center. The staff of the center as of 1973 consisted of more than 2,200 personnel, including GSA management and staff as well as military and civilian personnel from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, the Army Reserve, the FBI, and others. Fire At 12:16:15 AM on July 12, 1973, the Olivette Fire Department reported to its dispatcher that the NPRC building was on fire. At 12:16:35, 20 seconds later, a building security guard picked up the fire phone and relayed the report of a passing motorcyclist who also observed the fire. By 12:17:25, the first fire trucks were dispatched: three pumpers and two other emergency vehicles from the Community Fire Protection, arriving at 12:20:35. Forty-two fire districts eventually contributed to the effort to put out the fire. Ultimately, the fire burned out of control for 22 hours, being fought from the exterior of the building because heat and smoke within compelled firefighters to withdraw at 3:15 AM. Insufficient water pressure plagued efforts and a pumper broke down mechanically in its 40th continuous hour of operation. Crews entered the building again on July 14 while the fire continued to smolder for another two days. The fire was declared out on the morning of July 16, but crews continued using spray to suppress rekindling until the end of the month. Cause The exact cause of the fire was not fully determined. An investigation in 1975 suggested embers of cigarettes present in several trash cans as a possible cause, and at least one local newspaper reported that an employee had started the fire by smoking in the records area (a report largely assumed to be false). Deliberate arson was ruled out as a cause almost immediately by investigators, as interviews of some personnel who had been in the building just twenty minutes before the first fire alarm reported nothing out of the ordinary. In 1974, investigators of the General Services Administration stated that an electrical short was most likely the cause of the fire but that, owing to the near-total destruction of the sixth floor, where the fire had occurred, a specific investigation into the electrical systems was impossible. Affected records The losses to Federal military records collection included: *80% loss to records of U.S. Army personnel discharged November 1, 1912, to January 1, 1960; *75% loss to records of U.S. Air Force personnel discharged September 25, 1947, to January 1, 1964, with names alphabetically after Hubbard, James E.; *Some U.S. Army Reserve personnel who performed their initial active duty for training in the late 1950s but who received final discharge as late as 1964. None of the records that were destroyed in the fire had duplicate copies made, nor had they been copied to microfilm. No index of these records was made prior to the fire, and millions of records were on loan to the Veterans Administration at the time of the fire. This made it difficult to precisely determine which records were lost. Navy and Marine Corps records On the morning of the National Archives Fire, a very small number of U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps records were out of their normal file area, being worked on as active requests by employees of the National Archives and Records Administration who maintained their offices on the 6th floor of the building. When the NPRC fire began, these Navy and Marine Corps records were caught in the section of the building which experienced the most damage in the fire. The exact number of Navy and Marine Corps records destroyed in the fire is unknown, since such records were being removed only for a few days while information was retrieved from them and were not normally stored in the area of the building that experienced the fire. Estimates indicate that the number of affected records was no more than two to three dozen. Such records are considered \\"special cases,\\" and no accounting could be made of which records were affected, so the present policy of NPRC is to state that there were no Navy and Marine Corps records destroyed in the fire and to treat these records as records that had been lost in ordinary circumstances. The destroyed sixth floor of the NPRC also housed a security vault that contained high-profile and notable records of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Known as the \\"Sixth Floor Vault,\\" confirmed destroyed records included the Navy file of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou as well as the record of Adolf Hitler's nephew William Patrick Hitler. The sixth-floor security vault also held all the records of current NPRC employees who had their own Navy and Marine Corps records retired at the agency. Damage and reconstruction The 1973 fire destroyed the entire sixth floor of the National Personnel Records Center and greatly affected the fifth floor with water damage. As part of the reconstruction, the entire sixth floor was removed owing to the extensive damage, resulting in the current structure's now consisting of five floors. The rehabilitated building has firewalls to divide the large, open records storage areas. Smoke detection and sprinkler systems have also been added to prevent a repetition of the 1973 fire.

It was dedicated in August 1968 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Japanese immigrants to Hawaii. The temple is a replica of a 900-year-old Buddhist temple at Uji in Kyoto Prefecture of Japan. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a functioning Buddhist temple in the proper sense as it does not host a resident monastic community nor an active congregation. Inside the Byodo-In Temple is a statue of the Lotus Buddha, a wooden image depicting AmitƒÅbha. It is covered in gold and lacquer. Outside is a three-ton, brass peace bell. Surrounding the temple are large koi ponds that cover a total of . Around those ponds are lush Japanese gardens set against a backdrop of towering cliffs of the Ko ªolau Range. The gardens are home to sparrows and peafowl. The temple covers . The Byodo-In Temple is visited and used by thousands of worshipers from around the world. It welcomes people of all faiths to participate in its traditions. Apart from worship, the temple grounds are also used for weddings and office meetings. Ancient Japan Byodo-In Temple is a smaller-scale replica of the By≈çd≈ç-in, a World Heritage site near the ancient city of Kyoto, originally a monastery founded by Fujiwara no Yorimichi in 1052 of the Heian period. It was famous for its Vairocana statue. The statue was lost and replaced in 1053 with a large wooden statue of AmitƒÅbha, a national treasure carved by the Japanese artisan J≈çch≈ç. The AmitƒÅbha statue stands in the midst of the , an artistic reproduction of Sukhavati, the pure land of AmitƒÅbha. It is called the \\"Phoenix Hall\\" in English in reference to the two fenghuang birds stretching their wings upon the temple roof. Fifty two wooden images of bodhisattvas surround AmitƒÅbha, dancing and playing musical instruments on floating clouds. From 2001 to 2007, the temple underwent restoration in the spirit of preservation of Japan's ancient heritage. Modern Hawaii Byodo-In Temple was commissioned and built largely by concrete (the original is wooden without the use of nails) in 1968 at its present location in the Valley of the Temples to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the arrival of Japanese culture to Hawaii. It was dedicated by Governor John A. Burns, a favorite of the Japanese community for his long service for the cause of Japanese rights during the state's territorial years. Japanese immigrants entered the Kingdom of Hawaii and later Territory of Hawaii to labor in the sugarcane and pineapple plantations. They joined the Chinese, Filipino, Korean, native Hawaiians and Portuguese. Byodo-In Temple previously housed the remains of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. His body was held in a mausoleum until it was moved back to the Philippines where it is now held in a refrigerated tomb, in which he was later buried in the Heroes' Cemetery in 2016. Valley of the Temples Memorial Park Chapel at Valley of the Temples, Oahu The Valley of the Temples Memorial Park, where the Byodo-in Temple is located, also contains large Catholic statues depicting the Passion of Christ, the Virgin Mary, various Catholic saints, crypts and mausoleums of some of the most influential people in Hawai ªi. Most notable of those interred at the mausoleums of the Valley of the Temples is Walter F. Dillingham, Hawaii entrepreneur and statesman. For a time, former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was interred at a private mausoleum overlooking the Byodo-In temple. Thousands of Buddhist, Shinto, Protestant and Catholic residents of Hawaii are buried in this memorial park. It was founded by Paul Trousdale in 1963. In popular culture The TV series Hawaii Five-O and Magnum, P.I. featured several episodes where the temple is incorporated into the plot. The temple and its vicinity also served as a stand-in for South Korea in one episode of the ABC series Lost and as the Presidential Villa in an episode of seaQuest DSV. The temple was also used in the 2001 movie Pearl Harbor as a replica of the Byodo- In Temple in Japan as well as several other movies.

Gorrie (October 3, 1803 ‚Äì June 29, 1855) was an American physician, scientist, inventor of mechanical cooling, and humanitarian. Early life Born on the Island of Nevis in the Leeward Islands of the West Indies to Scottish parents on October 3, 1803, he spent his childhood in South Carolina. He received his medical education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District of New York in Fairfield, New York. In 1833, he moved to Apalachicola, Florida, a port city on the Gulf coast. As well as being resident physician at two hospitals, Gorrie was active in the community. At various times he served as a council member, Postmaster, President of the Bank of Pensacola's Apalachicola Branch, Secretary of the Masonic Lodge, and was one of the founding vestrymen of Trinity Episcopal Church. Gorrie Monument in Apalachicola, Florida. Dr. Gorrie's medical research involved the study of tropical diseases. At the time the theory that bad air ‚Äî mal-aria ‚Äî caused diseases was a prevalent hypothesis and based on this theory, he urged draining the swamps and the cooling of sickrooms. For this he cooled rooms with ice in a basin suspended from the ceiling. Cool air, being heavier, flowed down across the patient and through an opening near the floor.  Experiments with artificial cooling  Since it was necessary to transport ice by boat from the northern lakes, Gorrie experimented with making artificial ice. After 1845, Gorrie gave up his medical practice to pursue refrigeration products. On May 6, 1851, Gorrie was granted Patent No. 8080 for a machine to make ice. The original model of this machine and the scientific articles he wrote are at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1835, patents for \\"Apparatus and means for producing ice and in cooling fluids\\" had been granted in England and Scotland to American-born inventor Jacob Perkins, who became known as \\"the father of the refrigerator\\". Impoverished, Gorrie sought to raise money to manufacture his machine, but the venture failed when his partner died. Humiliated by criticism, financially ruined, and his health broken, Gorrie died in seclusion on June 29, 1855. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery. Another version of Gorrie's \\"cooling system\\" was used when President James A. Garfield was dying in 1881. Naval engineers built a box filled with cloths that had been soaked in melted ice water. Then by allowing hot air to blow on the cloths it decreased the room temperature by 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The problem with this method was essentially the same problem Gorrie had. It required an enormous amount of ice to keep the room cooled continuously. Yet it was an important event in the history of air conditioning. It proved that Dr. Gorrie had the right idea, but was unable to capitalize on it.Gorrie's fridge, ufl.edu; accessed December 20, 2015. The first practical refrigeration system in 1854, patented in 1855, was built by James Harrison in Geelong, Australia.

History The database attempts to capture very basic biographical and office-holding data for its political figures. Besides where they are buried, it records dates and locations of birth and death, offices held and the applicable dates, organizational affiliations, and cause of death. It also reports their relation (at least by blood and marriage) with other politicians listed, their political party, and limited military history. The names are sorted and indexed by surname, birthplace, positions held, demography, religion, occupation, cause of death, and final resting place, with each entry usually having fewer than five lines of text. The name comes from the website's inclusion of the burial locations of the deceased, when known. The site was created in 1996 by Lawrence Kestenbaum, then an academic specialist at Michigan State University, and later on staff at the University of Michigan. Kestenbaum was formerly a county commissioner, and in 2004 was elected to be County Clerk/Register of Deeds of Washtenaw County, Michigan. The site and its underlying database were developed from a personal interest triggered by the Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, which was its original data source. Since then his personal research, and the information contributions of hundreds of volunteers have greatly expanded the information available. It is licensed under the \\"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0\\" Creative Commons License. Over the years the definition of \\"eligible political figure\\" has been expanded. It now includes most high federal officials, ambassadors, all elected and some appointed statewide officeholders, and many mayors. It lists unsuccessful candidates, presidential electors, and delegates to U.S. presidential nominating conventions of the major political parties. Politicians are listed alphabetically, by office held or sought, and by location of birth, residence, and death. Some are listed in categories, including occupations, ethnicity, religious and organizational affiliation, honors and awards. Politicians accused of crimes or touched by scandal are listed by the nature of the accusation, as well as by decade and by state. Cause of death is broken down into dozens of categories. The site also lists political families. Individuals listed on the site are linked together if their relationship meets the Rule of 1/1000 common ancestry. Each cluster of three or more linked politicians is treated as a family, with family name and location assigned by an algorithm; the largest individual family cluster is the Kennedys, with 34 members. The site's largest cluster, with 2,134 members, is called \\"Two Thousand Related Politicians\\"; most of the larger families are subsets of this group, with each subset defined and named by an algorithm. The largest subset family is the Huntington-Chapin-Waterman family of Connecticut, with 229 members.

Prasad joined the Indian National Congress during the Indian Independence Movement and became a major leader from the region of Bihar. A supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, Prasad was imprisoned by British authorities during the Salt Satyagraha of 1931 and the Quit India movement of 1942. After the 1946 elections, Prasad served as Minister of Food and Agriculture in the central government. Upon independence in 1947, Prasad was elected as President of the Constituent Assembly of India, which prepared the Constitution of India and served as its provisional parliament. When India became a republic in 1950, Prasad was elected its first president by the Constituent Assembly. As president, Prasad established a tradition of non-partisanship and independence for the office-bearer, and retired from Congress party politics. Although a ceremonial head of state, Prasad encouraged the development of education in India and advised the Nehru government on several occasions. In 1957, Prasad was re-elected to the presidency, becoming the only president to serve two full terms.President's Secretariat National Informatics Centre Prasad stayed in office for the longest term of around 12 years. Post the completion of his tenure, he quit the Congress and set up new guidelines for parliamentarians which are still followed. Prasad played a major role in forming the Bihari Students Conference in 1906 and served as the president of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Constitution of India. Early life Rajendra Prasad was a landholding and rich Hindu Kayastha,born in Ziradei, in the Siwan district of Bihar. His father, Mahadev Sahai Srivastava, was a scholar of both Sanskrit and Persian languages. His mother, Kamleshwari Devi, was a devout woman who would tell stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata to her son. He was the youngest child and had one elder brother and three elder sisters. His mother died when he was a child and his elder sister then took care of him. Student life When Prasad was five years old, his parents placed him under the tutelage of a Maulavi, an accomplished Muslim scholar, to learn the Persian language, Hindi and arithmetic. After the completion of traditional elementary education, he was sent to the Chapra District School. Meanwhile, in June 1896, at an early age of 12, he was married to Rajavanshi Devi. He, along with his elder brother, Mahendra Prasad, then went to study at T.K. Ghosh's Academy in Patna for a period of two years. He secured first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta and was awarded Rs. 30 per month as a scholarship. Prasad joined the Presidency College, Calcutta in 1902, initially as a science student. He passed the F. A. under the University of Calcutta in March 1904 and then graduated with a first division from there in March 1905. Impressed by his intellect, an examiner once commented on his answer sheet that the \\"examinee is better than examiner\\". Later he decided to focus on the study of arts and did his M.A. in Economics with a first division from the University of Calcutta in December 1907. There he lived with his brother in the Eden Hindu Hostel. A devoted student as well as a public activist, he was an active member of The Dawn Society. It was due to his sense of duty towards his family and education that he refused to join Servants of India Society, as it was during that time when his mother had died as well as his sister became a widow at the age of nineteen and had to return to her parents' home. Prasad was instrumental in the formation of the Bihari Students Conference in 1906 in the hall of the Patna College. It was the first organisation of its kind in India and produced important leaders from Bihar like Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Krishna Singh who played a prominent role in the Champaran Movement and Non- cooperation Movement. The organisation provided political leadership to bihar in the upcoming years. Career As a teacher (Sitting L to R) Prasad and Anugrah Narayan Sinha during Mahatma Gandhi's 1917 Champaran Satyagraha Rajendra Prasad served in various educational institutions as a teacher. After completing his M.A in economics, he became a professor of English at the Langat Singh College of Muzaffarpur in Bihar and went on to become the principal. However, later on he left the college to undertake legal studies and entered the Ripon College, Calcutta (now the Surendranath Law College). In 1909, while pursuing his law studies in Kolkata he also worked as Professor of Economics at Calcutta City College. In 1915, Prasad appeared in the examination of Masters in Law from the Department of Law, University of Calcutta, passed the examination and won a gold medal. He completed his Doctorate in Law from Allahabad University in 1937. As a lawyer In 1916, he joined the High Court of Bihar and Odisha. In 1917, he was appointed as one of the first members of the Senate and Syndicate of the Patna University. He also practised law at Bhagalpur, the famous silk town in Bihar. Role in the Independence Movement Prasad's first association with Indian National Congress was during 1906 annual session organised in Calcutta, where he participated as a volunteer, while studying in Calcutta. Formally, he joined the Indian National Congress in the year 1911, when the annual session was again held in Calcutta. During the Lucknow Session of Indian National Congress held in 1916, he met Mahatma Gandhi. During one of the fact-finding missions at Champaran, Mahatma Gandhi asked him to come with his volunteers. He was so greatly moved by the dedication, courage and conviction of Mahatma Gandhi that as soon as the motion of Non-Cooperation was passed by Indian National Congress in 1920, he retired from his lucrative career of lawyer as well as his duties in the university to aid the movement. He also responded to the call by Gandhi to boycott Western educational establishments by asking his son, Mrityunjaya Prasad, to drop out of his studies and enrol himself in Bihar Vidyapeeth, an institution he along with his colleagues founded on the traditional Indian model.Atul Sethi, \\"Distant dads?\\" ''The Times of India'' (Aug 12 2007) .

He was elected as the President of the Indian National Congress during the Bombay session in October 1934. He again became the president when Subhash Chandra Bose resigned in 1939. On 8 August 1942, Congress passed the Quit India Resolution in Bombay which led to the arrest of many Indian leaders. Prasad was arrested in Sadaqat Ashram, Patna and sent to Bankipur Central Jail.

Prasad acted independently of politics, following the expected role of the president as required the constitution. Following the tussle over the enactment of the Hindu Code Bill, he took a more active role in state affairs. In 1962, after serving twelve years as the president, he announced his decision to retire.

Biography Marie Lorena Moore was born in Glens Falls, New York, and nicknamed \\"Lorrie\\" by her parents. She attended St. Lawrence University. At 19, she won Seventeen magazine's fiction contest. The story, \\"Raspberries,\\" was published in January 1977. After graduating from St. Lawrence, she moved to Manhattan and worked as a paralegal for two years. In 1980, Moore enrolled in Cornell University's M.F.A. program, where she was taught by Alison Lurie.Kelly, p. 2. Upon graduation from Cornell, Moore was encouraged by a teacher to contact agent Melanie Jackson. Jackson sold her collection, Self- Help, composed almost entirely of stories from her master's thesis, to Knopf in 1983. Works Short stories Her short story collections are Self- Help (1985), Like Life, the New York Times bestseller Birds of America, and Bark. She has contributed to The Paris Review. Her first story to appear in The New Yorker, \\"You're Ugly, Too,\\" was later included in The Best American Short Stories of the Century, edited by John Updike. Another story, \\"People Like That Are the Only People Here,\\" also published in The New Yorker, was reprinted in the 1998 edition of the annual collection The Best American Short Stories; the tale of a young child falling sick, the piece was loosely patterned on events in Moore's own life. The story was also included in the 2005 anthology Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules, edited by David Sedaris. Moore's Collected Stories was published by Faber in the UK in May 2008. It included all the stories in each of her previously published collections, excerpts from her novel Anagrams, and three previously uncollected stories first published in The New Yorker. Moore's latest collection Bark was published in 2014. Novels Moore's novels are Anagrams (1986), Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? (1994), and A Gate at the Stairs (2009). Who Will Run the Frog Hospital is the story of a woman vacationing with her husband who recalls an intense friendship from her adolescence. A Gate at the Stairs takes place just after the September 11 attack and is about a 20-year-old Midwestern woman's coming of age. Children's books Moore has written a children's book entitled The Forgotten Helper, about an elf whom Santa Claus mistakenly leaves behind at the home of the worst child on his \\"good\\" list. The elf must help the child be good for the coming year so Santa will return next Christmas. Essays Moore writes occasionally about books, films, and television for The New York Review of Books. A collection of her essays, criticism and comment was published by Knopf as See What Can Be Done in April 2018.

They are sailed extensively in the UK. The class was started in 1936 by the Royal Yachting Association as an alternative to the more expensive International 14s. National 12 racing The rules limit the length of the boat to 12 ft, beam to 6 ft 6 in, an all up weight to 78 kg and a sail area of 10.4 m2. National 12s are sailed on all types of water from narrow rivers to the open sea. The class holds a national championships on an annual basis ‚Äì known as Burton Week after the premier prize of the week: The Sir William Burton Cup ‚Äì at various venues around the UK coast. The National 12 is a development class where within a set of rules (and with occasional considered changes to those rules) the boats have been able to evolve over time, moving from wood and clinker construction to high-performance glass and carbon fibre-foam composite boats. One of the most noticeable changes in the boats is the steady increase in beam over the history of the class ‚Äì early examples were less than 5 ft while modern ones are usually at the maximum 6 ft 6 in to provide maximum righting moment for the crew. The Twelve has developed into a racing boat which performs well in all conditions being highly manouvreable and challenging to sail in windy weather. The History N153 Witch ‚Äì 1st Burton Cup winner at the 70th anniversary National 12s sailing at Ranelagh sailing club in the 1930s N1 \\"Gipsy\\" was designed by Uffa Fox and launched at Cowes in April 1936. The Twelve proved extremely popular and by the first championships in September of that year over 150 boats had been built. Gipsy accepted honourable retirement at the former Exeter Maritime Museum as a landmark in dinghy sailing history. Although his design, the \\"Uffa King\\", was very successful Fox himself built only two boats, Anemone N452, and Westwind N456, the latter for Bruce Banks, later to become famous as a sailmaker, in whose hands the boat was successfully campaigned for more than a decade, winning the Burton Cup both in 1939 and again in 1950. Westwind is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall From 1936 to the present day the class has continued to develop. Rule changes have been made where necessary, for example, a minimum width rule was introduced in 1937, and a maximum width in 1980. Clinker construction went out in 1970 with the development of GRP hulls and 'four plank' wooden construction. Ian Proctor started experimenting with metal masts to replace wooden spars in 1952 and Terylene sails arrived in 1954. The minimum weight was reduced to 80 kg in the 1980s. Feeling Foolish design of National 12 at Northampton 70th anniversary A further reduction in late 1990s and a recent reduction in 2000 reduced the minimum weight down to the currently 78 kg (this includes mast & centreboard), reflecting the ability of even amateur builders to build lightweight hulls. Today most new boats are built using carbon fibre-foam sandwich construction with a self draining floor. This makes the boats very light and stiff, adding to the responsive character of the boats. Handicap and Other Racing In a mixed fleet, the National 12 competes with other boats off a Portsmouth Yardstick handicap of 1064. In mixed fleet racing in North America, it is more likely to use a D-PN of 98.0.

Born Jakob Lewin Joseph in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia, he was the third child of Rabbi Israel Joseph and his wife Sara. He was an innovator in modern plastic surgery and reconstructive surgery who developed methods for aesthetic plastic surgery, including cosmetic rhinoplasty. He noted that cosmetic surgery, while not a physical necessity, was worth the risks to a person's health because of its positive impact on their spirit, personality, and role in the world. He was a pioneer of rhinoplasty, which he developed and performed on many of Berlin's Jewish community (to which he also belonged). From 1885 to 1889, he was a student of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1892 he joined the staff of the Berlin University Clinic for Orthopaedic Surgery. In the same year he married his wife, Leonore. In 1904, Jacques Joseph published his first report on the simultaneous, intranasal correction of a hump nose with the correction of the front nasal septum. In 1916, he was appointed head of the newly founded Department of Facial Plastic Surgery at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic at the Charit√© by the Prussian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs. In 1919, he was appointed professor despite not having habilitated and was awarded the Iron Cross. In 1922, Joseph set up his own practice where he dedicated himself to work in several fields of plastic surgery. A report on Jacques Joseph was published by \\"raving reporter\\" Egon Erwin Kisch. In 1928 and 1929 the first two sections of Jacques Joseph‚Äòs book on ‚ÄòNasal plastic surgery‚Äô were published at Curt Kabitzsch Publishers, W√ºrzburg and Leipzig. In 1931 the expanded final version of his book on ‚ÄòNasal Plastic Surgery and Other Facial Reconstructive Procedures, With an Appendix on Reconstructive Breast Surgery and Some Other Procedures in the Area of External Plastic Surgery. An Atlas and Text Book.‚Äò was published. This book is called a milestone in plastic surgery. Jacques Joseph's grave On 12 February 1934, Jacques Joseph died of a heart attack in the hallway of his house in Berlin on his way to his practice. Joseph's grave, long thought to be lost, was discovered in the early 2000s in the Jewish Wei√üensee cemetery. After reconstruction of the gravestone, it was rededicated by leading members of the Jewish community of Berlin on October 17, 2004.

Outcault. Adopted as the mascot of the Brown Shoe Company in 1904, Buster Brown, his sweetheart Mary Jane, and his dog Tige, were well known to the American public in the early 20th century. The character's name was also used to describe a popular style of suit for young boys, the Buster Brown suit, that echoed his own outfit.  Origins  The character of Buster Brown was loosely based on Granville Hamilton Fisher, a son of Charles and Anna Fisher of Flushing, New York. Fisher's physical appearance, including the characteristic pageboy haircut, was copied by Outcault and given to Buster Brown. The name \\"Buster\\" came directly or indirectly from the popularity of Buster Keaton, then a child actor in vaudeville. Another boy, Roger Cushman Clark (1899-1995) of Deadwood, South Dakota, was also described as the \\"original model\\" for the Buster Brown character.\\"Topics in Chronicling America: Buster Brown\\" Newspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room, Library of Congress.\\"Original 'Buster Brown'\\" Holbrook Argus (October 29, 1904). The character of Mary Jane was also drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault's daughter of the same name. In Outcault's own words‚Äîand his daughter's‚Äîshe was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although \\"Mrs. Brown\\" did resemble Outcault's wife.  Publication history  The comic strip began in the New York Herald on May 4, 1902. Outcault left for William Randolph Hearst's employ in January 1906, and after a court battle, Outcault continued his strip, now nameless, in Hearst papers, while the Herald continued their own version of Buster Brown with other artists. The latter lasted until January 1911, and Outcault's version until May 13, 1923. The character of Buster Brown inspired many imitators, including Perry Winkle from the Winnie Winkle newspaper strip, and the Bobby Bumps animated film series. The series was translated into Portuguese and published in the Brazilian children's magazine O Tico-Tico (where Buster Brown was known as Chiquinho); its stories were loosely adapted by Brazilian writers. Characters and story Buster Brown is a young city-dwelling boy with wealthy parents. He is disturbingly pretty (contrast him to Outcault's own The Yellow Kid, or Frederick Opper's creations), but his actions belie his looks. He is a practical joker who might dress in a girl's outfit and have her wear his clothes, break a window with his slingshot, or play a prank on a neighbor. The trick or transgression is discovered and he is punished, usually by being spanked by his mother, but it is unclear if he ever repents. Many strips end with Buster delivering a self-justifying moral which has little or nothing to do with his crime. For example, a strip from May 31, 1903, shows him giving Tige a soda from a drugstore soda fountain. The drink splashes, not only the front of his own clothes, but the skirts of a woman's splendid dress. Horrified by his clumsy misadventure, Buster's mother takes him home and flogs him with a stick. In the last panel the boy has written a message beginning, \\"Resolved! That druggists are legalized robbers; they sell you soda and candy to make you ill, then they sell you medicine to make you worse.\\" Mary Jane is Buster's sweetheart. Tige is thought to be the first talking pet to appear in the comics, and, like that of many of his successors, his speech goes unnoticed by adults.  Brown Shoe Company mascot  Outcault traveled to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, selling licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Buster Brown's association with shoes began with John Bush, a sales executive with the Brown Shoe Company; he persuaded his company to purchase rights to the Buster Brown name, and the brand was introduced to the public at the 1904 World's Fair. Little people were hired by the Brown Shoe Co. to play Buster in tours around the United States. These actors, each accompanied by a dog, performed in department stores, theaters and shoe stores from 1904 until 1930. Richard Barker played Buster Brown in many of these Brown Shoe Company advertising campaigns; his story is told in a biography called Buster Brown and the Cowboy. In the 1940s and '50s The Brown Shoe Company made a foray into the comic book publishing industry with Buster Brown Comics, on which a retailer could rubber-stamp their address. The comics featured the characters on the cover, but contained different adventure features, such as Robin Hood. The characters were revived with an updated, more contemporary look for a brief advertising campaign in the 1980s and 1990s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmC8uVhGlHQ  In other media  dwarf actor \\"Master Gabriel\\" plays the title role of Buster Brown, with George Ali as Tige, in the 1905 Broadway production.  Comic books  Buster Brown comics were given away as premiums in shoe stores from 1945 to 1959. Some contain art by Reed Crandall and other notable cartoonists. In the 1950s other comics based on the radio show were produced by Custom Comics and Dell Comics, and a coloring book was also produced.  Film  A series of live-action two-reelers were produced from 1925 to 1929 by the Stern Bros. for Universal Pictures. Buster was played by the actor Arthur Trimble. Pal the Wonder Dog (who played Tige) and director Gus Meins were both later associated with the popular Our Gang (Little Rascals) comedies, where Pal at some point came to be known as Pete the Pup, a name inherited by one of his pups, who carried on the role after Pal died of poisoning in 1930. Theater In 1905, a play was performed on Broadway at the Majestic titled Buster Brown. It starred a 21-year-old adult dwarf actor named Master Gabriel (1882‚Äì1929), born Gabriel Weigel.The kid of Coney Island: Fred Thompson and the rise of American Amusements by Woody Register c.2001 Photos of Master Gabriel in the role show him very convincing as a child. Gabriel appeared in another children's-oriented play in 1908 Little Nemo and a return engagement as Buster Brown in 1913.Buster Brown 1905 production at the Majestic Theatre, Broadway courtesy IBDb.com database It also featured famous animal actor George Ali as Tige. Radio A Buster Brown radio series began in 1943 with Smilin' Ed McConnell on the West Coast NBC Radio Network. It included such characters as Froggy the Gremlin (\\"Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!\\") and Midnight the Cat (\\"What do you say to the kids, Midnight?\\" \\"Nice.\\") Television McConnell moved the show to television in 1950, where it ran under the titles Smilin' Ed's Gang and The Buster Brown Show for four years. Andy Devine took over in 1955 after McConnell's death, but Devine's show was titled Andy's Gang. Playground games Buster Brown makes an appearance in several children's playground games. There is a skipping rope rhyme that starts \\"Buster Brown  Went to town  With his pants  On upside down.\\" There is also a game played on a seesaw where one rider will stop the seesaw with the other rider in the air and chant, \\"Buster, Buster, Buster Brown, what will you give me if I let you down?\\" The rider stuck in the air then offers an imaginary payment of grandiose proportions (e.g., \\"every Barbie doll ever\\", \\"the Moon and all the stars\\").

In geometry, the statement that the angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal is known as the pons asinorum (, ), typically translated as \\"bridge of asses\\". This statement is Proposition 5 of Book 1 in Euclid's Elements, and is also known as the isosceles triangle theorem. Its converse is also true: if two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite them are also equal. The term is also applied to the Pythagorean Theorem. The name of this statement is also used metaphorically for a problem or challenge which will separate the sure of mind from the simple, the fleet thinker from the slow, the determined from the dallier, to represent a critical test of ability or understanding. Its first known use was in 1645.Pons asinorum ‚Äî Definition and More from the Free Merriam  Proofs  { style=\\"float:right\\"  Proclus' proof } { style=\\"float:right\\"  Euclid's Elements Book 1 proposition 5; the pons asinorum } Euclid and Proclus Euclid's statement of the pons asinorum includes a second conclusion that if the equal sides of the triangle are extended below the base, then the angles between the extensions and the base are also equal. Euclid's proof involves drawing auxiliary lines to these extensions. But, as Euclid's commentator Proclus points out, Euclid never uses the second conclusion and his proof can be simplified somewhat by drawing the auxiliary lines to the sides of the triangle instead, the rest of the proof proceeding in more or less the same way. There has been much speculation and debate as to why Euclid added the second conclusion to the theorem, given that it makes the proof more complicated. One plausible explanation, given by Proclus, is that the second conclusion can be used in possible objections to the proofs of later propositions where Euclid does not cover every case.Heath pp. 251‚Äì255 The proof relies heavily on what is today called side-angle-side, the previous proposition in the Elements. Proclus' variation of Euclid's proof proceeds as follows:Following Proclus p. 53 Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Pick an arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and \\\\angle A is equal to itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and angles are equal. Therefore \\\\angle ABE = \\\\angle ACD and \\\\angle ADC = \\\\angle AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and \\\\angle DBE = \\\\angle ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore angle BDE = angle CED and angle BED = angle CDE. Since angle BDE = angle CED and angle CDE = angle BED, angle BDC = angle CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and angle BDC = angle CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, angle CBD = BCE, which was to be proved. Pappus Proclus gives a much shorter proof attributed to Pappus of Alexandria. This is not only simpler but it requires no additional construction at all. The method of proof is to apply side-angle-side to the triangle and its mirror image. More modern authors, in imitation of the method of proof given for the previous proposition have described this as picking up the triangle, turning it over and laying it down upon itself.For example F. Cuthbertson Primer of geometry (1876 Oxford) p. 7 This method is lampooned by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson in Euclid and his Modern Rivals, calling it an \\"Irish bull\\" because it apparently requires the triangle to be in two places at once.Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, Euclid and his Modern Rivals Act I Scene II ¬ß6 The proof is as follows:Following Proclus p. 54 Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Consider the triangles ABC and ACB, where ACB is considered a second triangle with vertices A, C and B corresponding respectively to A, B and C in the original triangle. \\\\angle A is equal to itself, AB=AC and AC=AB, so by side-angle-side, triangles ABC and ACB are congruent. In particular, \\\\angle B = \\\\angle C.Heath p. 254 for section Others A textbook proof A standard textbook method is to construct the bisector of the angle at A.For example J.M. Wilson Elementary geometry (1878 Oxford) p. 20 This is simpler than Euclid's proof, but Euclid does not present the construction of an angle bisector until proposition 9. So the order of presentation of the Euclid's propositions would have to be changed to avoid the possibility of circular reasoning. The proof proceeds as follows:Following Wilson As before, let the triangle be ABC with AB = AC. Construct the angle bisector of \\\\angle BAC and extend it to meet BC at X. AB = AC and AX is equal to itself. Furthermore, \\\\angle BAX = \\\\angle CAX, so, applying side-angle-side, triangle BAX and triangle CAX are congruent. It follows that the angles at B and C are equal. Legendre uses a similar construction in √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie, but taking X to be the midpoint of BC.A. M. Legendre √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie (1876 Libr. de Firmin-Didot et Cie) p. 14 The proof is similar but side-side-side must be used instead of side-angle- side, and side-side-side is not given by Euclid until later in the Elements.  In inner product spaces  The isosceles triangle theorem holds in inner product spaces over the real or complex numbers. In such spaces, it takes a form that says of vectors x, y, and z that ifJ. R. Retherford, Hilbert Space, Cambridge University Press, 1993, page 27. : x + y + z = 0\\\\text{ and }\\\\x\\\\ = \\\\y\\\\, then : \\\\x - z\\\\ = \\\\y - z\\\\. Since : \\\\x - z\\\\^2 = \\\\x\\\\^2 - 2x\\\\cdot z + \\\\z\\\\^2, and : x\\\\cdot z = \\\\x\\\\\\\\z\\\\\\\\cos\\\\theta where Œ∏ is the angle between the two vectors, the conclusion of this inner product space form of the theorem is equivalent to the statement about equality of angles. Etymology and related terms Another medieval term for the pons asinorum was Elefuga which, according to Roger Bacon, comes from Greek elegia \\"misery\\", and Latin fuga \\"flight\\", that is \\"flight of the wretches\\". Though this etymology is dubious, it is echoed in Chaucer's use of the term \\"flemyng of wreches\\" for the theorem. There are two possible explanations for the name pons asinorum, the simplest being that the diagram used resembles an actual bridge. But the more popular explanation is that it is the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and functions as a \\"bridge\\" to the harder propositions that follow.D.E. Smith History of Mathematics (1958 Dover) p. 284 Gauss supposedly once espoused a similar belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician. Similarly, the name Dulcarnon was given to the 47th proposition of Book I of Euclid, better known as the Pythagorean theorem, after the Arabic Dh≈´ 'l qarnain ÿ∞ŸèŸà Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÇŸéÿ±ŸíŸÜŸéŸäŸíŸÜ, meaning \\"the owner of the two horns\\", because diagrams of the theorem showed two smaller squares like horns at the top of the figure. The term is also used as a metaphor for a dilemma.A. F. West & H. D. Thompson \\"On Dulcarnon, Elefuga And Pons Asinorum as Fanciful Names For Geometrical Propositions\\" The Princeton University bulletin Vol. 3 No. 4 (1891) p. 84 The theorem was also sometimes called \\"the Windmill\\" for similar reasons.Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, Euclid and his Modern Rivals Act I Scene II ¬ß1 Metaphorical usage Uses of the pons asinorum as a metaphor include: *Richard Aungerville's Philobiblon contains the passage \\"Quot Euclidis discipulos retrojecit Elefuga quasi scopulos eminens et abruptus, qui nullo scalarum suffragio scandi posset! Durus, inquiunt, est his sermo; quis potest eum audire?\\", which compares the theorem to a steep cliff that no ladder may help scale and asks how many would-be geometers have been turned away. *The term pons asinorum, in both its meanings as a bridge and as a test, is used as a metaphor for finding the middle term of a syllogism. *The 18th-century poet Thomas Campbell wrote a humorous poem called \\"Pons asinorum\\" where a geometry class assails the theorem as a company of soldiers might charge a fortress; the battle was not without casualties.W.E.

In cricket, an appeal is the act of a player (or players) on the fielding team asking an umpire for a decision regarding whether a batsman is out or not. According to Law 31 of the Laws of Cricket, an umpire may not rule a batsman out unless the fielding side appeals. On many occasions when a batsman has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team has not realised, so neglected to appeal, and so the umpire has not declared them out. An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts their run-up for the next ball. Cricket rules According to the Laws of Cricket, an appeal is a verbal query, usually in the form of, \\"How's that?\\" to an umpire. Since the taking of a wicket is an important event in the game, members of the fielding team often shout this phrase with great enthusiasm, and it has transmuted into the slightly abbreviated form, \\"Howzat?\\", often with a greatly extended final syllable. Sometimes one or other syllable is omitted entirely, the player emitting an elongated cry of simply \\"How?\\" or \\"Zat?\\". Sometimes, players may turn to the umpire and simply just shout or cheer. Players often also raise their arms or point towards the umpire as part of the appeal. Although technically an appeal is required for the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may walk off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand their ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where they consider they might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where it is not clear whether the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that they are out, if in their own mind they are certain they were out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanship. Decisions Some decisions, such as leg before wicket, always require an appeal and the umpire's decision, as no batsman will preempt the umpire on what requires fine judgment of several factors. Run-outs and stumpings are usually appealed and decided by an umpire, unless the batsman is clearly out of their ground and obviously out. Appealing differs vastly from sledging in the context that appealing is not supposed to be offensive or directly taunting to the other team, and more of a celebration to the appealing team. However, excessive appealing is against the ICC's Code of Conduct. Unsportsmanlike appealing Under the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct, it is considered unsportsmanlike to: * appeal excessively; * appeal in an intimidating manner towards an umpire; or * appeal under the knowledge that the batsman is not out. Any instances of such behaviour are punishable by awarding penalty runs, as adjudicated and imposed by the umpires, or fines or match bans, as adjudicated and imposed by the match referee.

After working in private practice in Kansas City, Missouri, he was nominated for the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Whittaker to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In 1957, he won confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States, thus becoming the first individual to serve as a judge on a federal district court, a federal court of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. During his brief tenure on the Warren Court, Whittaker emerged as a swing vote. In 1962, he suffered a nervous breakdown and resigned from the Court. After leaving the Supreme Court, he served as chief counsel to General Motors and frequently criticized the Civil Rights Movement and the Warren Court. Early years and career Whittaker was born on a farm near Troy, Kansas to Charles Edward Whittaker, a farmer, and Ida Eve Miller, a schoolteacher from Hagerstown, Maryland. He attended the nearby one-room Brush Creek School, and then the Troy High School until he dropped out in the ninth grade after his mother died on his sixteenth birthday. He spent the next three years working on a family farm, and also hunting and trapping. Whittaker developed an interest in law by reading newspaper articles about criminal trials. In the summer of 1920, he applied to the part-time evening program at the Kansas City School of Law (currently the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City School of Law) and gained admission with the condition that he would finish his high school education after personally pleading with Oliver Dean, a president of the law school. Immediately, he enrolled at Manual High School in Kansas City, Missouri. He spent the next four years working during the day to support himself, and in the evenings was taking high school courses as well as classes at the Kansas City School of Law. While Whittaker was a student at the school, future President Harry S. Truman was a classmate. Whittaker graduated in the class of 1924 with a Bachelor of Laws having been admitted to the Missouri bar during his senior year.Smith, Craig A. Failing Justice: Charles Evans Whittaker on the Supreme Court. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland & Company, 2005.https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/whittaker-charles-evans Whittaker joined the law firm of Watson, Ess, Marshall & Enggas in Kansas City, Missouri, where he previously worked full-time as an office boy, and built up a practice in corporate law with the Union Pacific Railroad, Montgomery Ward, and the City National Bank and Trust Company among his clients. He developed close ties to the Republican Party. Federal judicial service (District Court and Court of Appeals) Whittaker was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on May 11, 1954, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri vacated by Judge Albert L. Reeves. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 7, 1954, and received his commission the next day. His service terminated on June 21, 1956, due to his elevation to the Eighth Circuit. Whittaker was nominated by President Eisenhower on March 16, 1956, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Judge John Caskie Collet. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 4, 1956, and received his commission the next day. His service terminated on March 24, 1957, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court Whittaker was nominated by President Eisenhower on March 2, 1957, to a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States vacated by Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 1957, received his commission on March 22, 1957, and took the oath on March 25, 1957. Whittaker thus became the first person to serve as a judge of a United States District Court, a United States Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Samuel Blatchford also served at all three levels of the federal judiciary, but the court system was configured slightly differently at that time. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the most recent Justice to have served in all three levels of the federal judiciary. Whittaker was one of the four Republicans appointed to the court by Eisenhower (along with Earl Warren, John M. Harlan II, and Potter Stewart). Eisenhower appointed one Democrat, William J. Brennan, to the Court. Whittaker served as Circuit Justice of the Eighth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit for his duration of service on the Supreme Court. He assumed senior status due to a certified disability on March 31, 1962. His service terminated on September 30, 1965, due to his resignation. Judicial philosophy On the closely divided Supreme Court, Whittaker was a swing vote. According to Professor Howard Ball, Whittaker was an \\"extremely weak, vacillating justice\\" who was \\"courted by the two cliques on the Court because his vote was generally up in the air and typically went to the group that made the last, but not necessarily the best, argument.\\"Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior, Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 126. Whittaker failed to develop a consistent judicial philosophy and reportedly felt himself not as qualified as some of the other members of the court. After agonizing deeply for months over his vote in Baker v. Carr, a landmark reapportionment case, Whittaker suffered a nervous breakdown in the spring of 1962. At the behest of Chief Justice Earl Warren, Whittaker recused himself from the case and retired from the Court effective March 31, 1962, citing exhaustion from the heavy workload and stress.\\"Whittaker is leaving U.S. Supreme Court\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 30 March 1962 Final years Effective September 30, 1965, Whittaker resigned his position as a retired Justice in order to become chief counsel to General Motors. He also became a resolute critic of the Warren Court as well as the Civil Rights Movement, characterizing the civil disobedience of the type practiced by Martin Luther King Jr. and his followers as lawless. He wrote a piece for the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin that advised protesters to use courts instead of taking to the streets.Urofsky, Melvin I. The Supreme Court Justices: A Biographical Dictionary. New York: Garland Pub, 1994. Whittaker died on November 26, 1973 at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.\\"Charles Whittaker dies; On top court\\", Youngstown Vindicator, 27 November 1973\\"Former Justice Whittaker of Supreme Court is dead,\\" The New York Times, November 27, 1973. Family In 1928, Whittaker married Winifred R. Pugh. They had three sons: Dr. Charles Keith Whittaker, a neurosurgeon; Kent E. Whittaker, an attorney; and Gary T. Whittaker, a stockbroker.

He served Georgia as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777 and as the Governor of Georgia in 1781. Early life Brownson was born in Woodbury, Connecticut, the sixth of ten children born to Timothy (1701‚Äì1766) and Abgail Jenner (1707‚Äì1784). He graduated from Yale in 1761 and practiced medicine in his hometown. In 1769 he married Elizabeth Lewis. The couple moved to St. John Parish, Georgia, in 1774 and began working a 500-acre plantation near Savannah. He settled in Liberty County, Georgia in 1764 and began his medical practice. Brownson‚Äôs wife died in 1775, and the following year he married Elizabeth McLean, with whom he had two children. Revolutionary War In 1774, St. John Parish was a hotbed of revolutionary activity; many of its people were New England Congregationalists by way of Dorchester, South Carolina, a settlement on the Ashley River above Charlestown that had been founded by Puritans from Massachusetts. Brownson and another transplanted Connecticut physician, Lyman Hall, were among the eleven delegates chosen to represent the parish at the provincial congress, which met in Savannah in July 1775. Both men were elected to represent Georgia in the Second Continental Congress; Brownson served from January to May 1777 and again from late August to early October of the same year. The British invasion of Georgia in the final days of 1778 was part of the southern theater of the revolution, but with the expulsion of the king‚Äôs troops from Augusta in June 1781, factional disputes threatened to spoil the victory. At this critical moment Brownson, then acting as deputy purveyor of hospitals in the South, was dispatched to Georgia with a brigadier‚Äôs commission from Congress. He initially served as Speaker of the House of Representatives, before a compromise was worked out whereby Brownson became governor and John Twiggs was promoted to brigadier general. Brownson congratulated General Nathanael Greene for his efforts to restore civil government in Georgia. Brownson's term as governor during the last few months of 1781 was filled with dealing with hostile Creek Indians and bands of Tories that roamed the countryside. Commandant of Spanish Pensacola, Florida, Arturo O'Neill wrote to Gov. Brownson on Nov. 18, 1781, indicating his suspicions regarding attempts of British traders in the area to gain favor with the Indians by securing presents for them. Brownson talked to the upper and lower Creek Nation and accused them of making an unsuccessful attack against American soldiers and of holding American traders, commissaries, and property. He told them that the Americans desire friendship, and threatened them with reprisal if they did not submit. During the decade following the war, Brownson served the public almost continuously as justice of the peace, as a commissioner for erecting a new capital in Louisville, as a member of the convention that ratified the federal constitution, as a delegate to the convention that drafted the state constitution in 1788, and as the first president of the Georgia Senate. He was appointed by Congress as deputy purveyor of hospitals and later to the charge of the southern hospitals. He was one of the trustees for the establishment of Franklin College, later called the University of Georgia. Death and legacy Brownson died at his plantation in 1796 in Riceboro, Georgia and was buried in Midway Cemetery in Midway, Georgia. Although his career was not as distinguished as some others of Georgia‚Äôs founding fathers, Brownson‚Äôs service at crucial periods helped the state transcend factional bickering and focus on the improvement of society.

Plot The novel takes place around the planets Yellowstone and Resurgam, in two story lines which converge near the climax of the novel. Yellowstone The novel begins in the year 2605, where Skade has been tasked with investigating a Conjoiner ship that has returned to the Conjoiner headquarters, the Mother Nest. It is revealed early on that Skade is a Conjoiner woman who appears to be in touch with secret circles of control within the theoretically egalitarian Conjoiners society. In the ship, she discovers Galiana, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, she encountered the Inhibitors, who have unleashed an agent into her ships which has taken control of it and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well. Galiana requests that Skade kill her, but Skade only places her in suspended animation in the hope that she can be helped in the future. Ten years later, Nevil Clavain is facing problems in the Conjoiner mother nest; he is struggling to find answers as to what happened to Galiana (he is unaware that she is still alive) and about Felka, who he believes may be his daughter. He ponders this as he leaves on a mission, during which he rescues Antoinette Bax as she buries her father in the gas giant Tangerine Dream. Her ship severely damaged, Antoinette limps back to the Rust Belt, a ring of orbital habitats around Yellowstone. When Clavain and Skade return to the Mother Nest, Skade, Remontoire, and Felka finally convince Clavain to join the Conjoiner's leadership, which Clavain had been resisting. Skade now informs him about the Inhibitors, convincing him to undertake a mission to reclaim lost Conjoiner doomsday weapons and taking him to see the fleet of advanced starships that the Conjoiners have been building in secret. Although Skade claims that the weapons and ships will be used to defend humanity against the Inhibitors, Clavain is convinced that they will actually be used simply to evacuate the Conjoiners and abandon the rest of humanity. Clavain defects to the Demarchists at Yellowstone and spreads the news of the Inhibitors, enlisting Antoinette Bax's help to escape the pursuing Conjoiners under Skade. Clavain is followed by Scorpio and Remontoire, but they along with Antoinette and Clavain are captured by the mysterious underground figure known as \\"H\\". H reveals what happened to Skade during a Conjoiner raid into Chasm City. This was when Skade discovered the secrets that would lead her to develop inertia suppression technology, and when H believes she was subverted by an alien intellect. Clavain reveals Skade's plans for the Conjoiner fleet and the cache weapons, and H agrees to help him beat Skade to them. H supplies ships and his own version of the inertial suppression technology, while Scorpio supplies an army of hyper-pigs for the pursuit. Skade and Clavain race to the Resurgam system employing various creative long-distance strategies against each other and pushing their vessels to higher and higher speeds. Eventually, Skade's vessel is damaged in an attempt to exceed the speed of light. Clavain and crew arrive in the Zodiacal Light ready to recover the cache weapons. Resurgam Several years on (roughly 50 from the start of the book), Triumvir Ilia Volyova and Ana Khouri are on the planet Resurgam and have discovered a new threat; the Inhibitors, alerted to the presence of humanity during events described in Revelation Space, have begun dismantling several rocky moons across the system and are moving their components towards the gas giant, Roc. They resolve to evacuate Resurgam by enlisting the aid of the rebel Thorn who has been attempting to evacuate Resurgam all along, by opening communications with Captain John Brannigan who is in direct control of their ship due to the nanotechnological Melding Plague, and by enabling the Cache Weapons as a last resort against the Inhibitors. (These are the same weapons that Clavain will be sent to recover, and it was their activation during the events in the novel Revelation Space by Volyova which allowed the Conjoiners in Yellowstone to determine the weapons' location.) Successful in all three endeavors, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation, while the Inhibitors continue their mysterious construction project. Only a few thousand people have been evacuated from the surface when the Inhibitors come so close to Resurgam's star that Volyova begins deploying the cache weapons in the hope that they will be able to buy more time. It is at this point that a beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives in a laser transmission, and attempts to negotiate the peaceful turn over of the cache weapons to the soon to be arriving Zodiacal Light. Volyova rejects his requests, explaining that she has greater need to the weapons and continues deploying them. When Zodiacal Light arrives in the system, and because of the failure of the beta-level to negotiate a handover, Clavain attacks Nostalgia for Infinity using Scorpio and his army of pigs as a boarding party. Clavain's superior force capture Nostalgia for Infinity, although Volyova is able to damage Zodiacal Light with one of the cache weapons. Negotiations resume and the two sides come to terms. The evacuation is completed with the help of the Storm Bird and Nostalgia for Infinity departs; Volyova, who is dying from injuries suffered during a suicide attempt by the Captain takes half of the cache weapons and attacks the Inhibitors in the Storm Bird, to no effect. Remontoire and Khouri remain in the system in the Zodiacal Light to try and contact Dan Sylveste in the Hades Matrix in hope that he will be able to supply information that can be used to fight the Inhibitors. The novel ends with Nostalgia for Infinity establishing a colony on an unnamed Pattern Juggler planet (in the following novel Absolution Gap it is called Ararat), waiting for the Zodiacal Light to catch up with them so that they can continue the fight against the Inhibitors. Inhibitor Asides In addition to the two plot lines there are occasional asides explaining the history and motivation of the Inhibitors. These asides explain the galaxy was once filled with star-faring civilizations. Those civilizations were largely destroyed in the \\"Dawn War\\", a galaxy-wide conflict over the galaxy's scarce resources. One of these civilizations determines that a collision between our galaxy and another will occur in 3 billion years and create/become the Inhibitors in order to shepherd intelligent life through this cataclysm. They had determined that collision could be most easily dealt with if intelligent life was kept isolated to individual star systems, leaving the Inhibitors to perform any necessary manipulations of stars and planets to reduce the damage caused by the collision. The asides also reveal that the Inhibitors were not as brutal in their past, but their performance has degraded over the millennia. They have been detecting civilizations at later stages, and required to commit wholesale extinction more often. Clavain and Felka learn of this history during communication with the Inhibitors in Galiana's head. Clavain, however, is not convinced that the Inhibitors are right about the coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down. The future collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda Galaxy is a scientifically predicted event. However, astronomers believe that it would not cause major damage to the capability of the galaxy to support life because galaxies are so diffuse that very few, if any, planets and stars would collide.

He was first mentioned in 1840 in the written record of the American fur trapper, Osborne Russell. In 1851, at the urging of trapper Jim Bridger, Washakie led a band of Shoshones to the council meetings of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). Essentially from that time until his death, he was considered the head of the Eastern Shoshones by the representatives of the United States government. In 1979, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early life Much about Washakie's early life remains unknown, but some information is revealed. Washakie was born between 1798 and 1810. His mother Lost Woman, was a Tussawehee (White Knife) Shoshoni by birth. His father, Crooked Leg (Paseego), was an Umatilla rescued as a boy from slave traders at Wakemap and Celilo in 1786 by Weasel Lungs, a Tussawehee dog soldier (White Knife) Shoshoni medicine man. Crooked Leg was adopted into Weasel Lungs' clan. He became a Tussawehee dog soldier (White Knife) Shoshoni and married Weasel Lungs' eldest daughter Lost Girl, later Lost Woman. His maternal grandmother, Chosro (Bluebird)), was also Tussawehee by birth. Lost Woman's younger sister, Washakie's aunt, was Nanawu (Little Striped Squirrel). She was the mother of Chochoco (Has No Horse), a first cousin to Washakie. Washakie's birth name was Pinaquanah (\\"Smells of Sugar\\"). He had other names before being called Washakie. When he was a teenager, he changed his name to Shoots the Buffalo Running. He was a high-stakes gambler, playing a game involving shaking small stones inside of a gourd rattle, rather like dice, so his friends renamed him Gourd Rattler.Ontko, Gale. Thunder Over the Ochoco, Volume I: The Gathering Storm. Bend, OR: Maverick Publications, Inc., 1997. Smells of Sugar met his first \\"white men\\" in 1811. Wilson Hunt's main party of Astorians, with the Pacific Fur brigade, were travelling down the Boise River from the mouth of the Bruneau River. Seven months late for their scheduled arrival at Fort Astoria, they happened into Crooked Leg's camp on the Boise. They needed horses, which Crooked Leg refused to sell to them; instead reluctantly selling them a few camas roots, dried fish, and four dogs.Ontko, Gale. Thunder Over the Ochoco, Volume II: Distant Thunder. Bend, OR: Maverick Publications, Inc., Fourth Printing, August 1997. Crooked Leg was killed in 1824 by members of the Piegan Blackfeet when they raided a Shoshone hunting camp inside the Blackfoot hunting Boundary. Every able-bodied Shoshoni was following and hunting the migrating herds of game, as bison were now scarce in the Ochoco and the rest of the southern Blue Mountains, and food was in short supply. There had been a weak truce in the summer of 1820, between Fires Black Gun (Tooite Coon), (also known to white men as Cameahwait and Comeah Wait, brother to Sacajawea), and Piegan Blackfoot leader, Ugly Head. The Shoshoni had been hunting high in the Montana Rockies, well north of the southern boundary of the Blackfoot hunting grounds, for any game they could find. A Piegan war party, led by Large Kidney and Four Horns, burst into one of their encampments on the Boulder River, to find Shoshoni head chief Owitze (Twisted Hand), his war leader Red Wolf, and the popular young leader of the Tussawehee White Knife dog soldiers, Po'have (The Horse). Fighting ensued. Washakie, by now in his late teens and riding with the dog soldiers, led by Weahwewa (Wolf Dog), was moving north out of Wyoming country with a weapons shipment of Mexican guns from Comanche leader Shaved Head, and overheard the disturbance. Crooked Leg was camped a few miles away and Washakie immediately got word to him of the attack. When Crooked Leg arrived on the battle scene, he was killed. The hunting ceased and the dog soldiers went on the war trail, backed by Comanche war chief Red Sleeves and his reinforcements. They combed the Boulder, the Yellowstone, and the Musselshell for Blackfoot and killed many. This victory by the Shoshoni led to a council with the Blackfeet tribes, with the Shoshoni once again a proud warrior society. At the council, it was agreed that the Blackfeet tribes would join forces with the Shoshoni to restrict the expanding encroachment of trappers into each tribes' hunting grounds. By the late 19th century Washakie became head chief of the Eastern Shoshone. He was the only Shoshone warrior to be honored by the Federal government of the United States, for leading General Crook's army to defeat the Sioux, after Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn. The year of Washakie's birth date is debated. A missionary in 1883 recorded the year of his birth as 1798, but his tombstone was later inscribed with a birth date of 1804. Late in his life he told an agent at the Shoshone Agency that when he was 16, he had met Jim Bridger. Interpolating from the age of Bridger when he first went into the wilderness, researchers have determined that Washakie was likely born between 1808 and 1810. During his early childhood, the Blackfeet Indians attacked a combined camp of Flathead and Lemhi people while the latter were on a buffalo hunt near Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana (where the Gallatin, Madison, and Jefferson rivers form the headwaters of the Missouri River). After Crooked Leg was killed, his mother and at least one sister were able to make their way back to the Lemhis on the Salmon River in Idaho. During the attack, Washakie was lost and possibly wounded. According to some family traditions, he was found by either Bannock Indians who had also come to hunt in the region, or by a combined Shoshone and Bannock band. He may have become the adopted son of the band leader. For the next twenty five years (c. 1815-1840) he learned the traditions and ways of a warrior that were typical of any Shoshone youth of that period. Although the name by which he would be widely known has been translated in various ways, it apparently dealt with his tactics in battle. One story describes how Washakie devised a large rattle by placing stones in an inflated and dried balloon of buffalo hide, which he tied on a stick. He carried the device into battle to frighten enemy horses, earning the name \\"The Rattle\\" or \\"Gourd Rattler\\". Another translation of \\"Washakie\\" is \\"Shoots-on- the-Run.\\" War deeds Fur trapper records of the 1830s describe Washakie as being feared by the Blackfeet. He had a life-long scar on his cheek from an arrow that was inflicted by an enemy during a raid. When as an older man his authority was questioned by fellow Eastern Shoshone, Washakie sought to reconfirm his prowess as a warrior to maintain his status. He disappeared for many days, then returned having singlehandedly secured several scalps of his enemies, a daring feat for a man of any age.Grace Raymond Hebard, Washakie: Chief of the Shoshones, University of Nebraska Press, 1995. In 1866, Washakie fought one-on-one with Crow Chief Big Robber to end a stalemate over rights to occupy the Wind River Basin, which the Crow claimed through the 1851 Horse Creek Treaty of Fort Laramie, though the area had long been used by the Shoshone. Washakie emerged victorious and displayed his enemy's heart on a lance. This event is memorialized in the place name of Crowheart Butte on the Wind River Indian Reservation, though the actual battle took place along a nearby draw. In 2005 a sculpture of the event was unveiled at the University of Wyoming's Washakie Dining Center in Laramie. Fur trade Chief Washakie (National Statuary Hall Collection statue) Washakie's band evidently participated in the fur trade rendezvous (1825‚Äì1840), since those rendezvous took place within the Green River, Wind River, and Snake River regions claimed by the horse-owning and buffalo-hunting Shoshone and Bannock bands of eastern Idaho. Late in life, Washakie reported that he and Jim Bridger became fast friends, and indeed, Bridger became Washakie's son-in-law in 1850 when he took Washakie's daughter as his third wife. Bridger, born March 17, 1804, entered Shoshone country in 1824 (Washakie said Bridger was the older of the two). Washakie learned French and some English from trappers and traders. Washakie's close association with the trappers developed into a similar relationship with U.S. officials. Fort Bridger Treaties In 1863, and again in 1868, he signed treaties with the U.S. at Fort Bridger, Wyoming. The Fort Bridger Treaty of 1863 established a generic Shoshone country, whose borders extended eastward to the crest of the Wind River Mountains, south to the Uintah Mountains of Utah, and on the northern side, to the crest of the Bitterroots. The western border was left undefined, but was understood to include most of the Snake River as far as the Oregon border. This treaty included a number of Shoshone and Bannock Indian bands besides that of Washakie. The Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 was established at the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868 and it proved more significant, for it established the Shoshone and Bannock Indian Agency located in west-central Wyoming. Moreover, this was land selected by Washakie and his headmen of the Eastern Shoshones. The initial reservation included about three million acres (12,000 km) in Wyoming's Wind River country for his people. Although an 1872 land cession reduced the size by , this valley remains the home of the Eastern Shoshones today. He was also determined that Native Americans should be educated, and he gave land to Welsh clergyman John Roberts to establish a boarding school where Shoshone girls learned traditional crafts and language. Washakie and Mormonism Washakie was a friend of Brigham Young and expressed sadness at the fighting his people had often done with the Utahns. It was not until after 1880, after Young's death, that Washakie became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was baptized on 25 September 1880 by Amos R. Wright. About 300 other Shoshone joined the church at this point.Encyclopedia of LDS History, p. 1312 Washakie and Episcopalianism In 1883, the Episcopal Church assigned John Roberts to minister to the Shoshone and Arapahos on the Wind River Reservation. Roberts established several churches on the reservation, as well as within his designated 150 mile radius. Although the Washakie's son was killed by a white man in 1885 during a dispute over alcohol, which purportedly led Washakie to vow revenge against whites, Roberts purportedly earned the Chief's respect by offering his own life in exchange. Furthermore, Roberts learned Shoshone customs, beliefs and language, and translated the Bible into Shoshone (and Arapahoe). Circa 1888, Washakie helped Roberts establish a boarding school where Shoshone girls from distant villages could learn traditional crafts and language, by donating 160 acres near Trout Creek, which many considered sacred ground. Washakie chose Episcopalism as his faith, was baptized again in 1897, and ultimately buried in a service officiated by his friend Roberts, on February 22, 1900. Congress reaffirmed the church's ownership of the school in 1909, when it deactivated the fort named after Chief Washakie. Although the school closed circa 1945, many of the historic girls' school buildings survive today. Recognition His memorial stone in Ft. Washakie His prowess in battle, his efforts for peace, and his commitment to his people's welfare made him one of the most respected leaders in Native American history. In 1878 a U.S. army outpost located on the reservation was renamed Fort Washakie, which was the only U.S military outpost to be named after a Native American. Upon his death in 1900, he became the only known Native American to be given a full military funeral. Washakie County, Wyoming was named for him and there‚Äôs a statue of his head in front of the Washakie County Courthouse. In 2000, the state of Wyoming donated a bronze statue of Washakie to the National Statuary Hall Collection. There is also a statue of Washakie in downtown Casper, Wyoming. The dining hall at the University of Wyoming is also named after him. The current ghost town of Washakie, Utah was also named after him. During World War II, a Liberty Ship built in Portland, Oregon, in 1942, SS Chief Washakie, was named in his honor. USS Washakie, a United States Navy harbor tug in service from 1944 to 1946 and from 1953 to 1975, also was named for him. Washakie was a hide painter. An 1880 painted elk hide at the Glenbow Museum is attributed to him. The hide painting portrays the Sun Dance.Skimkin 315 Chief Washakie Foundation The Chief Washakie Foundation was founded in 2004. It supports educational programs and research into the history and cultural traditions of the Shoshone and Arapaho of Central Wyoming and advocates for Native American education. Washakie's great- great grandson James Trosper serves as Chair and Executive Director.

She worked with major companies, including the Martha Graham Company and Batsheva Dance Company. Sokolow also formed her own group ‚ÄúDance Unit‚Äù which became Players‚Äô Project after its dispersal and her death.  Early life  Anna Sokolow was born on February 9, 1910 in Hartford, Connecticut. Her father, Samuel Sokolow, immigrated to the U.S. around 1905 in pursuit of a job. Her mother, Sarah, came to the U.S. in 1907. Intending to reside in Hartford, Connecticut, Samuel and Sara eventually moved to New York City for better job prospects. Both of her parents were Russian immigrants. Sarah started working in the garment industry when Samuel contracted Parkinson's disease. A socialist, Sarah was heavily involved in the Garment Workers Union. Anna Sokolow was the third child of four born to Samuel and Sarah, preceded by Isadore and Rose, and succeeded by Gertie.Larry Warren, Anna Sokolow: The Rebellious Spirit (London and New York: Routledge, 1998), pg. 8; Training Sokolow began her dance training by taking classes at the Emanuel Sisterhood alongside her sister Rose. Her first teacher, Elsa Pohl, was influenced by the work of Isadora Duncan. Despite the objection of her family, Sokolow moved away from home and dropped out of school in favor of a dance career at age 15. While training, Sokolow supported herself by working in a factory. She began training under Bird Larson, Irene Lewisohn, Louis Horst, Martha Graham, and Blanche Talmud at the Neighborhood Playhouse at the Henry Street Settlement House in 1925 as a ‚ÄúJunior Player.‚Äù Talmud, Sokolow's main teacher, had a background in Delsarte and Dalcroze eurhythmics. As a student at the Playhouse, Sokolow studied voice, dance and pantomime. She eventually received a full scholarship at the Playhouse, and participated in her first major performance in 1928 as a part of Bloch's ‚ÄúIsrael Symphony.‚Äù Career Sokolow first performed with the Martha Graham Company in 1930. She danced with the company as a soloist for about 8 years. While performing with the Graham company, she assisted Louis Horst in his choreography classes. One of her notable performances with the company was in Massine's ‚ÄúRite of Spring‚Äù in 1930. Sokolow's first solo performances occurred between 1929 and 1932. She developed the Theatre Union Dance Group in 1933, which was renamed ‚ÄúDance Unit‚Äù in 1935. In programs for ‚ÄúDance Unit‚Äù, Anna Sokolow's name wasn't emphasized in order to bring more attention to the group as opposed to certain individuals. Despite this, the dancers were known as the \\"Sokolovas.\\"[2] In 1936, a full evening of her own work was presented at the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) in New York City. Some of the works included in the program were Speaker (1935), Strange American Funeral (1935), Inquisition ‚Äò36 (1936), and Four Little Salon Pieces (1936). In 1937, four men joined the Dance Unit for the first time, premiering in Excerpts from a War Poem (1937). With the addition men, she avoided dividing movement based on gender and instead presented all bodies as equals. Sokolow joined the New Dance League in 1937. Beginning in the 1930s, she affiliated herself with the politicized \\"radical dance\\" movement, out of which developed her work Anti-War Trilogy (1933).Anna Sokolow: Radical Dance ; accessed February 9, 2018. During this time period, she performed and choreographed both solo and ensemble works, which tackled subject matter that included the exploitation of workers and growing troubles of Jews in Germany. Sokolow drew a lot of inspiration from the Union movement as she considered the unions her first audience. She often explored themes of Communism, socialism, and the working class through her dances, particularly in Strange American Funeral (1935) and Case No. -- (1937). Several works from this period, including Anti-War Trilogy, were set to music by the composer Alex North.Sanya Shoilevska Henderson, Alex North, Film Composer (Jefferson, NC: McFarland Press, 2003), pg. 226; In the 1940s, Sokolow continued premiering works in various venues throughout New York City, such as The Bride (1946), a piece influenced by traditional elements from Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremonies. From 1955-1985, Sokolow regularly choreographed for the Juilliard Dance Ensemble at the Juilliard School. She created many notable pieces for the group including Primavera (1955) and Ballade (1965). In 1953, Sokolow created Lyric Suite, one of her most well-received works. A collection of solos, duets, and ensemble work set to the music of Alban Berg, Lyric Suite was noteworthy for its lack of a narrative and its \\"suite form\\" design. The New Dance Group sponsored the first showing of Lyric Suite in March 1954. Sokolow considered this piece as the beginning of a new era in her choreography. Another one of Sokolow's signature works was Rooms (1955), a piece that explored loneliness. The music‚Äîcomposed by Kenyon Hopkins‚Äîwas originally a jazz score. Rooms was divided into six sections: Dream, Escape, Desire, Panic, Daydream, and The End? The piece featured eight dancers and eight chairs, with the intention that each dancer and chair portrayed a specific character in a secluded room. Rooms also garnered positive reviews, with many critics noting its powerful emotional impact. From 1958‚Äì65, Sokolow created her Opus series. This series includes Opus '58 (1958), Opus Jazz 1958 (1958), Opus '60 (1960), Opus '62 (1962), Opus '63 (1963), and Opus '65 (1965). The set of six pieces, along with Session for Six (1958) and Session for Eight (1959) used similar movement vocabularies and content with slight variations in each. Labanotation scores show the similarities found, including, used of strong accents and the dropping of the body and its parts to the floor. In the later 1960s, Sokolow used jazz style to protest the war occurring in Vietnam and to give voice to the countercultures of America. Time+ (1966) was a war protest dance with multiple parts. In the piece she used clear imagery of soldiers and their experiences of war. The piece ended with soldiers that appear to be wounded and struggling with one another to stand, showing the great hardships that come from war.  Theater work  Sokolow began her association with Broadway in 1947, choreographing for the musical Street Scene. She choreographed for multiple Broadway productions, including Happy as Larry (1950) and Camino Real (1953). She was set to work on Hair (1967) but an emergency surgery kept her from being fully involved in the process. Consequently, she dropped out of the production. When asked to rejoin, she denied the opportunity as she objected the use of nudity in the production. Sokolow also frequently staged works‚Äîsuch as Carmen (1956) and Candide (1956)‚Äîfor the New York City Opera.  International work  Though based in New York City, Sokolow was known for her work abroad as well. In 1939, she traveled to Mexico with her company to perform at the Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Mexico City, where they received positive reviews. This success lead to the formation of the group, La Paloma Azul. Sokolow created four works for this company El Renacuajo Paseador (1940). After her dancers left to return to New York City, Sokolow chose to stay behind to continue working at the request of the Ministry of Public Education. La Paloma Azul dissolved in 1940 due to the emergence of a competitor dance group. She eventually returned to New York City in the early 1940s but continued to visit Mexico City occasionally throughout her career. Jerome Robbins encouraged Sokolow to go to Israel to work with the Inbal Dancers in 1953. Sokolow's visits to Israel began in the 1950s and concluded in the 1980s. Her first program to premiere in Israel featured The Treasure (1962), The Soldier‚Äôs Tale (1954), and Dreams (1961). In 1962, she helped established Israel's Lyric Theatre. The company was short-lived as they disbanded in 1964. Sokolow returned to Israel as a guest choreographer for Batsheva Dance Company in 1972.  Teaching  One of Anna Sokolow's earliest teaching experiences occurred during a trip to Russia in the early 1930s. While there with her then-lover and musical collaborator, Alex North, she taught classes in the Graham technique. In 1955, Sokolow taught her first classes at Juilliard. She officially joined the faculty in 1958 and taught classes in \\"method dancing\\" from 1958‚Äì93. Sokolow also worked alongside Robert Lewis as a teacher at the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and the HB Studio.Andrea Olmstead, Juilliard: A History (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1999), pp. 202-03; . Additionally, she taught choreography classes at the Hebrew Arts School later in her career.  The Actors Studio  In 1947, Sokolow's close friend Elia Kazan convinced her to become a founding member of The Actors Studio. Sokolow taught movement for actors. The classes were rooted in the Graham technique and also incorporated floor work and ballet barre elements. Her piece Rooms (1955) emerged as a response to her experiences working with groups of aspiring actors. Sokolow eventually set a small-scale production‚ÄîElmer and Lilly‚Äîon her students. She left The Actors Studio in the mid-1950s. Repertory Since the 2004 dispersal of Sokolow's company, Players' Project, its former co-artistic directors have formed separate institutions to maintain Sokolow's Legacy. The Sokolow Theatre Dance Ensemble performs Sokolow's repertory plus contemporary choreographies under the direction of Jim May. The Player's Project continues to revive Sokolow's work today. Sokolow Now!, the archival dance company of the Sokolow Dance Foundation, performs Sokolow's repertory exclusively under the direction of Lorry May.

She won a variety of awards including the Samuel Scripps Award (1991), Aztec Eagle Honor (1988), an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Boston Conservatory (1988), and an Honorary Doctor of Humanities from the Ohio State University (1978). In 1967, she received a prestigious grant from the National Council on the Arts, worth $10,000; Sokolow used this funding to create Deserts (1967). She was also inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1998, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1993. Sokolow dedicated her works to her inspirations including Isadora Duncan, Louis Horst, Anne Frank, Jos√© Lim√≥n, Vaslav Nijinsky, Martin Luther King Jr., and her parents. Her choreography has been performed by many prominent dance companies including Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Batsheva, Boston Ballet, and Nederlands Dans Theater.  Personal life  Sokolow was romantically involved with Alex North, her musical collaborator, for seven years. Despite the resolution of their relationship, they continued to work together throughout their careers. She had no children. Sokolow was known for her heavy involvement in the Communist movement. In New York's 1936 election, she registered as a Communist. In the 1940s, she was also a featured performer in many Communist rallies. However, by the 1950s, Sokolow she no longer aligned herself with the Communist party. When questioned by the FBI, she cited her participation at rallies was motivated by earning money for her performance. Sokolow suffered from depression in the late 1960s-early 1970s. Sokolow died at the age of 90, on March 29, 2000 in New York City.

An English immigrant from Manchester, Daphne is employed by Frasier as a live-in housekeeper and physical therapist for his father, Martin. Her relationship with Frasier's brother Niles is a major plotline of the series, progressing from Niles' secret infatuation to their eventual marriage later in the show.  Biography  Daphne was born in September 1961 in Manchester, the only daughter in a family of nine children. She spent much of her childhood playing nurse and housemaid to her brothers. She has a complex love-hate relationship with her domineering mother, Gertrude Moon; her relationship with her father, Harry Moon, is much warmer and closer. As a young girl, Daphne's early career was as an actress in the hit British sitcom Mind Your Knickers (a show about 12-year-olds in a private girls' boarding school). Her career ended at age 16 when she became too tall and busty to play her shorter pre-teen character. During her youth, she gained considerable skill at billiards and darts, claiming to have won many tournaments. She also raised show rats, was a member of the Manchester Light Opera Works, and was a skilled shoplifter. As an adult, Daphne takes up a career as a physical therapist, working one-on-one with various invalids and shut-ins. At an undisclosed time, she migrates to America to live in Seattle, seeking a new life free of her domineering family. Her first job in America is at a convenience store, and it is implied she once shoplifted there. In the third season finale, \\"You Can Go Home Again\\", it is revealed that prior to being interviewed and hired by the Cranes, she had a chance encounter with them at Cafe Nervosa. In the series premiere, \\"The Good Son\\", Daphne is hired by Frasier to assist his father, Martin, with his daily activities and exercises; Martin suffers pain and discomfort from a gunshot wound to his hip that forced him to retire from the Seattle Police Department. Although Frasier is initially less than impressed with her, Martin takes a liking to her sense of humor and convinces Frasier to hire her and make her position a live-in one.  Personality  Daphne is mostly portrayed as kind and down-to-earth, often perplexed and exasperated by Frasier's snobbery and pretension. In the earlier seasons, Daphne portrays herself as a no-nonsense physical therapist with Martin. Although they fight and bicker over Martin's therapy sessions, she gets along with Martin well and acts as his caregiver and constant companion. Like most characters on Frasier, Daphne has many eccentricities. She often tells rambling stories about her family, cheerfully remembering rather grim or traumatic events, to the considerable discomfort of the Crane family. She is also a firm believer in the supernatural, and believes herself to be \\"a bit psychic.\\" Daphne's apparent psychic abilities are often treated with ambiguity on the show, and her various \\"visions\\" are sometimes shown to have come true, sometimes in a roundabout way and sometimes very accurately. As the series progresses, Daphne's psychic abilities are considerably downplayed. In the season 8 episode \\"The Wizard and Roz\\", Niles hires a paranormal expert to assess whether or not Daphne truly has any psychic abilities. During the course of her discussion with the expert, Daphne implies that her grandmother told her she had psychic abilities.  Role on the series  Like Martin, Daphne acts as a working class foil to Frasier and Niles's upper-class snobbery, while also vexing Frasier's scientific views with her eccentric behavior. As the show progressed and this aspect of her character was toned down, more focus was put on her relationships with the other characters. Daphne's most significant developing relationship over the course of the series is with Frasier Crane's younger brother, Niles. Unbeknownst to Daphne, Niles falls in love with her in the third episode, when they first meet. Despite the increasing obviousness of Niles' infatuation, Daphne remains utterly oblivious to Niles' feelings towards her, though they become increasingly close friends. Niles says nothing to Daphne, at first because he is married, later because she is involved with numerous (frequently unsuccessful) relationships with other men. Even when she is not, Frasier has one excuse or another to prevent Niles from telling her anything. Niles' feelings are ultimately, and accidentally, revealed by Frasier in season 7. Shocked to discover Niles's true feelings towards her, Daphne finds herself falling in love with Niles in return, placing her in the position Niles had been in for many years: in love with someone unaware of her true feelings. Daphne realizes her feelings after a court-ordered therapy session stemming from an incident where Daphne caused a dangerous traffic jam by throwing a neighbor's laundry off Frasier's balcony; the therapist points out that the entire chain of events leading to the incident was set off by Daphne's decision to wear her \\"best dress\\" while giving Niles a cooking lesson. Heartbroken to discover that he had, on impulse, married his girlfriend Mel, Daphne intends to go ahead with her own marriage to Niles's divorce lawyer Donny Douglas (played by Saul Rubinek), until Frasier intervenes. In a four- part episode closing Season 7 and opening Season 8, Niles finally confesses his feelings to her, and although she initially tells him both of them are better off staying with their current partners (each having made a serious commitment), Daphne changes her mind by the next morning, abandoning Donny at the altar, to Niles' euphoria. Niles and Daphne have a precarious courtship during season 8 after Mel forbids Niles from being seen in public with Daphne, and Donny retaliates with a lawsuit for the being left at the altar after Frasier confesses to Donny that he was the instigator of the breakup. Tensions arise, with Daphne blaming Niles for all their new relationship problems. Shortly thereafter, she gains sixty pounds (4 stone 4 pounds), but Niles is so blinded by love that he doesn't notice until Daphne falls to the floor and is too heavy to get up without the help of Frasier, Niles, and Martin (who remarks that \\"it took three Cranes to lift her\\"). The weight problem was written into the show to allow Leeves to continue working while pregnant. Daphne then leaves for several weeks to attend a \\"spa for fat people\\" and returns with her figure restored. Her therapist at the spa tells her that she began over-eating to create distance between herself and Niles because she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to live up to Niles's lofty expectations after he spent the last seven years believing she was perfect (\\"Daphne Returns\\"). During the episode \\"It Takes Two to Tangle\\" in which she did not appear while at the resort, Niles tells Roz that Daphne had lost 9 pounds, 12 ounces (the weight of Leeves's baby in real life). At some point in Season 10, she becomes a U.S. citizen (her lack of citizenship having set up some humorous situations in earlier seasons). In the first episode of Season 10, Daphne and Niles marry in a small, private ceremony in Reno, Nevada. The rest of Season 10 and early Season 11 show Daphne and Niles adjusting to their new life as a wedded couple. Daphne and Niles have their first child, David, in the final episode of the series, \\"Goodnight, Seattle\\". (He is named after the show's co-creator David Angell who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks.) A flash-forward scene in an earlier episode reveals that the couple will have two daughters.  Family  Daphne grew up in a very large dysfunctional family. They are often the subject of her long-winded tales that sometimes leave the Cranes somewhat perplexed. Although they are frequently mentioned, the first time one of her family members appears on the show is in the season 7 episode \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", in which Donny surprises Daphne with a visit from her brother, Simon (Anthony LaPaglia), not knowing that she dislikes him. (Her favorite brother, Stephen, never appears until the final episode, where he is played by Richard E. Grant). In \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue\\", Daphne's mother makes her first appearance, while her father only makes his debut in season 9. In the episode \\"An Affair to Forget\\", she mentions she had an ancestor who served on HMS Bounty who took Fletcher Christian's side in the mutiny. According to her, he made it to Pitcairn Island with a Tahitian wife and had several children. Five out of Daphne's eight brothers appear on the show; few of them maintain consistency with Daphne's Northern accent. LaPaglia, an Australian actor, faked a Cockney accent playing Simon, while Robbie Coltrane, who is Scottish, played Daphne's brother Michael with a muddled Brummie (Birmingham) accent‚Äîwhich had a distinct Scottish lilt to it‚Äîexplained away by Niles as being a result of his being dropped as a baby. The effect is completed by his speech's being virtually unintelligible. Richard E Grant played Stephen Moon with an indeterminate accent somewhere between Received Pronunciation and Cockney. Her brother Billy is implied to be gay, such as in the episode \\"Daphne's Room\\", in which Daphne says her brothers would \\"sneak into the bathroom and peek at me in the shower ‚Ä¶ except for me brother Billy, the ballroom dancer. He never peeked at me, though he did peek at me brother Nigel.\\" When Daphne talks with her mom Gertrude about resuming her sex life with Niles after his heart surgery, Gertrude tells her to \\"use your feminine wiles ‚Äì that's how your brother Billy landed Kevin.\\" According to Daphne, Billy rejected the family's traditional fishing background by announcing that he \\"hated the smell of fish, and was going to teach ballroom dancing.\\" Daphne also has an uncle, Jackie, who lives in San Francisco.  Accent  One British television critic took aim at the adopted Manchester accent of Leeves, who grew up in West Sussex. Leeves claimed that the accent was tailored to imply that Daphne had come of age in Manchester but had since spent a great deal of time in the United States.

Abstract. He responded to the economic calculation problem proposed by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek by claiming that managers in a centrally-planned economy would be able to monitor supply and demand through increases and declines in inventories of goods, and advocated the nationalization of major industries. During his stay in the United States, Lange was an academic teacher and researcher in mathematical economics. Later in socialist Poland, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.Witold Gadomski, Rynek trzyma smycz [Gadomski o ksiƒÖ≈ºce Belki] (The market holds the leash [Gadomski about Belka's book]). 11 June 2016.

Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, Farbiarska 7 Street - place of birth I Lyceum in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, Lange's secondary school Career Lange was born in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki as son of the Protestant manufacturer Arthur Julius Lange and his wife Sophie Albertine Rosner. His ancestors had emigrated at the beginning of the 19th century from Germany to Poland.Who is Who in Central and East-Europe 1933/34 Z√ºrich 1935, referenced in: Beate Kosmala: Juden und Deutsche im polnischen Haus. Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki 1914‚Äì1939. Berlin 2001, p. 227. He studied law and economics at the University of Krak√≥w, where he defended a doctoral dissertation in 1928 under Adam Krzy≈ºanowski. From 1926 to 1927 Lange worked at the Ministry of Labor in Warsaw, and then was a research assistant at the University of Krak√≥w (1927‚Äì31). He married Irene Oderfeld in 1932. In 1934, a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship brought him to England, from where he emigrated to the United States in 1937. Lange became a professor at the University of Chicago in 1938 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1943.Halik Kochanski (2012). The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War, pp. 612‚Äì613. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. . Joseph Stalin, who identified Lange as a person of leftist and pro-Soviet sympathies, prevailed on President Franklin D. Roosevelt to obtain a passport for Lange to visit the Soviet Union in an official capacity, so that Stalin could speak with him personally; he also proposed offering him a position in the future Polish cabinet. The State Department was opposed to Lange traveling as an emissary because they felt that his political views represented neither Americans of Polish descent nor American public opinion in general. Lange's trip to the Soviet Union in 1944 caused further controversy, as the newly- establish Polish American Congress condemned him and defended the interests of the London-based Polish government-in-exile. Lange returned to the United States at the end of May and met, at Roosevelt's request, with Prime Minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk of the government-in-exile, who was on a visit in Washington. Lange stressed how reasonable Stalin was prepared to be (Stalin told him of the Soviet desire to preserve independent Poland under a coalition government), and asked the State Department to put pressure on the exiled Polish leadership to reach an understanding with the Soviet leader.Halik Kochanski (2012). The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War, pp. 441‚Äì444. Towards the end of World War II, Lange broke with the Polish government-in-exile and transferred his support to the Lublin Committee (PKWN) sponsored by the Soviet Union. Lange served as a go-between for Roosevelt and Stalin during the Yalta Conference discussions on post-war Poland. After the war ended in 1945, Lange returned to Poland. He then renounced his American citizenship and went back to the US in the same year as the Polish People's Republic's first ambassador to the United States. In 1946, Lange also served as Poland's delegate to the United Nations Security Council. From 1947 he lived in Poland. Oskar Lange worked for the Polish government while continuing his academic pursuits at the University of Warsaw and the Main School of Planning and Statistics. He was deputy chairman of the Polish Council of State in 1961‚Äì65, and as such one of four acting chairmen of the Council of State (a head of state function). Oskar Lange monument at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Economics Academic contributions The bulk of Lange's contributions to economics came during his American interlude of 1933‚Äì45. Despite being an ardent socialist, Lange deplored the Marxian labor theory of value because he was very much a believer in the neoclassical theory of price. In the history of economics, he is probably best known for his work On the Economic Theory of Socialism published in 1936, where he famously put Marxian economics and neoclassical economics together. In the book, Lange advocated the use of market tools (especially the neoclassical pricing theory) in economic planning of socialism and Marxism. He proposed that central planning boards set prices through \\"trial and error\\", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occur rather than relying on a free price mechanism. Under this system, central planners would arbitrarily pick a price for products manufactured in government factories and raise it or reduce, depending on whether it resulted in shortages or gluts. After this economic experiment had been run a few times, mathematical methods would be employed to plan the economy: if there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered.Dalmia, Shikha, 2012, Cheer Up, Liberty Lovers, Schumpeter Was Wrong, Reason, Feb. 23. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production in order to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. In Lange's opinion, such simulation of market mechanism would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. Proponents of this idea argued that it combines the advantages of a market economy with those of socialist economy. With the utilization of this idea, Lange claimed, a state- run economy would be at least as efficient as a capitalist or private market economy. He argued that this was possible, provided the government planners used the price system as if in a market economy and instructed state industry managers to respond parametrically to state-determined prices (minimize cost, etc.). Lange's argument was one of the pivots of the socialist calculation debate with the Austrian School economists. At that time, the view among English socialists of the Fabian Society was that Lange had won the debate. His works provided the earliest model of market socialism.Robin Hahnel, 2005.Economic Justice and Democracy, Routledge, page 170 Lange also made contributions in various other areas. He was one of the leading lights of the \\"Paretian Revival\\" in general equilibrium theory during the 1930s. In 1942, he provided one of the first proofs of the First and Second Welfare Theorems. He initiated the analysis of stability of general equilibrium (1942, 1944). His critique of the quantity theory of money (1942) prompted his student Don Patinkin to develop his remarkable \\"integration\\" of money into general equilibrium theory. Lange made several seminal contributions to the development of neoclassical synthesis (1938, 1943, 1944). He worked on integrating classical economics and neoclassical economics into a single theoretical structure (e.g. 1959). In his final years, Lange also worked on cybernetics and the use of computers for economic planning. The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded Oskar Lange an honorary fellowship in 1962.

It is located at Combe Fields in the Borough of Rugby, roughly midway between Coventry and Brinklow in the countryside of Warwickshire, England. The house's original grounds are now a country park known as Coombe Country Park and run by Coventry City Council. Early history as an abbey During the 12th century, the building was known as the Abbey of Cumbe, and was the largest and most influential monastery in Warwickshire.Coombe Abbey Hotel website. Online reference The land was given to the Cistercian monks by Richard de Camville, of Didleton Castle. They accepted the gift, and sent out an advance party of monks, who, living in temporary wooden buildings, began the building of a monastery dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. Among these monks was one called Martin who was to be the first Abbot of the new House which opened in 1150.Motkin, D. L. 1961 ‚ÄúThe Story of Coombe Abbey‚Äù. Online reference Numerous gifts of land were made to the monks during the four hundred years of their occupation and they owned land in many counties. In 1470 King Edward IV visited the Abbey. He was on his way from Leicester to Coventry, pursuing his enemy the Earl of Warwick in the Wars of the Roses and he rested awhile at Coombe.Motkin, D. L. 1961 \\"The Story of Coombe Abbey\\" \\"Monks Murder and Theft\\". Online reference The monastery was well known for its generosity in distributing gifts to the poor. Every Maundy Thursday, money, ten quarters of rye bread, three quarters of malt beer and 300 herrings were given to the poor at the abbey gate. The monks lost the Abbey in 1539 because of the dissolution of monasteries under Henry VIII. Since then numerous alterations and additions have been made over the centuries. However, some of the cloisters have been preserved and can still be seen in the present building.Warwickshire County Council website. Online reference Conversion to a private residence Princess Elizabeth After the Abbey had been seized in 1539 it was passed through numerous owners for the next forty years. In 1581 it came into the possession of Sir John Harington of Exton and he converted the abbey into one of the most substantial houses in the county.Parks and Gardens website. Online reference Harington was of Scottish descent, being a descendant of Robert Bruce. When James VI of Scotland became King of England, Harington used his ancestry to win favour. In 1603 James sent his daughter Princess Elizabeth to live at Coombe Abbey. The King issued a Privy Seal Order which declared \\"we have thought fit to commit the keeping and education of the Lady Elizabeth our daughter to Lord Harington and the Lady his wife\\". Elizabeth lived at the Abbey for the next five years. Her tutor and chaplain were Master John Tovey, the headmaster of the Free School at Coventry. Elizabeth's favourite childhood companion was Ann Dudley, a niece of Lord Harington, and with her, she formed a lasting friendship.Motkin, D. L. 1961 The Story of Coombe Abbey. Online reference In 1604 the famous Gunpowder Plot was conceived. It was planned that King James and his two sons were to be killed, leaving Princess Elizabeth as Queen. Elizabeth was to be kidnapped and a Catholic Regent appointed to rule the country in her minority, during which time she was to be married to a Catholic and educated in Catholicism. To ensure that she was unguarded at Coombe Abbey a hunting match to which Harington was invited, was arranged by the Catholic gentry to take place on the 6th of November 1605 at Dunchurch, only a few miles from Coombe. As the plotters marched to Coombe, Lord Harington received word of the rising that morning and had sent Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Holcroft into the walled city of Coventry. The Mayor and nine other citizens mounted guard, drawing bows, pikes and other weapons from the city armoury for this purpose. Thus, when the plotters arrived at Coombe they found Elizabeth gone and realising that they had been discovered they fled. Most of them were killed while trying to escape, but a few were captured and taken to London where they were executed.Motkin, D. L. 1961 The Story of Coombe Abbey. Online reference In 1613 Elizabeth married Frederick who later became King of Bohemia and she became the Queen. John Harrington died in 1613 and after several changes of ownership, the Abbey was bought in 1622 by Lady Elizabeth Craven widow of Sir William Craven, mayor of London who settled the property on her son. It remained in the Craven family for the next three hundred years.Coombe Abbey Hotel website.

The Abbey was passed through successive generations until 1769 when it became the home of William Craven, 6th Baron Craven. In 1771 he commissioned the famous landscaper Capability Brown to modernise the landscaping around the property. Brown was an expert at making serpentine lakes that looked like natural rivers. He dammed Smite Brook to create the main lake, Coombe Pool, and the smaller Top Pool.

Jackson, Robert Carlyle, Emily Mortimer, Ricky Tomlinson, Sean Pertwee, Rhys Ifans, Stephen Walters and Meat Loaf. The film follows the story of an American master chemist (Jackson) who heads to Britain to sell his formula for a powerful new drug. All does not go as planned and the chemist soon becomes entangled in a web of deceit. The film premiered in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2001. It was released internationally under the name Formula 51 in October 2002, where it grossed $14.4 million, just over half of the budget. Plot Alternate poster and title for the film The Fifty First State In 1971, a policeman catches Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a degree, smoking marijuana. Due to his arrest and conviction, he is unable to find work as a pharmacologist. In the present day, a drug lord called \\"the Lizard\\" calls a meeting of his colleagues, hoping to sell a new substance invented by Elmo. The meeting goes badly when Elmo, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's control, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Infuriated, the Lizard contacts Dakota, a contract killer, who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses the hit, but accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a $250,000 bonus. Felix DeSouza (based on a local tattooist), a local \\"fixer\\" in Liverpool has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organisation, to collect Elmo from Manchester airport, in exchange for two tickets to a sold-out football match between Liverpool and Manchester United. On route to the airport Felix enters a pub full of Manchester United supporters and goads them before letting off a rocket flare inside; the United fans give chase but his friends rescue him in their car. Elmo lands in Manchester, is collected by Felix and is taken to the meeting with Durant in Liverpool. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant's chemist, confirms Elmo's claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is $18 million short of the agreed payment, Elmo begins to leave. In a room across the street, Dakota is about to take a shot at Elmo's head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She switches rifles to an automatic weapon and kills everyone but Elmo and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, a gang of skinheads who want the drug surround them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane and his partner Arthur arrive on the scene and give chase. They are soon lured into a game of chicken by Elmo, who escapes. Kane and Arthur return to the crime scene and Kane demands 50% of Durant's deal with McElroy. A miscommunication leads to Durant's death. Felix contacts a gun dealing club owner and drug distributor named Iki, promising him the formula for ¬£20 million. As Elmo and Felix acquire the ingredients necessary for the drug's manufacture, all of which are over-the-counter products, the now-armed skinheads capture them. Elmo is unfazed, as the skinheads claim they have a lab, though it turns out to be a broken-into animal testing facility. Elmo makes two batches of the drug; one blue and one red. He claims that the red pill is the stronger version, and after he takes one, the skinheads try it. While they are partying, waiting for the effect of the drug, in the next room Elmo spits out his red pill. He tells Felix it is a powerful laxative; Elmo and Felix leave after throwing rolls of toilet paper to the incapacitated skinheads. At Iki's rave club, Elmo initiates his deal and delivers the drug to the waiting crowd. Kane and the police interrupt the deal and arrest Felix. When Dakota appears, she reveals that her real name is Dawn and that she and Felix were romantically involved. She captures Elmo and leaves with him via the roof. Elmo overpowers her, suspending her over the edge of the roof. Having no choice, she strikes a deal with him and they evade Kane. Meanwhile, Kane blackmails Felix during a police interrogation and forces himself into the deal with Iki, which Felix sets up for him. Felix, Elmo and Dawn meet Iki in a private viewing box at the football match at Anfield. This time, the deal is interrupted by the Lizard, who shoots Iki dead and demands the formula to POS 51. The Lizard celebrates with a drink, as Elmo reveals that the drug is a placebo and POS stands for Power of Suggestion. Kane interrupts them as Elmo's cocktail, an explosive ingested by the Lizard, takes effect, killing the Lizard and showering everyone in blood. Kane is knocked unconscious and arrested by Arthur, while the main three exit unscathed. Dawn and Felix give their relationship another chance, and Elmo purchases a castle once owned by the man who owned his ancestors. Cast Casting The DVD commentary reveals that the script was originally written with Laurence Fishburne in mind, sometime before Samuel L. Jackson became a star. Production Development Screenwriter Stel Pavlou came up with the idea for The 51st State in 1994 while studying at university in Liverpool and working in the kitchen's of The Brook Cafe at The Quiggins centre, loosely basing some of the characters on his friends. Pavlou described the idea of the film being based on Liverpool's history in the slave trade and transferring it to modern day in the form of the drug trade. Pavlou and his business partner Mark Aldridge showcased their idea at the Cannes Film Festival in France which led to film development company Focus Films offering funding for development. Soon the film caught the eye of Samuel L. Jackson, who eventually came on board as both a producer and star of the film. Originally Pavlou budgeted at around ¬£1 million and intended to direct it himself. Due to difficulty getting funding Pavlou stepped aside and took a co-producer credit while the matter was being resolved. After five years The 51st State was finally budgeted at $28 million, with financing coming from Canada and the UK via Alliance Atlantis and the Film Consortium. Pre-production Actor and film producer Samuel L. Jackson recommended Hong Kong director Ronny Yu to direct the film with belief that the film's overall style was suited to that of Yu's previous credits, such as his 1998 film Bride of Chucky. With the roles of Elmo McElroy (Samuel L. Jackson) and Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) both secured, producer Andras Hamori suggested Meat Loaf to play the antagonist. This was approved by director Yu, who called the idea a \\"truly inspired piece of casting\\". Filming =Locations= Almost all of the film was shot on location in LiverpoolSouthport Reporter apart from the opening scene which was shot in Los Angeles, a driving scene which was filmed in Manchester, and another scene which was filmed at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire. Major locations used in Liverpool included the River Mersey and docks, Pier Head, the India Building,Southport Reporter Water Street as well as Liverpool's's stadium Anfield. Other famous Liverpool landmarks can be seen throughout the film in the background such as St George's Hall and the Liver Building. Production designer Alan Macdonald used the film's production base in Boundary Street to build various sets for interior scenes, as well as a vast disused warehouse space in Blackstock Street. Release Home media The film was released on both VHS and DVD. The DVD version was released on 7 October 2002. Special features include an audio commentary, making-of and production featurettes, a photo gallery, trailer, and cast and crew interviews. Reception For its US release, the film was renamed Formula 51 as the original title was seen as potentially offensive to American audiences. The expression 51st state, in this context, refers to US dominance over Britain. Critical reception On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 25% based on reviews from 102 critics, with an average rating of 4.3/10, and the consensus reading: \\"Filled with profanities, Formula 51 is a stylized and incoherent mess that doesn't add up to much.\\" On Metacritic, the film gained a 23 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper called the film \\"a farce\\", giving the film one out of four stars, and particularly negative comments on the film's content and script. Generally positive reviews were given by both BBC and Empire reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter calling it \\"full-on fun\\" and that the film \\"goes beyond the boundaries\\" of British films. IGN.com also gave the film a generally positive review, concluding that \\"you get exactly what you pay for\\" and that the film was overall very \\"enjoyable\\". Box office The film had its world premiere on 7 December 2001, in London's West End Curzon Cinema. In total, the film earned over $14.4 million at the worldwide box office, $5.2 million of that in the US and $9.2 million elsewhere. Soundtrack The soundtrack was written by Darius Kedros, Caspar Kedros and Barney Quinton under the band name Headrillaz, and also featured artists such as PJ Harvey, Run‚ÄìD.M.C., Nelly and Stephen Day.

Chim was known for his images from the Spanish Civil War, for co-founding Magnum Photos with Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and George Rodger, and for his project \\"Children of War\\" with UNICEF that captured the plight of children in the aftermath of World War II. He became president of Magnum after Capa's death in 1954 and held this post until his own death in 1956 by Egyptian machinegun fire in the aftermath of the Suez crisis. Early life Chim was born to Polish Jewish parents in Warsaw in 1911. David had a sister, Eileen, who was three years older. Their parents were Regina and Benjamin Szymin, a respected publisher of Yiddish and Hebrew books. In 1914 Chim and his parents emigrated to Odessa just as World War I had begun. In 1919 they returned to Warsaw. Chim studied graphic arts in Leipzig and then traveled to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. Career A Disturbed Child in a Warsaw Orphanage, 1948, by Chim. Identified as Teresa Adwentowska by a pair of Polish researchers. It was while Chim was studying at the Sorbonne in Paris that he became interested in photography. He began working as a freelance journalist in 1933. His first \\"credited\\" published photograph appeared in 1934 in the magazine Regards. Between 1936 and 1938 Chim covered the Spanish Civil War (alongside colleague Robert Capa) and other international political events. In February 1935 Chim was sent to Spain by Regards to report on crucial issues there. Twenty five of his stories on Spain ended up being published in Regards. In 1939 he covered the Loyalist Spanish war refugees on the S.S. Sinaia to Mexico and then later in the year he arrived in the United States. Chim was in New York City when World War II broke out in Europe when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Chim's birthplace. In 1940 he enlisted in the United States Army, serving in Europe as a photo interpreter during the war. In 1942 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, the same year that his parents were killed by the Nazis. Chim photographed for Life, along with Look, Paris-Match and Regards. In 1948 he received a commission through UNICEF and traveled to Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Germany to document the plight of World War II refugee children. Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, said: > Chim's heart had always gone out to children, and they reacted to him with > complete acceptance. They seemed oblivious of him, but he noticed every > little movement, every little pain, every little pleasure. There is no > artifice, no bravura of lighting expertise in Chim's photographs of the > children. They speak simply from his pictures, as if alive. This > intellectual, so adept at analyzing the most complex political situations, > so comfortable photographing heads of state, produced his greatest > photographs to help children in need. Between 1949 and 1955 Chim travelled extensively throughout Europe and Israel, fulfilling assignments for major publications in Europe and the United States. Edward Steichen included his imagery, including his simple but eloquent picture of the worn hands of an older worker clutching a dip-pen to practice the letter 'a', in MoMA's 1955 world-touring The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors. Magnum Photos In 1947, Chim co-founded the Magnum Photos photography cooperative, together with Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom he had befriended in Paris in the 1930s. As Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, stated: > Photojournalism was about to enter a golden decade. Television was not yet > available to broadcast world events, and editors and the public were eager > for news, from which they had been cut off during the fascist years and war > years. After Capa's death in 1954, Chim became president of Magnum Photos. He held that post until his death on November 10, 1956. Death On November 10, 1956, Chim was killed while driving to photograph an exchange of wounded soldiers at El Quantara (along with French photographer Jean Roy) by Egyptian machinegun fire four days after the armistice of the 1956 Suez Crisis, ten days before his 45th birthday.

He also led two Roberts Commissions, the first of which investigated the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the second of which focused on works of cultural value during World War II. Born in Philadelphia, Roberts graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and pursued a legal career. After working as a district attorney in Philadelphia, he was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to investigate the Teapot Dome scandal. After the death of Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford in March 1930, President Hoover nominated John J. Parker to fill the vacancy on the court. The Senate rejected Parker and Hoover quickly nominated Roberts as his second choice for the vacancy. Roberts was easily confirmed and took his position on the court in May 1930. On the Hughes Court, Roberts was a swing vote positioned between the conservative Four Horsemen and the liberal Three Musketeers. Along with Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Roberts's vote often decided whether President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation would be upheld. His decision to uphold the constitutionality of a state minimum wage law in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish has been called \\"the switch in time that saved nine.\\" That term references the decision's possible role in the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have expanded the Supreme Court and thus allowed Roosevelt to appoint Justices more sympathetic to his policies. Roberts's motivation for upholding the constitutionality of the New Deal and his role in the defeat of the bill remains a matter of debate. Though the bill was defeated, Roosevelt's long presidency allowed him to appoint most of the court. By the end of Roberts's tenure, he was the lone Supreme Court Justice who was not appointed by Roosevelt. He was one of three Justices to vote against Roosevelt's orders for Japanese American internment camps in Korematsu v. United States as well as the lone judge to dissent in the case of Smith v. Allwright, which ruled white primaries unconstitutional. His relations with his colleagues on the Stone Court became strained and he retired in 1945. Roberts served as the Dean of his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1948 to 1951. He died in Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1955. Early life and career Roberts was born in Philadelphia and attended Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa SocietySupreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members , Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009 and was the editor of The Daily Pennsylvanian. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1895 and went on to graduate at the top of his class from University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1898. On March 1, 1912, Roberts and fellow Philadelphia lawyers William W. Montgomery, Jr. and Charles L. McKeehan, founded the law firm Roberts, Montgomery & McKeehan, the predecessor of the law firm Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads, LLP.https://www.mmwr.com/about-montgomery-mccracken/our-history/ He first gained notice as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia. He was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to investigate oil reserve scandals, known as the Teapot Dome scandal. This led to the prosecution and conviction of Albert B. Fall, the former Secretary of the Interior, for bribe-taking. Supreme Court Roberts was appointed to the Supreme Court by Herbert Hoover after Hoover's nomination of John J. Parker was defeated by the Senate. On the Court, Roberts was a swing vote between those, led by Justices Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan Fiske Stone, as well as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who would allow a broader interpretation of the Commerce Clause to allow Congress to pass New Deal legislation that would provide for a more active federal role in the national economy, and the Four Horsemen (Justices James Clark McReynolds, Pierce Butler, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter) who favored a narrower interpretation of the Commerce Clause and believed that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause protected a strong \\"liberty of contract.\\" In 1936's United States v. Butler, Roberts sided with the Four Horsemen and wrote an opinion striking down the Agricultural Adjustment Act as beyond Congress's taxing and spending powers. \\"Switch in Time that Saved Nine\\" Roberts switched his position on the constitutionality of the New Deal in late 1936, and the Supreme Court handed down West Coast Hotel v. Parrish in 1937, upholding the constitutionality of minimum wage laws. Subsequently, the Court would vote to uphold all New Deal programs. Since President Roosevelt's plan to appoint several new justices as part of his \\"Court-packing\\" plan of 1937 coincided with the Court's favorable decision in Parrish, many people called Roberts's vote in that case \\"The switch in time that saved nine,\\" although Roberts's vote in Parrish occurred several months before announcement of the Court-packing plan. While Roberts is often accused of inconsistency in his jurisprudential stance towards the New Deal, legal scholars note that he had previously argued for a broad interpretation of government power in the 1934 case of Nebbia v. New York, and so his later vote in Parrish was not a complete reversal. Roberts, however, had sided with the four conservative justices in finding a similar state minimum wage in New York unconstitutional in June 1936. Because the announcement of the Parrish decision took place in March 1937, one month after Roosevelt announced his plan to pack the court, it created speculation that Roberts had voted in favor of the Washington's state minimum wage law because he had succumbed to political pressure. However, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes contended in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt's attempt to pack the court \\"had not the slightest effect\\" on the court's ruling in the Parrish case and records showed that Roberts indicated his desire to uphold Washington state's minimum wage law two months prior to Roosevelt's court- packing announcement in December 1936. On December 19, 1936, two days after oral arguments ended for the Parrish case, Roberts voted in favor of Washington's state minimum wage law, but the Supreme Court was divided 4‚Äì4 because pro-New Deal Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone was absent due to an illness; Hughes contended that this long delay in the Parrish case's announcement led to false speculation that Roosevelt's court packing plan intimidated the court into ruling in favor of the New Deal. Roberts and Hughes both acknowledged that because of the overwhelming support that had been shown for the New Deal through Roosevelt's re-election in November 1936, Hughes was able to persuade Roberts to no longer base his votes on his own political beliefs and side with him during future votes on New Deal related policies In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt's re-election forced the court to depart from \\"its fortress in public opinion\\" and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on personal or political beliefs. Other rulings and Roberts Commissions Roberts wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case of New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., , which safeguarded the right to boycott in the context of the struggle by African Americans against discriminatory hiring practices. He also wrote the majority opinion sustaining provisions of the second Agricultural Adjustment Act applied to the marketing of tobacco in Mulford v. Smith, . Roberts was appointed by Roosevelt to head the commission investigating the attack on Pearl Harbor; his report was published in 1942 and was highly critical of the US military. An antiwar journalist, John T. Flynn, wrote at the time that Roosevelt's appointment of RobertsFlynn, John. \\"The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor\\" (October 1945) > was a master stroke. What the public overlooked was that Roberts had been > one of the most clamorous among those screaming for an open declaration of > war. He had doffed his robes, taken to the platform in his frantic > apprehensions and demanded that we immediately unite with Great Britain in a > single nation. The Pearl Harbor incident had given him what he had been > yelling for ‚Äì America's entrance into the war. On the war issue he was one > of the President's most impressive allies. Now he had his wish. He could be > depended on not to cast any stain upon it in its infancy. Perhaps influenced by his work on the Pearl Harbor commission, Roberts dissented from the Court's decision upholding internment of Japanese-Americans along the West Coast in 1944's Korematsu v. United States. The second Roberts Commission was established in 1943 to consolidate earlier efforts on a national basis with the US Army to help protect monuments, fine arts, and archives in war zones.Roberts Commission, Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art webpage. Retrieved 2013-05-30. The commission ran until 1946, when its activities were consolidated into the State Department Roberts also played a key role in the creation of the OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) which investigated and documented Nazi plunder networks in Europe. In his later years on the bench, Roberts was the only Justice on the Supreme Court who was not appointed (or, in the case of Stone, who had become Chief Justice, promoted) by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roberts became frustrated with the willingness of the new justices to overturn precedent and with what he saw as their result-oriented liberalism as judges. Roberts dissented bitterly in the 1944 case of Smith v. Allwright, which found the white primary unconstitutional and overruled an opinion that had been written 19 years earlier by Roberts himself. He coined in that dissent the oft-quoted phrase that the frequent overruling of decisions \\"tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.\\" Retirement Roberts retired from the Court the following year, in 1945; Roberts's relations with his colleagues had become so strained that fellow Justice Hugo Black refused to sign the customary letter acknowledging Roberts's service on his retirement. Other justices refused to sign a modified letter that would have been acceptable to Black, and in the end, no letter was ever sent. Shortly after leaving the Court, Roberts reportedly burned all of his legal and judicial papers. As a result, there is no significant collection of Roberts' manuscript papers, as there is for most other modern Justices. Roberts did prepare a short memorandum discussing his alleged change of stance around the time of the court-packing effort, which he left in the hands of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Later life While in retirement Roberts, along with Robert P. Bass, convened the Dublin Declaration, a plan to change the U.N. General Assembly into a world legislature with \\"limited but definite and adequate power for the prevention of war.\\"S.Doc.107-3 Authority and Rules of Senate Committees, 2001‚Äì2002 Roberts served as the Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1948 to 1951. He died at his Chester County, Pennsylvania, farm known as the Strickland-Roberts Homestead after a four-month illness.

In addition, a school district near Pottstown, Pennsylvania, the Owen J. Roberts School District, was named after him. In 1946, Roberts was the first layperson elected to serve as President of the House of Deputies for the General Convention of the Episcopal Church (United States).

[T]hose gorgeous gory newsstand spreads ...\\" After serving as editor of his high-school yearbook, for which he did cartoons and illustration, and working a number of odd jobs including \\"soda jerk, street repairman, tie designer, exercise boy on the race track circuit, etc.,\\" he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, in late summer 1954, studying two nights a week for three months under Jerry Warshaw for \\"the total of my entire formal art training.\\" His first formal commission \\"was something like a bank ad or a tie design when I was still in my teens.\\"The Collector, p. 41 He joined the city's Feldkamp-Malloy art studio, later being fired. Feeling encouraged by a meeting with comic-strip artist Allen Saunders, Morrow submitted strip samples to various syndicates with no luck. Undaunted, he moved to New York City in winter 1955 and by the following spring had met fellow young comics artists Al Williamson, Angelo Torres, and Wally Wood. He sold his first comic-book story, a romance tale, to Toby Press, which went out of business before it could be published. Morrow next did two stories for another company -- a Western with original characters and an adaptation of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard's \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\", but this company, too, went defunct. He then worked for Williamson and Wood doing backgrounds and layouts, and through Williamson began contributing to Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics,Roach, Cooke, p. 73 drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories plus at least four Westerns and one war story on titles cover-dated July 1956 to June 1957.Gray Morrow at the Grand Comics Database Gray illustrated several stories for EC Comics in the 1950s, including horror, suspense and science fiction. He later did covers and stories for the company's New Trend comics and Picto-Fiction magazines. In late 1956, Morrow was drafted into the U.S. Army. Stationed at Incheon and Wolmido Island, South Korea, with Fox Company, he did \\"illustrations and paintings for the officers' club, day rooms, insignias on helmets for their parades ... you know, anything and everything. That was my official duty.\\" After being discharged in 1958, \\"My friend Angelo Torres took me around to a couple of his clients, one being 'Classics' [i.e., the Gilberton Company, publisher of the Classics Illustrated comic-book series of literary adaptations], and I was given a script. One thing led to another and I was soon working on a regular basis. Prior to his Gilberton stint, Morrow contributed to one of the first black-and-white horror-comics magazines, the Joe Simon-edited Eerie Tales #1 (Nov. 1959) from Hastings Associates, penciling and inking two four-page stories by an unknown writer, \\"The Stalker\\" and \\"Burn!\\" 1960s to 1970s In the early 1960s, Morrow anonymously illustrated three literary adaptations for Classics Illustrated: The Octopus by Frank Norris (#159, Nov. 1960); Master of the World by Jules Verne (#163, July 1961); and The Queen's Necklace by Alexandre Dumas (#165, Jan. 1962),Jones, pp. 333, 334. which he said he penciled and inked at the rate of \\"eight pages a day ... as fast as I've ever been able to go\\" since \\"I'd moved to California and needed those checks badly.\\"Jones, p. 221. Morrow also supplied drawings for chapters in Classics Illustrated Special Issue #159A, Rockets, Jets and Missiles (Dec. 1960), and in 13 World Around Us issues ranging from Prehistoric Animals (Nov. 1959) to Famous Teens (May 1961).Jones, pp. 343, 346-348. One of those, #W28, Whaling (Dec. 1960), resulted in unexpected controversy when he accurately depicted African-American whalers: In the end, the problematic chapter, \\"The Long Voyage\\", retained what one comics historian called \\"a respectable number of African-American whalemen.\\" Morrow, however, recalled, \\"[T]hey had me make them all white. I had to change their features.\\" Concurrently, Morrow also illustrated entries in the Bobbs- Merrill juvenile book series \\"Childhood of Famous Americans\\", continuing with that publisher after Gilberton ceased production of new titles.

He also painted four horror covers for Warren. For competitor Skywald Publications, he drew the eight-page \\"The Skin And Bones Syndrome\\" for Psycho #1 (Jan. 1971), and co-created the muck-monster Man-Thing, with writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, in Marvel Comics' first entry into the adult-oriented comics-magazine market, the black-and-white Savage Tales #1 (May 1971). Gray Morrow by thumb By 1970, Morrow was married to Betty Morrow, who wrote a story he drew, \\"The Journey\\", in the early independent comic witzend #7 (1970).Roach, Cooke, p. 74 That same year he returned to color comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories for DC Comics' Witching Hour, House of Secrets and House of Mystery, as well as a smattering of romance and superhero tales. He also drew Western stories, and with writer Robert Kanigher co-created the Old West vigilante El Diablo in All-Star Western #2 (Oct. 1970). He did a small amount of work for Marvel during this time, with the cover and a romance story for My Love #14 (Nov. 1971), a Man-Thing cover and story in Adventure into Fear #10 (Oct. 1972), two \\"Gullivar Jones, Warrior of Mars\\" stories in Creatures on the Loose #20-21 (Nov. 1972 - Jan. 1973), and virtually his only Marvel superhero story, a 10-page Falcon feature in Captain America #144 (Dec. 1971). By 1973, Morrow had served as an uncredited ghost artist or art assistant on the syndicated comic strips Rip Kirby by John Prentice, Secret Agent X-9 by Al Williamson and Big Ben Bolt by John Cullen Murphy. He took over the Buck Rogers strip in 1979 and the Tarzan Sunday strip from 1983 to 2001. He recalled trying out for Prince Valiant, saying he provided a sample \\"when [strip creator] Hal Foster decided to go into semi-retirement. It was done in August and published in October or November of '71. It was done as a sample when Foster interviewed [me] and a couple of others (Wally Wood and John Cullen Murphy) to take over.\\"The Collector, p. 43 Through 1974 and early 1975, he edited and frequently drew stories for Archie Comics' imprint of non-teen-humor titles, Red Circle Comics, including Chilling Adventures in Sorcery, its successor Red Circle Sorcery, and the single-issue The Super Cops, based on two real-life New York City Police Department detectives. Following this, he specialized in covers and stories for such black-and-white Marvel magazines as Masters of Terror, Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction and Marvel Preview. Afterward, through 1976, he was art director of Charlton Comics' black-and-white magazine Space: 1999, based on the TV series of that name.

In addition to comics, Morrow in the 1960s and 1970s was an illustrator for many science-fiction magazines, with examples of his work gracing most of the covers of the American version of the Perry Rhodan paperback-book series. He also did the illustrations for the original Galaxy Science Fiction publication of the Hugo-winning novella Soldier, Ask Not by Gordon R. Dickson.

In 1836, Marcus Whitman led an overland party by wagon to the West. He and his wife, Narcissa, along with Reverend Henry Spalding and his wife, Eliza, and William Gray, founded a mission at present day Walla Walla, Washington in an effort to convert local Indians to Christianity. In the winter of 1842 Whitman returned east, returning the following summer with the first large wagon train across the Oregon Trail. The new settlers encroached on the Cayuse Indians living near the Whitman Mission and were unsuccessful in their efforts to Christianize the Tribe. Following the deaths of many nearby Cayuse from an outbreak of measles, some remaining Cayuse accused Whitman of murder, suggesting that he had administered poison and was a failed shaman. In retaliation, a group of Cayuse killed the Whitmans and twelve other settlers on November 30, 1847, an event that came to be known as the Whitman Massacre. Continuing warfare between settlers and Indians reduced the Cayuse numbers further. Early life On September 4, 1802, Whitman was born in Federal Hollow, New York to Beza and Alice Whitman. After Beza's death when Whitman was seven, he was sent to Massachusetts to live with his uncle.National Park Service: Biography of Marcus Whitman Whitman dreamed of becoming a minister but did not have the money for such schooling. He returned to New York as a young man. He studied medicine for two years with an experienced physician under the form of apprenticeship approved then, and received his degree from Fairfield Medical College in New York. He practiced medicine for a few years in Canada but was interested in going to the west. Missionary In 1835, Whitman traveled with the missionary Samuel Parker to present-day northwestern Montana and northern Idaho, to minister to bands of the Flathead and Nez Perce nations. During this journey, he treated several fur trappers during an outbreak of cholera. At the end of their stay, he promised the Nez Perce that he would return with other missionaries and teachers to live with them. Narcissa Whitman Marriage and family In 1836, Whitman married Narcissa Prentiss, a teacher of physics and chemistry. She had also been eager to travel west as a missionary, but she had been unable to do so as a single woman. They had one daughter, Alice Clarissa, born On March 14, 1837, the first Anglo-American child born in Oregon Country. She was named after her grandmothers. She drowned in the Walla Walla River at age two.Allen, Opal Sweazea. Narcissa Whitman: An Historical Biography, Binfords & Mort, 1959 As settlers came in increasing numbers, the Whitmans took in eleven orphaned children, including the adoption of the Sager orphans. They also established a kind of boarding school for settlers' children at their mission. The way west On May 25, 1836, the Whitmans, and a group of other missionaries including Henry and Eliza Spalding, joined a caravan of fur traders and traveled west. The fur company caravan was led by the mountain men Milton Sublette and Thomas Fitzpatrick. The fur traders had seven covered wagons, each pulled by six mules. An additional cart drawn by two mules carried Milton Sublette, who had lost a leg a year earlier and walked on a \\"cork\\" one made by a friend. The combined group arrived at the fur-traders' annual rendezvous on July 6. The group established several missions as well as Whitman's settlement at a Cayuse settlement called Waiilatpu (Why-ee-laht-poo) in the Cayuse language, meaning \\"place of the rye grass\\". It was located just west of the northern end of the Blue Mountains. The present-day city of Walla Walla, Washington developed six miles to the east. The settlement was in the territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce tribes. Whitman farmed and provided medical care, while Narcissa set up a school for the Native American children. In 1842, Whitman traveled east, and on his return, he accompanied the first large group of wagon trains west. His alleged political influence over the United States' claim to the Oregon country, as well as his purported leadership role in the emigration, were greatly exaggerated in the decades following his death, leading to great controversy in popular and academic literature.Review: Acquisition of Oregon and the long suppressed evidence about Marcus Whitman by Leslie M. Scott in the Oregon Historical Quarterly (1912). Known as the \\"Great Emigration\\", the 1843 expedition established the viability of the Oregon Trail for later homesteaders. Not having much success with converting the Cayuse, the Whitmans gave more attention to the settlers. They took in children to their own home and established a boarding school for settlers' children. Massacre Marcus Whitman's grave in Walla WallaThe Cayuse resented the encroachment of white settlers. More significantly, the influx of settlers in the territory brought new infectious diseases to the Indian Tribes, including a severe epidemic of measles in 1847. The Native Americans lack of immunity to Eurasian diseases resulted in high death rates, with children dying in large numbers. The Whitmans cared for both Cayuse and white settlers, but half of the Cayuse died and nearly all the Cayuse children perished. Seeing that more whites had survived, the Cayuse blamed the Whitmans for the devastating deaths among their people.The West: \\"Marcus & Narcissa Whitman\\", 2001, PBS, accessed 30 April 2012 The Cayuse tradition held medicine men personally responsible for the patient's recovery. Their despair at the deaths, especially of their children, led the Cayuse under Chief Tiloukaikt to kill the Whitmans in their home on November 29, 1847. Warriors destroyed most of the buildings at Waiilatpu and killed twelve other white settlers in the community. The events became known among white settlers as the Whitman Massacre. The Cayuse held another 53 women and children captive for a month before releasing them through negotiations. These events, and continued white encroachment, triggered a continuing conflict between the settlers and the Cayuse that became known as the Cayuse War. Historians have noted contemporary accounts of competition between the Protestant missionaries and Catholic priests, who had become established with Jesuit missions from Canada and St. Louis, Missouri, as contributing to the tensions. The Roman Catholic priest John Baptiste Brouillet aided the survivors and helped bury the victims. Two days later Brouillet encountered Rev. Henry H. Spalding on his way to the Whitman's, told him what had happened, and warned him that he might be in danger.Drury, Clifford Merrill. Henry Harmon Spalding, Caldwell, Idaho. The Caxton Prnters Ltd. 1936. p. 337 Spalding later wrote a pamphlet stating forcefully that the Catholic priests, including Father Brouillet, had incited the Cayuse to massacre. Spalding's version of the disaster was printed and reprinted, sometimes at taxpayer expense, for the next half-century. It was finally discredited in 1901 by Yale University historian Edward Gaylord Bourne.\\"Edward Gaylord Bourne, \\"The Legend of Marcus Whitman\\", American Historical Review of January 1901.History of the Catholic Sentinel, official website Legacy Marcus Whitman, National Statuary Hall Collection, US Capitol Whitman is commemorated by Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest, Mount Rainier's Whitman Glacier, and numerous schools, including Marcus Whitman Middle School in Port Orchard, Washington; Marcus Whitman Junior High School in Seattle, Washington; and Marcus Whitman Central School in Rushville, New York, his hometown.

As a rail and highway junction, Fresnillo is the center of a rich mining area known especially for silver, and the location of one of the world's richest silver mines, the Mina Proa√±o or Fresnillo Mine, which belongs to the Pe√±oles mining company. It has a mining school, and agriculture (cereals, beans) and cattle raising are other important economic activities. Fresnillo is also the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name which surrounds it. The municipality had a population of 196,538 and an areal extent of . It is the location of religious pilgrimages to see the famous Santo Ni√±o de Atocha (\\"Holy Child of Atocha\\"), a Roman Catholic devotional statue brought to Mexico from Spain.  History  Between 1551 and 1552, Diego Fern√°ndez de Proa√±o embarked on several explorations in the Zacatecas region, searching for a legendary hill purported to contain great mineral wealth. He discovered a hill, which despite not matching the descriptions given, bore evidence of rich mineral deposits, which he named \\"Cerro de Proa√±o\\" (\\"Proa√±o's Hill\\"). He returned to the city of Zacatecas to report his findings to the Viceroy, but apparently there was not much interest in his discovery and Proa√±o's Hill was forgotten over the years. A second expedition, headed by 15-year-old Francisco de Ibarra, arrived on September 2, 1554 at a place where there was a freshwater spring, in whose border was a \\"Peque√±o Fresno\\" (small ash). They decided to spend the night, and Francisco de Ibarra wrote his name for the place in his daily journal: \\"Ojo de Agua del Fresnillo (spring of the small ash)\\". In the early years after its foundation, the town suffered incursions by Guachichil Indians who were nomadic and bellicose. Due to the heavy losses suffered by the settlers in those early years, the Viceroy, Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almanza, ordered the construction of a presidio in the town. Boner Captain Rodrigo R√≠o de Loza was assigned to lead the garrison of eight soldiers. The military outpost was built where the current municipal palace stands today. Among the first mayors of Fresnillo were Captain Diego N√∫√±ez de Miranda, Crist√≥bal Caldera and Juan de Avellaneda. Between 1682 and 1757, the mines were worked constantly. There were several mines, mostly on the foothills of Proa√±o's Hill. In 1757, the mine shafts had reached fifty meters in depth and flooding began to be a major problem. The mines were abandoned as it was economically unviable to mitigate the flooding and the area went into an economic crisis. The mine owners lost their mines as a result of seizure by the Spanish Crown for failure to repay loans. The Crown named a new administrator for the mines, but they continued to lie idle. In 2013, Fresnillo became the first municipality in Mexican history to elect an openly gay mayor, with the election of Benjam√≠n Medrano.\\"Mexico's 1st Openly Gay Mayor Elected\\". ABC News, July 18, 2013. Climate The Coat of Arms of Fresnillo In the superior part of the shield is the Latin phrase: \\"Orat Atque Laborat Ab Urbe Condita\\", which means: \\"Since its Founding a City that Works and Prays.\\" The lower part reads, \\"Real de Minas del Fresnillo (Royal Mine of Fresnillo).\\" In the center the horizontal bar reads: \\"2 de Septiembre de 1554.\\" The coat of arms is divided into three boxes: first in the left superior part, there appears the Virgin of Candlemas, Pattern of Fresnillo, which is identified by the candle in her right hand. In the box on the right superior part, there is a rodela or shield and the arms used by the natives and the Spaniards during the Conquest. In the inferior part (the third box) there appears a spring, in whose margin there is an Ash tree, and a depiction of the bottom of the Proa√±o Hill with some clouds, symbolizing the rainy month of September. \\"2 of September of 1554\\". Plateros Fresnillo, Zacatecas is often connected with Plateros, a central church which attracts many religious followers to the area. The church was built in the late 1690s in commemoration of Spanish miners finding a miraculous silver crucifix. The crucifix is said to have appeared in a wooden crate without knowledge of its creation. Spiritual devotion and respect resulted in the cross-Atlantic travel of a statue of the Our Lady of Atocha. The statue has the Virgin Mary carrying an infant Jesus in her arms. This infant statue became known as the Holy Child of Atocha. Many claim that miracles result from the devout prayer to this Holy Child. Those who truly believe that the Holy Child worked in their favor will often bring back a gift in gratitude. In 1883, a separate building was constructed to house the various gifts followers brought back to him. Today, many families who have religious connections to this saint will travel far in pilgrimage and attend mass as they visit the shrine. The saint itself is said to be a Zacatecas iconic piece, as well as a guardian of miners. Agriculture Agriculture in Fresnillo, Zacatecas Agriculture is of great importance. The city is a great producer of various crops, including corn, pepper, tomato, among others. The neighboring towns and villages will focus on exporting its goods to the main city, as well as others. Economic sustainability is often connected to its agricultural success, along with silver mining. Regional Fair of Fresnillo In commemoration of the discovery of the city in the month of September in 1954, the city is home to a large celebration which celebrates culture and the arts. People from all over the world come to Fresnillo to celebrate, bringing along traditions native to their home countries. Many will choose to participate in the folkloric dances and athletic competitions. In 2004, Fresnillo celebrated the 450th year of its establishment.
