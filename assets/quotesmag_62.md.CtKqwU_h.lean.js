Dutkiewicz in 1983, which provides palliative care for the terminally ill. History Father E. Dutkiewicz SAC Hospice (formerly: Pallottinum Hospice) was established in Gda≈Ñsk in 1983 on the initiative of the Catholic Church, local medical staff and groups of volunteers. The founding movement was led by the Pallottine priest Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz, one of the pioneers of the concept of hospice care in Poland. In 1987, the Polish Episcopate appointed Fr Dutkiewicz the National Chaplain of Hospices in Poland in recognition of his active service for the development of hospice movement. Since it was established, the Hospice in Gda≈Ñsk dynamically expanded its range of charitable activities. In 1991, The Regional Center of Palliative and Hospice Care (Wojew√≥dzki O≈õrodek Opieki Paliatywnej i Hospicyjnej) was founded, which is in charge of palliative care in Gda≈Ñsk. The Center also provides consultations in palliative medicine for the whole Pomeranian region. After Dutkiewicz's death in 2002, the Pallottine priest Piotr Krakowiak, PhD, became the new director of the Hospice and was appointed the National Chaplain of Hospices in Poland in the same year. In 2003, the hospice house was created, which offers help to the most needy patients. June 2003 saw the opening of the hospice ward for terminally ill children, which is the first hospice ward for adolescent patients in Pomeranian region. In 2004, on the initiative of Fr Krakowiak, The Hospice Foundation (Fundacja Hospicyjna) was established. The foundation conducts charitable and educational activities throughout Poland, raising funds for more than a hundred of Polish hospices. In January 2004, the Hospice obtained a new statute and assumed a new name in honour of its founder ‚Äì the present name of the Hospice is: Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz SAC Hospice (Hospicjum im. Ks. Eugeniusza Dutkiewicza SAC). Hospice Services The Hospice offers two models of palliative care ‚Äï stationary hospice at a residence and home hospice, providing specialised care at a patient‚Äôs home. Both approaches are meant not only for adults but also for children. The first form of help is aimed at the terminally ill patients whose families are unable to deliver constant care. The hospice residence provides thirty beds in rooms with separate sanitary fittings. The patients are entitled to stay at the stationary hospice for a long time; however, it is also possible to admit a patient for a shorter period ‚Äï until 10 days. The philosophy of the home hospice consists in the co-operation of an interdisciplinary health care team with a patient's family. This model of help comprises personnel's visits at a patient's place of residence and provides specialised medical equipment, medicines and dressings. Irrespective of the model of the care delivered, the hospice offers twenty-four-hour access to help ‚Äï also on Saturdays and Sundays. The hospice conducts necessary laboratory tests and tests with the use of specialised equipment. The palliative care team includes physicians, nurses, therapists, specialists carrying out rehabilitation, clergymen and charity workers. Apart from the standard services, the Pediatric Ward organises games for the youngest patients, with the help of the volunteers. Additional services What is more, next to the palliative care centre, functions the so-called Academy to Fight Against Cancer, which offers relaxation techniques workshop hosted by a trained professional. The main objective of creating such therapeutic classes is to provide psychological support to those who are wrestling with stress and suffering from recurring states of depression, the two disturbances often associated with the illness discussed. A Palliative Care and Pain Therapy Outpatient Clinic has been established in the hospice house so as to deal with patients in the final stage of their disease. The clinic is intended to be visited by patients from Gda≈Ñsk and its environs who had completed casual treatment in hospital. There is also a new initiative that has been born among the hospice team ‚Äì the bereavement support groups for grieving persons. The workshop is hosted by an experienced therapist and aims at helping to endure the loss of a loved person. The participants of the workshop share the experience of loss and honour their relationships with their loved ones in an atmosphere of trust and openness. It is worth mentioning that during their patients' difficult days, the hospice team strive to be with them and their kin, helping to alleviate their suffering also through common prayer. One can attend a special mass held every day in the hospice chapel in the intention of the ill. Voluntary Service Medical Voluntary Service The primary purpose of Gda≈Ñsk hospice is to focus on the palliation of patients in the terminal phase of their illness. The professional medical team, i.e. doctors and nurses, additionally aided by both clergymen and volunteers, strive to improve quality of life for people facing this difficult period of their existence. Medical volunteers provide services to the ailing and their families not only in the stationary residence, but in patients' private homes as well. Some main examples of volunteers' duties are: providing assistance with personal care such as bathing, doing light housekeeping for the patients and their families, and being a comforting and supportive presence. Charity Campaigns In addition to the medical voluntary service, Gda≈Ñsk Hospice is also the organiser of various campaigns, both local and national. The aim of those is to help the ill and dying, as well as to popularise the hospice idea in society. One of such campaigns is the WHAT programme (full name: Hospice Voluntary Service as a Tool of Acceptance and Tolerance Learning Tool among Prisoners), whose pioneer is Father E. Dutkiewicz Hospice. In accordance with the programme's guiding principles, convicts and small offence criminals may join voluntary service. The programme was initiated in 2002, and since then has proved to be a success. The movie To Overcome Prejudice tells the story of this campaign. 'Fields of Hope' (Pola Nadziei) is an international campaign, first conducted in Scotland by the Marie Curie Cancer Care Foundation. In Poland, the first to organise this campaign was the Hospice in Krak√≥w in 1998, and in 2003, Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz Hospice SAC in Gda≈Ñsk joined the action. Each year, around 4 October, thousands of people plant daffodils (at hospitals, schools, government buildings, etc.) as a symbol of solidarity with cancer patients. In spring, when the flowers are in bloom, begins the action aiming to gather funds for providing hospice care. The volunteers, dressed in yellow T-shirts, collect money for the hospice on streets, in parks, in front of churches and shopping malls. A daffodil flower ‚Äì the symbol of hope ‚Äì is given out in thanks for contributions. The fund-raising is accompanied by various artistic happenings (e.g. concerts). In addition to gaining monetary fundings for the hospices, Fields of Hope is also aimed at promoting the idea of hospice care, informing the society of its role and activity, as well as sensitising people to the needs of terminally ill patients. The Package from the Heart campaign (Paczka od Serca) is organised each year in December, with the aim of helping the youngest patients. Within the campaign, an auction of special packages is held. The contents of said packages are composed by media, movie, music and sports celebrities. The Become a Gda≈Ñsk Angel campaign (Zosta≈Ñ Gda≈Ñskim Anio≈Çem) has taken place during the 749th Dominican Fair (Jarmark ≈öw. Dominika). The volunteers, dressed as angels, took part in the opening parade, and organised an additional attraction for spectators and the ill from Gda≈Ñsk Hospice. The aim of this campaign was to help people realise the importance of helping others, and also to call attention to the suffering of another.

He was Archbishop of Gniezno, head of the Polish church, from ca. 1092/99 until 1112/27.It is not known how long Martin was archbishop of Gniezno and when he died; certainly he was already in the office in 1099 and was still alive ca. 1112. Jan D≈Çugosz, writing in 15th century gives the dates 1092 to 1118, but, since he did not provide any source, both dates are contested.

Kazimierz ≈ömigiel: S≈Çownik biograficzny arcybiskup√≥w gnie≈∫nie≈Ñskich i prymas√≥w Polski, Wydawn. WBP, 2002, p. 362 gives the dates from 1092 until as late as ca. 1124/27, because his successor James of ≈ªnin in 1124 was still provost in Gniezno.

Neither his direct predecessor nor direct successor is established with certainty. Archbishop Bogumi≈Ç died in 1092, but probably he was succeeded at first by Heinrich von W√ºlzburg, mentioned only in Vitae of Otto of Bamberg without any exact date, see Jan Powierski: Data konsekracji katedry gnie≈∫nie≈Ñskiej (1 maja 1099) na tle sytuacji politycznej Polski, Rusi i kraj√≥w sƒÖsiednich, Roczniki historyczne 1994, p. 96; and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Abraham, Organizacja Ko≈õcio≈Ça w Polsce do po≈Çowy wieku XII, Lw√≥w 1890, p. 83.

It was the largest claim to be lodged in the United Kingdom, but was rejected in the Employment Tribunal and on appeal. Facts Stephanie Villalba was the daughter of a former head of Merrill Lynch's France operations, and had many family members working with the company. She too joined as a graduate and by 2002 had become the \\"Market Executive for Europe\\". She reported to a Mr Raymundo Yu, who quickly formed the view that Ms Villalba was \\"not flexible\\" in taking criticism or advice on board. Late 2002 was a bad time in the markets, and Mr Yu appointed a Mr Ausuf Abbas, who took over some of Ms Villalba's functions. From then, followed some incidents, which the Tribunal found amounted to less than Ms Villalba had alleged. One was an email where Mr Abbas said Ms Villalba was \\"high maintenance\\". This was found simply to mean \\"requiring considerable management time and effort\\". A second was that on a jet flight between Frankfurt and Milan, Villalba got the last seat, near the drinks cabinet, and was expected to pour drinks for the fellow travellers. She alleged she was being made to feel like a flight attendant, but it was found that anybody who had sat there would have had to do the same. Feeling isolated, Ms Villalba confided in the Human Resources head Ms Pauline Cahill and made according to the tribunal a \\"tentative allegation of sex discrimination\\", that she was not being treated as an equal team member. Ms Cahill (who had heard concerns about Ms Villalba's performance) encouraged Ms Villalba to work constructively, but then went and told others, and by 11 December Mr Abbas had heard that Ms Villalba had alleged sex discrimination. After that their relationship broke down and she complained further to Ms Cahill that Mr Abbas was \\"micro managing\\" her, while afterwards Mr Abbas said he tried to avoid her. In January bonuses were awarded, by Mr Yu, and Ms Villalba got the middle-ranking bonus for people who merely \\"achieved requirements\\". On 23 January Villalba and Abbas had a fight. Human resources did not do anything, except try to keep them apart. Mr Yu tried to find her a new job, but the one he came up with did not have the same pay or promotion prospects. On 21 Villalba sent a letter suggesting sex discrimination. Villalba rejected the new post, or any that would be outside the UK. On 28 March she was offered some leave while a new post was found, and she replied that she had instructed solicitors. After that she was told she must stay at home and her contract was terminated at the end of July. Bonuses are 75%-80% of pay at Merrill Lynch, and the tribunal noted there is a culture of secrecy about these figures, but at the same time are perceived as a vital indicator of personal worth to the company. The Tribunal rejected the contention about sex discrimination, but did hold that Villalba's claims of victimisation were well founded, given Cahill's failure to keep Villalba's complaints confidential (see SDA 1975 ss 4(1) and 6(2)(b)).

See also: Background The district is a major crossroads in Ithaca, and contains a wide variety of architectural styles and cultural, social, educational, political and religious functions. Concern for preservation of the neighborhood was a motivating factor behind Ithaca's passage of a local Landmarks Preservation Ordinance in 1971. Dewitt Park was Ithaca's first designated local historic district in 1971. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the same year. DeWitt Park DeWitt Park is owned by the Presbyterian Church on North Cayuga Street. The church congregation purchased the land from Simeon DeWitt on August 1, 1815, for the sum of $499.65. The church specifically set the land aside for public enjoyment, rather than as a graveyard, which would have been more typical of the day. In 1856 the church came to an agreement with the Village of Ithaca that the church would retain ownership of the park, while the village would be responsible for maintaining it.

He was also referred to as Tupua Malietoa To'oa Mata'afa Iosefo. History The matai chiefly title Mata'afa is one of highest titles in Samoa. From the late 19th century, Iosefo (first name) played a pivotal role during the country's colonial era when Germany, Great Britain and the United States were vying for control of the Samoa Islands. Each western power had their own chiefly candidate for the 'kingship' of Samoa, and Mata'afa was Germany's preferred candidate. In the late 19th century, Mata'afa Iosefo was exiled to the Marshall Islands and was permitted to return in 1898. The Germans upheld his claim for the kingship. First Samoan Civil War Mata'afa Iosefo first came into prominence in September 1888 when under his command, his followers rebelled against the German-backed Tamasese who was proclaimed Tafa'ifa or King of Samoa. A battle of the First Samoan Civil War saw Mata'afa's warriors send Tamasese's forces retreating to Mulinu'u Point where a German gunship offered protection. The ensuing bombardment of his villages saw Mata'afa retaliate by wiping out an invading German contingent and plundering the German plantations at the First Battle of Vailele. Eventually, Germany, the United States and Britain agreed that Malietoa Laupepa would be restored as the Malietoa and Tafa'ifa of Samoa Second Samoan Civil War He was a major protagonist in the Second Samoan Civil War, an important proxy conflict in the leadup to the outbreak of World War One. During the conflict, he his followers waged a bloody conflict with German support against Malietoa Tanumafili I, who was in turn supported by Western Allied forces from the United States and the British Empire. The war dragged on for several months, in which Mata'afa and his allies won or drew several battles at heavy cost, including the Second Battle of Vailele in which the Mataafans defeated Samoan loyalists and a squadron of British and American warships, though suffering casualties both far larger than his opponents and extremely heavy by the standards of Samoan warfare. His push for the kingship of Samoa was also supported by the early Mau movement led by orator Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe. In the end, he was able to resist all attempts by the Allies to capture or kill him. As a result, the division of Samoa was agreed as a compromise. Germany obtained the western islands and created German Samoa, the U.S. annexed the eastern islands and created American Samoa, and the British withdrew their claim in exchange for concessions in the Solomon Islands. In 1900, Iosefo was declared Ali'i Sili (highest chief) by the German Samoa colonial powers. Iosefo succeeded his father, Mata'afa Tafagamanu, to the Mata'afa title. Death Following his death at Mulinu'u in 1912, he was succeeded by Mata'afa Tupuola Iose. See also *Mata'afa *Fa'amatai, chiefly system of Samoa.

The 2007 St Albans City and District Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of St Albans District Council in Hertfordshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats lost overall control of the council to no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrats 29 *Conservative 19 *Labour 8 *Independent 2 Campaign A total of 83 candidates from the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, Labour and Green Party stood in the election. Each party contested every ward, apart from in London Colney where the Green candidate was disqualified due to an incorrect nomination. Each ward had one seat up for election apart from in Harpenden West where two seats were contested as a Conservative councillor stood down early due to illness. The other parties needed to gain 3 seats from the Liberal Democrats to remove them from power, with a 2-seat drop meaning the Liberal Democrats would depend on the mayor's casting vote to remain in power. After the Conservatives won the most votes in the previous 2006 election they were hoping to make gains, with Harpenden East, Marshalswick South, Verulam and Wheathampstead seen as being possible gains. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats defended their record in running the council during the election. They called for St Albans to be Hertfordshires' \\"premier community\\" and pointed to the Audit Commission rating the council as one of the 10 most improving in the country. 6 sitting councillors stood down at the election including a former Conservative cabinet member Chris Whiteside and a former Labour mayor Malcolm MacMillan. Election result The Liberal Democrats lost their overall majority after losing 2 seats to the Conservatives, dropping to exactly half of the council with 29 councillors. The 2 Conservative gains from the Liberal Democrats came in Harpenden East and Redbourn wards to lift the party to 19 seats and the Conservatives received around 2,000 votes more than the Liberal Democrats. There was no change elsewhere on the council, with Labour staying on 8 seats, despite dropping to fourth place in several wards and there also remained 2 independent councillors. Overall turnout at the election was 43.6%. Following the election the Liberal Democrats remained in control of the council after one of the independent councillors, Tony Swendell, abstained on the vote to decide the composition of the cabinet.

The panel was established to ensure that matches between the best international teams are handled by the best referees. World Rugby appoints a neutral 4-person team (referee, 2 assistant referees, and TMO) to each match in the international windows, as well as to the [Six Nations] and The Rugby Championship. All the referees on the International panel, have progressed through refereeing ranks in their domestic leagues, before developing skills further on the Sevens World Series panel, and in World Rugby Under 20 competitions, as well as gaining experience in multinational club competitions such as the European Rugby Champions Cup and Super Rugby,.http://www.sanzarrugby.com/superrugby/ Regarded as the best in the world, referees on the panel are employed by their home unions and World Rugby, and have strict standards that they must adhere to. Appointments Appointments are made four times a year, prior to the June and November international test windows, the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship. Appointments are made by a panel of the elite referee managers from Six Nations and SANZAR sponsored competitions, and are based on a referees performance in both recent international and club matches. Referees can be called up to and dropped from the panel in between series', meaning that the best referees are appointed to the panel for each period. The World Rugby Match Official Selection Committee, chaired by John Jeffrey, comprises former elite referees Lyndon Bray (SANZAR), Andrew Cole (SANZAR), Donal Courtney (European Professional Club Rugby), Clayton Thomas (Six Nations) and World Rugby High Performance Match Officials Manager Jo√´l Jutge. Sponsorship and Kit Supply The panel is sponsored by Emirates Airlines, and their Fly Emirates branding appears on the referees shirts for all test matches. Starting in 2015, this sponsorship will also extend to the Rugby World Cup, marking the first time a sponsor has appeared on a players or officials shirt while on the field of play. The panels kit is supplied by Canterbury, the kit consists of blue socks, blue shorts and a choice of four shirts - blue, orange, white and black. The choice of shirts is in place to avoid a colour clash with any of the teams during a game. Some officials also have their own sponsorships, for other equipment such as boots.

Formal logic In formal logic, a knowledge base KB is complete if there is no formula Œ± such that KB ‚ä≠ Œ± and KB ‚ä≠ ¬¨Œ±. Example of knowledge base with incomplete knowledge: KB := { A ‚à® B } Then we have KB ‚ä≠ A and KB ‚ä≠ ¬¨A. In some cases, a consistent knowledge base can be made complete with the closed world assumption‚Äîthat is, adding all not-entailed literals as negations to the knowledge base. In the above example though, this would not work because it would make the knowledge base inconsistent: KB' = { A ‚à® B, ¬¨A, ¬¨B } In the case where KB := { P(a), Q(a), Q(b) }, KB ‚ä≠ P(b) and KB ‚ä≠ ¬¨P(b), so, with the closed world assumption, KB' = { P(a), ¬¨P(b), Q(a), Q(b) }, where KB' ‚ä® ¬¨P(b). Data management In data management, completeness is metaknowledge that can be asserted for parts of the KB via completeness assertions. As example, a knowledge base may contain complete information for predicates R and S, while nothing is asserted for predicate T. Then consider the following queries: Q1 :- R(x), S(x) Q2 :- R(x), T(x) For Query 1, the knowledge base would return a complete answer, as only predicates that are themselves complete are intersected. For Query 2, no such conclusion could be made, as predicate T is potentially incomplete.

History The lineage of the Ashfield Gales was documented by Sir William Betham, Ulster King-of-Arms, who created thousands of sketch pedigrees of the era using sources such as his abstracts of the prerogative wills of Ireland from 1536‚Äì1800.Falley, Margaret Dickson (1981). Irish and Scotch-Irish Ancestral Research: Repositories and Records. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., p. 146 According to Betham's pedigree, the Ashfield Gales descended from a Colonel Oliver Gale who came to Ireland during the time of Henry VIII, perhaps as part of the early English Plantations of Ireland. In support of the connection to Oliver Gale, Betham references Ducatus Leodiensis, which documents the pedigrees of many of the nobility and gentry of Yorkshire, England.

The final was contested by Cork of Munster and Galway of Connacht, with Cork winning by 4-13 to 2-15. Cork were rank outsiders coming into the game as Galway had used the imaginative tactic of a two-man full-forward line to dispose of Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final. Galway deployed this tactic once again in the final, however, the Cork team retained the positions leaving Johnny Crowley free at the Hill 16 end. When Galway realised that this move failed to pay any dividends they resorted back to the orthodox formation. Cork, in spite of playing against he wind, had a blistering first quarter. A goal from a twenty- yard John Fenton free after just eight minutes was quickly followed by a second from Kevin Hennessy. Galway rallied strongly in the second quarter, leaving Cork just 2-5 to 0-10 ahead at the interval. Galway introduced P. J. Molloy and Michael Connolly to their attack for the second half as Cork lost John Fenton to an ankle injury. Of all the goals it was Tom√°s Mulcahy who scored the most spectacular of the day. After collecting a puck-out from Ger Cunningham he ran fifty metres before rifling the sliotar to the back of the Galway net. Galway's first goal didn't come until eight minutes from the end as goalkeeper John Commins sent a twenty-metre free to the net. That goal came too late as Kevin Hennessy had bagged his second just before that. P. J. Molloy got Galway's second goal a minute from time, however, it was too little too late. Fittingly, it was Jimmy Barry-Murphy, playing in his last game, who scored Cork's last point. Cork's All-Ireland victory was their first since 1984. The win gave them their 26th All-Ireland title over all and bolstered their position as outright leaders on the all-time roll of honour. Similarly, Cork preserved their record of having never been beaten by Galway in an All- Ireland final. Galway's All-Ireland defeat was their 13th over all. It was their second in succession and their third since their last All-Ireland final victory in 1980. It was Galway's fourth All-Ireland final defeat by Cork in an All-Ireland final.

At the age of 16 he developed leprosy and later, under the guidance of Hannah Riddell, he also helped people with leprosy in Okinawa.  Early history and Hannah Riddell  Keisai Aoki (real name Yasujiro Aoki) was born in Tokushima Prefecture on April 8, 1893. At the age of 16 he developed leprosy and everything did not help, including the pilgrimage of 88 holy places of Shikoku (at that time it was believed to be of help). In 1916 he entered the Oshima Leprosarium and was baptized in 1918 as a Christian. He helped with missionary work, and he sent a letter to Hannah Riddell since he was worried about women's temptation. At Kusatsu, he met Riddell who was vacationing there and decided to go to Kaishun Hospital, where she was the director. He helped with her missionary work in the facility, which he described as having an almost monastic atmosphere. During his time at the hospital, he met Aiko Tamaki, who he became attracted to. This, however, worried him because this was against Riddell's strict policy of gender segregation. He decided to go to Okinawa to pursue missionary work at the strong suggestion of Riddell. It is not clear whether Riddell discovered Keisai's affection for Tamaki or whether he was asked to leave because of it. However, Keisai, himself, described Riddell's devotion to her patients even those who left under difficult circumstances, sending them letters and gifts after their departure.  Okinawa and Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium  With missionary Arato, he discovered people with leprosy living in caves or other places, first on Iejima Island, and later on Mainland Okinawa, and they gave them clothes, food and spiritual ministry. At one place, village people burned down the houses of people with leprosy. They also discovered about 40 people forced to live in a small island called Jalma Island. Later they landed at Yagaji Island (some sources say Gayachi Island), where they acquired a piece of land, which Keisai eventually used to found the Kunigami (later Okingawa) Airakuen Sanatorium Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium in 1938. In 1957, he became an official missionary of Okinawa Seikokai (Episcopal Church). On March 6, 1969, he died of myocardial infarction. Haiku Keisai also composed many short poems (haiku). These include the following: :Koetekite, Hone o Uzumuru, Hito Ha kana ::Coming over to Okinawa, I am like a leaf, my bones will be buried here. Leprosy in Okinawa before Aoki Among the Japanese prefectures, leprosy had the highest incidence in Okinawa Prefecture in 1925, 1935 and 1940. The Okinawa Government was inconsistent concerning the establishment of leprosaria. In 1931, Miyako Hoyoen Sanatorium was established on Miyako Island, but it was met with strong opposition from the mainland Okinawans. Rioting and burning of houses of leprosy patients occurred. With the help of various organizations and individuals such as Kensuke Mitsuda and Fumio Hayashi, the Kunigami Airakuen, now the Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium, was established due to the efforts and leadership of Keisai Aoki.Leprosy Control Measures Kazuo Saikawa, Okinawa Leprosy Prevention Association, 1999.

Old Soviet submarine pen Mine cars, Balaklava Naval Museum Naval museum complex Balaklava (, Russian: –ú—É–∑–µ–π —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã, \\"The Cold War Museum\\", designation K-825) is an underground submarine base in Balaklava, Crimea (originally known as Object 825 GTS). It was a top-secret military facility during the Cold War, located in Balaklava Bay. Today it serves as a museum and also houses a museum about the Crimean War.  Description and purpose  The complex is built accordingly to withstand a category-I (nuclear yield of 100kt) nuclear explosion, and includes an underground network of water channels complete with a dry dock, repair shops, warehouses for torpedoes and other weapons. Additionally it could protect personnel from nuclear fallout. The complex is located in the mountain of Tavros, on both sides of which are exits. Caisson gates could be used if necessary to seal the entire complex. An exit to the open sea is provided on the northern side of the mountain. The holes in the rock are neatly covered with camouflage devices and networks. Object 825 GTS was intended to house, repair and maintain Project 613 and 633 (known as Whiskey and Romeo-class respectively) submarines. The central water channel of the facility, at a length of , could accommodate up to 7 submarines if necessary, and up to 14 submarines of different classes in all water channels. The water channels have depths up to , with widths ranging from . The total area of all facilities in the complex is around , while the total surface area of water stands at . Equipment loading in peacetime was carried out on the pier, then conducted while watching out for the movements of spy satellites of possible military adversaries. A special tunnel is used for loading equipment into the base in wartime. The complex also includes a repair and technical base, code-named Object 280, designed for storing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. Submarines could enter and exit the base completely submerged through its underwater access point. Temperature inside the base is kept around . The Soviet Navy trained dolphins at this facility to attach underwater beacons and explosives to submarines and ships.  History  In the period after the Second World War, the two superpowers, the USSR and the US, stepped up their nuclear arsenal, threatening each other with pre-emptive strikes and retaliatory strikes. It was then when Joseph Stalin gave Lavrentiy Beria (who was responsible at that time for nuclear projects), a secret directive; to find a place where they could house submarines for a retaliatory nuclear strike. Several years of research pinpointed the quiet Balaklava as the location, and the city was immediately coded and got merged into the city of Sevastopol as a city district. Balaklava sits on a narrow winding inlet with a width of only 200‚Äì400 meters. This small inlet protects the city not only from storms, but also from reconnaissance as it is not visible from any angle from the open sea. Additionally, the site is close to Sevastopol, a major naval base still used by the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet today. In 1957 a special construction department coded as No. 528 was created, which handled the construction of underground facilities. The construction of the underground complex lasted eight years, from 1953 to 1961. About 120 thousand tons of rock were removed from the Tavros mountain throughout the process. To ensure secrecy supplies were transported at night on a barge in the open sea. After the complex was closed in 1993, most of the complex is unguarded. The abandoned facility was handed over to the naval forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2000. However, the former base was frequently plundered during the unguarded period from 1993 to 2003, with all metal structures scavenged for the metal. The Sevastopol \\"Marine Commission\\" led by Vladimir Stefanovsky proposed the construction of the current museum. The museum would have themed exhibition halls, which were former repair shops and arsenals, a submarine standing by the underground pier, a tourist center, a cinema room with a chronicle of the time of active military confrontation between the two superpowers, and finally, an underground memorial dedicated to submariners who died at sea. The 10th anniversary of the museum was celebrated in June 2013. Submarine veterans, former employees of the base as well as representatives from the authorities, armed forces and students attended the ceremony. The facility was placed under the jurisdiction of Russia and the southern area of the Military History Museum of fortification structures of the Russian Federation in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea.http://muzey- sevastopol.com/  Restoration  According to press information from March 2014, Russia is considering the possibility of restoring the submarine base in Balaklava.

Early life  He was born Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo de Ata√≠de e Malafaya, one of the thirteen children of Dom Manuel de Azevedo, Comendador of the monastery of S√£o Jo√£o de Alpendurada. He was thus half-brother of the Jesuit martyr, Blessed In√°cio de Azevedo. Not being the firstborn son, he did not inherit his father's estate, that included the lordship of the ancient honras of Barbosa and Ata√≠de, each with an estimated annual income of 100 thousand reais, a considerable sum in 16th century Portugal. Dom Jer√≥nimo was thus compelled to follow the example of many second sons of the Portuguese nobility of that era, by emigrating at a young age to the most important of Portugal's overseas possessions, the Estado da √çndia, where he made his career. He entered royal service on 25 March 1577, as a page (mo√ßo fidalgo) of King Sebastian's household (this was a posting usually reserved for very young members of the nobility, suggesting he was born sometime around 1560 - and not 1540 as referred in some sources). The appointment was made with his going to the East already in view and some time later, he sailed to India. Governorship of Ceylon Azevedo was Captain- Major of the Malabar coast for a period of 15 years, before being nominated Captain-General of Ceylon in the year 1594. He stayed in charge in Ceylon for a period of 18 years (from Christmas 1594 until November 1612), an unusual long period for holding one office in the Estado da √çndia. He was a key figure in the late 16th-century and early 17th-century Portuguese attempts to take full control over the whole territory of present-day Sri Lanka. The touchstone of Portuguese ambitions in Ceylon by the end of the 16th century was the bequest by King Dharmapala of Kotte in 1580 of his entire realm to the king of Portugal. Dharmapala was a Christian convert and his bequest was unacceptable to many of his Buddhist subjects and to the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Kandy. The takeover was therefore resisted, and the Portuguese had to subjugate Kotte by force.  Military campaigns in Kotte  Azevedo arrived in Colombo with fresh troops on 24 December 1594, barely three months after his predecessor, Pedro Lopes de Sousa died at the battle of Danture (9 October 1594). The Portuguese army had been annihilated by the Kandyan forces in that battle and Azevedo found a kingdom of Kotte in full rebellion. On the first of January 1595 he held a review of the armed forces at his disposal, with king Dharmapala (the source of legitimacy for Portuguese rule in Kotte) at his side. He mustered 900 Portuguese and 2,000 Lascarin soldiers. He sized up the situation and decided he had to pacify the lowlands of Kotte before he could retaliate against Kandy. A difficult, ruthless and prolonged campaign to crush the revolts in the lowlands was thus started and it would concentrate most of Azevedo's attention until it was successfully concluded in 1602. By the end of 1601 the king of Portugal was already writing to the viceroy in Goa, promising to remember Azevedo's many services to the crown.  Malvana Convention and opening of Ceylon to the Jesuits  His governorship in Kotte is also noted for his dealing with complex political issues, which he partly addressed by summoning the Convention of Malvana after the death of king Dharmapala in 1597. Azevedo convened representatives of all the districts of the kingdom and accepted - after two days of deliberations - that the native inhabitants of Kotte would keep their laws and customs, though they had to pledge allegiance to the king of Portugal. This convention is mentioned (some 40 years after it was allegedly convened) in a letter of grievance written by Sinhalese leaders to the captain-general, Diogo de Melo e Castro (1636 - 1638). Another issue to which Azevedo dedicated his attention was missionary activity. In 1554, the Portugueses crown had decided that its possessions in Ceylon would be an exclusive preserve of the Franciscans, and it reaffirmed this decision in 1593. Under Azevedo, however, this policy changed. In January 1597 the Bishop of Cochin, D. Andr√© de Santa Maria, wrote to the King of Portugal, suggesting that it allow the Jesuits to engage in missionary activity in Ceylon, since the resources available to the Franciscans were allegedly \\"insufficient\\" for achieving the evangelizing objectives of Portugal. Later in that year, the Portuguese crown received specific proposals - based on the initial suggestions of the bishop of Cochin, fully supported by Azevedo, whose brother In√°cio was a Jesuit martyr - on how to divide missionary activity in the island between the two Religious Orders. After much debate, these proposals were adopted by the crown and in April 1602 the first four Jesuits arrived in Colombo, backed by a patent issued by Viceroy Aires de Saldanha, on 27 February 1602.  Military campaigns against Kandy  Azevedo was less successful in his attempts to subdue Kandy. He invaded the kingdom in 1603 in a carefully planned operation with a total force of about 1,100 Portuguese and 12,000 Sinhalese, but despite initial successes he was forced to withdraw after a rebellion erupted among the Lascarins, the indigenous troops who fought alongside the Portuguese forces. In contrast to his predecessor Pedro Lopes de Sousa, who lost his life and his troops in a previous invasion, he did manage to prevent the annihilation of the Portuguese forces and showed exceptional military capabilities during this retreat that thus came to be known as a famosa retirada. After this setback, Azevedo brought innovations to the formulation of Portuguese military strategy in Ceylon. He decided to abandon the traditional approach of trying to subdue Kandy with a single, decisive military offensive and adopted instead a new strategy based on economic warfare. Every year the Portuguese would engage in smaller but highly destructive biannual forays and raids deep inside Kandyan territory, burning crops and villages and driving off the cattle. This greatly weakened Kandy - in the words of a Portuguese chronicler, the Jesuit Fern√£o de Queiroz, the kingdom \\"never in our time recovered its former opulence and size\\". However, this strategy aimed at the economic strangulation of the kingdom of Kandy did not produce all the effects expected by Azevedo, because Portuguese traders in Indian port cities such as S√£o Tom√© de Meliapor, with the support of the Hindu king at Jaffna, refused to abandon their highly lucrative trades with Kandy. Political map of Ceylon in the early 17th century. Dom Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo invaded Kandy in 1603, but was forced to retreat after a rebellion erupted among his Lascarin auxiliaries. When he finally left Ceylon for Goa, Azevedo issued directives to his successor, insisting that his new strategy should continue to be followed until Kandy accepted a status of vassalage to the kingdom of PortugalDaman. Azevedo ordered its building in the year 1615, while viceroy in Goa.alt=  Viceroy of Portuguese India  Azevedo was appointed 20th viceroy of Portuguese India on 24 November 1611, and left Colombo for Goa where he assumed his new duties on 16 December 1612. In 1615 he backed an audacious expedition to Pegu to loot the Moon imperial treasures in Mrauk-U, an enterprise that ultimately did not succeed. However, the fact that it was supported at such a high official level showed how plunder was considered a legitimate policy objective in 16th-century Portuguese-ruled Asia. Also in 1615 Azevedo led a huge fleet that tried to drive English East India Company ships under the command of Nicholas Downton off Surat, but after a series of engagements (including a clash in which the viceroy's brother, Dom Manuel de Azevedo, captain of Chaul and Diu, sank a couple of English merchant vessels) he failed to achieve the strategic objective of dislodging the East India Company from the Indian Ocean trade routes ‚Äì an incident which demonstrated that Portuguese Goa had lost the capacity to protect its monopoly of commerce on the Western coast of India. During his government in Goa Azevedo also had to face the serious threat posed by the increasing pressure of Dutch fleets against the Portuguese possessions and trade routes in the Indian Ocean. His response was not only military, for one surprising byproduct of the Dutch challenge was galvanizing the Portuguese into undertaking new journeys of geographical exploration, seen as a sort of preemptive strike against the movements of Dutch and English fleets. Between 1613 and 1616 Dom Jer√≥nimo ordered two such expeditions to the coasts of Madagascar  known to the Portuguese as ilha de S√£o Louren√ßo since the beginning of the 16th century - with the participation of Jesuit priests (the Jesuits were then very much engaged in such activity, including journeys to the interior of China and to Tibet). One of the aims of this project was evaluating the possibilities for conquest of the island. The expeditions explored the region, prepared a roteiro of the coasts of Madagascar, produced new regional maps and compiled many scientific observations, in a concrete demonstration that the spirit of discovery was still present in the Estado da √çndia in the first quarter of the seventeenth century. According to the historian A. R. Disney by the time of Dom Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo's mandate as viceroy the influence of colonials in Goa, as distinct from metropolitan Portuguese, was steadily growing. These colonials had interests and an outlook that did not necessarily coincide with those of the metropolis. In practice, Azevedo ‚Äì who had come to Asia as a young man and served for his entire career in the Portuguese Estado da √çndia ‚Äì was a colonial. This influence of colonials coincided with a period of resurgent Portuguese expansionism in South and Southeast Asia, that reached its peak when Azevedo took office in 1612 but was already weakening when he terminated his mandate as viceroy in 1617. On his return to Lisbon, Azevedo was held in custody and put on trial on several accusations, including embezzlement. One factor that probably contributed to his downfall in the Philippine court was the obstruction he made, when viceroy in Goa, to the mission of the Castilian national Garc√≠a de Silva Figueroa, appointed by king Philip III of Spain (Filipe II of Portugal) as his envoy to the Shah of Persia. Figueiroa left Lisbon in April 1614, headed for a stopover in Goa, where he had strong disagreements with Azevedo, that prevented him from reaching his final destination until the year 1617. Dom Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo died on 9 March 1625, in S√£o Jorge Castle, before the conclusion of his trial. He was buried in S√£o Roque Church in Lisbon, which was then the home church of the Jesuits in Portugal.  Legacy  Azevedo lived at a time when the Portuguese Empire in the East was already past its heyday and relatively weakened by the arrival to Asian waters of other European powers. But military successes in the 1590s against the Kingdoms of Sitawaka and Jaffna presented the Portuguese crown with a unique window of opportunity that led it to decide (in 1594) to attempt the conquest of the entire island of Ceylon. The martial qualities of the governors were thus paramount, and this is the likely reason that explains Azevedo's long tenure in Colombo, followed by his promotion to viceroy in Goa in 1611. Azevedo had attempted to resign from captain general of Ceylon in 1597 and later on, in February 1603, he was also the target of an inquiry (\\"devassa\\") conducted by the Archbishop of Goa, for alleged misappropriation of resources. However, as early as 15 March 1603, the king was already writing to the Archbishop to request the postponement of the inquiry, since in the meantime he had received favorable informations from the bishop of Cochin concerning Azevedo's military campaigns on the island. Clearly, the king did not want the good military results of governor to be undermined, and in the end he granted to D. Jer√≥nimo a reward of 10,000 reais and a comenda in the Order of Christ. By that time, Azevedo had already acquired in Ceylon the equivalent of the power and mystique of a viceroy. That Azevedo was more than a military chief, can be seen from the political initiatives (Malvana Convention) and missionary reforms (opening of Ceylon to the Jesuits) that he took while in Colombo, as well as in his support of geographical exploration and scientific activities during his tenure in Goa. On balance, it is likely that - more than the accusations of embezzlement (a quite common feature of many previous tenures of governors and viceroys of the Portuguese Empire) - it was his politically risky actions against a personal envoy of the king of Spain and Portugal that sealed his final fall from grace in the Habsburg court. The Fort of S√£o Jer√≥nimo (Saint Jerome) in Nani Daman was started during his term as viceroy and is named in his honor. Azevedo was also responsible for the rebuilding of the Idalc√£o or Adilshahi Palace in Panaji (Goa).

He spent much of his career in Norway, participated in the Theater War, and commanded Fredriksten Fortress from 1790 to his death, reaching the rank of lieutenant general. He was born in Mansbach as a son of Friedrich Wilhelm von und zu Mansbach and Sophia Bernstein. In 1787 he married Isabella von Oldenburg (1769‚Äì1855), a daughter of Adam Christoph von Oldenburg and Maria de Sch√∂ller, and a former member of D√©sir√©e Clary's court. Their son Carl von und zu Mansbach became a notable military officer and diplomat, and one of Carl's daughters married judge and politician Otto Joachim L√∏venskiold. Johann Friedrich von und zu Mansbach was a military officer in Hesse-Kassel before serving Denmark. In April 1776 he became a naturalized Danish citizen. He served as leader of Dronningens Livregiment in Denmark from November 1772, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He became chamberlain (kammerherre) in April 1774. He was promoted further to colonel in May 1783, major general in July 1788 and lieutenant general in April 1801. From May 1783 he was stationed in Norway. From March 1787 to his death he led the S√∏nnenfjelske gevorbne Infanteriregiment, and when the Theater War broke out in 1788 he led the Fourth Field Brigade. From September 1790 he doubled as regiment leader and commander of Fredriksten Fortress. In 1801, when the War of the Second Coalition raged, Mansbach was especially tasked with commanding troops in Vestfold, fearing a British invasion--the Kingdom of Great Britain had recently attacked Denmark-Norway in the Battle of Copenhagen. An attack on Vestfold did not occur. Mansbach died in March 1803 at Fredriksten.

Even though these systems are usually fully automated, a system that requires a manual pump or button activation is still identified as a centralized lubrication system. The system can be classified into two different categories that can share a lot of the same components. Oil systems: Oil systems primary use is for stationary manufacturing equipment such as CNC milling Grease systems: Grease primary use is on mobile units such as trucks, mining or construction equipment. Oil versus grease can vary even though their primary use is mostly stationary for oil and mobile for grease, some stationary manufacturing equipment will use grease systems.  Reason for an automatic lubrication system  Automatic lubrication system is designed to apply lubricant in small, measured amounts over short, frequent time intervals. Time and human resource constraints and sometimes the physical location on machine often makes it impractical to manually lubricate the points. As a result, production cycles, machine availability, and manpower availability dictate the intervals at which machinery is lubricated which is not optimal for the point requiring lubrication. Auto lube systems are installed on machinery to address this problem.  Benefits  Auto lube systems have many advantages over traditional methods of manual lubrication: # All critical components are lubricated, regardless of location or ease of access # Lubrication occurs while the machinery is in operation causing the lubricant to be equally distributed within the bearing and increasing the machine‚Äôs availability. # Proper lubrication of critical components ensures safe operation of the machinery. # Less wear on the components means extended component life, fewer breakdowns, reduced downtime, reduced replacement costs and reduced maintenance costs # Measured lubrication amounts means no wasted lubricant # Safety - no climbing around machinery or inaccessible areas (gases, exhaust, confined spaces, etc.) # Lower energy consumption due to less friction # Increased overall productivity resulting from increase in machine availability and reduction in downtime due to breakdowns or general maintenance #in this system lubrication the engine parts are lubricated under pressure feed  Components  A typical system consists of controller/timer, pump w/reservoir, supply line, metering valves, and feed lines. Regardless of the manufacturer or type of system, all automatic lubrication systems share these 5 main components:Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology: Reasons for Lube Systems; MATLLUB04. January 2007, FLO Components Ltd. # Controller/Timer ‚Äì activates the system to distribute lubrication can be linked to a POS system. # Pump with Reservoir ‚Äì stores and provides the lubricant to the system # Supply Line ‚Äì line that connects the pump to the metering valves or injectors. The lubricant is pumped through this. # Metering Valves/Injectors‚Äì component that measures/dispenses the lubricant to the application points. # Feed lines - line that connects the metering valves or injectors to the application points. The lubricant is pumped through this.  Types  There are several different types of automatic lubrication systems including: * Single Line Parallel systems * Dual Line Parallel systems * Single Point Automatics * Single Line Progressive systems (or Series Progressive) * Single Line Resistance * Oil Mist and Air-Oil systems * Oil re-circulating * Chain lube systems The 4 most commonly used Automatic Lubrication System types are: * Single Line Parallel, * Dual Line Parallel and * Single Line Progressive. * Multi port direct lubricators  Single line progressive  Single Line Progressive Automatic Lubrication System A single line progressive system uses lubricant flow to cycle individual metering valves and valve assemblies. The valves consist of dispensing pistons moving back and forth in a specific bore. Each piston depends on flow from the previous piston to shift and displace lubricant. If one piston doesn‚Äôt shift, none of the following pistons will shift. Valve output is not adjustable. Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump to start the lube event. The pump then feeds lubricant into the supply line which connects to the primary metering valve, for either a preprogrammed amount of time or number of times as monitored through a designated piston cycle switch. Lubricant is fed to the multiple lubrication points one after another via secondary progressive metering valves sized for each series of lubrication points, and then directly to each point via the feed lines.Lincoln Industrial Corporation: Quicklub Centralized & Automated Lubrication Systems. April 2007.  Single line parallel  Single Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System The first single-line parallel system for industry was introduced in 1937 by Lincoln Engineering (now known as Lincoln Industrial) in the United States. A single line parallel system can service a single machine, different zones on a single machine or even several separate machines and is ideal when the volume of lubricant varies for each point. In this type of system, a central pump station automatically delivers lubricant through a single supply line to multiple branches of injectors. Each injector serves a single lubrication point, operates independently and may be individually adjusted to deliver the desired amount of lubricant.Lincoln Industrial Corporation: Centro-Matic Automated Lubrication Systems. December 2007. Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump starting the lube cycle. The pump begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the supply line connecting the pump to the injectors. Once the required pressure is reached, the lube injectors dispense a predetermined amount of lubricant to the lubrication points via feed lines.Paul Conley, Lincoln Industrial Corporation and Raj Shah, Koehler Instrument Company: Ventmeter Aids Selection of Grease for Centralized Lubrication Systems. In: Machinery Lubrication Magazine. January 2004 Once the entire system reaches the required pressure, a pressure switch sends a signal to the controller indicating that grease has cycled through to all the distribution points. The pump shuts off. Pressure is vented out of the system and grease in the line is redirected back to the pump reservoir, until the normal system pressure level is restored.  Dual line parallel  Dual Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System A dual line parallel system is similar to the single line parallel system in that it uses hydraulic pressure to cycle adjustable valves to dispense measured shots of lubricant. It has 2 main supply lines which are alternatively used as pressure / vent lines. The advantage of a two-line system is that it can handle hundreds of lubrication points from a single pump station over several thousand feet using significantly smaller tubing or pipe. Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump to start the lubrication cycle. The pump begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the first (the pressure) supply line while simultaneously venting the second (vent) return line. Once the required pressure is reached, a predetermined amount of lubricant is dispensed by the metering devices to half of the lubrication points via feed lines. Once the pressure switch monitoring main supply line pressure indicates a preset pressure in the line has been reached, the system is hydraulically closed. The controller shuts off the pump and signals a changeover valve to redirect lubricant to the second main supply line.Steve Cartwright; LubriSource Inc. Product Guide - Centralized Lubrication Systems. In: Machinery Lubrication Magazine. July 2002 The next time the controller activates the system, the second main line now becomes the pressure line while the first line becomes the vent line. The second line is pressurized and the entire process is repeated lubricating the remaining lube points. Multi point direct lubricator When the controller in the pump or external controller activates the drive motor, a set of cams turns and activates individual injectors or pump elements to dispense a fixed amount of lubricant to each individual lubrication point. Systems are easy to design, direct pump to lube point without added accessories and easy to troubleshoot.

It was developed by Japanese studio Alfa System with animation studio Movic providing anime cinematics, and was published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game was released in Japan in 1995, and in North America in 1996. It features character designs by internationally renowned manga artist Masamune Shirow. The game was a stylistic predecessor to Elemental Gearbolt, also developed by Alfa System. Gameplay Project: Horned Owl is a basic arcade-style rail shooter, with the action taking place in a first-person perspective. It has the option of utilizing the PlayStation mouse or the Konami light gun. There is a two player co-op as well as single-player mode, both taking place across five city-based levels, where the player controls a giant mech and fights off a variety of mechanized enemies. At the conclusion of each stage there is generally an anime cutscene. Plot The events of the game take place in the somewhat futuristic Metro City, where the player controls one of two Horned Owl Armored Mechanized Unit police officers, Hiro Utsumi or Nash Stolar, as they attempt to take down a terrorist organization known as Metalica. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"There are a few highlights, including some nicely-detailed and futuristic 3D environments, lengthy missions, and interactive backgrounds.

Interleukin 6 is a cytokine relevant to many inflammatory diseases and many cancers. Hence, anti- IL6 agents have been sought. In rheumatoid arthritis they can help patients unresponsive to TNF inhibitors. The first approved medication in this class, tocilizumab (Actemra), is an antibody directed against the IL6-receptor. The second, siltuximab (Sylvant), is directed against IL-6 itself.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125496s000lbl.pdf Siltuximab is approved for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-negative and HHV-8-negative patients with multicentric Castleman's disease. Siltuximab was also tested in the phase I/II study for therapy of patients with metastatic castration-associated prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel and in renal cell carcinoma; phase II trials in ovarian cancer resulted in 39% of patients showed disease stabilization via IL-6-regulated downregulation of CCL2, CXCL12 and VEGF. Tocilizumab was first used in large-cell lung carcinoma. In phase I/II trial of tocilizumab in ovarian cancer EGFR pathway upregulation was observed and after inhibition of this pathway by gefitinib tumor growth was decreased both in vitro and in vivo. Sarilumab was approved by US FDA in 2017 for rheumatoid arthritis.FDA Gives Nod to Sarilumab for Rheumatoid Arthritis. 2017 Several agents are in clinical trials: olokizumab (CDP6038) elsilimomab, BMS-945429 (ALD518), sirukumab (CNTO 136), levilimab (BCD-089), and CPSI-2364 an apparent macrophage-specific inhibitor of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Anti-IL-6 Receptor antibodies: Treatment of Coronavirus-associated pulmonary pathology During the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2019‚Äì2020), antagonistic antibodies against the IL-6 receptors were tested in clinical trials to assess their use in treating or preventing severe pneumonia in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Such antibodies include tocilizumab and sarilumab. Antibodies against IL-6 itself, such as siltuximab, were also investigated. Also: Levilimab. Exercise induced IL-6 New research has found IL-6 to be an anti- inflammatory cytokine with multiple beneficial effects when released by contracting muscle as a myokine. IL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise- induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage. However, it has become evident that eccentric exercises are not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric ‚Äúnondamaging‚Äù muscle contractions. This finding demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. In fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery. Anti-IL-6 therapies should therefore take into consideration the (beneficial) anti-inflammatory effects of myokines generally, including the now-established multiple benefits of muscle-derived Interleukin 6. IL6 and asthma Obesity is a known risk factor in the development of severe asthma, and work has suggested that IL-6 plays a role in regulating disease severity in obesity-related asthma.

It is bounded in the southern corner by Vesnina Street in the east - Sumska Street to the north - the so-called elite private settlement construction, and in the west - Dynamo street corner and Novgorod.  History  The origin of the park was from the City governing council who \\"put forth a proposition to plant trees on 20-40,000 square metres on both sides of the Sumskoy road\\"Newspaper ‚ÄúYuzhniy Kray\\" 1893 The idea was that the area would be used for horse riding in a similar manner to the Boulogne Forest. Teachers, university students, and school students all assisted voluntarily with the tree planting. Each tree had a plaque planted next to it showing who had planted it. In 1899 in honour of the 100th birthday of Alexander Pushkin the size of the park was doubled. In 1932 the park was increased again in size to its ultimate size of 130 hectares. It was in 1938 that the park was given its name of Maxim Gorky Central Park for Culture and Recreation, two years after the death of influential Russian and Soviet writer Maxim Gorky. In 1940 the first Children's railway, 3.6 km long, was opened in the park. During the Second World War all the facilities in the park were ruined and thousands of trees were felled, including the city's only cedar grove. On the cessation of hostilities the Kharkiv community immediately set about rebuilding the park. In the 1950s and 1960s 1.2 million people per year would visit the park. A statue of Maxim Gorky was located near the entrance of the park from 1980 until 1999. It was restorated in 2006, but replaced by a glass squirrel sculpture in 2011. Five carry a refrigerator: six lost monuments of Kharkov, my kharkov.info (26 December 2019)  Recent activities  In 2006 the city restored the colonnade at the entrance to the park and in 2007 the park's fountain was restored. The park features tennis courts, a movie theatre, a children's railway, and an aerial cableway. In 2005 the City authorities considered the possibility of building a tunnel under the park to relieve traffic congestion. This proposal did not proceed however the authorities did proceed with a plan to build a road though the park. To this end, in February 2008, 9.9 hectares of the park from Sumskaya Street to Novgorodskaya Street were transferred to the Department of Construction, Maintenance and Reconstruction for the building of a road, a hotel complex and some private dwellings. At the same time another 12.8 hectares of park land was granted a change of status to enable the construction of residential and public buildings. These grants effectively reduced the park's size to 107 hectares. In May 2009, the Ukrainian Parliamentin accordance with Bill #2443 pronounced a moratorium on construction works in parks and forest parks but nevertheless on 19 May 2010 the Executive Committee of the Kharkiv City Council made a decision to cut 500 trees and continue with building a road across the park. This decision by the Council led to considerable public protest from May to July 2010 leading to many arrests and imprisonments.For detailed information on the protests and alleged corruption in the Council Gallery File:–•–∞—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–∞—Ä–∫ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∫–∞.jpg File:–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞–ª–ª–µ—è –ü–∞—Ä–∫–∞.JPG File:–•–∞—Ä–∫—ñ–≤, –ø–∞—Ä–∫ —ñ–º. –ì–æ—Ä—å–∫–æ–≥–æ8.JPG File:–•–∞—Ä–∫—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π –¶–ü–ö—ñ–í. –ë—ñ–ª–∫–∞.JPG File:Gorky Park.

History  In 1824, Thomas Usher and his wife Hannah acquired a small brewery in Back Street, Trowbridge, renaming it Usher's Wiltshire Brewery. In 1844, the couple's three sons joined the partnership, allowing the parents to retire in 1869. After this, the beers and brand developed a loyal following, facilitating a quick expansion of the company through the 19th century. In 1887, the partnership took over Fanshaw & Palmer of Donnington, Berkshire. This resulted in the registration in 1889 of Usher's Wiltshire Brewery Ltd to combine the two organisations. From its date of formation until the Second World War, the company acquired some fifteen independent breweries and their associated public house premises. After 1945, the company acquired Conigre House and gardens in Trowbridge, then the home of the local Liberal Club, enabling it to double the scale of its brewery and bottling plant. Having dropped the apostrophe from its registered name in 1951, in 1960 the company agreed to a takeover bid from the acquisitive Watney Mann. The joint assets included the brewery sites in both London (soon closed) and Trowbridge, together with 900 pubs. In 1964, the company changed its registered name to Ushers Brewers Ltd. Watney Mann merged with Grand Metropolitan Hotels in 1972.Directory of UK Real Ale Breweries In 1991 Roger North, the MD of Grand Met Brewing led a management buyout creating a reconstituted Ushers Brewers Ltd, with an estate of smaller pubs deemed by Grand Metropolitan to be too small or not capable of redevelopment. The new company began acquiring pubs to provide a distribution network, under a holding company called Innspired Pubs. By March 1997 the company owned 541 pubs and floated on the London Stock Exchange after a previous float had been aborted in 1995. Following a profit warning, North took the company private again in December 1998 with the backing of Alchemy Partners. The accounts to 31 October 1998 showed the brewery making operating profit of ¬£6.3m on sales of ¬£45.8m whilst the tenanted pubs had an operating profit of ¬£11.7m on turnover of ¬£27.9m. However, North fell out with Alchemy because they \\"wanted to take Ushers down a route with less emphasis on brewing and brands\\". Alchemy merged Ushers with 250 pubs in the Alehouse chain that they had acquired in June 1997, and replaced North with Robert Breare who came from a hotel background and proclaimed himself \\"a devotee of a major separation between brewing and retail\\". Breare claimed that the brewery was \\"big enough to make serious money. When it is close to capacity it is very, very profitable\\" but it was running at 70% of its 600,000 barrels-per-year capacity and was closed in 2000. The residual pub operator company, renamed Innspired Pubs plc, was bought by Punch Taverns in September 2004. Today, beers are brewed under the Usher name by the Wychwood Brewery for Refresh UK.  Legacy  The brewery equipment was sold for ¬£1.5M to North Korea via German broker Uwe Oehms. It now forms the core of the Taedonggang brewery, located just outside Pyongyang. In 2009, its new brew \\"Taedong River Beer\\" made international headlines after featuring in what is thought to be North Korean television's first beer advert. The main Trowbridge site was redeveloped into housing (including the Ushers Apartments) and a Sainsbury's supermarket. Ushers also occupied a site behind what is now River Way Industrial Estate, that housed various offices, a black room and workshops related to pub refurbishment/fitting. These buildings are now, for the most part, derelict and facing an uncertain future although the square building overlooking the railway line has been refurbished and houses the south west office of Fastglobe Mastics Ltd.

Many young writing talents joined the magazine, e.g. Georg Brandes (who wrote literary and theater criticism) in 1862, although he was fired in 1869 when his views diverged from those of the editors.

BBC News, 25 October 2009 in the Republic of Ingushetia, a federal subject of the Russian Federation. Aushev had taken over the opposition website, Ingushetia.org, after its owner, Magomed Yevloyev, a vocal critic of the Ingush government, was shot and killed while in police custody. Biography Aushev was a businessman and a member of a prominent Ingushetian family. In 2007, Aushev's son and nephew were both kidnapped. He blamed Ingush security forces under the control of then-President of Ingushetia Murat Zyazikov for the abductions. Aushev organized protests against the security forces and the Zyazikov government. In 2008, journalist Magomed Yevloyev, the owner of Ingushetia.org and a critic of the Zyazikov government, was shot and killed while in police custody. Aushev personally took over ownership of Ingushetia.org following Yevloyev's death. The Russian government removed Zyazikov in October 2008 and installed Yunus-Bek Yevkurov as president. Yevkurov offered dissidents in Ingushetia a certain amount of protection from politically motivated attacks. Aushev largely supported Yevkurov policies towards the opposition, and withdrew from his most vocal opposition to the government since Yevkurov's installation. Aushev accepted a position on a human rights council set up by the ombudsman of Russia's federal government. However, he remained a vocal critic of former President Zyazikov and his relatives, as well as the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russian special forces in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Aushev survived an attempted kidnapping in September 2009. In an interview with an Australian television network, he revealed that he had ‚Äúvery strong information that I was going to be killed‚Äù during the failed abduction. On October 25, 2009, Aushev was shot and killed on the spot when gunmen attacked his car on a road near Nalchik in the neighboring Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. He was buried in the Ingush village of Surkhakhi. Post-death On 8 December 2009, Aushev was posthumously awarded the Russian Federation's human rights ombudsman's medal ‚Äú‚Äù ('). In a 2013 RT documentary, Blood and Honor: Chechen Vendetta Code, Aushev's father, Magomed Aushev, states that he has spent more than $1 million trying to track down his son's killers. Magomed said he would forgive his son's killers only if they came to him first.

Perhaps her greatest accomplishment was the reversal of the liberation of Iceland that the colorful, erratic, former Royal Navy seaman and privateer J√∏rgen J√∏rgensen had carried out. Talbot was sold in 1815 for mercantile service. Renamed George, she interspersed several voyages to Ceylon and India with three voyages as a whaler. She was last listed in 1831. Talbot Class Talbot was the lead ship for a class of two sloops; her sister ship was . Both were enlarged versions of the Cormorant-class ship-sloop. In 1811 the Admiralty re-rated Talbot and Coquette as 20-gun post ships. Service The Admiralty commissioned Talbot in September 1807 under Commander the Honourable Alexander Jones, who about a year later sailed her to Portugal. In 1808 Jones and Talbot took three prizes: Lykens Proven (14 April), Union (17 May), and Bon Jesus e Almar (9 May). In 1809 Talbot was in the North Sea where she captured several prizes: Twee Gebroederss (26 April), Bagatellen (29 April), Neskelaen (30 April), Emanuel (2 May), Providentia (10 May), Gestina and Nautilus (18 May), and Sara Catharina (19 May). The most notable, but still minor, capture occurred on 13 June when Talbot captured the Danish privateer Loven, off the Naze of Norway. Loven had two long guns, which she had dismounted during the chase, and a crew of 11. She had left Norway that morning and had made no captures. Talbot entered the harbour at Reykjav√≠k on 14 August. After some investigation Jones took J√∏rgen J√∏rgensen into custody. J√∏rgensen had arrested the Danish governor and proclaimed himself \\"His Excellency, the Protector of Iceland, Commander in Chief by Land and Sea\\". With Talbots arrival, the Danish government was restored and J√∏rgensen was taken to England, where he ended up in prison for more than a year, but for breaking parole after his earlier capture by , not for his adventures in Iceland. On 14 November, three Danish sloops arrived at Leith, prizes to Talbot, the sloop Charles, and the cutter Hero.Lloyd's List, no.4408, - accessed 28 March 2015. In 1811, Captain Spelman Swaine commanded Talbot on the Irish station. On 30 November she was in company with the frigate as they sailed from Lough Swilly, Donegal, where they were based. Four days later a gale caught them in the Lough. Saldanha foundered with the loss of her entire crew; Talbot got out to sea and survived. Later Talbot protected merchants sailing to and from Newfoundland and the West Indies.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.81. On 5 August 1812, Talbot captured the American ship Rhoda and Betsey. Swaine transferred to on 28 April 1814 after Lieutenant Thomas Walbeoff Cecil of killed Captain Hassard Stackpole, of Statira, in a duel. (Cecil was promoted into but died of yellow fever in 1814.) Swaine's successor, in April 1814, was Captain Henry Haynes. Disposal: In September 1814 Captain William Dowers took command of Talbot. Captain Archibald Tisdall succeeded him in July 1815. She was paid off in August or September 1815 before the Admiralty sold her on 23 November for ‚Ç§1,610 for mercantile use. Talbot entered mercantile service as George. Post-script to Talbots naval career: Early in 1815 Talbot captured John, an American merchant vessel. However, it turned out that the US and Great Britain had signed a peace treaty on Christmas Eve 1814, so she was not a prize. Furthermore, John was lost to \\"the perils of the sea\\" while in custody, leading to a suit by her owners against Talbots captain. That suit was dismissed, but the United States claimed on behalf of the owners against the British government, and the court judged that the government did owe compensation. The settlement took place after 1853.Cobbett (1909-13), pp.229-232. Merchantman In 1813 the British East India Company (EIC) had lost its monopoly on the trade between England and India. Many owners, including Georges, then sailed in that trade under a license from the EIC. Renamed George, the ship first appeared in the 1816 volume of Lloyd's Register with R.M. Arle, master, Johnson & Co. owner, and trade London‚ÄìBengal.Lloyd's Register (1816), Supple. pages \\"G\\", Seq.‚ÑñG8. The 1816 volume misreported her burthen as 424 tons, but the 1818 volume corrected that; in 1818 her trade was listed as London‚ÄìCalcutta.Lloyd's Register (1818), Seq.‚ÑñG106. On 14 September 1817 R.M. Arle sailed George for Fort William, India.Lloyd's Register (1818), \\"Licensed and Country Ships\\". On Georges return, Johnson sent her on the first of three whaling voyages. First whaling voyage (1818‚Äì1822): Captain Bonifal or Bunnifer or Bunfer or Thompson sailed from England on 1 December 1818, bound for the Gal√°pagos Islands. She returned on 4 June 1822 with 65 casks of sperm oil, 35 casks of \\"headmatter\\", and 50 casks of whale and elephant oil.British Southern Whale Fishery Voyages: George. Second whaling voyage (1822‚Äìc.1825): Captain Fitch sailed George to Peru in 1822. She was reported to have been on the coast of \\"Chili\\" in 1824 with some 1799 barrels. There is no record of the date of her return. Voyages to Ceylon and India: The Register of Shipping for 1826 shows George with Berscan (or Burscan), master, and trade London‚ÄìCeylon. She apparently sailed for Ceylon in 1825. The 1827 volume shows Captain Clark replacing Berscan, and then Captain Fulcher replacing Clark. On 10 April 1827 Captain Fulcher and George sailed from Gravesend, bound for India. George was carrying several families of missionaries for Quilon.Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle, Volume 5, p.219. Third whaling voyage (1828‚Äì1831): Captain M'Alley (or McCully) left England on 28 July 1828, bound for new Zealand and the Pacific Ocean. George was reported to have been at New Zealand 1 February 1829, the Kingsmill Islands in May‚ÄìJune, and Tongatapu in November. In July 1830 she was at San Francisco. She returned to England on 27 May 1831 with 209 casks sperm oil and headmatter. Fate George was no longer listed in either Lloyd's Register or the Register of Shipping in 1832.

As of 2015, it is the home of women's association football club FC Roseng√•rd, currently playing in Damallsvenskan; the men's clubs Malm√∂ FF and IFK Malm√∂ have played there in the past. The stadium is the third largest in Malm√∂ behind Malm√∂ Stadion and Stadion, the current home grounds of IFK Malm√∂ and Malm√∂ FF respectively. The Sweden national football team has played at Malm√∂ IP twice, in 1929 and 1949. The stadium's capacity has changed throughout the years with various redevelopments and renovations; it is today 7,600, but was historically much higher. The record attendance at the ground was set on 1 June 1956 when 22,436 people attended an Allsvenskan match between Malm√∂ FF and Helsingborgs IF. The stadium was built as a multi-purpose sports field between March and July 1896 with a grand opening on 4 July 1896. IFK Malm√∂ took up residence at the ground in 1903, with Malm√∂ FF also doing so seven years later; both remained until 1958, when they moved to Malm√∂ Stadion, which had just been built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Extensive redevelopment and restoration was carried out between 1978 and 1980, and in 1999; the two Malm√∂ clubs returned following this latter renovation, but Malm√∂ FF went back to Malm√∂ Stadion after a single season. The laying of artificial turf before the 2008 season led IFK to return to Malm√∂ Stadion in protest. The stadium is located on the northern side of Malm√∂'s largest park, Pildammsparken, with Malm√∂ Stadion and Stadion both to the park's south. History Construction and early history (1896‚Äì1938) Malm√∂ IP was built in 1896 to host cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, athletics and tennis events.Smitt, 2009, p. 11. Cycling competitions had been organised by Malm√∂ Velocipedklubb (MVK) since 24 August 1890, at a temporary sports field in R√∂rsj√∂staden. This was also the venue for the first association football match in Malm√∂, a friendly match on 12 October 1890 featuring Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub of Denmark.Smitt, 2009, p. 11. The members of MVK were impressed by the new sport and started a football section of their own. After the R√∂rsj√∂staden field was earmarked for a new housing development in 1893, MVK began to explore the idea of a new ground.Billing, 1996, p. 10. The club pitched this to the local municipality, Malm√∂ Stad, which in February 1894 presented plans for a new sports field in the north-east of the city, in what is today Teatern, a neighbourhood in Innerstaden district. The MVK board consulted its members, then agreed and signed a 15-year lease on the site.Billing, 1996, p. 12. The old entrance of Malm√∂ IP, as it appeared in the early 20th century To raise funds for the ground's construction and the annual lease payments, an aktiebolag (limited company) called AB Malm√∂ Idrottsplats was formed in March 1896 under the chairmanship of Carl Frick, a locally-born sea captain and sports enthusiast. The final construction costs for the new ground were 44,000 kronor, roughly 2,930,000 kronor in modern terms. The ground originally spanned ; an oval cycling track surrounded the grass pitch where association football and other sports were played.Billing, 1996, pp. 21‚Äì22. Construction began in March 1896 and ended in July the same year. Malm√∂ IP opened on 4 July 1896 with cycling competitions, accompanied by organised betting. MVK disbanded its cycling section in 1902, five years after Sweden outlawed gambling in 1897; this had caused attendances to plummet.Billing, 1996, p. 23. The construction of a large pavilion in the centre of the pitch in 1899 made football impossible, contributing to the end of MVK's football section in 1900; the sport had so far failed to win much local popularity in any case.Billing, 1996, p. 33. After football became more popular in Malm√∂ in the early 1900s, the pavilion was removed in 1905, with a new pitch concurrently laid out. On 18 September 1897, Malm√∂ IP hosted a large celebration marking King Oscar II's Silver Jubilee; over 10,000 people attended. The ground continues to be used on events such as national holidays to the present day.Billing, 1996, p. 35. Athletics overtook football and cycling competitions at Malm√∂ IP after MVK's exit and the foundation of IFK Malm√∂ in April 1899. IFK arranged events such as the 100 metres, the mile run, early forms of the high jump, and pentathlons involving the long jump, javelin throw, 100 metres, discus throw and wrestling. Equestrianism was popular at Malm√∂ IP around the turn of the century, and ice skating was held during the Swedish winter months. Crown Prince Gustaf, who later became King Gustav V, attended one of IFK's athletics competitions on 7 November 1901, and reportedly enjoyed the experience very much. When he was stationed at Malm√∂ three years later during his military education, he regularly returned to the ground to play tennis. played tennis at Malm√∂ IP when he was stationed in Malm√∂ during his military education in 1904. This bust of Carl Frick, the chairman of AB Malm√∂ Idrottsplats, is today outside Malm√∂ IP The most successful and first club dedicated solely to football in these early years was Malm√∂ BI (then abbreviated MBI, and now called FC Roseng√•rd after various changes of name), which was founded in 1904 by former MVK players, and based at Malm√∂ IP. The ground also became home to IFK Malm√∂'s football division, which was formed in 1903. A third club, Malm√∂ FF, took up residence at the stadium following its own foundation on 24 February 1910 by 19 men at the Malm√∂ IP restaurant.Smitt, 2009, p. 14. Several members of IFK Malm√∂'s athletics division left the club on 26 August 1908 due to differences in opinion regarding its administration; the dissidents formed Malm√∂ Allm√§nna Idrottsf√∂rening (MAI) two weeks later. Swedish javelin thrower Eric Lemming set two new world records in the first international competition that MAI hosted on 10‚Äì11 July 1909. Following the banning of betting in Sweden, as well as other events such as rainy summers and wet winters, AB Malm√∂ Idrottsplats started to have financial difficulties and applied to the municipality for help.Billing, 1996, p. 32. The annual lease payments were cancelled in 1899 and replaced with a subsidy of 1,500 kronor a year, conditional on local schoolchildren receiving free access to the pitch for a few hours each day. Stora Hallen (\\"The great hall\\"), an adjoining building that had served first as a tennis arena, then riding stables, was redeveloped in 1910 into a dance hall and restaurant called Boston Palace. This was done in the hope of increasing the ground's profits as it was struggling financially. The redevelopment was criticised by some who contended that dancing was an immoral pastime with nothing to do with sport. The financial difficulties continued into the 1910s and the city was forced to raise the yearly grant for Malm√∂ IP.Billing, 1996, p. 58. IFK Malm√∂ and Malm√∂ FF, the city's main association football clubs, by this time regularly played home games at the ground. When Malm√∂ hosted the Baltic Exhibition in 1914, Malm√∂ IP hosted relevant sporting events during June and July.Billing, 1996, p. 62. The exhibition forced the municipality to rearrange the area surrounding the sports field and the surrounding road network was redrawn. Malm√∂ IP was given a large compensation for this as the sports field area was affected by the changes.Billing, 1996, p. 61. The sports field surpassed into municipal ownership in 1938 when AB Malm√∂ Idrottsplats's financial difficulties became too great to bear. There was also widespread criticism from minor sport clubs in Malm√∂ against the company's tendency to favour the bigger clubs such as IFK Malm√∂, Malm√∂ FF and athletics club MAI.Billing, 1996, p. 152. Malm√∂ Stad therefore voted to nationalise the ownership of both Malm√∂ IP and other sport fields in the city in 1935, the motion passed with a small margin, 25 voted for nationalization and 23 voted for continued private ownership.Billing, 1996, p. 154. Lengthy negotiations between AB Malm√∂ Idrottsplats and the municipality's sports committee began in 1935 and ended in 1937 with a settlement of 160,000 kronor, roughly 4,600,000 kronor in modern terms.Billing, 1996, p. 157. The municipality formally took over Malm√∂ IP on 1 January 1938. Municipal ownership; plans for a new stadium (1938‚Äì58) Association football and athletic clubs continued to share Malm√∂ IP after the municipal takeover. The events that attracted the biggest crowd in the 1930s and the 1940s were Malm√∂ FF's home matches in Allsvenskan, which could attract capacity crowds of 14,000 spectators.Billing, 1996, p. 164. After the capacity was increased, the record for attendance was broken again in 1939 when MAI hosted a competition honouring 25 years since the 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malm√∂; over 25,000 people attended over two days.Billing, 1996, p. 174. MAI also hosted other international competitions that brought large crowds to the sports field, including Amerikagalorna (The America galas), which involved visiting athletes from the United States and Swedish sportsmen and women.Billing, 1996, pp. 173‚Äì174. Sture M√•rtensson (left) of Malm√∂ FF receives his gold medal at Malm√∂ IP at the end of the 1944 season, when the club first won the Swedish championship Malm√∂ IP's future came into official discussion first in 1933 with the proposed building of the Malm√∂ Opera and Music Theatre; the original plans called for Malm√∂ IP and the surrounding area to be completely demolished. The theatre was ultimately built on the edge of the stadium grounds, and only some nearby structures had to be destroyed‚Äîhowever, these included the building in which Malm√∂ FF had been founded in 1910. The ground's main entrance was moved from the north to the east, where it remains to this day. A commemorative table was placed at the exact site of Malm√∂ FF's founding in 2010 as part of the club's centenary celebrations, in what is today the theatre's parking lot. Malm√∂ was one of the most successful sporting cities in Sweden during the 1940s and 1950s; its clubs won national championships in several sports.Billing, 1996, p. 201. Malm√∂ FF won their first football championship at Malm√∂ IP during the 1943‚Äì44 Allsvenskan season, and over the next decade and a half added another four league titles and five Svenska Cupen (Swedish Cup) wins. MAI, wrestling clubs Sparta and Enighet, IFK Malm√∂'s handball division and others also won Swedish championships during this time. Several major European football clubs visited Malm√∂ IP in the years following the Second World War to play friendlies against Malm√∂ FF; these included A.C. Milan of Italy and Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Charlton Athletic from England. These matches caused new attendance records to be set several times.Billing, 1996, pp. 209‚Äì210. Gunder H√§gg (right) and Arne Andersson (left) both set world records in the mile run at Malm√∂ IP Malm√∂ was affected by World War II more than most of Sweden, which was neutral, because of the city's close proximity to German-occupied Denmark, with the Danish capital Copenhagen just opposite Malm√∂ on the other side of the √òresund. During these years many public celebrations and events of national unification were celebrated at Malm√∂ IP such as the National Day of Sweden on 6 June 1941, when Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, who was born in Malm√∂, gave a speech.Billing, 1996, p. 196. Wartime athletics competitions for military recruits were also held; events included the throwing of grenades.Billing, 1996, p. 195. Athletics continued to draw large crowds to Malm√∂ IP during the 1940s, when Gunder H√§gg and Arne Andersson battled at the running tracks. The world record for the mile run was beaten twice at the stadiumSmitt, 2009, p. 13.‚Äîfirst by Andersson on 18 July 1944, and then almost exactly a year later 17 July 1945 by H√§gg. By the 1950s it had become clear to the local authorities that Malm√∂'s interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malm√∂ IP to accommodate. Malm√∂ FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the Scanian derby game between Malm√∂ FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951‚Äîamid considerable commotion in the stands some people were pushed against poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured.Billing, 1996, p. 216. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malm√∂ IP to be too small for major events, but council members differed on where to build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954,Billing, 1996, pp. 246‚Äì247. when Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup, with matches to take place in Malm√∂. The new ground's location was a central issue in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in J√§gersro, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malm√∂, near the city's main park, Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. Malm√∂ Stadion was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malm√∂ IP. Malm√∂ FF and IFK Malm√∂ both moved to Malm√∂ Stadion on its completion in 1958. Reduced prominence; threatened demolition and first renovation (1958‚Äì1995) The departure of Malm√∂ FF and IFK to Malm√∂ Stadion caused Malm√∂ IP, which had been the centre of sport in the city since 1896, to lose much of its prominence. MAI also relocated much of its operations to the new Stadion, though it still used Malm√∂ IP for training and some national competitions.Billing, 1996, p. 251. All international events were moved to Malm√∂ Stadion. The last major athletics tournament at Malm√∂ IP was held in May 1970. Participants included Ricky Bruch, a champion discus thrower who went on to represent Sweden in the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.Billing, 1996, p. 255. MAI left Malm√∂ IP altogether in 1971 for the H√§sthagen neighbourhood, where a new sports field had opened.Billing, 1996, p. 267. A football match between Malm√∂ FF and Helsingborgs IF in Allsvenskan on 15 April 1945. The Northern Stand, which remains to this day, is visible in the background. Despite the exit of Malm√∂ FF and IFK Malm√∂, Malm√∂ IP continued to host less football, albeit in a less prominent capacity. The two major clubs continued to use the ground for friendlies and pre-season fixtures.Billing, 1996, p. 256. Less prominent clubs such as Malm√∂ BI and IF Allians played at the stadium in lower divisions, mainly in the third and fourth tiers of Swedish football.Billing, 1996, pp. 256‚Äì259. Malm√∂ BI moved to the Roseng√•rd area in 1973, and IF Allians later moved to Kronprinsen.Billing, 1996, p. 259. Ice hockey club Malm√∂ FF Ishockey, who had played on a rink at Malm√∂ IP since their founding in 1947, moved to the new Malm√∂ Isstadion in 1970.Billing, 1996, pp. 259‚Äì261. Hockey games at Malm√∂ IP during the 1960s attracted crowds of around 2,500. Team handball, which had been played at the tennis hall across the road from the main ground from the 1930s, endured until 1964, when the handball divisions of Malm√∂ BI, IFK Malm√∂ and Malm√∂ FF moved to the new Baltiska hallen at Stadionomr√•det, near Malm√∂ Stadion.Billing, 1996, pp. 262‚Äì263. On 26 October 1961 Malm√∂ Stad announced that Malm√∂ IP would be demolished to make room for a new city hall. The initial plans earmarked the entire ground for demolition, but the negotiations and bureaucratic procedure dragged on for over a decade. The ground and its facilities deteriorated over this time, leading many of its tenants to move elsewhere. The municipality eventually dismissed the demolition plans and decided in July 1975 to renovate the stadium instead. Planning for this was concluded in 1978, and two years later the work was completed. Apart from the Northern Stand, dating back to the 1920s, all of Malm√∂ IP's stands, buildings and facilities were destroyed;Billing, 1996, p. 270. new dressing rooms and running tracks were built, but new stands were not. Malm√∂ IP became a centre for the city's minor sports teams,Billing, 1996, p. 271. hosting school tournaments, amateur football and sports such as rugby. Second renovation and modern history (since 1995) The Southern Stand, built as part of the extensive restoration completed in 1999. In early 1995, largely on the initiative of Malm√∂ FF's vice-chairman Bengt Madsen, Malm√∂ FF and IFK Malm√∂ created a joint project group regarding the future of Malm√∂ IP. This body decided to completely renovate Malm√∂ IP for a second time, constructing new stands and removing the running tracks to create a stadium exclusively for football.Billing, 1996, p. 277. This decision was the result of both clubs' declining attendances during the 1990s‚ÄîMalm√∂ FF were averaging crowds of less than 5,000 at Malm√∂ Stadion, while IFK were attracting less than 1,000 by 1999.Alsj√∂, 2011, p. 199.Alsj√∂, 2011, p. 150. Malm√∂ Stadion's capacity of 27,500 was therefore far too much for both sides. When Malm√∂ IP formally reopened on 1 August 1999, both Malm√∂ FF and IFK moved back, but Malm√∂ FF officials soon decided that the refurbished ground was too small and lacked the safety facilities Malm√∂ Stadion offered. After only a few months, following Malm√∂ FF's relegation from the Swedish top flight at the end of the 1999 season, the club moved back to Malm√∂ Stadion. IFK Malm√∂ remained at Malm√∂ IP until 2008, when they also moved back to Malm√∂ Stadion in protest at the decision to lay artificial turf at Malm√∂ IP instead of grass. Malm√∂ FF frequently use Malm√∂ IP for pre-season friendlies, since the artificial turf makes it possible to play during the Swedish winter months. Since Malm√∂ FF's centenary in 2010, the club has maintained a tradition of playing a friendly at Malm√∂ IP each year on 24 February, the anniversary of the club's foundation. In 2006, the women's association football club Malm√∂ FF Dam started to use the ground regularly for games in Damallsvenskan, the top level of Swedish women's football. The club has since been renamed twice and has been called FC Roseng√•rd since 2013. Structure and facilities Malm√∂ IP has an overall capacity of 7,600 spectators, of which 3,900 are seated. It comprises five larger stands and one smaller stand. The main stand is the Southern Stand, which is all-seated and located along one of the long sides of the pitch. The Western and Eastern Stands, at opposite ends of the ground behind the two goals, are respectively terraced and seated. Opposite the Southern Stand are three inconsistent structures‚Äîfrom west to east, a stand with terracing, another with seats and a small standing area with a canopy. The dugouts, changing rooms and referees' facilities are located in the Southern Stand, which also features a small cafeteria. A sports hall called Tennishallen (\\"The tennis hall\\"), across the road from the Eastern Stand, is also considered part of the stadium. The stadium's structure and facilities have gone through many changes since it first opened in 1896. The ground originally comprised a football pitch surrounded by an oval cycling track; a main stand was on the pitch's southern side, with a smaller stand opposite. Both stands were terraced.Billing, 1996, p. 21. A larger stand, built on the northern side of the pitch in the early 1920s, is still in use, and is considered a landmark building by the city municipality‚Äîmodifications to it are therefore illegal. A larger, improved Southern Stand was built in 1931, the same year of the tennis hall's construction.Billing, 1996, p. 148. The tennis hall was built as part of the same plot, but it now stands on the other side of a road that was built through the grounds in 1945.Billing, 1996, p. 198. The Northern Stand originally had a restaurant behind it and a large hall next to it, but these were knocked down in 1944 to make room for the Malm√∂ Opera and Music Theatre.Billing, 1996, p. 199. When Malm√∂ IP was renovated during the 1990s, the old running tracks were removed and new stands were built close to the pitch. The only major change since 1999 has been the change from a natural grass pitch to artificial turf in 2008. In late 2013 the artificial turf was relaid to meet new regulations and standards‚Äîthe new pitch includes an under- soil heating system to allow use in all weather conditions. International football Malm√∂ IP has hosted two Sweden international matches: one friendly and one match in the Nordic Football Championship. Records A graph showing Malm√∂ FF's average attendances at Malm√∂ IP between 1921 and 1958 The record for highest attendance at Malm√∂ IP was set on 1 June 1956, when 22,436 spectators saw the Allsvenskan match between Malm√∂ FF and Helsingborgs IF. Helsingborgs won 3‚Äì0.Smitt, 2009, p. 278. Malm√∂ FF's first league game at the stadium was a Division 2 game against IS Halmia on 2 May 1920; Malm√∂ FF won 3‚Äì0 in front of 1,277 fans.Smitt, 2009, p. 258. Average attendances during Malm√∂ FF's first seasons at the ground were below 1,000 people, except for the 1922 season when Malm√∂ FF played in Svenska Serien, then the unofficial top flight. Apart from 1922, Malm√∂ FF played in the second tier of Swedish football until the 1931‚Äì32 season, when they entered Allsvenskan for the first time. Attendances rose sharply to an average of around 7,000 per game. Gates continued to increase year on year until they peaked during the 1949‚Äì50 season, when Malm√∂ FF completed the league season unbeaten‚Äîan average of 17,290 people attended the club's home games. As of 2015, this is the third highest average attendance in Malm√∂ FF's history. Attendances varied for Malm√∂ FF's final seasons at the stadium in the 1950s, around an average of about 15,000 spectators. The club's last league game at the stadium except for 1999, on 15 May 1958 against IFK Eskilstuna, attracted 10,013 spectators.Smitt, 2009, p. 279. Transportation Triangeln, the closest railway station to Malm√∂ IP Malm√∂ IP is served by Malm√∂ bus lines 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8, all of which stop at Triangeln railway station, which opened in December 2010 as part of Citytunneln. The station is served by P√•gat√•g and √ñresund Trains, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the √ñresund Region. The closest parking location to Malm√∂ IP is \\"P-huset Malm√∂ IP\\", a garage with 419 parking spaces next to the stadium. There are also several parking spaces on the ground's southern side, opposite Malm√∂ Opera and Music Theatre. Apart from these two parking areas, there are various other residential parking spaces, and a large number of bicycle stands nearby. Malm√∂ IP is about 15‚Äì20 minutes' walking distance from Malm√∂ Stadion and Stadion, on the other side of Pildammsparken.

He previously played for the Newcastle Knights, Penrith Panthers and the Wests Tigers in the NRL. On the 22 May 2018 Naiqama signed a three year contract with St. Helens. Background Naiqama was born in Sutherland, New South Wales, Australia, and is of Fijian descent. He played his junior football for the Arncliffe Scots, before being signed by the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Naiqama is the younger brother of former London Broncos player and Fijian international, Wes Naiqama. Playing career Early career After playing with the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Naiqama joined the Newcastle Knights alongside his brother Wes in 2008. He played for the Knights' NYC team in 2008 and 2009, scoring 21 tries in 33 games. 2009 Naiqama played for Fiji in the 2009 Pacific Cup. 2010 Moving to the Knights' New South Wales Cup team Central Coast Centurions, Naiqama played for the New South Wales Residents against the Queensland Residents at ANZ Stadium as a curtain raiser to Game three of the State of Origin series. In Round 26, Naiqama made his NRL debut for the Knights against the Melbourne Storm on the wing in the 34-4 loss at AAMI Park. At the end of 2010, Naiqama was named on the wing in the New South Wales Cup Team of the Year. 2011 Naiqama playing for the Central Coast Centurions in 2011. In June, Naiqama re-signed with the Knights on a 1-year contract, but did not make an appearance for the Knights in the 2011 season. 2012 On 3 August, Naiqama re-signed with the Knights on a 1-year contract. In Round 17 against the Parramatta Eels at Parramatta Stadium, he scored his first NRL try in the Knights' 20-12 win. He finished the season with 8 matches and 7 tries. 2013 On 21 June, Naiqama signed a 2-year contract with the Penrith Panthers starting in 2014, to join his older brother Wes. Knights coach Wayne Bennett told Naiqama to move clubs and further his career as he was behind representative players Darius Boyd, James McManus and Akuila Uate at the Knights. He finished the 2013 season having played in 6 matches and scoring 2 tries. At the end of the season, he played for Fiji at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, playing in 5 matches and scoring 1 try. Hercules 2014 In February, Naiqama played for the Panthers at the inaugural Auckland Nines. In Round 2 against the Melbourne Storm, he made his Panthers debut, scoring a double in the 18-17 loss. On 3 May, he played for Fiji in the 2014 Pacific Rugby League International, scoring a try in the 32-16 loss. He finished off the NRL season with 8 matches and 7 tries. On 10 October 2014, Naiqama signed a 1-year contract with the Wests Tigers starting in 2015. 2015 Naiqama made his first appearance for the Wests Tigers in the Auckland Nines. After what the Sydney Morning Herald called an \\"impressive showing\\", he said, \\"I'm the fittest and fastest I have felt in a couple of years, having done my first full pre-season in two years.\\" With regular winger David Nofoaluma recovering from injury, Naiqama was named in the starting side for the opening games of the season. In round 1 against the Gold Coast Titans, Naiqama made his debut for the Wests Tigers in the 19-18 loss at Robina Stadium. In Round 2 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Naiqama scored his first try for the Tigers in the 22-4 win at Campbelltown Stadium. On 15 April 2015, Naiqama signed a two-year extension with the club. In round 8 against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Naiqama did one of the best try assists of the year, when he miraculously flicked a ball, that looked go over the dead ball line, back to James Tedesco. When asked about his try assist being similar to Greg Inglis's in the 2008 ANZAC Test, Naiqama said \\"I think his was more acrobatic than mine. But it was just real lucky to pull it off and get the try in the end\\". On 2 May, Naiqama played at fullback for Fiji against Papua New Guinea in the 2015 Melanesian Cup. From Round 21 onwards, when David Nofoaluma returned from injury, Naiqama was shifted from the wing to centre. Naiqama finished his first year with the Wests Tigers with 9 tries from 24 matches. 2016 Naiqama was named in the Tigers Auckland Nines squad. Remaining at right centre in 2016, Naiqama scored his first treble in the Round 3 match against the Titans in the 30-18 loss at Robina Stadium. By mid-season, he was named as one of the most improved players of the year, and it was said he had, \\"become a genuinely dangerous player down the Tigers' right side, appearing in every game this season. His success is the result of nothing but hard work and persistence.\\" Naiqama finished the season with 11 tries from 23 matches. On 8 October, Naiqama represented Fiji in a test against Samoa in Apia, captaining the team to a 20‚Äì18 victory. 2017 In February, Naiqama played in the Auckland Nines. On 6 May, Naiqama again played as captain and fullback for Fiji against Tonga in the 2017 Pacific Cup. He set up a try for Ben Nakubuwai just before half time in the thrilling match but they unfortunately lost 26-24 in the dying minutes. Naiqama made 23 appearances for Wests Tigers, playing centre and wing, and covering fullback when James Tedesco was injured. At season's end, he signed an extension to stay at the club for another year. Naiqama noted he was \\"stoked\\" to be staying, and coach Ivan Cleary said, \\"Kevin has shown great versatility for the team this year covering a number of positions and has handled himself exceptionally well.\\" Playing in his second World Cup, but his first as captain of Fiji, Naiqama gained attention when he was seen crying during his team's national anthem before the first game. He scored two tries in that match against the USA, and another in the match against Italy for three tries from five games. Coach Mick Potter said of his captaincy, \\"The position he plays is good for him to be captain. He can boss a few people around but he also shows composure under pressure. I think that's really important. He speaks well, he speaks rugby league. He doesn't talk rubbish and he gets to the point very quickly.\\" 2018 Naiqama made 20 appearances for Wests in the 2018 NRL season as the club finished in 9th place on the table and missed out on the finals. 2019 After his contract ran out with the Wests Tigers, Naiqama joined English side St Helens.

Ithaka Darin Pappas lived and recorded in Lisbon, Portugal, from 1992 to 1998. His poem \\"So Get Up\\" (then entitled \\"So Get Up, The End Of The Earth Is Upon Us\\") was written and first vocalized on December 13th of 1992 for a program called Quarto Bairro on R√°dio Comercial in Lisbon. The station's radio presenter, Pedro Costa, recorded Ithaka's voice live on-air. Two months later, in March 1993, a techno-pop demo was made in Manchester, England, with a student engineer-producer. The initial 'publicly released, physically manufactured' musical element backing the poem was created in 1994 by DJ Vibe and Doctor J aka Underground Sound of Lisbon (or USL) who invited Ithaka (at that time using an alias name, Korvowrong) to re-record the poem as a guest vocalist on their first release. USL's nine-minute progressive house version of \\"So Get Up\\" appeared on the B-side of their \\"Chapter One\\" 12-inch vinyl release. In Portugal this was distributed by Kaos Records, and worldwide by Tribal UK and U.S. label Twisted Records. It soon became a major Portuguese dance music \\"national anthem\\" and influenced a large populace of Portuguese youth to get interested in house music, famous for Ithaka's shouting \\"The end of the earth is upon us. Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust, So Get Up!, forget the past, go outside and have a blast!\\" In 1994, the UK edition of the single, had several remixes by Danny Tenaglia and Junior Vasquez as well as an original mix and two different a cappella variations. This first international edition sold approximately 80,000 copies, with over a million copies of the song sold between 1994-1995 via international compilations, reaching the #1 ranking on specialized dance music charts around the world. Thru the last three decades, So Get Up under varying titles such as; \\"Get Up\\", \\"Insane\\", \\"Go Insane\\", \\"Get Up! Go Insane!\\", \\"Forget The Past\\", \\"Next Life\\", \\"See You In The Next Life\\" \\"The End Of The Earth\\", \\"The End Of The Earth Is Upon Us\\", \\"Hardventure\\", \\"Headcharge\\", \\"Hurt\\",https://www.beatport.com/track/hurt-original-mix/11070996 \\"Belther\\", \\"Last Resurrection\\", \\"Earthquake\\", \\"PPF (Past Present Future)\\", \\"Intensity\\", \\"My Tripcreator\\", \\"Viginti Etduo\\", \\"Trance Line\\", \\"Zombie\\", \\"All Points North\\", \\"Speed O.J.\\", etc. has been remixed, sampled and released in a multitude of EDM styles on the records of; Fatboy Slim, Stretch n Vern, Oxia, Peter Bailey, Orion's Voice, JJ Mullor, Dani Sbert, Lexington Avenue, Dylan, Derek Marin, Public Domain, K-Traxx, Technoboy, Bob Ray & Van Dyuk, Ben Gold, Pelari, Meat Katie and many others. In 1995, a remix of So Get Up, retitled \\"Trance Line\\" by the Madrid production team Committee (Dimas Carbajo and J.J. De La Fuente) rose to #3 in January of 1995 on the Billboard Singles Charts for Spain, remaining in the Top Ten for more than a month. Committee's Trance Line versions, which also had several mixes of their own utilized all of Ithaka's original vocal, but none of Underground Sound Of Lisbon's instrumental. In 2003, Miss Kittin used the entire \\"So Get Up\\" poem as part of the intro on her album Radio Caroline Vol.1. Six remixes were initially made of \\"So Get Up\\" in 2014, but because two a capellas were included in the first U.S. and U.K. releases on Tribal Records, rogue musical versions using the vocal have snowballed out of control. Hundreds of House, Hardstyle, Progressive House, Speedcore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKPxHV8cTck,Trance, Techno, Tech House, Industrial,Rock, Dubstep and Gabber producers have simply placed the So Get Up vocal on their own instrumentals and called them their own (sometimes with subtle title changes, but often just as \\"So Get Up\\"). To date, there are now several hundred released remixes using Ithaka Darin Pappas' original vocal recording. As of late 2016, So Get Up now holds the distinction of being the most remixed vocal a cappella in musical history (Guinness World Record Holder 2016). \\"So Get Up\\" by its individual producers and DJs has been played or performed at large-scale dance parties around the global such as the Electric Daisy Carnival in New York and Orlando (2016) as interpreted by Cosmic Gate. In early 2017, Armin Van Buuren opened a vinyl set at his own A State of Trance festival in Utrecht, Netherlands by playing the \\"So Get Up\\" a capella from 1994. Lyrics \\"So Get Up\\" lyricist/vocalist Ithaka Darin Pappas in 1992 The end of the earth is upon us. Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust. So get up. Forget the past. Go outside and have a blast. Go a thousand miles in a jet airplane. Go out of your mind go insane. To a place you never been before. Eat ice cream or you'll lick the floor. 'Cause, the end of the earth is upon us. Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust. Goodbye my friends. Goodbye world. I'll see you in the next life. Sorted film appearance (2000) In the year 2000, a trance remix of Ithaka's \\"So Get Up\\" (entitled \\"See You In The Next Life\\") by Italian DJs, Atlantis, appeared during the closing titles sequence of the British feature film Sorted, directed by Alexander Jovy and starring Matthew Rhys, Sienna Guillory, Ben Moor and Tim Curry. The soundtrack also includes songs by; Leftfield, Morcheeba, Public Enemy, Elvis Presley, Matt Darey, Southsugar, The Turtles, Mauro Picotto, Paul Johnson, Aphrodite, Agnelli & Nelson, Funky G, Gibson Brothers, St. Etienne, Kadda Cherif Hadria, Disposable Disco Dubs, Six Degrees, Da Hool, Highgate, Art Of Trance, Scott 4, Depeche Mode, Twisted Pair, Lost Tribe, and CRW.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221563/soundtrack https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221563/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm/ http://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/453909/Sorted/full-credits.html \\"So Get Up\\" controversies In December of 1992, Ithaka had originally written and recited the poem called \\"So Get Up\\" (The End Of The Earth Is Upon Us) for his weekly segment of a program called Quarto Bairro on R√°dio Comercial in Lisbon, Portugal. The next year he rerecorded it as a guest performer to be the primary vocal of a B-side single for the Portuguese dance music group called Underground Sound Of Lisbon. The song became an instant national hit and was soon released internationally as a ten-mix, double-vinyl set on New York's Tribal Records (a subsidiary of I.R.S. Records/E.M.I. Records). The song climbed to 1st place on the Billboard's Independent Dance Music Charts for the U.K.‚Äîand number 52nd in the United States. Since 1995, the song has been remixed over a thousand times including versions by such performers as Fat Boy Slim, Junior Vasquez, Danny Tenaglia, and Cosmic Gate, and has appeared on over one hundred compilations with combined sales in the millions. As the original music has been stripped away by each succeeding producer, the only singularly unifying element of all 1,000+ mixes of \\"So Get Up\\" is Ithaka's poem and his vocals. The song, which was considered the first modern \\"Portuguese\\" musical export, was released without a featuring Ithaka credit, even though Ithaka (a Californian who was only temporarily residing in Lisbon) is the primary publishing rights owner of the track and never a member of the Underground Sound Of Lisbon project. Reportedly no record royalties were ever paid to Ithaka Darin Pappas. In 1999, Samsung in Korea featured a version of \\"So Get Up\\" (remixed by U.K. Breakbeat duo, Stretch N Vern) for a national My Jet printer ad series featuring actress Jun Ji-Hyun. According to almost all online biographical sources, the commercial transformed Ji-Hyun into a teen idol in Korea and today Jun Ji-Hyun is one of the most prominent celebrities in the entire country. The commercial, which was made by Cheil Communications, did not get authorization from either Ithaka or Stretch N Vern for the usage. In 2013, German Trance superstars Cosmic Gate also excluded Ithaka's vocal- lyrical credit even though they licensed the entire \\"So Get Up\\" a capella. Without a doubt, Cosmic Gate's version of has become the biggest commercial success of So Get Up to date. In October 2013, it charted at number 1 on Beatport's trance music charts after being featured on Armin Van Buuren's compilation A State of Trance 2013, on Hardwell On Air Episode 133 and on Cosmic Gate's album Start to Feel (2014), with additional mixes by Pelari, Alex di Stefano and Ben Gold. It has been a festival favorite for the group since its release, being performed at Amsterdam Dance Event, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival and on Cosmic Gate's own world tour.

A member of the Russian court, he was presented to Empress Catherine the Great by Grigory Potemkin and, after having been tested by Praskovja Bruce and doctor Rogerson, became the Empress' lover. He was most influential in the commercial development of Shklov and Mogilev. Early life Simeon (Sima) Gavriloviƒá Zoriƒá (), a Serb, was born in ƒåurug, a village at the time part of the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire (now ≈Ωabalj municipality, South Baƒçka, Serbia). His exact date of birth is unknown, though on May 11, 1754 he signed up for the Hussar regiment in Slavo-Serbia, citing his birth year as 1743 (which would make him 11 at the time). His Serbian name Simeon (Semyon in Russian), customarily indicates that he was born on September 1, the date Serbs venerate Saint Simeon Stylites. Semyon's father was Gavrilo Nerand≈æiƒá and his mother was Stefanija, the daughter of Jovan Zoriƒá, a military officer from the Potisje region (Tisa river basin), in the province of Vojvodina located in Serbia. The river Tisa flows between Banat and Baƒçka regions and was a strategic military frontier where the famed ≈†ajka≈°i in their armed vessels patrolled the major rivers (Danube, Tisa, Drava, Sava) keeping the Ottomans at bay. Semyon had a brother, David Nerand≈æiƒá, who later on served in the Imperial Russian army with him. Both the Nerand≈æiƒá and Zoriƒá families were close and lived in the Potisje military frontier of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before settling in Russia. Jovan Zoriƒá's wealthy nephew Maksim Zoriƒá had no male heir (only a daughter named Juliana) and in this customary way Semyon was adopted by his older cousin. The Russian government appealed in early 1750 to Serb settlers, creating two settlements in New Russia, called New Serbia and Slavo-Serbia. The region became a staging area and chief supply depot for troops intended for operations against the Turks. Slavo-Serbia was strategically located, bound by a line running from Dniepr along the middle course of the Samara to the Luganchik river. It became the new home of the Zoriƒá and Nerand≈æiƒá families, first settled by Maksim Zoriƒá in 1752 and two years later by his brother Vasilije and Simeon, Maksim's adopted son from the Nerand≈æiƒá family. Simeon who joined a cadet school in Slavo-Serbia as soon as he arrived in 1754, began showing great promise. He graduated from a cadet academy at St. Petersburg (1757), but his bent was decidedly towards his soldiering, and in 1757 he obtained a commission in the Hussar regiment. Military career  Simeon first joined the Hussar regiment when he was only fourteen years old in 1756, at the start of the Seven Years' War, and four years later (1760) he had distinguished himself on the front as a daring soldier still in his teens who won a reputation of valour in the wars against Prussia. And, for the next decade Zorich continued to build, during these troubled times, a reputation as a brave and distinguished cavalry officer. Zorich served in the light cavalry in the Russo-Turkish Wars, and distinguished himself by his daring and resourcefulness, even during capture. But in spite of a long record of excellent service under Rumyantsev, Suvorov and Krechetnikov, and of his aristocratic connections, his promotion was slow, until he was introduced by his stepfather to Catherine the Great and Potemkin, her lover of long standing. In the interval between the Polish-Lithuanian and Turkish wars, Zorich, who combined military gifts and courage, was also employed in an unofficial mission to Stockholm, and from then on became a paramour of Catherine II for almost a year until he came to loggerheads with Prince Potemkin. From 1760 to 1774, Zorich served against the Polish rebels under Pyotr Krechetnikov, sent by Peter the Great to intervene against the Bar Confederation, an association of Polish nobles formed at the fortress of Bar in Podolia, Prussia in the Seven Years's War (1756-1763) under Count Pyotr Saltykov, and participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774) under Pyotr Rumyantsev, distinguishing himself in nearly every important action, and quickly gained the reputation of being the bravest man there, winning engagement after engagement by sheer dash and daring. He was only seventeen when he earned the rank of lieutenant for bravery. He was attached to Field Marshal Rumyantsev's army where he won his colonelcy (Polkovnik) by his ability and valour leading up to the Battle of Larga and the Battle of Kagul in 1770. He was present at the Battle of Riabaia Mogila (Battle of Speckled Tomb) when Rumyantsev, commanding the First Army, decided to carry out his mission with aggressive actions. Zorich's fame reached its culmination when he cut his way through a greatly superior Turkish-Tatar detachment of Kaplan Giray II, the khan of Crimea, at Riabaia Mogila on June 17 (Old Style) or June 28 (New Style). He was captured, however, because he would not surrender any ground when his regiment was besieged by Turks and Tatars. Prisoners were often decapitated in the exuberance of the moment, but noblemen were preserved for ransom‚Äîso it was with Zorich. The Turks, who were eventually forced to abandon the territory and retreat, marched Zorich to the Crimea, made him a galley slave for a while, and in Constantinople the infamous dungeons of Yedikule Fortress became his \\"home\\" for the next five years. In captivity he remained until the war ended in 1774, when he was released after the final exchange of prisoners in Constantinople. He went back to Russia where he was immediately made Brigadier for his past war services, and Prince Potemkin recommended him to his sovereign as the best hussar commander under fire. In the following year (1775) Catherine sent General Alexander Suvorov to suppress the rebellion of Pugachev. Again Zorich's most brilliant work as a Hussar commander was done there. He was then immediately sent on a diplomatic mission to Stockholm. Upon his return he was invited to the Russian court to meet Catherine II who conferred upon him the coveted Order of St. George on the recommendation of Field Marshal Rumyantsev for his valour and bravery. For his war activities he was made adjutant to Potemkin and aide-de-camp, and then aide-de-camp of Catherine II herself. Every step of his promotion was gained in the field of battle, and after he came back from quelling the Pugachev rebellion Prince Potemkin himself asked for Zorich's promotion to the rank of Major-General and aide-de-camp. In the meantime, he held various district commands in New Russia (Novorosiiskaia guberniia) where Catherine was determined to reorganize the borderlands between Russia and Poland and to prevent future revolts among the Cossacks. In late 1776, he was recalled to the court at St. Petersburg. On the anniversary of the Coronation day Zorich was officially awarded the rank of Major General, and he was made Cornet of the Horse Guard Corps, then he received a diamond star, aglets, a sword, plumes, studs and buckles, an enormous house near the Winter Palace, three hundred thousand roubles, the magnificent Shklov estate with its sixteen thousand inhabitants that had once belonged to Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, and an estate in Poland, in the Vitebsk province of the Polotsk Government. Foreign monarchs also did not leave the services of Semyon Zorich without recognition: the King of Poland bestowed on him the Order of the White Eagle, and the Swedish monarch gave him the Order of the Sword. Russian Court In 1777 the handsome, brave 34-year-old officer Zorich, who had been a prisoner of war of the Turks for five years, four-times wounded, was introduced into the Russian court by Grigory Potemkin as a counterpoise against Pyotr Zavadovsky, who deposed Potemkin as Catherine's favourite the previous year. This was done only when Zorich had received his due recognition for his services to the state and the title of Count. Semyon speedily became the recognized lover of Catherine the Great. Soon, Semyon Zorich thought himself influential enough to attempt to supersede Potemkin himself, and openly opposed Potemkin by challenging him to a duel. Common sense, however, prevailed and the duel was cancelled and hatchets buried and forgotten. His blunt manners, his unconcealed scorn of other favourites (that disgraced the court), and perhaps also his sense of unrequited merit, produced an estrangement of sorts between him and the empress. It appears that his stepfather, Maksim Zorich, must have acted as an intermediary between Semyon and Potemkin when they were not on speaking terms. In 1778 Zorich was superseded in the empress's graces by Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov; but the relationship between Catherine and Potemkin continued to be most friendly, and Semyon's influence with Empress Catherine and Prince Potemkin never wavered and was never seriously disrupted. He eventually retired to his estate in Shklov. During the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from the public view. He resumed his functions as general, but his ardent ideas for reforming the army came to nothing in the face of the general war-weariness with the Second Russo-Turkish War on the horizon. His zeal added to the number of his enemies, and in 1784 after he had been soldiering for three decades, it was proposed to place him on the retired list. The empress, unwilling to go so far as this, ennobled him, gave him an estate, and shelved him by making him a governor of Shklov in the Mogilev district, next to the estate of Potemkin. There Zorich would entertain many of his Serbian countrymen who were visiting Russia for the first time such as Gerasim Zeliƒá, Marko Zannoviƒá (brother of Stefano Zannowich), Simeon Pi≈°ƒçeviƒá and Dositej Obradoviƒá. After Catherine's death, Emperor Paul I of Russia called him for service, raised a Lieutenant General and given command of the regiment Izums'kyi. But he was dismissed once again in 1797 when irregularities were found in the financial affairs of his regiment. He returned to his estate where he did good service in the reorganization of the Mogilev district, and founded the cadet corp school for the children of former veterans, now impoverished and in need of assistance.

In the second half of the 1960s he performed on the public Polish Television (TVP), where he was a co-author of various TV shows, such as: Poznajmy siƒô, Ma≈Ç≈ºe≈Ñstwo doskona≈Çe, Kariera i Runda. In the 70s he co-created a radio satirical magazine 60 minut na godzinƒô, where he performed several roles creating famous characters, among which were: Kolega Kierownik and Kolega Kuchmistrz.

Moreover, he gave lectures during Tygodnie Kultury Chrze≈õcija≈Ñskiej (Christian Cultural Weeks). At that time both audio and video programmes were released on cassettes in the system of \\"second circulation\\" (they were also broadcast in Radio Free Europe).

He was a host of the controversial programme Dziennik Telewizyjny on TVP.Jacek Fedorowicz; TVP.INFO His programme went through a metamorphosis from the one about politics into a TV show. In 2005 Dziennik Telewizyjny changed its name into Subiektywny Ekspres Jacka Fedorowicza aka SEJF (Jacek Fedorowicz's Subjective Express) for several months. The satirist ended his collaboration with TVP in 2006. Since 1989 he has hosted author‚Äôs evenings in different cities.

These include the identity of the director of the film. Among the different hypotheses of who directed the film included Spanish actor Ramiro Olvieros and producer Oscar Brazzi, cinematographer Mario Mancini, producer Dick Randall and screenwriter William Rose. The Italian copyright agency SIAE certified that director Robert H. Oliver was a pseudonym of Mancini. Actor Gordon Mitchell contradicts this, saying that the director was Robert Oliver, while the actress Simone Blondell recalled only that the director \\"spoke English, he wasn't Italian\\" Among the crew, assistant director Gianlorenzo Battaglia denied Mancini directed the film, stating that \\"the American director left the film because of disagreements with the producer, and so Mario finished it on his own. I'm not 100% sure though!\\" The film was shot in late 1972 and finished in early 1973.

The film was released in the United States under various titles including Terror Castle, The House of Freaks, The Monsters of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks. It was released in the United Kingdom as Frankenstein's Castle. Curti described the film as having a minor cult status in the United States when it aired on Elvira's Movie Macabre in the 1980s.

It is a respectable example of Ottoman architecture in Kosovo. It was built over the Erenik river, probably at the end of the 15th century, and was altered in the 18th century. It is a noteworthy example of the Terzijski guild from Gjakova, from which it received its name. Major reconstruction and restoration to its original appearance occurred from 1982 to 1984. Today, the bridge is under the protection of the Republic of Kosovo, originally being declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990 within Serbia.  History  It is not known when exactly the bridge was built, but it is thought to have been at the end of the 15th century. This is due to the bridge having been erected on a medieval route, which connected Gjakova with Prizren, and that the bridge was later expanded (a result of changes of flow in the river). In the 18th century it experienced major modifications, which gave it its current appearance. These works were financed by the Terzijski guild from Gjakova, confirmed by an inscription carved in Turkish. The bridge was built with trimmed stones, in dark gray and an ocher shade. Its length exceeds 190 meters, the width of the pavement originally measuring over 3.5 meters. The bridge consists of 11 rounded arches, among which are embedded niches.

The school was founded in 1957. The school underwent a change from a secondary school to a high school in 2009. The school, like most government high schools, is mostly funded by user fees from pupils. History The school has been noted as one of the schools that has been in existence since the Northern Rhodesia British colonial period in Zambia's history. Luanshya Boys High School was first a co-ed school. It was also one of the first schools to accept non-white students in January 1964 following Northern Rhodesia becoming semi-independent following the break up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland at the end of 1963. Later in 1964 when Zambia became an independent nation, the school, like most others of a similar nature become fully integrated. Also at that time school fees were payable, but only by the 1964 intake and throughout their five years at the school. Those prior and those who followed did not pay. When it changed to current status I do not know. I graduated with GCE 'O' Levels at the end of 1998 -- Robert L. Taylor, Head Boy, 1968. By 1998 the school was virtually 100% African students as most non-Africans had left the town or preferred to send their children down south or overseas for their education. Why I don't know as I had a very good time there and the quality was good. Luanshya Secondary school also had the distinguished record of being the first schools whose Cadet Contingent won the prestigious Presidents Banner in 1968 by winning almost all the 1st Battalion ZCCF competitions and then beating the champion contingent of the 2nd Battalion in a falling plates shooting competition at the ABTA Camp of 1968. The banner was handed over to us by Brigadier Gen Grigg, then commander of the Zambia Army, on behalf of President Kenneth Kaunda. We proudly carried that banner through Luanshya after the war memorial that year, from the war memorial (cenotaph) near the mine club, all the way back to the school, a march of about 4 km, in full uniform and in November, when it was pretty sweltering. The school is run by the help of a Student Body or School Council which consists of elected representatives from various classes. The term of office for the Councillors is one year. The school council in the 1960s was chaired by the headmaster, Mr S Bottom and consisted of him, two other senior staff members, head prefects (boys and girls) and one class rep from each year. Although we had no real say in the running of the school, there was opportunity to get our views across to the authorities and, at times, made things better for the scholars, as well as staff and parents.

The company has produced home video game consoles and handheld consoles since 1983; these systems were released from the third console generation to the sixth. Sega was formed from the merger of slot machine developer Service Games and arcade game manufacturer Rosen Enterprises in 1964, and it produced arcade games for the next two decades. After a downturn in the arcade game industry in the 1980s, the company transitioned to developing and publishing video games and consoles. The first Sega console was the Japan-only SG-1000, released in 1983. Sega released several variations of this console in Japan, the third of which, the Sega Mark III, was rebranded as the Master System and released worldwide in 1985. They went on to produce the Genesis‚Äîknown as the Mega Drive outside of North America‚Äîand its add-ons beginning in 1988, the Game Gear handheld console in 1990, the Sega Saturn in 1994, and the Dreamcast in 1998. Sega was one of the primary competitors to Nintendo in the video game console industry. A few of Sega's early consoles outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the Master System in Europe. Several of the company's later consoles were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast console caused the company to restructure itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture consoles and became a third-party video game developer. The only console that Sega has produced since is the educational toy console Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega consoles have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original consoles had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the Master System and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.

In Brazil, Tectoy created and released the Master System 3 Compact, which may function wirelessly with an RF transmitter. An SKU of this console targeted at female gamers, the Master System Girl, was molded in bright pink plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. Another Master System variant, built as a handheld game console, was released by Coleco in North America in 2006. The Genesis was the first Sega console to receive third-party versions. Its first variants were released before any Master System variants, even though the Genesis was released three years after the Master System. Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD- GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added the Genesis to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999. In Brazil, where the Genesis never ceased production, Tectoy released a portable version of the Genesis with twenty built-in games on December 5, 2007. Another Tectoy variant of the console called \\"Mega Drive Guitar Idol\\", released in 2009 in Brazil, includes two six-button joypads and a guitar controller with five fret buttons. That year, AtGames began producing two new Genesis variants in North America and Europe: the Firecore, which can play Genesis cartridges as well as preloaded games; and a handheld console, the Sega Gopher, as well as a dedicated motion console, the Sega Zone, preloaded with 20 Genesis games. Companies such as Radica Games have released compilations of Genesis games in \\"plug-and-play\\" packages resembling the system's controller.

The Mocs finished 2010 with a 6‚Äì5 record (5‚Äì3 in conference for a three-way tie for 3rd place), including a 24‚Äì62 defeat at the hands of #3 Auburn on November 6, 2010. Fresno State *Source: Nebraska opened a series with another new foe never before met on the field, for a second consecutive week, when the Fresno State Bulldogs arrived in Lincoln. Fresno State finished the 2010 season under 14th‚Äìyear Head Coach Pat Hill with an 8‚Äì5 record (5‚Äì3 in the Western Athletic Conference for 4th place), including a 17‚Äì40 postseason loss to the 2010 Northern Illinois Huskies football team Huskies in the 2010 Humanitarian Bowl. Washington *Source: When Nebraska met Washington in their September 18, 2010 non-conference match, the Cornhuskers won 56‚Äì21 in Seattle, tying the most points ever scored by a non‚Äìconference opponent in Husky Stadium, and igniting Heisman Trophy talk around Nebraska's redshirt freshman QB Taylor Martinez. However, a mid-season ankle injury to Martinez coincided with a downturn in Nebraska's fortunes late in the season, as the Cornhuskers finished the season by losing two of the last three games, including letting a 17‚Äì3 advantage over Oklahoma in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game fade into a 20‚Äì23 defeat. After the loss, Nebraska was selected for a rematch with Washington in the 2010 Holiday Bowl, where an uninspired Cornhusker squad bowed to the effort and determination of the underdog Huskies and their senior QB, Jake Locker. The 7‚Äì19 postseason loss left Nebraska with three losses in the final four games of the season. This closing chapter matched a mark not seen since 2007, the final season of former Cornhusker Head Coach Bill Callahan. The 2011 meeting of these teams, this time in Lincoln, was the third time Washington and Nebraska played in just under a year. The all-time series now has a one-game edge for Nebraska with a 5‚Äì4‚Äì1 record between the two teams. Wyoming *Source: Wyoming Head Coach Dave Christensen led the 2009 Cowboys to a 7‚Äì6 (4‚Äì4 Mountain West Conference) finish in his first season, including a 35‚Äì28 defeat of Fresno State in the 2009 New Mexico Bowl. However, the Cowboys slid to a disappointing 2010 final record of 3‚Äì9 (1‚Äì7), which included a 28‚Äì20 win over Southern Utah of the FCS. Nebraska is undefeated in all five previous meetings of these teams, with a combined scoring total of 203‚Äì69. The series dates back to 1934, but this will be the first time the squads meet at War Memorial Stadium in Laramie. Wisconsin *Source: Nebraska opened Big Ten conference play for the first time, with a road game at Wisconsin. The Cornhuskers met a team that finished 2010 in a three-way tie for the Big Ten title and an 11‚Äì2 (7‚Äì1) record, which included a 19‚Äì21 loss to #3 TCU in the 2011 Rose Bowl. Following Wisconsin's 48‚Äî17 win, the series between the two schools is tied at 3‚Äì3. Ohio State *Source: This game was the third all-time meeting between Nebraska and Ohio State, and the first since 1956. The game also marked the Buckeyes' first appearance in Lincoln. In two previous three contests, Ohio State had outscored Nebraska a combined 62‚Äì27. Nebraska trailed at halftime 20‚Äì6, and would ultimately fall behind by a score of 27‚Äì6 midway through the third quarter. Nebraska's ultimate comeback began with a LaVonte David strip and fumble recovery of Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller. On the next play Taylor Martinez ran past the Ohio State defense for an 18-yard touchdown, the first of four unanswered touchdowns. On the subsequent Ohio State series, Miller twisted his ankle causing him to leave the game. He did not return. He was replaced by Joe Bauserman who went 1‚Äì10 passing including a costly interception. The Nebraska offense out-gained Ohio State in the second half by a total of 250 to 45 yards. With the win, Nebraska secured its first ever victory over Ohio State and as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The win also marked the largest come from behind win in school history after trailing 27‚Äì6 midway through the third quarter. Minnesota *Source: Nebraska renewed an old rivalry against the Golden Gophers, as the Cornhuskers played at TCF Bank Stadium for the first time for Minnesota's 2011 homecoming game. The last meeting was a 1990 non-conference game. First-year Minnesota Head Coach Jerry Kill has taken over the squad following a 3‚Äì9 (2‚Äì6) finish in 2010. With Nebraska's 41‚Äì14 win in this contest Minnesota still holds a 29‚Äì21‚Äì2 edge in the all-time series. Michigan State *Source: Nebraska met Michigan State for the first time since the Spartans were defeated 3‚Äì17 by Nebraska in the 2003 Alamo Bowl. Of special significance, that was the first Nebraska football victory under Head Coach Bo Pelini, as he served a one-game stint as interim Head Coach following the late-season dismissal of Frank Solich in 2003. The victory added to Nebraska's undefeated record against the Spartans, moving the streak to 6‚Äì0. Northwestern *Source: Following an important Legends division win against Michigan State the previous week, Nebraska dropped a stunning 28‚Äì25 decision to Pat Fitzgerald's Northwestern Wildcats. The 2011 match up between the Huskers and Wildcats marked the first contest between the two schools since the Nebraska's 66‚Äì17 victory in the 2000 Alamo Bowl. Despite the loss, Nebraska still holds a 3‚Äì2 lead in the all-time series. Penn State *Source: The game against Penn State was surrounded by the circumstances presented in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. Allegations against the former Penn State assistant coach emerged nationally in the week leading up the game. In the wake of the scandal, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was fired the Wednesday of game week. Penn State's contest against Nebraska marked the first Nittany Lion's game not coached by Paterno in 46 years. Before the kickoff, players from both sides met at mid‚Äìfield for a prayer led by Nebraska assistant football coach Ron Brown. In the game, Nebraska led 10‚Äì0 at halftime and then extended their lead to 17‚Äì0 after taking advantage of a Matt McGloin fumble in the third quarter. Penn State rallied and had a chance to win after scoring two touchdowns and narrowing the deficit to 17‚Äì14. However, Nebraska's defense came up with two key fourth down stops to secure the victory. The game was marked with much emotion with a blue-out at Beaver Stadium in support of the alleged victims of Sandusky's crimes.

The form a group within the cleroid beetles and were formerly treated as a subfamily Prionocerinae within the family Melyridae. Very little is known of their life history but most species are pollen feeders as adults and occur in large numbers during spring or the host flowering season. Larvae are predatory or feed on decomposing wood. Description Beetles in the family are elongate with soft elytra. The elytra are often covered with rows of hairs. The margin of the eyes are not round but notched anteriorly. The head faces forward (prognathous) and the clypeal region is produced into a short flat snout. Each of the legs have five tarsi (5-5-4 in the Oedemeridae) with simple claws and a single spur on the pro-tibia. Male Idgia and Prionocerus have a comb on the inner edge of the distal tarsal segment of the foreleg. The genera Nacerdes and Xanthochroa in the family Oedemeridae and some Cantharidae bear resemblance to some of the Prionoceridae. Members of the family were formerly included as a subfamily within the closely related Melyridae (the genus Lobonyx in Dasytidae). Prionoceridae have been recorded from the middle Jurassic of China (Idgiaites jurassicus) and Eocene Amber from Canada (Prionocerites tattriei).

In Bermuda, they are also known as the goat's head porgy. In Jamaica, they are known as the Porgi grunt and the sugareye porgy. They may also be known simply by the name Porgy in several other Caribbean islands. Saucereye porgies are considered to be minor gamefishes and when caught are marketed both fresh and frozen.  Taxonomy and naming  The Saucereye porgy was first described by the French zoologist, Achille Valenciennes in a 22-volume work entitled Histoire naturelle des poissons (Natural History of Fishes), which was a collaboration with fellow zoologist, Georges Cuvier. It was first described as Pagellus calamus, being placed in the genus Pagellus. It was since moved into Calamus, a genus named for the mythological Calamus, or Kalamos. It was so named because the Calamus of myth allowed himself to drown in a river, after the death of his lover, and transform into aquatic plants that young saucereye porgies make their homes in.  Description  Saucereye porgies can grow up to 56 cm in length, but normally they are 30 to 45 cm long. Though some sources state that they can weigh up to 3 lbs, the largest record is only half that: 1.5 lbs. The cheek area is blue with yellow spots; there is also a dark blue smudge behind the upper gill opening. Calamus calamus1.jpgC. calamus in its natural habitat: A reef setting near Isla Juventud, Cuba. Saucereye porgy.jpgC. calamus swimming over flats in Cozumel, Mexico.  Distribution and habitat  A bed of sea grass off the coast of Florida. Saucereyes are found only in the western Atlantic ocean‚Äîfrom North Carolina, east to Bermuda, and south to Brazil. They are most common around the cities of Key West and Havana. Adults are commonly found around coral reefs, where they are easily approached by divers, while juveniles are common to beds of sea grass (mainly Thalassia). Saucereyes feed on a variety of animals, such as mollusks, sea worms, brittle stars, hermit crabs, crabs and sea urchins. Relationship with Humans The Saurcereye porgy is mostly eaten by people in the West Indies, where it is most often caught. These fishes are also considered to be of minor commercial importance to the region, despite the occasional danger of ciguatera poisoning during red tide events. Dammann, A.E., 1969.

It was released worldwide in May 2010 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.  Gameplay  Skate 3 is a skateboarding extreme sports game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game takes place in the fictional city of Port Carverton, which embraces skateboarding, unlike the \\"skateboarding is a crime\\" mentality portrayed in the second game. Although the location is a more colorful and friendlier place than Skate 2s de-saturated, and grainy streets, the gameplay provides a similar feel to the first and second games. Port Carverton is made up of three districts, Downtown, the University, and Industrial. Although the overall look of the city is very clean (except industrial) each district has its own unique designs and monuments. Downtown is full of slick rigid ledges and rails, while the University is full of banks and open areas. Industrial is the most unusual; it is home to a huge quarry that has bricks of stone. Several notable skateboarding professionals appear throughout the game, such as Danny Way, Darren Navarette, Terry Kennedy, Eric Koston, Chris Cole, Pat Duffy and Jason Lee. In contrast with the original Skate, two new difficulty levels have been added: \\"Easy\\" and \\"Hardcore\\" modes. \\"Easy Mode\\" allows the player to perform tricks easier and provides greater control of the character. \\"Hardcore Mode\\" attempts a more realistic simulation of skateboarding and requires the player to perform tricks precisely. It adds a more realistic feel to the game unlike easy. It would also be recommended for players who have more experience. The game also features an introductory \\"Skate School\\", where Coach Frank (Jason Lee) teaches players the basics of skateboarding, such as grinding and performing ollies. This feature is optional and the area can also be visited for unrestricted skateboarding. Similar to the Tony Hawk games, Skate features a \\"Skate.Park\\" mode that allows players to build custom skate parks. EA introduced three new online game modes: \\"1-Up\\", \\"Domination\\", and \\"Own The Lot\\". In \\"1-Up\\", players compete in turns to beat the other team's last score in a given time period. In \\"Domination\\", teams compete to gain the most points on set spots in an area within a time limit. In \\"Own The Lot\\", two or more players try to complete tasks before their time limit ends. Unlike the previous Skate games, Skate 3 has no offline multiplayer game modes on the disc. Players must purchase the \\"San Van Party Pack\\" downloadable content in order to access the offline \\"Party Play\\" mode. Plot Some time after Skate 2, the player character has proven that they are one of the best, and now goes by the alias \\"The Legend\\". They are attending the Port Carverton University. After a failed attempt to \\"Jump The Shark\\", a Thrasher challenge at the stadium, their next goal in life is to be a skateboarding mogul by making a team composed of skaters like them. Their goal is selling over 1 million boards while doing the same odd jobs around Port Carverton.  Development  In the developer's diary, it was revealed that characters such as Joey Brezinski, Dan Drehobl, Benny Fairfax, Josh Kalis, Lizard King, Andrew Reynolds, Chris Haslam, Terry Kennedy, Chris Cole, Jason Dill, and Rob Dyrdek would be featured in the game. New tricks were introduced, like the darkslide, underflip, and dropping into a ramp or bowl. The soundtrack contains 46 licensed tracks. John King of The Dust Brothers composed original score for the game. According to Mutato Muzika's website, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo and Del the Funky Homosapien were involved with Skate 3s soundtrack, with each composer providing music for a different area in Port Carverton. The game also features music by composer Dan Diaz, who continues his work with the franchise after writing for Skate 2 and Skate It.  Reception  Skate 3 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" from critics on both platforms according to the review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, where the PlayStation 3 version was ported for release on December 16, 2010, followed by the Xbox 360 version a week later, Famitsu gave both console versions each a score of three sevens and one eight for a total of 29 out of 40. The A.V. Club gave the Xbox 360 version a B+ and said, \\"Online play isn't essential, but it would be a shame to continue skating in a vacuum.\\" 411Mania gave the same console version a score of eight out of ten and said it was \\"a great follow-up to Skate 2 but it might be a bit too close for comfort. The last thing we want is for Skate to start taking a page out of Tony Hawk's book with yearly iterations that bring nothing new to the table.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave the same console version eight out of ten and called it \\"a difficult, slow burning game that never strays far into the whimsical and overblown. Understanding the mechanics, let alone mastering them, is a slow, difficult, painful crawl from gnarly amateur to diamond champion.\\" Wired similarly gave it eight stars out of ten and said that it \\"doesn't take gamers anywhere as exotic or over-the-top. And that's its charm. The realistic setting and complex control scheme make for an engaging single-player experience, but it's the wide range of online multiplayer options that make Skate gleam the cube.\\" The Escapist gave the same console version four stars out of five and stated: \\"Fans of the series will find more to love in the third installment. For newcomers, this is the most accessible and fun skateboarding game there is.\\" Edge gave the PS3 version seven out of ten and said, \\"While refinement might be the best way to make a good game better, it certainly isn't the best way to justify the cost of a second sequel in as many years.\\" The game has become a popular staple of Let's Play channels, due to its humorous ragdoll physics and glitches, resulting in the game being a high-selling game as late as 2014, requiring EA to issue a reprinting of the title. The game was also one of the most requested titles to be added to the Xbox One backwards compatibility feature, and was made backwards compatible on November 10, 2016. EA shut down the game's servers around the end of 2016. However, just prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 in June 2018 and in late 2019 after Electronic Entertainment Expo 2019, EA reactivated the servers, leading to speculation of either a remaster of Skate 3 or a new title in the Skate series. Sequel At the June 2020 EA Play event, a new Skate title was confirmed to be in development, commonly known by fans as Skate 4 though no official title has been revealed yet.

Some police departments may set \\"productivity goals\\" but deny specific quotas. In many places, such as California, Texas, and Florida, traffic ticket quotas are specifically prohibited by law or illegal.https://www.officer.com/home/news/10445445/texas-chief-accused-of- issuing-ticket-quota United States One common way of preventing traffic ticket quotas includes statutorily regulating the distribution of ticket fines, to prevent fine revenue generated by tickets from going directly back to the law enforcement agency budget which issued the tickets; thus eliminating any direct monetary incentive between issuing tickets and the fine paid. For example, Florida law distributes traffic ticket fine monies by small percentages or amounts to several separate funds preventing it from going back to the agency which issued the ticket. Some of these different funds include the overall governmental entities' general revenue fund, Child Welfare Training Trust Fund, Juvenile Justice Training Trust Fund, Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Trust Fund, Indigent Criminal Defense Trust Fund, Emergency Medical Services Trust Fund, Law Enforcement Radio System Trust Fund, Vocational Rehabilitation of the Department of Education, Division of Blind Services, Epilepsy Services Trust Fund, and Nongame Wildlife Trust Fund. Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in Brooklyn, New York says: \\"Such quotas put the cops under pressure to write summonses when the violations don't exist ... It takes discretion away from the police officer.\\" Netherlands The national quota system for issuing tickets was previously scrapped from police performance contracts, but individual forces may still impose their own quota system.

The settlers may also search for \\"The Seven Jewels of Genesia\\". Reception Computer Gaming World rated Ultimate Domain one star out of five. Describing it as a lackluster combination of Populous and Civilization, the magazine reported that it was possible to win the game without expanding from the starting position, concluding that \\"If that doesn't sound a death knell for a game of empire building, I don't know what does\\".

Retrieved on 15 May 2012. The family is represented on all continents except Antarctica, and is most diverse at both the generic and species levels in the Old World tropics. Silvanids generally are small, brownish, flattened, pubescent and densely punctured beetles ranging from 1.2-15mm in length, and mostly with a 5-5-5 tarsal formula. They have short, strongly clubbed, to very elongate antennae, and frequently grooves or carinae on the head and/or pronotum. Many genera have the lateral margins of the pronotum dentate or denticulate. The family is divided unequally into two subfamilies: Brontinae and Silvaninae. The Brontinae, arranged in two tribes (Brontini and Telephanini) of 10 genera each, are larger, loosely jointed beetles with long antennae, an especially elongate scape, inverted male genitalia, and mandibular mycangia.Grebennikov, V. V. and R. A. B. Leschen. 2010. External exoskeletal cavities in Coleoptera and their possible mycangial functions. Entomological Science 13: 81‚Äì98.

Insecta Mundi 0048: 1-14. The Silvaninae, which has not been divided into tribes, consists of 48 genera of mostly smaller beetles characterized by their closed procoxal cavities, mostly without mandibular mycangia, and non-inverted male genitalia. The largest genera are Telephanus (109 species), Psammoecus (81 species), and Cryptamorpha (27 species) (all Brontinae: Telephanini) and the Old World silvanine genus Airaphilus (35 species). There have been a number of major taxonomic studies in the Silvanidae in recent decades, including Halstead (1973),Halstead, D.G.H. 1973. A revision of the genus Silvanus Latreille (s.l.)

It showed a close relationship between Passandridae and Silvanidae, and a more distant one with Cucujidae.Robertson, J. A., M. F. Whiting, and J. V. McHugh. 2008.

Biology and habitats Although all silvanids seem to be primarily fungivorous, the habitat where the various taxa are found varies. Members of the tribe Brontini primarily are found under dead bark, although Brontoliota are found on the outside of dead wood lying on the ground in wet forests and Protodendrophagus occur under rocks in alpine areas of New Zealand. Brontini do not have lobed tarsomeres. Members of Telephanini usually occur on withered, pendant leaves, especially of Musaceae and Heliconiaceae. Telephanini usually have lobed tarsomeres. Silvaninae are found in subcortical habitats as well as in leaf-litter and soil. Two genera, Nepharis and Nepharinus, are inquilines of ants in Australia, and two species of Coccidotrophus and one of Eunausibius occur in the petioles of ant-plants (Tachigalia spp.) in the American tropics, where they feed on honeydew produced by a mealybug (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae).B√∂ving, A.

Most species are found in the Oriental realm where they live in montane forest habitats.

They have a long 11-segmented antenna. There are no fossil species known as yet, and nearly all the species are found mainly along the Himalayas extending into China, Korea, the Sunda Islands, and the Philippine Archipelago. Trictenotoma grayi is found in the Western Ghats of peninsular India while T. templetonii is found in Sri Lanka. Adult beetles are attracted to lights and specimens are found widely in collections across the world however very little was known of their life-history until the habits of Trictenotoma formosana were studied in captivity in Taiwan in 2019. Based on that species, these are thought to breed in wood, the eggs being laid under bark. The eggs hatch after about 10 days. The larvae are carnivorous and can be cannibalistic. They build tunnels in soft wood in which they stay. They feed on their exuviae and may undergo 8-9 moults over the course of one and a half years before they pupate. The pupae eclose in 40 to 46 days as adults. Adults feed on tree sap. The scape of the antenna is longer than segments 2 and 3 together and the second segment isg rounded. The eight antennal segment is simple in Trictenotoma and has lateral projections in Autocrates. The terminal three antennal segments form a club. * Genus Autocrates J.

Biography Symeon was born in Constantinople, most likely between 1381 and 1387. He became a monk in one of the monasteries there, possibly the Xanthopouloi monastery.\\"Saint Symeon, Archbishop of Thessaloniki\\", Ecumenical Patriarchate Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and South East Asia, September 17, 2013 He was archbishop of Thessalonica from 1416 or 1417, until his death in 1429. His consecration took place in Constantinople, in accordance with the established practice for hierarchs who belonged to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The city of Thessalonica was surrounded by Ottoman forces when he arrived as archbishop in 1416-17. He slipped quietly out of the city in June 1422 to go to Constantinople and persuade the emperor to send more forces to protect the city. He got only as far at Mount Athos, narrowly escaping capture by the Ottoman forces beginning their siege. On Mt. Athos he was convinced to return to Thessalonica. From this point onward, he presided over the city at a particularly difficult time with the city under siege by the Ottoman sultan Murad II (1421‚Äì1451). Receiving no help from the emperor in Constantinople, the city's governor, Andronikos Palaiologos, took the decision to hand Thessalonica over to Venice, in the hope that the maritime republic would keep it out of Ottoman hands. Venetian rule, however, could not prevent the Ottomans from maintaining their siege, and conditions in the city remained desperate. Symeon describes these events in his Logos Historikos. His death, probably in September 1429, came shortly before Thessalonica finally fell to the Ottomans in March 1430. Works Symeon wrote a number theological and liturgical works, which were imperfectly edited in Ia≈üi in 1683, reprinted by Migne in PG 155. He also left a number of short works, homilies, and a host of pastoral letters to be found in the Political-historical Works and in the Theological Works (·ºúœÅŒ≥Œ± Œ∏ŒµŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫Œ¨) published by Balfour. In addition, he wrote numerous hymns and a discourse on the priesthood. The most extensive of his works is the Dialogue in Christ, which runs from PG 155: 33 to 696. It begins with a lengthy anti- heretical section and then deals with each the church's religious services. Veneration He was canonized by the Greek Orthodox Church in 1981. His feast day is celebrated on 15 September. Notes Further reading Works * Politico-Historical Works, ed.

Pagodas called tah≈çt≈ç also have a hisashi. Open corridors or verandas under extended or additional roofs are also sometimes referred to as hisashi. In temples constructed in the hip-and-gable style (irimoya-zukuri), the gabled part usually covers the moya while the hipped part covers the hisashi. The hisashi can be under the same roof as the moya, and be therefore invisible from the outside, or protrude and have a pent roof of its own as for example in the case of many Zen main halls (butsuden). The main purpose of the hisashi is reinforcing the building's structure against side motion. Japanese traditional architecture was based on the post and lintel system, which is intrinsically not very strong. To strengthen it, therefore, an extra row of pillars and relative lintels are added, supporting the moya's walls. The hisashi can be present on just one or all four walls, and is counted with the suffix . A building can for example be said to be a 3 x 3 ken, 4 men butsuden if it is surrounded by a hisashi on all sides.

The core of the building (moya) is 3 x 3 ken and is surrounded on four sides by a 1-ken wide hisashi, bringing the external dimensions of the edifice to a total of 5 x 5 ken. Because the hisashi is covered by a pent roof of its own, the butsuden seems to have two stories, but in fact has only one. This decorative pent roof which does not correspond to an internal vertical division is called , literally \\"skirt story\\" or \\"cuff story\\".

The resulting acyl hydride complex next binds the alkene. The sequence of oxidative addition and alkene coordination is often unclear. Via migratory insertion, the alkene inserts into either the metal-acyl or the metal-hydride bonds. In the final step, the resulting alkyl-acyl or beta-ketoalkyl-hydride complex undergoes reductive elimination. A competing side-reaction is decarbonylation of the aldehyde. This process also proceeds via the intermediacy of the acyl metal hydride: :R\\"C(O)-MLn-H ‚Üí R\\"-M(CO)Ln-H This step can be followed by reductive elimination of the alkane: :R\\"-M(CO)Ln-H ‚Üí R\\"-H + M(CO)Ln :Hydroacylation reaction Mechanism Asymmetric hydroacylation Hydroacylation as an asymmetric reaction was demonstrated in the form of a kinetic resolution.The Asymmetric cyclisation of substituted pent-4-enals by a chiral rhodium phosphine catalyst Brian R.

Under its original name of Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture, Gardening, and Horticulture for Women, the college was one of the first in the world to open the profession to women. In 1915 it was renamed the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture for Women, and in 1945 it was absorbed into the Rhode Island School of Design as the Lowthorpe Department of Landscape Architecture. History The school was founded in 1901 as Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture, Gardening, and Horticulture for Women by Judith Eleanor Motley Low, a Groton native who was either the granddaughter or great granddaughter of Benjamin Bussey.\\"Form A: Country Day School of the Holy Union\\". Massachusetts Historical Commission. Low had spent time in her youth at the Bussey Institute at Arnold Arboretum, studying agriculture, gardening, and botany. A one-page brochure announcing the establishment of the school offered instruction in the subjects of \\"landscape gardening, elementary architecture, horticulture, botany and allied subjects.\\" The brochure announced an October 1901 start date, but instruction did not actually begin until the following fall. To be admitted, a prospective student was required to have a high school diploma and some knowledge of both drawing and botany. The school's population of students ranged from single digits in the early years up to 30 or 40 in the 1930s. Instruction focused on private residential design rather than public gardens, as such work was at the time considered most suitable for women. The Groton campus included of meadows, orchards, gardens, greenhouses, and an administration building.\\"Lowthorpe School\\". Harvard University Library Virtual Collection bibliographic record.\\"Lowthorpe School\\". Smithsonian Institution SIRIS archives website The gardens were largely the work of school students and were mostly laid out in geometrical arrangements; the herb garden, for example, was in the form of an Elizabethan knot. Although the naturalistic style of Edwardian-era English garden design (embracing both the English landscape garden and its later variant the cottage garden) was the prevailing aesthetic taught at the school, the more formal style of Italian landscape design was also taught and influenced how the gardens were organized.Knight, Jane Alison. \\"An Examination of the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture for Women, Groton, Massachusetts, 1901-1945\\". Cornell University Master's thesis, 1986. Lowthorpe was incorporated in 1909 and placed under direction of a board of directors with Low as president of the board. Patrons included Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University, Professor Charles Sprague Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum and Professor James Sturgis Pray, Chairman of the Department of Landscape Architecture at Harvard, among others. The course curriculum was changed in 1915 from two to three years, diplomas were awarded, and the name changed to the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture for Women, dropping the words Gardening and Horticulture from the title. In 1917, Lowthorpe fielded a baseball team called the Farmerettes. Under John Parker, Lowthorpe's director from 1934 to 1945, winter classes were taught in Boston at 491 Boylston Street. In 1945, Lowthorpe was absorbed into the Rhode Island School of Design and became known as the Lowthorpe Department of Landscape Architecture. The Groton campus was adapted into a convent and a day school that is today named the Country Day School of the Holy Union. The stature of the school was raised when Ellen Shipman (named in 1933 by the magazine House & Garden as the \\"dean of women landscape architects\\"), in a 40-year career, reportedly would only hire graduates from Lowthorpe School. According to Catharine Filene, writing in Careers for Women in 1920, schools offering training similar to Lowthorpe included Cornell University, the University of Illinois, the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, and the University of California.

It aired on SBS from August 1 to September 20, 2009 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:45 for 16 episodes. Based on the popular 2008 chick lit novel of the same title by former fashion reporter Baek Young-ok, Style depicts the inner workings of a fictional fashion magazine.  Synopsis  Park Ki-ja (Kim Hye-soo) is the perfectionist editor at Style magazine. She's extremely confident, stubborn, and self-centered, but also has a killer fashion sense. In her youth, Ki-ja dreamed of studying at Parsons The New School for Design in New York City, but her hopes were crushed after the Korean economic crisis led her father to commit suicide. Soon after her father's death, Ki-ja's mother moved to Canada, but Ki-ja stayed behind in Korea. At the time she couldn't leave her boyfriend Seo Woo-jin (Ryu Si-won) behind, who was studying to become a doctor. But Woo-jin eventually dropped out of medical school and moved to New York to become a chef. Since that time, Ki-ja has worked her way up from a lowly assistant to a highly respected editor. Meanwhile, Woo-jin has become a macrobiotic chef and eventually returned to Korea to open a restaurant. His restaurant named Mackerel became a success, especially with the ladies. Woo-jin himself is a ladies man, having good looks and exemplary culinary talents. He then meets Ki-ja again, as well as her assistant Lee Seo-jung (Lee Ji-ah). Lee Seo-jung has worked as Ki-ja's assistant for over a year, even though she has come close to having a nervous breakdown because of her demanding boss. Seo-jung initially hoped to become a writer, but because of her financial situation took a part-time job at Style magazine. When Seo-jung meets Woo-jin, she becomes enamored with him. She knows that Woo-jin is Ki-ja's ex-boyfriend, but she can't control her feelings for him. Lastly, Kim Min-joon (Lee Yong-woo) is a photographer at Style magazine. He follows Ki-ja around like a lost puppy dog due to his overwhelming feelings for her. Because of Ki-ja, Min-joon has stayed at Style magazine even when better offers came calling. When Min-joon notices the attention that Woo-jin receives from both Ki-ja and Seo-jung, he feels jealousy.

It is a member of the City and Regional Magazine Association (CRMA). The magazine was purchased in 1970 by WQED, who used the magazine as part of its pledge drives. By 1978, it was still losing money, but it had gained tax-exempt status through WQED. Allies of Richard Mellon Scaife, the owner of the rival Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and the Pittsburgher, investigated the financial status, with a possible eye toward challenging the tax-exempt status. In 1983, the magazine was drawn into a battle between staff members regarding WQED's involvement with Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign. In 1990, the magazine was the subject of a libel lawsuit brought by two police officers after publishing an article about the disappearance of a Pittsburgh man; the suit was settled for $75,000. Amid significant staff turnover, former employees suggested that the growth of the magazine was stunted by its relationship with the financially distressed WQED. In October 1993, Sewickley native Christopher E. Fletcher was hired as editor. The magazine underwent a significant format re-design in 1994. In 2009, the magazine was purchased by WiesnerMedia, a suburban Denver-based publishing company. A short time later, the offices were moved out of WQED's Oakland headquarters to new facilities on Washington's Landing. In January 2010, the magazine launched its World Wide Web home: PittsburghMagazine.com, which includes daily and weekly blogs and e-media.

Semmendinger first made his cameras in New York City. The second factory where he built his cameras was located in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Early life August Semmendinger was born on April 9, 1820. Records indicate he emigrated to the United States from Bad Urach, Germany, arriving in the United States on July 6, 1849 aboard a ship named Columbia which had embarked from Bremen. Arriving with Semmendinger was his wife Magdalene, and his one-year-old daughter, Alwine. After arriving in the United States, August lived in Lower Manhattan at 9 Elizabeth Street as a cabinetmaker. In 1855-6 he moved two blocks over to 40 Forsyth Street where his occupation is listed as a box maker. Shortly thereafter, August moved to 144 Elizabeth Street where he began to manufacture cameras. Career An Excelsior Wet Plate Camera made in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Semmendinger began making cameras in 1859 and claimed to be the first to manufacture \\"photographic apparatus\\". Semmendinger made his cameras in New York City at this time at Nos. 410 & 412 West 16th Street. Semmendinger was also an early camera designer, and was awarded three United States patents related to camera making. The first, Patent No. 27,241, was earned on February 21, 1860 for a \\"Photographic Apparatus\\" This invention was used to take successive exposures using the same wet plate. A second patent was secured on August 7, 1860, Patent No. 29,523, for an invention simply described as a \\"Camera.\\" By the early 1870s, Semmendinger moved his family and business to New Jersey and purchased land just across the Hudson River in Fort Lee. Here, Semmendinger was awarded his third United States Patent, No. 145,020, for Photographic Plate-Holders. This patent is for what Semmendinger titled his \\"Celebrated Silver Double Corners.\\" Semmendinger's fourth patent was for \\"Camera-Stands\\", issued on March 31, 1874 (Patent No. 149,255). In the summer of 1874, Semmendinger displayed his \\"photograph camera box\\" at the Fifth Cincinnati Industrial Exposition. He soon thereafter won a bronze medal at the 43rd exhibition of the American Institute of the City of New York for his \\"Elevated Camera Stand with double Swing Back Camera Box\\". He was later an exhibitor at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia where he displayed his \\"photograph apparatus\\". By 1882, his factory on Gerome Avenue (formerly Eickhoff or Ichoff Street) was a leading Fort Lee manufacturing industry employer.Bertram, Lucille (2004) Images of America: Fort Lee pg. 25 Semmendinger's \\"Mammoth plate\\" wet-collodion camera saw use in remote landscape photography despite its weight and that of the glass plates it used. It was considered a \\"monster\\".Fowler, Don D. (1989) The Western Photographs of John K. Hillers: Myself in the Water pg. 20 Semmendinger's idea of utilizing that portion of the camera just under the lens and converting it into a sort of cupboard was thought novel. Family Semmendinger married Magdalene Kinney (b.c. 1829) and together had eight children: Theodore, Alvina, Roland, Guido, Clara, Aloise, August, and Pythagoras. Death August Semmendinger died in Fort Lee, New Jersey on August 6, 1885. His sons carried on the photography business after his death.

It crosses over a small valley containing the southern arm of the Red River, and a minor road known as Viaduct Lane. The Hayle Railway opened the railway through this site in 1837 to link Hayle and Redruth. To overcome a significant change in elevation an inclined plane was built to the east of the present viaduct. When the West Cornwall Railway took over the route, it built a timber trestle viaduct as part of a more gently- graded route which by-passed the inclined plane. The present-day viaduct was built by the Great Western Railway in 1888 as part of a programme to replace the timber viaducts on the line and prepare the single-track route for double track.

It is defined as the most inclusive clade containing Stomatosuchus inermis but not Notosuchus terrestris, Simosuchus clarki, Araripesuchus gomesii, Baurusuchus pachecoi, Peirosaurus torminni, or Crocodylus niloticus. Two genera are known to belong to Stomatosuchidae: Stomatosuchus, the type genus, and Laganosuchus. Fossils have been found from Egypt, Morocco, and Niger. Both lived during the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The skulls of stomatosuchids are said to be platyrostral because they have unusually flattened, elongate, duck- shaped craniums with U-shaped jaws. This platyrostral condition is similar to what is seen in the \\"nettosuchid\\" Mourasuchus, which is not closely related to stomatosuchids as it is a more derived alligatoroid that existed during the Miocene. Lower jaws of Laganosuchus thaumastos Unlike Mourasuchus, stomatosuchids have jaws that are less strongly bowed. Additionally, the glenoid is rounded rather than cupped at the posterior end of the jaw, and the retroarticular process is straight rather than dorsally curving like in Mourasuchus and other extant crocodylians. The only existing specimens of stomatosuchids belong to the recently described genus Laganosuchus, which is known from two species, L. thaumastos and L. maghrebensis from the Echkar Formation in Niger and the Kem Kem Beds in Morocco, respectively. The genus Stomatosuchus is known only from a holotype skull collected from the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, which was destroyed in World War II with the bombing of the Munich Museum.Stromer, E.

Nelson Nils Olas Nelson (September 11, 1844 - October 5, 1922) was an American industrialist and businessman who was the founder of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Background Nelson was born the son of Anders Nelson at Lillesand in Aust-Agder, Norway. His family immigrated to the United States in 1847. He grew up on the farm of his parents near St. Joseph, Missouri. After serving in the American Civil War, he was introduced into a career in accounting. He became a bookkeeper for a plumbing fixtures firm in St. Louis, Missouri.Norwegians in the Civil War (Vesterheim Civil War Database) N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Co. In 1877, he started the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in St. Louis, Missouri. Once he had established his business, he moved from simply wholesaling items to manufacturing items dealing with the area of plumbing. The company manufactured and distributed plumbing supplies of all kinds, including faucets, water closets, water heaters, valves and fire hydrants. In 1888, Nelson decided to relocate the manufacturing facility from St. Louis to a rural area. In 1890 a suitable location was found across the Mississippi River in Madison County, Illinois. The complex was designed by St. Louis architect Edward A. Cameron (1861-1899) specifically for the Nelson Manufacturing Company.N. O. Nelson Co. - St. Louis, MO (Former Hydrant Manufacturers)From Our History (WinWholesale Inc.) Leclaire, Illinois In 1890, N.O. Nelson founded the village of Leclaire as a model company town. The development of Leclaire started with the original plat design by engineer, surveyor and city planner Julius Pitzman (1837-1923). Nelson named the community after French economist and businessman, Edme-Jean Leclaire, who had inaugurated employee profit sharing in France. Leclaire was a model cooperative offering affordable homes, free education, opportunities for recreation, and employment at the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. Nelson implemented profit sharing and employee benefits. In 1902, he founded a cooperative store in Leclaire.John S. Garner (October 1971) Leclaire Illinois: A Model Company Town 1890-1934 (Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 30 No. 3) Nelson's vision was influenced by the progressive theory his era including that of Sedley Taylor, professor at Trinity College, Cambridge and his 1885 essays On Profit Sharing Between Capital and Labor. In 1895, Nelson had been a delegate to the meeting in London, England of the Co- operation and Profit Sharing Associations of the World. Nelson was also responsible for the organization within the Greater St. Louis area of many recreational and cultural activities for the underprivileged. In 1934, the city of Edwardsville, Illinois annexed the village. Today the LeClaire Historic District has most of the original structures and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. The renovated N. O.

He won eleven caps for Wales and was part of the first Grand Slam winning side in 1908. Rugby career Watts, a steelworker by profession, played the majority of his rugby career for first-class Welsh team Llanelli and in the 1903‚Äì04 season was given the captaincy of the first team. Despite this accolade, Watts was not selected for the Wales national team until the 1907 Home Nations Championship. His first international was against England, played at home at St. Helen's, and the match ended in a Welsh win. Watts was reselected for the remaining two games of the Championship, an away loss to Scotland, and a crushing home win over Ireland. Watts had joined the Wales team during their first 'Golden Age', and the loss to Scotland would be the only international defeat of his 11-match career. Watts was back in the Wales team for the 1908 Home Nations Championship, and played in all three matches of the series and the very first international encounter between Wales and France played in preparation for France joining the competition in 1910. Wales won all three Championship games, winning the tournament and taking the Triple Crown; and in beating France at the Cardiff Arms Park the team also took the first Grand Slam title. At the start of the 1908/09 season, the very first touring Australian team arrived in Britain. Llanelli were the seventh British team to face the tourist, who to that point were unbeaten. Under the captaincy of Tom Evans, Watts was part of the Llanelli team that faced the Australians at Stradey Park; Llanelli winning a memorable match 8‚Äì3. Two months later Watts was part of the Wales team to face the same touring Australians, Wales winning thanks to a second-half penalty kick from Bert Winfield. Watts' final international campaign was the 1909 Home Nations Championship, which began with narrow wins over England and Scotland. The third game was the last 'unofficial' encounter with the French team, which saw Wales score eleven tries. ten of the tries came from the three-quarters positions, with Watts scoring the other try, his first international points. Watts final match for his country was the Championship decider against Ireland.

It is part of the larger Continental Intercalaire Formation, which stretches from Algeria and Niger in the west to Egypt and Sudan in the east. The Douiret Formation is located in the Tataouine basin in southern Tunisia, stretching into Algeria and Libya, and is part of the Merbah el Asfer Group of rock formations. The Douiret is 80 metres thick and consists of a 30-metre layer of sand beneath a 50-metre layer of clay. A few fossil- bearing beds have been discovered in the sand layer. The fossils range from the Aptian to Albian period and include freshwater and marginal marine sharks, skates, fish, turtles, crocodilians, pterosaurs, bivalves, pollens and plants, including trees. The fish are the most abundant type of fossil found. The orientation of the fossils suggests the earlier ones were deposited by a westward flowing paleocurrent while the later ones were laid down in waves. Dinosaur remains are also among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific genus. The green clay layer contains plant remains (ferns and conifers), but no vertebrate or flowering plant remains. The Douiret formation dates from the Early Cretaceous period, more than 100 million years ago. Scientists have dated the sandy layer to the Hauterivian, Barremian or Aptian periods (132 to 113 million years ago) and the clay layer to the Barremian or Aptian periods (130 to 113 million years ago). Based on both the geology of the formation and the fossils found, scientists agree that the sandy part of the Douiret Formation was a lush coast or more likely river delta on the shore of the Tethys Sea, but by the time of the clay layer, tectonic subsidence and the northward migration of the Tethys Sea had turned the area into a huge freshwater lagoon that periodically dried into a salt flat, hostile to vegetation.

It is the lowermost of the four formations found within the Uitenhage Group of the Algoa Basin, its type locality, where it has been measured at a maximum thickness of . Discontinuous outcrops are also found in the Worcester-Pletmos and Oudshoorn-Gamtoos Basins, including isolated occurrences in the Haasvlakte, Jubilee, and Soutpansvlakte Basins near the small town Bredasdorp.  Geology  The Enon Formation was formed along the southern section of South Africa during the break up of Gondwana when there was widespread erosion of rocks comprising the Cape Fold Belt. It is considered to be Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous in age although more thorough dating needs to be undertaken. It provides important geological data on the change in landscape during the break-up of Gondwana in relation to the younger and softer formations - the Kirkwood and Sundays River - which overlie it, and because it is the oldest formation of the onshore post-Karoo Mesozoic deposits found in South Africa. Underlying strata are separated by unconformities in most locales expect where the Enon is underlain by deposits of the Cape Fold Belt. The sedimentary rock of the Enon comprises several different types of coarse, clastic, poorly sorted pebble to cobble thickly- bedded conglomerate deposits. The clasts are usually pale or white quartzite, and the most common matrix is a gypsiferous (sometimes iron-oxide rich) sandy clay. At some places, clasts of various sizes are intermixed, with large amounts of sandy matrix; at others however, water-sorted clasts of similar size occur in layers, separated by infilled sandstone lenses. Groupings within the formation have occasionally been informally identified, such as the basal Enon Sandstones that occur in the Algoa Basin. Much of the formation tends to comprise smaller clasts in a more iron-rich matrix, giving it a more reddish colour. Conglomerates are the most diagnostic feature of the Enon, so much so in the past the formation was referred to as the Enon Conglomerate Formation. The conglomerates consist of large, sub-rounded to rounded clasts of sheared or unsheared quartzite and sometimes slate, shale, and charcoal. Quartzite clasts are generally more rounded whereas the slate and shale clasts are angular. These are interbedded with subordinate sandstone lenses ranging from white, yellow, red and green in colour, claystones, and rare mudstone units. These were deposited in a high-energy alluvial environment where debris flows were common.  Current geographic extent  Though formerly continuous, the Enon Formation now occurs as several disjunct outcrops in the southern Cape. Along the Worcester-Pletmos Basin, it occurs in patches along the southern flanks of the Langeberg Mountains - from Worcester in the west, as far as Mossel Bay in the east. In the Breede River valley, the Enon beds are tilted downwards to the south, and occur in three main outcrops. At Worcester it exists as partially-rounded clasts of grit and Witteberg sandstone, cemented in beds of argillaceous, reddish sandstone, and overlaying the Ecca formation. In the Nuy-Vink area, it exists as pale Witteberg sandstone and greenish Ecca shale clasts, cemented in a pale red or greenish (sometimes calcareous) mudstone, overlaying the Ecca Group and the Dwyka. Between Robertson and Ashton, it exists mainly as micaceous or quartzitic Witteberg sandstone clasts, in a reddish-brown matrix, overlaying Witteberg Group rocks. This outcrop surrounds the fine, pale, greyish Kirkwood Formation sandstones of the Klaasvoogdsrivier area. The eastern part of this Enon outcrop, near Ashton, contains clasts of Dwyka tillite, fine greenish sandstone and shale pebbles. In the Overberg region, the Enon Formation occurs in several more outcrops. At Swellendam, it exists as Bokkeveld shale and micaceous Witteberg sandstone clasts, in a reddish-green sandy clay matrix. Between Heidelberg and Riversdale, it exists mainly as a curved band surrounding the southern edge of the larger Kirkwood Formation. Near Heidelberg, the Enon is composed of greenish Bokkeveld shale clasts and vein quartz. Nearer Riversdale, Witteberg sandstone clasts are also present. At Herbertsdale, a large section is exposed, often interfingered with the neighbouring Kirkwood Formation. The southern portion of the Enon is composed mainly of angular Bokkeveld shale clasts in a pale reddish-grey matrix. The rock just south of the Hartebeeskuil dam however, is composed more of partially silicified sandstone and quartzite clasts. At Mossel Bay, the Enon outcrops are often also composed of sandstone and quartzite clasts.Gresse, P. G., Theron, J. N., & Geological Survey (South Africa) (1992). The geology of the Worcester area: Explanation of sheet 3319, scale 1:250 000. Pretoria: Republic of South Africa, Dept. of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Geological Survey Along the Oudshoorn-Gamtoos Basin, it occurs south of the Swartberg mountain range - around Oudtshoorn and eastwards. A large but highly eroded outcrop also occurs in the Soutpansvlakte Basin, in the Waterskilpad river area, north east of Bredasdorp. The far western portion of this conglomerate is composed of Bokkeveld (60%) and Table Mountain sandstone (40%) clasts. The more northern parts have far more intercalated sandstone and mudstone, with clasts originating from the central Ruens Bokkeveld deposits. The clasts of the southern parts are predominantly from the surrounding Bredasdorp mountains and Bokkeveld rocks. To the east, an isolated bed in the Soutrivier valley is composed almost entirely of disc- shaped shale and siltstone clasts (with occasional vein quartz rocks). Other outcrops occur in smaller, isolated basins south of Soetendalsvlei at Jubilee, where pale red and grey conglomerates, mudstones, sandstones and tuffaceous rocks support occasional silcrete caps, as well as at Haasvlakte. Laterally, the limits of the Enon conglomerate beds often interfinger or transition gradually into the softer sands and mudstones of the Kirkwood Formation. Outcroups are also known from the Breede River Valley.  Paleontology  Some silicified wood, charcoal fragments, abraded bone fragments, and theropod dinosaur teeth,Oudtshoorn theropod site at Fossilworks.org have been recovered from the Enon Formation. However, fossil preservation is extremely poor.

Advertised as a cross between a violin and guitar, it was essentially a fiberglass bodied electric violin with some very advanced internal electronics for the time. History thumb thumb The Vi-Tar was designed and marketed by Spencer Lee Larrison of the Exinde Corporation (Later the Xinde Corporation) in the early 1970s. Advertised as being designed \\"by a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\", it incorporated very advanced onboard electronics with active volume control for each string, a 'mute-tone' control and a built-in distortion called the \\"DynaFUZZ\\". Exact production dates and quantities are unknown. The basic design was patented in September 1972. Construction thumb The body of the Vi-tar is a hand molded fiberglass shell with roughly the same footprint as a standard violin. The upper 2 bouts are cut away to allow easier access to higher positions. It was designed to allow any standard chinrest and shoulder rest to be used. It was available in either a 4 string version, or a 5 string violin/viola combination in a variety of color combinations. The controls include separate volume controls for each string, a 'mute-tone', master volume and \\"DynaFUZZ\\" control. The bridge is a solid piece of acrylic and the magnetic pickups are built into fingerboard, allowing for the individual volume controls. The DynaFUZZ is an onboard distortion circuit. thumb The electronics are powered by an external 18v battery box and the power is sent through the cable using a 4 conductor cable terminating in U174/U (TP120) connectors. The battery box also has the output to run to an amplifier or headphones. Players The Vi-tar is listed on many album credits, but by far the most well known player was John Franklin \\"Ellington\\" Blair. John Blair was an improvisational jazz violinist who primarily used a Vi-tar violin throughout his career. He released 4 albums of his own, but also played on many others with artists such as Leon Thomas, Richie Havens and Lalo Schifrin. His 2 main Vi-tars were a white 4 string model he named 'Cleopatra' and a black 5 string named 'Nefertiti'.

It is described as the \\"Heart of Sikkim/Denzong\\", citing to its importance of religious sacredness. It is located on top of the hill rising between the Rathong chu and the Rangeet River, from Gyalshing and to the south east of Yuksam. The annual festival of Bumchu, meaning ~Holy water~ takes place on the 14th and 15th of the 1st month of Tibetan lunar calendar, often around the months of February and March. The festival is believed to predict the upcoming forecasts and events for Sikkim in the coming year. Undoubtedly, one of the most important and holiest festivals for all the Buddhists in Sikkim and around, it also provides for a perfect platform for all those Non-Buddhists who seek a deeper insight into Buddhism and its religious customs, beliefs and rituals. History of the Festival- Somewhere between 755 and 804 CE in Tibet under the reign of King Trisong Deutsonin. It was under his rule that Guru Padmasambhava when invited to Tibet performed a holy sadhana and consecrated the land with water from his SACRED VASE, which was then later concealed as a hidden treasure in his most blessed place, the Tashiding Monastery in Sikkim. Somewhere around 17th century, the vase was again discovered by one of the reincarnations of Padmasambhava and it is since that time, this festival again resumed with all its glory and splendour in the hidden and blessed land of Sikkim/Beyul Demazong. Tashiding is the nearest town to the Tashiding Monastery (Gompa) Tashiding means \\"The Devoted Central Glory\\" and the monastery by this name was founded in 1641 by Ngadak Sempa Chempo Phunshok Rigzing who belonged to the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Ngadak was one of the three wise men who held the consecration ceremony crowning the first King of Sikkim at Yuksom. It was extended and renovated in 1717 during the reign of the third Chogyal Chakdor Namgyal. 'Bhumchu Ceremony' or festival is a popular religious festival that is held on the 14th and 15th day of the first month of Tibetan Calendar.:File:Plaque at entrance to Tashiding Monastery.jpg: Official plaque at entrance to Tashiding Monastery erected by the Government of Sikkim. The Tashiding Monastery is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit starting with the first monastery at Yuksam in Sikkim known as the Dubdi Monastery, Norbugang Chorten, Pemayangtse Monastery, the Rabdentse ruins, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, and the Khecheopalri Lake. Legend There are several legends linked to the most revered monastery and the Bhumchu festival that is held here. According to one local legend Guru Padmasambhava shot an arrow into the air to select the place. Where the arrow he shot landed, he sat in meditation and that site eventually became the site of the Tashiding Monastery. The Golden Chorten near Tashiding Monastery Another legend relates to the three monks who consecrated the first Chogyal of Sikkim at Yuksam. It is said that the three monks saw an unusual divine phenomenon of bright light shining on top of the Kanchendzonga mountain, which reflected to a site near the place where the present Tashiding Monastery has been built. Concurrently, a scented smell of incense followed by all pervading divine music was also noted. The first Chogyal who visited the site subsequent to hearing this unusual event, erected a small chorten at the site and named it as Thongwa- Rang-Grol. Legend further glorifies the site stating that a mere sight of it \\"confers self-emancipation\\". Another absorbing legend is related to the celebration of the Bhumchu festival at Tashiding Monastery. The legend is traced to the tantric art. Guru Padmasambhava, while teaching the tantric system of \\"Mahakarunika Avalokiteshvara Sadhana and initiation on emancipation from the cycle of mundane existence\\" to the King Trisong Duetsen, prince Murub Tsenpo, Yeshe Tsogyal and Verotsana in Tibet, sanctified the same holy vase with holy water, which is now kept in Tashiding Monastery and revered during the Bhumchu festival. This vase is made of five types prized jewels, divine soil and holy water said to have been gathered by Padmasambhava from religious centres in India, Odiuana and Zahor. The vase was made by the wrathful deity Damchen Gar-bgag and sanctified by Guru Padmasambhava himself by performing the \\"Sadhana of Yidam Chuchig Zhal (meaning tutelary deity of eleven heads)\\". On this occasion, heavenly deities appeared in the sky and thereafter merged into the holy water contained in the vase. The vase then overflowed and the water dispersed in \\"all directions in the form of rays.\\" This ritual was immediately followed by an earthquake, which was considered an auspicious sign. The divine moment also witnessed the presence of the four guardian divinities namely, \\"the Gyalchen Dezhi/Cutur ‚Äì Maharajika of Dharma and the gods of the thirty-three heavens (Samchu Tsasumgyi Lhanam) who showered flowers from the sky.\\" The event was witnessed by devotees and Padmasmabhava distributed the holy water from the vase to all assembled people, which spiritually benefited one and all. The vase was then hidden as a treasure under the care of the divine deities. However, the vase was rediscovered and passed through the hands of several holy men and finally placed at Tashiding by Terton Ngdag Sampachenpo. During the reign of the first ruler of Sikkim, Phuntshog Namgyal, the Terton recited the holy hymn \\"Om Mani Padme Hum\\" five billions when several unique events were also witnessed in Sikkim. After the religious ceremony the vase with the water has been kept on display in a small chamber in the Monastery under the custody of the Chogyal himself, which is opened once a year during the Bhumchu festival. Geography This monastery located at an altitude of 1465 m is built on top of a heart shaped hill or helmet shaped hill above the confluence of the Rathong Chu and Rangeet rivers, with the Mt. Kanchendzonga providing the scenic back drop. It is about 16 km from Yuksam, 40 km from Gezing via Legship. The monastery is considered the spiritual centre of Sikkim since it is encircled by many important monasteries in Sikkim in all directions such as: the Dubdi Monastery 23 km away on its northern direction, the Khecheopalri Lake (wish fulfilling lake) on the northwest, the Pemayangtse monastery on the west, the Shiva temple at Legship on the south, the Mongbrue gompa and Ravangla B√∂n monastery on the southeast, the Ravangla Gelug monastery on the east, the Karma Kagyud Ralang Monastery on the northeast. Gulia summarising the importance of this monastery has said: Geographically the Monastery and the Tashiding town are surrounded by four divine caves located in four cardinal directions. The four caves where Buddhist saints meditated are: On the East is the Sharchog Bephug, on the South is the Khandozangphu, in the West is Dechenpug cave and on the North is the Lhari Nyingphug. The main deity deified in the monastery is Tashiding and hence the monastery is also known as 'Dakkar Tashiding'. History In the 17th century, Ngadak Sempa Chemp built a small Lhakhang at this location. This was enlarged into the present monastery during the reign of Chogyal Chakdor Namgyal. Pedi Wangmo built the main monastery and installed many statues which are still seen in the monastery. Lhatsun Chenpo built the Chortens; which are considered holy. Yanchong Lodil, the Master craftsman crafted the flagstones that surround the monastery. These are carved with the holy Buddhist mantra 'Om Mane Padme Hum'. Architecture Entrance gate to Tashiding Monastery An overall picture of the precincts of the monastery within the Tashiding town is provided in five distinct blocks namely, the Sinem market place, the outskirts, the main market place, the main Tashiding Monastery and the Chorten area. The Sinek market place is located on an incline on the ridge between Rathong Chu and Rangeet River. There is a gompa here called the Sinolochu Gompa from where an approach leads to the Tashiding Monastery on the southern direction. The settlement is spread lengthwise and is from Yuksom. A large 'Mani' stone is seen at the entrance to this settlement and the Tashiding market. From the main market centre the approach to the Monastery is through a road, and also a footpath. The footpath in the southern direction has a gentle slope and passes through a Mani and then prayer wind wheels terminating at the entrance gate of the Monastery. The Monastery itself consists of a 'Mani Lhakang' at the entrance surrounded by flags, and lead to the guest house. From this point ahead is the main 'Tashiding Gompa' which is called as Chogyal Lhakhang or the monastery, followed by the 'butter lamp house', four chortens, 'Tsenkhang', a new butter lamp house and finally terminating at the 'Guru Lhakhang', which is the temple of Guru Rinpoche. Other basic essential structures such as kitchen, school and residential housing are located on the left side of the approach path to the monastery. Chorten and inscription slabs outside the Tashiding Monastery. In the 'Chorten area', there are 41 chortens categorised as 'Chotens of Enlightenment', 'Chortens of Reconciliation' and 'Chortens of Great Miracle', which are all of Rinpoches and TathƒÅgatas. However, the main temple has undergone renovation work in modern times and rebuilt, but is still encircled by traditional buildings and chortens at the far end of the site, which holds the relics of Sikkim Chogyals and Lamas, including the 'Thong-Wa-rang-Dol' chorten which is believed to cleanse the soul of any person who looks at it. Also of major note are the stone plates called the 'Mani', the work of Yanchong Lodil who inscribed them with the sacred Buddhist inscriptions, such as \\"Om Mane Padme Hum\\". Festivals Bhumchu festival, which is linked by an ancient legend to Guru Padmasambhava, is about a divine vase filled with holy water kept in the monastery, which is opened for public display and worship every year on the night before the Full Moon day in the first month of Tibetan calendar. Bhumchu (Bhum=pot; Chu=water) is a Buddhist festival celebrated to predict the future. In this vase, water of Rathong chhu is stored for a year and kept in the Tashiding Monastery. It is opened during the festival by the lamas who inspect the water level and hence it is called the festival of holy water. The belief is that alteration in the quantity and quality of the water stored in the vase over a year would indicate the fortune of Sikkim and its people in the following year. If it is filled to the brim (which is interpreted as a measure of increase by 21 cups), the following year will be prosperous. If it is empty, famine will follow, and if it is half-filled also a prosperous year is predicted. If the water is polluted with dust it is interpreted as a sign of strife and clash. Once inspected and the Bhumchu festival is concluded, the lamas fill the vase with fresh water from the river and seal it for the opening in the following year. The procedure followed for taking out the sacred water from the vase is that the first cup of sacred water is taken out for blessing the members of the Royal family of the Chogyals, then the second cup is meant for the Lamas and the third cup of water is meant for the devotees to whom it is distributed. Pilgrims come to the monastery from all regions of Sikkim to be blessed with the holy water. The festival is of particular importance to the Bhutias (ethnic Tibetans) of Sikkim who hold the \\"life-sustaining water of the rivers\\" with great reverence. The festival falls on the 15th day Full Moon day of the first Tibetan month or Hindu month of Magh corresponding to February/March according to Gregorian calendar. The basic purpose of the festival is to highlight the importance of water as a precious resource to be conserved and its purity preserved. The prophecy also sends a message to the people that waters should not be polluted and its environmental importance is propagated.envis, p. 84 Gallery File:India - sikkim.jpgScroll painting of Buddha seen in the Monastery File:Plaque at entrance to Tashiding Monastery.jpgA plaque at the entrance to the Tashiding Monastery File:Chorten and inscriptions slabs outside the Tashiding Monastery..jpgChortens and inscription stones outside the Tashiding Monastery References Buddhist monasteries in Sikkim ","title":"Tashiding Monastery"},{"id":"25157044","text":"The Iles Formation is a Mesozoic geologic formation.

From 1069 to 1118 it belong to Izyaslavichi who primarily ruled from Turov (see Principality of Turov). After losing Turov to Monomakhovichi in 1105, the descendants of Izyaslav Yaroslavovich for a few years continued to rule in Volhynia. From 1154 to 1199 the principality was named Principality of Vladimir when the Principality of Lutsk (1154-1228) was separated.  Territory  The principality held the lands of the historic region of Volhynia from where it acquired its name. The capital of the principality as well as the largest and most important city of the region was Volodymyr. Other notable cities in the principality include Kremenets, Lutsk, Busk, Dorogobuzh, Brest, Belz and Shumsk. Principality of Volhynia in beige.  History  The Principality of Volhynia along with her sister state, the Principality of Halych were formed by sons of the ruling Rurik dynasty in Kiev.

GMail Drive was not supported by Google. It allowed a user to access a virtual drive stored in a Gmail account by causing the contents of the Gmail account to appear as a new network share on the user's workstation. In order to use this add-on, the user needed a Gmail e-mail account. The add-on enabled the user to use the standard Windows desktop file copy and paste commands to transfer files to and from the Gmail account as if it were a drive on the user's computer. Gmail Drive was based upon GmailFS, a file system developed by Richard Jones. GMail Drive was published in 2004 and functional as early as 2005 which predates Google's later implementation of Google Drive released on April 24, 2012. As of 2015, the official extension page declares the project dead.  Function  In order for GMail Drive to operate, the computer must be connected to the Internet and the user must have a Gmail account. A broadband connection is preferable, though not necessary, as all operations are done through Gmail and consequently over the Internet. GMail Drive uses the inbox of the Gmail account to store files and creates a virtual filesystem on top of the Gmail account, enabling the user to save and retrieve files stored on the Gmail account directly from inside Windows Explorer. GMail Drive adds a new virtual drive to the computer under the My Computer folder, where the user can create new folders, copy and drag-and-drop files to, but does not give an actual drive letter, such as C:, preventing its use in all console applications, and some older Windows applications. When the user creates a new file using GMail Drive, it generates an e-mail and posts it to the Gmail account's inbox. The e-mail appears in the normal Inbox folder when using the normal Gmail interface, and the file is attached as an e-mail attachment. GMail Drive periodically checks the mail account (using the Gmail search function) to see if new files have arrived and to rebuild the virtual drive's directory structures. Multiple computers can connect to one Gmail account thus allowing GMail Drive to act as a multi-user file server. Consequently, restrictions on the Gmail service are also enforced when using GMail Drive. For example, files larger than 25 MB cannot be uploaded, as the maximum file size of Gmail attachments is 25 MB. In the past, Gmail also prevented users from transferring certain file types, such as an executable or ZIP archives that contain an executable within. Some users bypassed this restriction by renaming the file extension or by putting it into a RAR or 7z archive. This restriction has now been lifted. A GNU software package named PhpGmailDrive even makes it possible to link different Gmail accounts together, and with some manual changes you can have a Gmail Drive built out of several Gmail accounts.  Caveats  GMail Drive is an experimental package that depends on but is not provided by Google. Changes in Google's Gmail system may render GMail Drive temporarily or permanently inoperable. The current GMail Drive does not support accounts that are hosted with Google Apps. The Gmail Program Policies do not explicitly ban GMail Drive, shell namespace extensions, or the use of Gmail storage space for files other than e-mail. Nonetheless, immoderate use of GMail Drive may trigger Google to temporarily suspend a Gmail account.

Mstislav was married to Agnes of Poland and in a fierce opposition to Yuri Dolgoruki. Being exiled to Poland for a short period of time Mstislav was able to drive the Suzdal's Prince out of Volhynia. With time the city of Belz with its surrounded territories was passed to Vsevolod Mstislavich who in turn passed it to his son Alexander. In the early 13th century, Alexander, a nephew of Roman the Great, was deposed in 1234 from Belz by Daniel of Galicia who incorporated Belz into the Duchy of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (later the Kingdom of Rus) which would control Belz till 1340. Soon afterwards, in 1240 and 1241, it was ravaged by the Mongols, as were most other Rus principalities; the town was burned, the local castle destroyed and locals had to recognize the Mongol suzerainty. The Mongol influence waned in the following decades, because of the decline of the Mongol Empire and Pax Mongolica. Early in the 14th century, after the death of Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia, the King of Rus, there started a war for its succession. Eventually the Duchy was inherited by a prince Yuri, son of Narimantas (Jerzy Narymuntowicz) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The period of Yuri's rule of Belz (1340-1377) saw the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars; Belz was besieged several times (in 1351, 1352 and 1355). From 1378 to 1387 it fell into the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Hungary, as in 1377 Belz was captured by Louis I of Hungary; for several years, the duchy was governed in Louis's name by prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk. At that time, Poland was in a brief union with Hungary, but in 1387, after the end of the union, Belz was taken by Queen Jadwiga of Kingdom of Poland. At first it was part of another Polish fiefdom, the Duchy of Masovia, as in 1388 the king of Poland, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, granted Belz to Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, for his recognition of Masovia as a fiefdom of Poland and as a dowry for Siemowit's marriage with Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's sister, Alexandra.

The Chogyar Namgyal established the first monastery known as the Dubdi Monastery in 1701, at Yuksom in Sikkim, which is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit involving the Norbugang Chorten, Pemayangtse Monastery, the Rabdentse ruins, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, the Khecheopalri Lake and the Tashiding Monastery. Established in 1701, it is professed to be the oldest monastery in Sikkim and is located on the top of a hill which is about an hour's walk () from Yuksom. It was also known as the Hermit's Cell after its ascetic founder Lhatsun Namkha Jigme, who along with two other lamas from Tibet met at Norbugang near Yuksom and crowned Phuntsog Namgyal as the first King or Chogyal of Sikkim at Norbugang Yuksom in 1642. The literal meaning of 'Dubdi' in local language is \\"the retreat\\". History Dubdi monastery is central to the history of Sikkim as it is closely linked to the founding of the State of Sikkim at Yuksom in the middle of the 17th century by Lhetsum Chenpo and his two associate lamas. Chenpo‚Äôs green image is enshrined in the Dhubdi monastery as it was established by him to commemorate the founding of the Kingdom of Sikkim. It is the only monastery (purported now as the first monastery built in Sikkim) surviving out of the four built at that time, the other three locations are now identified by: a cluster of four juniper trees was the location where a monastery of Khardokpa sect existed; another location of a monastery established by Lama of Nadakpa sect now seen in the form of a rocky mound and two juniper trees, and the third site has now a chorten, which was originally the location of the residence of the King of Sikkim who was crowned at Yuksom by the three lamas. Monastery had thirty monks some time back. Now to gain access to the monastery, the only monk who stays in the monastery has to be informed in advance. Architecture Dubdi stands at an altitude of on a spur. Established during the reign of Chogyar Namgyal, the Monastery has an elaborately painted interior area. Images of divinities, saints, other symbols and collection of manuscripts and texts are housed in the monastery. The statues of three lamas who were responsible for establishing Yuksom are also installed in the monastery. It is a two storied structure built in stone. It is square in plan and faces south. It has a tapering tower with a flat roof made of iron sheets with projecting eaves. The top of the roof has a bell shaped gilded dome known as \\"Gyaltshen\\".

They dwell in forests or near to forests in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam in Kerala, and Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts in Tamil Nadu. Though they cultivate everything and make agriculture as the main profession, they have a special liking for fishing and hunting. Literacy is estimated to be around 53.84%.Major Tribals in Kerala. Focus On People, retrieved August 20, 2011 Kaanikkar Nritham is a form of group dance performed as a rural offering.Tribal Dances. The PRD Kerala Website, retrieved August 20, 2011 The Kanikkars are semi-nomadic, living in temporary huts of bamboo and reeds. These are generally situated on hillsides. Previously they practiced slash- and-burn cultivation, but this was banned in the late 19th century, who assigned certain areas of the forest for their exclusive use. Some work on planter estates, others in manufacturing bows and arrows. They shoot heated arrows at elephants from huts in the trees when watching over crops. These huts are easily constructed, with bamboo walls and a thatched leaf roof. They are built 50 feet above the ground, and are connected to the ground with a ladder. The community also collects minor forest produce, especially honey. The Kanikkars climb ropes at the base of cliffs where nests are located, and collect honey and put it in baskets. Subdivisions of Kanikkars are known as Ilams, or families: 5 are Machampi (brother-in-law ilams), who are endogamous, and 5 are Annantampi (brother ilams), who are exogamous. The Kanikkars live in communities under a Muttakani, a headman. They inherit property father-to-son, but a share of the property goes to a nephew. Their chief deity is Sasta, but the community worships a series of other forest deities. They worship their gods twice a year. On the morning of the festival people take plantains and rice to the headman's house. Most of the rice is husked and ground to flour by the boys and men, and is then taken to a clearing where a row of plantain leaves is laid. A Kanikkar spreads rice over these leaves, and above puts plantains. An officiating priest burns incense, and all pray for goodwill of their fields. When the land is first cleared for cultivation, the headman is given rice and coconuts and clears part of the field. History Concerning their genealogy and genesis they have interesting stories. Aryans who moved from north to south called them Kanikkar, which literally means landlords, descendants of the Kings, gave their offerings to Attingal King. Thus they are so called. Another story concerning them is that they derived the name Malayarayan from Hindu mythological Sage, Agasthya. They claim that once they were the rulers of the area comprising Trivandrum, Kollam, parts of Kanyakumari dist and claim that they were here even before the Dravidians, and claim to be the original people of the land. It is a fact that they had a special place among the rulers of Travancore and they were treated without any discrimination and did not come under the untouchability practiced in Kerala. They had free and unrestricted access to all the temples including Sreepadmanabha temple since time immemorial their children were admitted in palace run schools including Kilimanoor even before abolition of caste system and Kshetrapravesana Vilambaram. They were not confined to hills alone, they were present in the areas nearer to the coast like Kazhakuttam, Kulathoor, Uloor, etc. Language The Kanikkaran language is closely related to Tamil, but has significant Mayalam influence.

The composition is foraminiferal calcisiltite and calcarenite and is rich in macrofossils of a diverse range of species. The specimens of ammonites date the Miria Marl of the Giralia Anticline layer to a period of formation at a major extinction event in the Cretaceous.

The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.

The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils. The upper member of the Moenave is the pale reddish-brown with a thickness of and cliff-forming Springdale Sandstone. It was deposited in swifter, larger, and more voluminous streams than the older Dinosaur Canyon Member.

The upper part of the shale beds contains up to of discontinuous ironstone beds. The total thickness is about . The formation is transitional with both the underlying Lewis Shale and the overlying Fruitland Formation. The formation is interpreted as a marine littoral formation deposited during the final regression of the Western Interior Seaway from the San Juan Basin, with recognizable delta-front and barrier facies.Flores and Erpenbeck 1981 The regression was interrupted by at least three brief transgressions that produced tongues of the upper Pictured Cliff Sandstone in the northern San Juan Basin.Ambrose and Ayers 2007 Fossils The formation contains fossil marine invertebrates and trace fossil Ophiomorpha major, tyical of a nearshore marine environment. Economic geology The formation serves as a reservoir rock for natural gas. Production by 1988 amounted to 87.7 x 109 cubic meters with remaining reserves estimated at that time as 127.4 x 109 cubic meters. The gas likely originated both in the underlying Lewis Shale and the coal beds of the overlying Fruitland Formation.Scott et al. 1991 History of investigation The formation was first described as the Pictured Cliffs group or Pictured Cliffs sandstone by W.H.

It was first collected in 1968, and was not formally described until 1971. The number of living plants is estimated at fewer than 300. It is considered Critically Imperiled in global rank which means it is at very high risk of extinction. It has been a federally protected species since 1992. The genus Wilkesia is one of three genera constituting the silversword alliance, a group of highly diverse yet genetically exceedingly closely related species, all thought to be descended from a colonizing ancestor related to the tarweed of North America. Description Wilkesia hobdyi is a perennial shrub with branches reaching a length of extending vertically from the base. Branch tips yield whorl, rather than spirals, of narrow, flat, grass-like, somewhat thick leaves around long. Cream-colored flowers are produced in inflorescences in diameter. Flowering has been observed most often in the winter months, but also during June. This species is probably pollinated through outcrossing and is probably self-incompatible. Insects are the most likely pollinators. Wilkesia die after flowering. Habitat Wilkesia hobdyi inhabits dry, nearly vertical rock outcroppings in the western part of the island at elevations of . Rainfall in these sites is less than 1,200 ml per year.Terrain typical of W. hobdyi habitat, western Kauai Threats The primary threat to the species is grazing by feral goats. Native species evolved in the absence of grazing animals and thus did not develop any mechanism for protection. When goats were introduced in the 18th century, many native species were devastated. The existing plants are found only on nearly vertical cliffs which even goats cannot climb. The species is also threatened by encroachment by alien plant species, especially grasses which can smother the plants. Alien grasses also pose fire hazards which endanger the plants. The other species making up the Wilkesia genus, W. gymnoxiphium, is not officially endangered, though it is also found only on Kaua'i and is not common there. Associated plants Associated plants include ƒÅhinahina (Artemisia spp.) iliau (Wilkesia gymnoxiphium), nehe (Lipochaeta connata), Lobelia niihauensis, makou (Peucedanum sandwicense), kokio ula (Hibiscus kokio), alahee (Psydrax odorata), alaala wai nui (Peperomia spp.), naio (Myoporum sandwicense), ilima (Sida fallax), uhaloa (Waltheria indica), aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), and kƒÅwelu (Eragrostis variabilis).

Milas was born in the village of Zmijavci near Imotski in Zagora, and graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb. Milas was close to Marko Veselica and was active in the Croatian Spring in the early 1970s. In 1972, the authorities of communist Yugoslavia charged Milas with \\"actions against the state\\", arrested and spent six months in jail awaiting trial. He was released to prepare his defense, and subsequently fled to Austria where he received the status of a refugee. Yugoslavia sought his apprehension, which Austrian courts denied. He was tried in absentia in Yugoslavia and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 1988 Milas met the Croatian historian and politician Franjo Tuƒëman and in August 1989 joined his newly formed Croatian Democratic Union. Milas received a passport to return to Croatia in February 1990 and was elected to the Croatian Parliament in its first democratic elections. During the first phase of the Croatian War of Independence between the summer of 1991 and the spring of 1992, Milas served as the Deputy Minister of Defence and Deputy Minister of Justice. Milas was reelected in the 1992 election, and served as the Minister of Justice from June 6 to August 12, 1992 and was later vice-president in the Croatian Government, under Hrvoje ≈†ariniƒá. On May 28, 1995, President Tuƒëman awarded him with the Grand Order of King Dmitar Zvonimir. Also in May 1995, the function of the Keeper of the State Seal () was created, and President Tuƒëman named Milas to the position on May 6, 1995, where he remained until February 1, 2000. no other person was named to the position after Milas. Milas was elected to Sabor again in the October 1995 election. Between 1996 and 2000 Milas was a member of the Council of the Croatian National Bank. He was last elected to the Croatian Parliament in the 2000 Croatian parliamentary election, where he served until late 2003, when he retired from politics. Milas gained considerable notoriety in the Croatian public after he publicly expressed his opinion that in the West, brain is valued in kilograms. Ivan Milas died in Zmijavci at the age of 72.

Geology  Leptocleidus capensis (Andrews, 1911) from the Sundays River Formation The Sundays River Formation overlies the Kirkwood Formation which it grades laterally into in certain areas, meaning that they correlate in age in some localities. The sedimentary rock of the Sundays River comprises mainly fine to medium grained grey sandstones which often contain shell fragments, siltstones, and mudstones. The sandstone layers are frequently cemented with calcite layers. These were deposited in a shallow marine environment which likely included estuarine and lagoonal settings.  Paleontology  The Sundays River is highly fossiliferous and a variety of fossil flora and fauna have been discovered. Invertebrate shells from ammonites, bivalves, and microfossils such as species of forams and ostracods are commonly found cemented within the calcite layers in the sandstone deposits.

These venues were: * Chariots Shoreditch (opened 1996, closed 2016) * Chariots Farringdon (opened 1999, closed 2010 due to the Crossrail development).Archive page of Chariots Farringdon in 2007. * Chariots Streatham (opened 1999, closed 2016) * Chariots Limehouse (2002, previously Sailors Sauna, since c.2013 Sailors Sauna again) * Chariots Waterloo (opened 2003, previously Wellingtons Health Club, closed 2018) * Chariots Vauxhall (2005, the only venue still open) In terms of floor-space and capacity, Chariots Shoreditch was the largest gay sauna in the UK. Description Chariots Shoreditch was on three floors, decorated in the style of Roman baths. On the ground floor was the main entrance with several areas of customer lockers, main shower room, TV lounge with bar/cafe, vending machines, internet area and an inclusive gym with several work-out machines. The first floor housed a maze of free private cabins of various sizes including orgy rooms and an extensive dark maze (pitch black orgy room and set of cabins). The second floor had a swimming pool, poolside loungers, two whirlpools (jacuzzis), two steam-rooms, two hot dry saunas, showers, glory-hole cubicles, a second smaller dark room, outside private smoking area and a porn video/orgy room. There were free STD testing sessions held at the bathhouse. Chariots Roman Spa opened in 1997. The management previously ran Rio's, a Kentish Town naturist spa. Originally a warehouse, the Shoreditch redevelopment cost ¬£2.5 million.Chariots History, archive from official site In 2000 the venue was significantly expanded with the addition of the restaurant, 30 more cubicles, video lounge and internet room. It was announced in February 2016 that the venue would be closing down, and the building would be demolished for a redevelopment of the site.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/londons-biggest-gay-sauna-to-be- demolished-to-make-way-for-hotel-a3173226.html Chariots Waterloo was on one level on the first floor of the building. It comprised an entrance lobby, locker room, cafe, showers, a steam room, a large sauna later divided in two, dark rooms, glory holes, private rooms and relaxation area. Etiquette Customers were given two towels, a locker key and condoms on entrance. Further condoms were available from wall dispensers. Most people kept the second towel as a dry spare in their locker. The convention was to walk around the bathhouse wearing a towel, though nudity in the dry or steam sauna was normal. Apart from the lounge, cafe area, lockable cabins and within the jacuzzi, sexual activity occurred anywhere, with anyone free to watch or attempt to join in. =Media attention= On 2 May 1998, former footballer Justin Fashanu spent the evening in Chariots Shoreditch before committing suicide nearby that night. There was significant press interest and internet speculation in 2006 when Chariots Shoreditch was closed for Easter Weekend, after a 24-year-old man's body was found. The police investigation found that death was due to a drugs overdose but there were no suspicious circumstances. On Sunday 20 March 2011 the London Fire Brigade were called to attend a fire which was reported to have destroyed most of the ground floor of Chariots Shoreditch. 150 patrons were evacuated, and there were no injuries.

Description Palaemonetes paludosus is up to long and largely transparent. By manipulating the pigment granules in its body, it can produce effective camouflage against its background. It is very similar to P. kadiakensis, from which it can be distinguished by the arrangement of spines on the telson. Distribution Palaemonetes paludosus is common in southern states east of the Appalachian Mountains. It is also found in Louisiana, where it may not be native, and there are scattered records from further west, in Texas and California. Their distribution is due to decreased susceptibility to predation because of complexity in higher habitats in Polygonum bedsDistribution, diel movement, and growth of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes paludosus in the Kissimmee River-floodplain ecosystem,K. J. Wessell (a1), R. W. Merritt (a2) and K. W. Cummins Ecology Palaemonetes paludosus lives in fresh water or slightly brackish water, usually in lakes. It is nocturnal, remaining hidden among the vegetation by day, and emerging at night to feed on plankton. It is an important prey item for a number of birds and fishes, and may be considered a keystone species.

This divides the Mancos Shale into the underlying Rio Salado Tongue and the overlying Pescado or D-Cross Tongue. The base of the wedge is approximately along a line from the Arizona-New Mexico border southwest of Gallup, New Mexico to east of Cookes Range, where the overlying Pescado or D-Cross Tongue of the Mancos Shale pinches out. The wedge itself pinches out along an arc that passes south of Gallup and just north of Acoma Pueblo and west of Capitan. Total thickness is . The formation itself is interpreted as a regression-transgression sequence of the Western Interior Seaway. It is divided into three members: the lower Atarque Sandstone Member, which is regressive marine sandstone; the Carthage Member, a sequence of marine and nonmarine shale and sandstone; and the upper Fite Ranch Member, a transgressive marine sandstone. Fossils The base of the formation contains the ammonite Spathites coahuilaensis characteristic of the middle Turonian.Cobban 1988 The formation spans the ammonite zones of Collignoniceras woollgari, Prionocyclus percarinatus, P. hyatti, and P. macombit, indicating that the formation ranges from early middle Turonian to early late Turonian. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific genus. History of investigation The unit was first designated the Tres Hermanos Sandstone member of the Mancos Shale by C.L. Herrick in 1900.Herrick 1900 In 1983, Hook et al. raised the unit to formation rank and interpreted it as a clastic wedge directed to the northeast into the Mancos Shale.

It is equivalent in age to the Lourinh√£ Formation of Portugal. It was originally thought to date from the Late Tithonian-Middle Berriasian, but more recent work suggests a Kimmeridigan-Late Tithonian age. The Villar del Arzobispo Formation's age in the area of Riodeva in Spain has been dated based on stratigraphic correlations as middle-upper Tithonian, approximately 145-141 million years old. Most of the unit consists of siliclastic mudstone, however the lower portion of the formation is dominated by bioclastic, oolitic and peloidal limestone, while channelised sandstone and conglomerate is found in the middle portion of the unit. While the lower part of the formation was deposited in an inner carbonate platform, the upward gradation into mudstone in the middle and upper portions of the formation represents a change in depositional environment to paralic and alluvial plain conditions. Dinosaur remains are found throughout the unit, but are more abundant and better preseved in the terrestrially deposited middle-upper sections.

It was written in response to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey's A Vision of Judgement (1821), which had imagined the soul of king George triumphantly entering Heaven to receive his due. Byron was provoked by the High Tory point of view from which the poem was written, and he took personally Southey's preface which had attacked those \\"Men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations\\" who had set up a \\"Satanic school\\" of poetry, \\"characterized by a Satanic spirit of pride and audacious impiety\\". He responded in the preface to his own Vision of Judgment with an attack on \\"The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the renegado intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem\\", and mischievously referred to Southey as \\"the author of Wat Tyler\\", an anti- royalist work from Southey's firebrand revolutionary youth. His parody of A Vision of Judgement was so lastingly successful that, as the critic Geoffrey Carnall wrote, \\"Southey's reputation has never recovered from Byron's ridicule.\\"Geoffrey Carnall, in H. C. G. Matthew and B. H. Harrison (eds.) The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. 51, pp. 698‚Äì9; The Poetical Works of Robert Southey (Paris: Galignani, 1829) p. 587  Synopsis  Byron's poem is set in Heaven, where the carnage of the Napoleonic Wars has placed a massive workload on the Recording Angel, though since most of the dead have been damned, St. Peter has little to do. After \\"a few short years of hollow peace\\"Line 49 comes the death of George III, whom the poet describes as, A cherub brings the news of the king's death to St. Peter, and George III then arrives accompanied by Lucifer, the archangel Michael and an angelic host. Lucifer claims him for Hell, portraying him as a friend of tyrants and an enemy of liberty: \\"He ever warr'd with freedom and the free\\".Line 353 In support of this view, Lucifer calls John Wilkes's shade as witness, who however declines to give evidence against the king, claiming that his ministers were more to blame. The soul of the pseudonymous pamphleteer Junius is then summoned, and on being asked for his opinion of king George, replies \\"I loved my country, and I hated him.\\"Line 664 Lastly the demon Asmodeus produces Robert Southey himself, whom he has abducted from his earthly home. Southey gives an account of his own history, which Byron thus summarises: Southey then begins reading from his Vision of Judgement, but before he has got further than the first few lines the angels and devils flee in disgust, and St. Peter knocks the poet down so that he falls back to Derwent Water: George III meanwhile takes advantage of the confusion to slip into Heaven unnoticed, and begins practising the hundredth psalm.  Publication and prosecution  Byron wrote The Vision of Judgment in Ravenna, Italy, beginning it on 7 May 1821 (four weeks after the publication of Southey's poem) and completing it by 4 October. It was sent in the first instance to John Murray, at that time his usual publisher, but Murray hesitated to accept such a dangerous work, and finally rejected it. Murray then passed The Vision of Judgment on to the radical publisher John Hunt, who included it in the first number of his short-lived magazine The Liberal on 15 October 1822, minus Byron's preface which Murray had neglected to send. In this edition Byron's name was not used, the poem being said to be by \\"Quevedo Redivivus\\" (Quevedo revived). Some months after publication a legal action was brought against Hunt for publishing a libel against George IV, in spite of the fact that he is not mentioned in the poem. A verdict was brought in against Hunt, and he was fined ¬£100.Andrew Rutherford Byron: A Critical Study (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1961) p. 381; Ethel Colburn Mayne Byron (London: Methuen, 1912) vol. 2, pp. 179, 252; Luther A. Brewer My Leigh Hunt Library: The First Editions (New York: Burt Franklin, 1970) pp. 124‚Äì6.  Critical reception  Reviews of the poem were generally vitriolic. The Courier for 26 October 1822 described Byron as having \\"a brain from heaven and a heart from hell\\", assuring its readers that he \\"riots in thoughts that fiends might envy,\\" and \\"seems to have lived only that the world might learn from his example how worthless and how pernicious a thing is genius, when divorced from religion, from morals, and from humanity.\\"Ethel Colburn Mayne Byron (London: Methuen, 1912) vol. 2, pp. 179, 252. The Literary Gazette for 19 October 1822 held a similar opinion: > If we do not express our abhorrence of such heartless and beastly ribaldry, > it is because we know no language strong enough to declare the disgust and > contempt which it inspires...We deliver the judgment of Britain when we > assert, that these passages are so revolting to every good feeling, there is > not a gentleman in the country who will not hold their author in contempt as > unworthy of the character of a gentleman.Andrew Rutherford (ed.) Lord Byron: > The Critical Heritage (London: Routledge, 1996) p. 249. Yet some 19th-century readers agreed with Byron's own assessment of it as \\"One of my best things\\".Dieter A.

Joseph was the eldest of three sons and two daughters of the couple. He received his bachelor's degree from City College of New York in 1931 and a master's degree from Columbia University in New York City in 1932. Career Political activism In 1930 while a Junior at City College, Lash joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA), of which he remained a member until his resignation in 1937. Following his graduation in 1932, Lash went to work for the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), an independent socialist organization closely tied to the SPA. He remained head of the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID) and editor of its publication Student OutlookMaurine Hoffman Beasley, Holly Cowan Shulman, Henry R. Beasley, The Eleanor Roosevelt Encyclopedia. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2001; pp. 305-307. from 1933 until 1935. In 1936 Lash became the executive secretary of the American Student Union, a popular front organization which brought together members of the youth organizations of the rival Socialist and Communist parties. Lash served in this capacity until 1939. In 1934 Lash began organizing anti-war demonstrations on campuses, but when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 between Loyalist defenders of the Spanish Republic, backed by the world Communist and Socialist movements, and pro-Fascist rebels under the leadership of Francisco Franco, he dropped his pacifism and dedicated himself to fighting Fascism. About 1937 Lash went to Spain but did not participate in the fighting, preferring to speak to youth groups in an effort to help rally support for the Loyalist cause. He grew politically close to the Communist Party in this period. The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 23, 1939, deeply shook Lash's growing leanings towards the Communist Party, causing him to resign as executive secretary of the American Student Union. Three months later he was subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (colloquially known as the \\"Dies Committee\\" after its chairman) to be questioned about his activities with the American Student Union and the American Youth Congress. Lash was a hostile witness on November 11, refusing to cooperate with the committee in its effort to obtain the names of members of the Communist Party and to expound upon their influence. After boarding a train at Pennsylvania Station to attend the hearing, Lash met First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, becoming lifelong friends. The White House press corps was stunned when she invited him and six other witnesses on the train to lunch at the White House, then made an appearance at Lash's afternoon hearing to lend moral support. After the hearing, she invited Lash and the others to a dinner at the White House, where they met her husband and Helen Gahagan Douglas and her husband, actor Melvyn Douglas.www.nytimes.com In 1940, shaken by the turn of the Soviet Union and its Communist Party USA supporters away from militant anti-Fascism to neutrality towards the Adolf Hitler regime, Lash established the non-Communist national student organization, the International Student Service, serving as its head until 1942. In 1942 at his own request, Lash made a second appearance before the Dies Committee, at which he renounced his former Communist Party allies, while at the same time refusing to provide information about individuals with whom he worked during the Popular Front period. Lash applied for a commission with Naval Intelligence during World War II but was apparently turned away as a potential security risk. He instead enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force, which he entered as a sergeant before being promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. During the wartime years he maintained a correspondence with the First Lady, who visited him during her 1943 American Red Cross tour of the Pacific. In 1947 with Eleanor Roosevelt, Lash was a co-founder and New York director of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), an anti-Communist national membership organization of American liberals. He remained director until 1949. Journalist and biographer In 1950, Lash went to work for the New York Post as the paper's United Nations correspondent. Lash began his career as a chronicler of the Roosevelt Administration in 1952, when he assisted Franklin D. Roosevelt's son Elliott Roosevelt with the editing for publication of two volumes of the President's letters. In 1961, Lash published his first full-length book, a biography of U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. Thereafter, he moved to a position as assistant editor of the New York Post's editorial page, staying in that capacity until 1966. Following Eleanor Roosevelt's death in 1962, Lash set to work writing a memoir of her, published two years later as Eleanor Roosevelt: A Friend's Memoir. This fair and familiar treatment of his friend kept him in the Roosevelt family's eye. In 1966, two years after the publication of this book, Lash received a telephone call from Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., the literary executor of his mother. Roosevelt asked whether Lash might like to take a look at Eleanor Roosevelt's personal papers, with a view to writing a biography. Lash accepted this offer with gusto, quit his job at the Post, and began a five-year project which would culminate in the publication of the first installment of a two-part biography, Eleanor and Franklin. This book, which dealt sympathetically but candidly with the Roosevelts' sometimes troubled marriage, made headlines and garnered critical praise. It won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1972, cementing Lash's prominence as an independent writer. A series of literary projects ensued. Personal life and death Lash was married twice; his second wife was Trude Wenzel. Lash died at age 77 on August 22, 1987, in Boston, Massachusetts, where he had been undergoing treatment for a heart ailment. Legacy Lash won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award as well as the Francis Parkman Prize for Eleanor and Franklin. Lash's papers are held by the New York State Archives in Albany, New York, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, New York. References Works During his lifetime Lash's books were translated into a number of European languages, including German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, and Croatian.Author search: Joseph P.

De Batuc has worked in a variety of mediums including drawing, painting, ceramics, silkscreen and lithograph prints, and has also been commissioned for several special projects such as murals in the Los Angeles area. His work with Self Help Graphics during its early years and during the height of the Chicano Movement connects de Batuc to a rich history of political and artistic activism. Through this work and activism, de Batuc helped to create a collective Mexican American cultural pride and identity that was integral to the goals of the Chicano Movement. In 2005, Alfredo de Batuc was stricken with a severe case of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, which has kept him from active life since, and from which he is slowly recovering.  Biography  Alfredo de Batuc was born in 1950 in the small village of Batuc, located in the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico.De Batuc, Alfredo, Alfredo de Batuc: Liberation of an Artist. Interview by Eric Minh Swenson. February 7, 2012. Video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm3SAudUq3I&feature;=youtu.be. He lived in this village for the first thirteen years of his life until he decided to leave home to join a Roman Catholic boarding school. De Batuc left the boarding school after three years to join his family, who had recently relocated to Hermosillo, the state capital of Sonora. While in Hermosillo, de Batuc attended the Academia de Artes Plasticas and became involved in various arts organizations and exhibits and began to produce art more seriously. De Batuc‚Äôs family, along with the 3,000 other inhabitants of Batuc were forced to leave the village and relocate due to the construction of the Plutarco Elias Calles, or El Novillo Dam. The controversial construction of the dam was implemented by the Mexican government from 1958 to 1964 and was part of a national effort to transition to an industrialized economy from the agricultural economy involving mining and cattle raising that had previously dominated the area.De Batuc, Alfredo. Reflecting Solitude and Dreams: Alfredo de Batuc Documentary. Interview by Oregel Films. November 12, 2019. Video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE0fRrgMGQ4. The dam was meant to provide water for irrigation and generate electricity but resulted in the complete flooding and subsequent destruction of the village of Batuc along with two other neighboring towns. In an interview conducted in 2012, de Batuc discussed how this event had affected him as a child, stating that he knew he would be forced to leave but remained in his home as long as possible before it was destroyed. His family was one of the last to leave Batuc, and he remembers watching from a distance as the water slowly rose to submerge his childhood home. This forced relocation and the flooding of his village have deeply influenced de Batuc and his art, and he still refers to this event as the ‚Äúdeath by drowning of [his] home town‚Äù and is reminded ‚Äúthat in the house of [his] childhood, fish swim.‚Äù De Batuc left Hermosillo when he was twenty-five in order to settle in Los Angeles, California and pursue his artistic career. While studying and creating individual pieces, he became interested in the idea of producing multiples or works in series and became involved with the serigraphy program at Self Help Graphics in Los Angeles almost immediately after settling there. De Batuc quickly became close to fellow artist Carlos Bueno, who was integral to the foundation of Self Help Graphics as well as their efforts to bring the traditional Mexican holiday of Dia de los Muertos to California. De Batuc subsequently became more involved with these efforts to introduce the festival to the local area and therefore foster a sense of cultural pride and identity among the Mexican American community of California. During these early years in Los Angeles, de Batuc held a variety of jobs including preschool teacher, children's book illustrator, and story- board artist for the film industry. De Batuc continued to sell his work but only began exhibiting professionally in 1984. Since then, de Batuc has focused solely on his artistic career and has exhibited locally as well as internationally in cities such as Kyoto, Japan, Mexico City, Mexico, and Tijuana, Mexico. Over the course of his career, de Batuc has produced works on paper, paintings, ceramics, silkscreen and lithograph prints as well as special commissions for murals and other commemorative pieces. Some of his works are now held in the permanent collections of the Laguna Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum, and the Museo Estudio Diego Rivera in Mexico City. In 2005, de Batuc was developed a severe case of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and can cause nerve damage and paralysis. Unfortunately for de Batuc, the disease mostly affected his upper extremities, resulting in the paralysis of his hands and the inability to continue his artistic career. Since the onset of the disease, de Batuc has been involved in extensive physical therapy in order to recover his mobility and independence. While de Batuc still suffers some residual effects such as extreme fatigue, he has begun to produce art again, albeit only small drawings and paintings.  Artistic Practice  De Batuc is chiefly concerned with the formal elements of art and design, including composition, color, visual harmony, and three-dimensionality. His works have a strong sense of composition, and his application of paint results in a consistently rich and complex surface. A number of symbols and icons constantly recur throughout the body of de Batuc‚Äôs work, including references to the primordial elements of earth, water, fire, and air as well as references to ancient Mexican civilizations. De Batuc specifically references the Olmec head stone carvings found in the Gulf of Mexico and reinterprets these monumental figures into an all-seeing being he calls the \\"Presence.‚Äù In his earlier works, de Batuc painted this figure as completely ambiguous. While viewers have identified it as the sun or the moon or as male or female, de Batuc has assigned no meaning to the Presence. De Batuc depicts the Presence not as threatening or as a symbol of either good or bad, but as a completely neutral icon. However, in more recent years, de Batuc has begun to paint this figure with more feminine qualities and characteristics.De Batuc, Alfredo. Alfredo de Batuc: His Art. His Habitat. His City. Interview by Eric Minh Swenson. February 14, 2012. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKc2YGt8QRM. De Batuc has depicted the Presence throughout his body of work, but it can be seen specifically in his paintings entitled Presence with Volcano and Dog and Three Men in a Boat (Presence). The Los Angeles City Hall is another notable and recurring symbol in de Batuc‚Äôs work. After settling in Los Angeles, de Batuc developed a desire to anchor his works in the area. He decided to use the Los Angeles City Hall as this marker and identifier as opposed to other landmarks of Los Angeles such as the Hollywood sign. According to de Batuc, unlike these other popular icons of Los Angeles, the city hall represents the people of Los Angeles, both legally and politically. De Batuc also cites the rivalry of Los Angeles and New York as artistic capitals of the United States as a reason for the repetition of this symbol. De Batuc aims to establish Los Angeles as an artistic center rather than solely as a center for the television and film industry with which it is typically associated. In placing his artworks firmly within the city of Los Angeles, he hopes to bring about the recognition and appreciation of Los Angeles as an important artistic center of the United States. De Batuc 's representations of the Los Angeles City Hall can be seen in many of his works including Seven Views of City Hall, Our Lord City Hall, and Sub Rosa.  Work with Self Help Graphics  De Batuc‚Äôs involvement at Self Help Graphics in the years immediately following his move to Los Angeles along with his working relationship with Carlos Bueno led de Batuc to become involved in the efforts by Self Help Graphics to bring the Dia de los Muertos festival to California. The festival and the efforts to popularize it in California were central to the Chicano Movement of the 1970s and its goals in creating a collective Mexican American culture, pride, and identity as well as promoting and achieving Mexican American civil rights. De Batuc's involvement with the arts organization during the 1970s and 1980s, during the height of the Chicano Movement, connects de Batuc to the political and social mobilization of the movement as well as the increased awareness and appreciation of Chicano art and artists. Since the efforts to promote the festival began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Self Help Graphics has commissioned local artists each year to create commemorative serigraph prints to memorialize each years' celebration. The prints have been used as marketing materials or simply as a means for local artists to reinterpret the festival in relation to their own experience as Mexican Americans. These commemorative prints created for the festival have achieved national recognition and have led to a new appreciation for Chicano art and artists. Therefore, they also serve as important works of the Chicano art legacy as well as the Chicano Movement in general. De Batuc created these commemorative prints for the Dia de los Muertos celebrations of 1979 and 1981, entitled Four Seasons and Las Cuatas, respectively. = Las Cuatas = Las Cuatas is a reinterpretation of a painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo entitled, Los Dos Fridas. As in Los Dos Fridas, Las Cuatas depicts two seated representations of Frida Kahlo as the figures hold hands and are connected by their exposed anatomical hearts. In de Batuc‚Äôs print, the Frida on the left is portrayed as a calavera, a representation of a human skeleton that is an important symbol connected to the Dia de Los Muertos festival. The two Fridas face each other as they hold a mask of one another's face. Cherubs frame the print as they hold a banner heralding the words, ‚ÄúDia de los Muertos, 1981‚Äù above the seated figures. The Hollywood sign, Los Angeles City Hall, and Watts Towers are visible through the windows in the background of the print, establishing the setting of the scene as within the city of Los Angeles.  Other Notable Works  In addition to the extensive amount of works on paper de Batuc has created, he has also taken part in several special commissions such as murals. One of his most well-known and most reproduced works is his street mural depicting the late Mexican actress, Dolores del Rio, who was one of Hollywood's first Latina actresses. De Batuc was chosen for this mural commission after the Social and Public Art Resource Center (S.P.A.R.C.) of Los Angeles sent out a competitive call for submissions and ultimately accepted de Batuc's proposal above all others. According to de Batuc, he wanted to create a sense of neighborhood pride through the mural and chose Dolores del Rio as his subject due to her extensive work and successful career in the Hollywood film industry in the 1920s and 1930s. The mural was first painted in 1990 but has subsequently been severely vandalized and restored several times in recent years. It is located at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Street in Los Angeles.

Ligand substituents are omitted for clarity. a) 12-crown-4 b) 12-MCFe(III)N(shi)-4 c) 15-crown-5 d) 15-MCCu(II)N(picHA)-5 Metallacrowns are a unique class of macrocyclic compounds that consist of metal ions and solely or predominantly heteroatoms in the ring. Classically, metallacrowns contain an [M‚ÄìN‚ÄìO] repeat unit in the macrocycle. First discovered by Vincent L. Pecoraro and Myoung Soo Lah in 1989, metallacrowns are best described as inorganic analogues of crown ethers. To date, over 600 reports of metallacrown research have been published. Metallacrowns with sizes ranging from 12-MC-4 to 60-MC-20 have been synthesized. In 2013, the project \\"Metallacrowns: Metallacrown-based innovative materials and supramolecular devices\\" has been funded by the European Union Research Executive Agency as a Marie Curie IRSES International Research Staff Exchange Scheme. This mobility project involves researchers from the Universities of Parma, Wroc≈Çaw, Paris-Sud, Kyiv, and Michigan, and the CNRS in Orl√©ans. This project has been funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 611488. Nomenclature Metallacrown nomenclature has been developed to mimic the nomenclature of crown ethers, which are named by the total number of atoms in the ring, followed by \\"C\\" for \\"crown,\\" and the number of oxygen atoms in the ring. For example, 12-crown-4 or 12-C-4 describes Figure 2a. When naming metallacrowns, a similar format is followed. However, the C becomes \\"MC\\" for \\"metallacrown\\" and the \\"MC\\" is followed by the ring metal, other heteroatom, and the ligand used to make the metallacrown. For example, metallacrown b in the figure above is named [12-MCFe(III)N(shi)-4], where \\"shi\\" is the ligand, salicylhydroxamic acid. Preparation Metallacrowns form via self-assembly, i.e. by dissolving the ligand in a solvent followed by the desired metal salt. The first reported metallacrown was MnII(OAc)2(DMF)6[12-MCMn(III)N(shi)-4]. Metallacrowns can be prepared with a variety of metals in the ring and in a variety of ring sizes. In recent years, many other metallacrowns have been prepared, including 9-MC-3, 15-MC-5, and 18-MC-6. Ring size is controlled by a number of factors, such as the geometry of the ligand chelate ring, ring metal Jahn-Teller distortion, central metal size, steric effects, and stoichiometry. Common ring metals have included V(III), Mn(III), Fe(III), Ni(II) and Cu(II). Hydroxamic acids, such as salicylhydroxamic acid, and oximes are commonly utilized in metallacrown ligands. Structure Many structures have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Metallacrowns typically contain fused chelate rings in their structure, which imparts them with substantial stability. Metallacrowns have been synthesized with substantial variety. Mixed ligand and mixed ring-metal, and mixed-oxidation state metallacrowns are known. Inverse metallacrowns have been reported that contain metal ions oriented towards the center of the ring.Stemmler, A. J.; Kampf, J. W. and Pecoraro, V. L. \\"Synthesis and Crystal Structure of The First Inverse 12-Metallacrown-4\\" Inorg. Chem., 1995, 34, 2271-2272. Metallacryptates, metallahelicates, and fused metallacrowns are known. Among the interesting features of metallacrowns are the similarities between certain structures and the corresponding crown ether. For example, in the 12-C-4, the cavity size is 2.79 √Ö and the bite distance is 0.6 √Ö. In the 12-MC-4, the cavity size is 2.67 √Ö and the bite distance is 0.5 √Ö. Potential applications Metallacrowns are most widely studied for their potential use as SMMs (single-molecule magnets). Notably, the first mixed manganese-lanthanide SMM was a metallacrown. Metallacrowns with gadolinium as the central metal are potential MRI contrast agents. A lot of attention is focused on metallacrown molecular recognition and host‚Äìguest chemistry. Chelation of heavy metals by 15-MC-5 complexes could be utilized in lanthanide separation or heavy metal sequestration. Metallacrown container molecules constructed from the 15-MC-5 structure type have been shown to selectively encapsulate carboxylate anions in hydrophobic cavities. A crystalline solid displaying second-harmonic generation was generated by including a nonlinear optical chromophore in a chiral metallacrown compartment. Metallacrowns have also been utilized in the construction of microporous. and mesoporous materials. In another potential application, some metallacrowns exhibit antibacterial activity.

In 1941 it was connected to the local electrical distribution system on Grandpa's Knob in Castleton, Vermont, US. It was designed by Palmer Cosslett Putnam and manufactured by the S. Morgan Smith Company. The 1.25 MW turbine operated for 1100 hours before a blade failed at a known weak point, which had not been reinforced due to wartime material shortages. It would be the largest wind turbine ever built until 1979.A Pioneer is Vindicated in Kiplinger's Personal Finance Jan 1981, page 24, available at Google Books Description The turbine had two blades, 175 feet (53 m) in diameter, on the down-wind side of a 120-foot (36 m) steel lattice tower. Each blade was approximately 8 feet (2.4 m) wide and 66 feet (20 m) long, and weighed eight tons. The blades were built on steel spars and covered with a stainless steel skin. The blade spars were hinged at their root attachment to the hub, allowing them to assume a slight cone shape. The generator was a 1250 kW 600 RPM synchronous generator made by General Electric, producing 2,400 V at 60 cycles. The generator and rotor hub were mounted on a pintle beam, which allowed the rotor to capture wind from varying directions. The pitch of the blades was controlled by hydraulic cylinders to maintain constant speed. Daniel Behrman, Solar energy: the awakening science Taylor & Francis, 1979 pages 227‚Äì230 Origins Palmer Putnam became interested in production of electric power from wind after observing high winds at Cape Cod. Putnam was aware of the Balaklava 100 kW turbine and desired to improve on its performance.Peter Asmus, Reaping the Wind: How Mechanical Wizards, Visionaries, and Profiteers Helped Shape Our Energy Future, Island Press, 2001 , page 45 By 1937 he had enlisted General Electric, and the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. General Electric provided a generator, and Central Vermont Public Services Corporation was interested in an energy supply that could displace purchased power for meeting peak loads. A Bold Effort in Vermont: The 1941 Smith‚ÄìPutnam Wind Turbine, C. Sulzberger, retrieved 2009 Nov 21 Only 23 months elapsed between first discussions and production of power.Beauchamp E. Smith Smith‚ÄìPutnam Wind Turbine Experiment in Joseph M. Savino (ed), Wind energy conversion systems: workshop proceedings, Washington, D. C., June 11‚Äì13, 1973, National Science Foundation (U.S.)/ National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1973 page 6 Palmer concluded that the most promising concept was a two-bladed propeller driving a synchronous AC generator. He developed a preliminary design and cost estimates. Dr. Vannevar Bush, Dean of Engineering at MIT, reacted favorably when shown these calculations in 1937. Bush introduced Putnam to a vice president of General Electric Company, Mr. T. Knight. From this point on Putnam was able to enlist the services of some very talented people which included Theodore von Karman, a world-famous authority on aerodynamics, to assist in the design, parametric studies, cost analyses, site selection, and determination of wind characteristics. In 1939, the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) was approached by Palmer C. Putnam, to design the turbine. Theodore von K√°rm√°n had William Rees Sears and W. Duncan Rannie carry out the aerodynamic design. Unfortunately, Rannie's analytical findings regarding the stability of the giant windmill were not incorporated in the prototype that was built and tested on the mountain.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740026427.pdf Joseph M. Savino, A Brief Summary of the Attempts to Develop Large Wind- Electric Generating Systems in the U.S., NASA TM X-71605, August 29‚Äì30, 1974 Putnam obtained the financial and technical backing of the S. Morgan Smith Company of York, Pennsylvania. The Smith Company manufactured hydroelectric hydraulic turbines. Since the number of feasible sites for hydroelectric development was felt to be declining, the Smith company sought diversification into a new but related product line. The S. Morgan Smith Co. agreed to take on the project as general contractor and financed construction of a pilot turbine. Construction The site chosen for the prototype turbine was a previously unnamed 2000 foot (600 m) elevation, named \\"Grandpa's Knob\\"; this mountain was not so high as to have excessive ice build up, but had high wind speeds. Access to the site required construction of a road with 12 to 15% grade. Due to the impending entry of the United States into World War II, some of the fundamental research and testing process was skipped so that major components could be made before wartime material shortages occurred.  Operation and failures No-load testing of the unit began in August 1941 to verify mechanical operation of the turbine and the blade control system. The generator was first synchronized to the local electrical grid on the evening of October 19, 1941, and tested under load varying from zero to 700 kW. The unit operated for about 1000 hours between startup and February 1943, when a shaft bearing failed. Due to wartime material priorities, the bearing was not replaced until March 3, 1945, when the unit achieved another three weeks of operation. In the early morning of March 26, 1945, the operator on duty in the nacelle of the turbine was thrown down by vibrations. He stopped the turbine. On investigation, it was found one turbine blade had broken off and fallen about 750 feet (229 m) away. The blade had failed at a previously repaired weak point in the spar; due to wartime shortages, it had been impractical to complete a full repair and reinforcement of the blade root.  Aftermath  A study completed in 1945 suggested that a block of six turbines similar to the prototype, producing 9 MW, could be installed in Vermont for around US$190 per kilowatt. However, the economic value to the power utility was only $125 per kilowatt, and the wind turbine was not considered economically viable by a factor of 1.5.Erich Hau, Wind turbines: fundamentals, technologies, application, economicsBirkh√§user, 2006 , page 36 Although the S. Morgan Smith company had spent more than US$1.25 million on the prototype turbine, entirely private funding, it concluded that there was insufficient prospect for profit on further development. Repairs were never done after the March 1945 failure. The prototype turbine was dismantled in 1946, leaving only concrete footings and a marker plaque at the site today. In the introduction to Putnam's book, Vannevar Bush stated that the project achieved proof of the concept of synchronous generation of wind power, and projected future commercial use of wind-generated electricity.

In November 2009, the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Prof Tahir Mamman SAN, said that students who passed through unauthorized law faculties would not be admitted into the Nigerian Law School. He said the Council of Legal Education will refer law Professors and teachers managing illegal law faculties to the disciplinary committee of the Body of Benchers .This is why Prof Tahir Mamman SAN is referred to as the most successful Director General since the inception of the institution. Mr O. A. Onadeko the previous Deputy Director General of the Lagos Campus served as the Director General of the Nigerian Law School from 2013 to 2018.

The early days The earliest paper on the Diamond Fields was a weekly called the Diamond Field, published from 15 October 1870 at Pniel. It moved the following year first to Du Toit's Pan and then New Rush (later renamed Kimberley), and had a strongly anti-imperial view point. Another of the early papers was the pro-British Diamond News of R. W. Murray.Van Niekerk, F. (ed), Knights of the Shovel. Kimberley: Africana Library, 1996, pp. 86-87. The Independent, owned by William Ling in 1876, was acquired by J. B. Robinson. By the late 1870s the success of the Independent had forced the Diamond Field to close, but with the Diamond Fields Advertiser then emerging as a third paper alongside the Diamond News and the Independent keeping local politicians on their toes in the turbulent years that followed.Roberts, Brian, Kimberley, Turbulent City, Cape Town & Kimberley: David Philip and Historical Society of Kimberley and the Northern Cape, 1976, p. 173. During the Siege of Kimberley, the newspaper was the subject of a feud between Cecil Rhodes and garrison commander, Colonel Robert Kekewich. The local newspaper, which was under Rhodes' control, ignored the military censor and printed information that compromised the military. Kekewich obtained permission from his superior to place Rhodes under arrest if necessary. Prominent journalists in Kimberley in the early years included R. W. Murray, and F. Y.

Such scarabs were found in several archaeological sites of the Near East, from Syria to Sudan. Over two hundred of them are known to exist in museums and collections around the world. Most of the scarabs are made of steatite painted blue or green. Their length varies between 4.7 and 11 cm, their width between 7 and 8.9 cm. Most of them are pierced for threading. On the basis of their inscriptions the scarabs can be divided into five groups (in parentheses the number of scarabs of the type found on several sites): # \\"lion hunt scarabs\\" (123) # \\"marriage scarabs\\" (56) # \\"lake scarabs\\" (11) # \\"bull hunt scarabs\\" (5) # \\"Gilukhepa scarabs\\" (5) The scarabs are likely to have been made at the same time, in or after the 11th regnal year. The scarab beetle was a symbol of the sun god Khepri, and glazed materials were called tjehenet ('shining') in Egyptian, so the shining scarabs refer to the king, the dazzling Sun himself. Groups ;Lion hunt The lion hunt scarabs emphasise the pharaoh's strength and bravery by recording that Amenhotep killed over a hundred lions (102; 110 on some scarabs) during the first ten years of his reign. These have the shortest inscription (7 lines), their average length is 7,7 cm. The lion hunt scarabs vary the most in size; the smallest scarab is 4,7 cm long, the largest is more than twice its size with a length of 9,5 cm. ;Marriage The so-called marriage scarabs actually refer not to the marriage itself, and neither do they mention a marriage date. They record the name of Amenhotep's chief queen Tiye (following that of her husband), along with the names of her parents, as if to explicitly state her non-royal birth: the name of her father is Yuya, the name of her mother is Thuya; she is married to the great king whose southern border is at Karoy and whose northern is Naharin. Tiye's importance is shown by defining the boundaries of the empire in terms of her. The length of the inscription on these scarabs is 9-10 lines, the scarabs' average length is 8,5 cm. ;Lake The lake scarabs commemorate the construction of an artificial lake for Queen Tiye in the 11th regnal year. On these, the name and titles of the pharaoh are followed by those of Tiye, the names of her parents, then the description of the lake that was dug in Tiye's town Djaruha. The lake was 3700√ó700 cubits large, and the royal couple was rowed on the lake in the royal barge Aten-tjehen. The name of the boat means 'Shining Sun-disc', this is the first appearance of this name which later becomes an epithet of the king himself. The lake scarabs vary the most in their texts, but the differences don't affect the meaning of the text itself. The text is 11 lines long, the average length of these scarabs is 8,4 cm. ;Bull hunt The bull hunt scarabs record that in the 2nd regnal year Amenhotep, followed by his soldiers and officials, went to Shetep (possibly the area of Wadi el-Natrun) on his barge Khaemmaat ('Appears in Truth'), charged at wild bulls by his chariot and killed them. On the first day he slayed 56 bulls, four days later he killed 40 of them. The bulls had been previously surrounded with a ditch. Hunt was not only a favourite pastime for the pharaohs, it also symbolized the ruler's strength and his victory over the forces of chaos, thus it equalled victory on a battlefield. These scarabs also list the titles of the king and mention Tiye. The bull hunt scarabs have both the greatest length (9,9 cm) and the longest text. The only scarab which doesn't have its back carved in the shape of a beetle is among these scarabs. This one has two longitudinal holes for suspension. ;Gilukhepa The Gilukhepa scarabs commemorate the arrival of Princess Gilukhepa, daughter of Shuttarna II of Mitanni into the pharaoh's harem in the 10th regnal year. She had a retinue of 317 ladies-in-waiting. Tiye is also mentioned on the scarab. The length of the text is 10 lines, the average length of these scarabs is 7,2 cm.

It is licensed in English by Digital Manga Publishing, which published Fake Fur in April 2007. A prequel volume, , was published by DMP in September 2007. Plot The first story in Fake Fur concerns a schoolboy, Yamashita who learns he is gay, and falls in love with his straight classmate Kubo, who moves away. Although Yamashita has sex with an older man, Reni, and later enters a relationship with his college roommate Fukuzawa, Yamashita finds he cannot fall in love, until he realizes Fukuzawa might leave him. The second story in Fake Fur concerns a runaway, Maki, who has an encounter with Reni. The prequel, Manic Love, explores Maki's background and concerns a love triangle between him, his math teacher, and a fellow teacher. Reception Danielle Van Gorder, writing for Mania Entertainment, described the art of Fake Fur as \\"sketchy\\", but felt that this was not due to lack of skill on Yamagata's part and enhanced the emotional qualities of the work. Van Gorder felt the themes of \\"emotional connection in a lonely world and not knowing what you have until it's gone\\" came through Fake Fur extremely well. Ginger Mayerson, writing for Sequential Tart, felt Fake Fur was \\"sad, happy, sexy, moody, and all of it beautifully drawn and told in a refreshingly clear-eyed style\\". Library Journal says that although Fake Fur is \\"light on plot and character and heavy on explicit sex, it is elevated by elegant, uncluttered artwork.\\" Danielle Van Gorder, writing for Mania Entertainment, described the art of Manic Love as \\"sketchy\\" and \\"sparse\\", cautioning that it will not be to all readers' tastes. Van Gorder felt that it was not needed to have read Fake Fur to enjoy Manic Love, and felt that the \\"similar mature, moody feel\\" to Manic Love would make it not appeal to all readers, but would be more likely to appeal to older readers than younger readers. Ginger Mayerson, writing for Sequential Tart, found Manic Love confronting in that Maki is rejected by his teacher and in Fake Fur becomes involved with the \\"jerk\\" Reni. Mayerson noted a hint that one of Maki's classmates has interest in Maki, and Mayerson created an \\"imaginary manga\\" where Maki and this classmate live happily ever after.

With these measurements, SeaQuest will also be able to quantify the energy loss of a colored parton (quark) travelling through cold, strongly-interacting matter. SeaQuest has been approved by Fermilab to extend previous down to up antiquark measurements to larger Bjorken x. It will use a 120 GeV proton beam extracted from the Fermilab Main Injector. The experiment will also examine the modifications to the antiquark structure of the proton from nuclear binding. Physics motivations SeaQuest expected uncertainties for extending to higher Bjorken x *'/' Asymmetry Originally it was thought down and up antiquarks ( and , respectively) were produced in the nucleon sea with a ratio of 1. However, the result of deep inelastic scattering experiment by CERN-NMC showed that there are more 's than 's in the proton. The Gottfried sum evaluated by NMC from the data of deep inelastic muon scattering on a proton and a deuteron targets was 0.235¬±0.026 which is smaller than the expected value of 0.333. This means that (x)-(x) integrated over Bjorken x from 0 to 1.0 is 0.147¬±0.039, indicating a flavor asymmetry in the proton sea. In the early 1990s, DYSSIS (CERN-NA51) made a measurement of Drell-Yan process in the low Bjorken x region that tilted the ratio in favor of a higher number than . Experiments such as Fermilab E-866/NuSea yielded results in a range of low Bjorken x, which further showed an asymmetry in the antiquark production. SeaQuest will extend the measurements to higher Bjorken x, which will help resolve questions about the behavior of this ratio above . *Partons in Cold Nuclear Matter The Drell‚ÄìYan process is particularly well-suited to carry out a measurement of energy loss of quarks as they propagate through nuclear matter. Since the products‚Äîa virtual photon and two leptons‚Äîdo not interact strongly with the rest of the nuclear medium, there is no further loss of energy due to QCD bremsstrahlung. Feynman diagram of the Drell-Yan process *Antishadowing and the EMC effect In studying a free nucleon and a nucleon bound in a nucleus, the European Muon Collaboration found that nucleons inside a nucleus have a different distribution of momentum among their component quarks. Three main features are the shadowing, antishadowing, and the \\"EMC effect\\". A previous Drell-Yan experiment (Fermilab E-772) has studied this with inconclusive results in the antishadowing region and with no results in the \\"EMC effect\\" region. SeaQuest will be able to yield more statistically precise results regarding the antishadowing region, and will be able to probe into the \\"EMC effect\\" region, where no Drell‚ÄìYan data has yet been seen.

This star is larger, cooler, brighter, and more massive than our Sun. Also its metal content is 2.3 times as much as the Sun. In 2009, a gas giant planet was found in orbit around the star.  Properties  HD 28254 is a G-type star with a spectral type G1IV/V, indicating that it has begun its evolution off the main sequence. It is estimated to have a mass 11% larger than the Sun's, a radius 57% larger, and an age around 7.8 billion years. It has a luminosity of 1.57 times the solar luminosity and an effective temperature of about 5,600 K. HD 28254 has a low activity level and a larger metallicity than the Sun, with 2.3 times the solar iron abundance. HD 28254 is the brighter component of a visual binary. Its companion, HD 28254 B, has a visual apparent magnitude of 13.8 and is located at a separation of 4.3 arcseconds. The two stars have maintained the same separation through time, indicating that they form a physical binary system. Furthermore, the radial velocity of the primary shows signs of orbital motion. From its brightness, the companion star is probably a red dwarf with spectral type between M0V and M2V, with about 48% the solar mass. The projected separation between the stars is 235 AU, corresponding to an orbital period of more than 1,000 years.  Planetary system  In 2010, the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting HD 28254 was published. It was detected by Doppler spectroscopy from observations with the HARPS spectrograph between October 2003 and April 2009. The best fit model for the 32 radial velocity data obtained consists of a planet in an eccentric 1116 days orbit, plus a quadratic trend that is probably caused by the star HD 28254 B. The planet is a gas giant with a minimum mass of 1.16 times the mass of Jupiter. It is at a mean distance of 2.15 AU from the star, and takes 1116 days to complete an orbit. Its orbit has a very high eccentricity of 0.81, carrying the planet between 0.41 and 3.90 AU from the star. This can be the result of gravitational interactions with the secondary star via the Kozai mechanism.

The coalition has been reformed in April 2012 after an electoral agreement between the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) and Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) was made with Sir Anerood Jugnauth as leader. The agreements remain the same, 30 seats for the MMM and 30 seats for the MSM. It has also been conveyed that SAJ would be prime minister for 3 years and Paul Berenger would take over for the rest of the parliamentary term if the coalition wins the next general elections. It has also been agreed that Pravind Jugnauth who is leader of the MSM will not be in the Front Bench of the coalition in an eventual government of the MSM/MMM. This is because he has been provisionally charged with using office for gratification by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. He will therefore seat as a back- bencher until he is dismissed from all accusations. The coalition which was firstly made in 2000, was known as the \\"Medpoint Deal\\" and was formed by former Prime Minister and President Sir Anerood Jugnauth on 14 August 2000. It was the most famous political alliance that Mauritian Politics ever had. It was the first time that the country was experiencing a social change, Paul Berenger would become Prime Minister out of this deal and would be the first- non Hindu to hold such powerful post. The deal was to join the two leaders of the two parties. The MSM leader Sir Anerood Jugnauth & MMM leader Paul Berenger. As a misconception and with a battle for the leadership of the MSM after Sir Anerood retired, Pravind Jugnauth and Ashok Jugnauth both fought to become the party's next leader. At the end Ashock moved out and formed his own party namely National Union(UN) and went forward with Paul Berenger and formed the new alliance MMM/UN. In July 2005, the MSM/MMM coalition went together for general elections and became the opposition party, but in 2006 they ended the deal and MSM became alone party while MMM took hands with UN. The MMM/MSM coalition won the local council elections held on December 9, 2012. They obtained a total of 53 councilors against 36 for the government party Mauritian Labour Party and one for the Mauritian Movement Social Democrats. They will therefore administer the cities namely Port-Louis, Quatre Bornes and Rose Hill while the only city administered by the government will be Vacoas- Phoenix. Please note that the city of Curepipe is under a deadlock with 7 councillors elected from the MMM/MSM coalition, 7 councillors elected under the banner of the Labour Party and 1 elected under the Mauritian Movement Social Democrats. The deadlock will therefore be handled as soon as negotiations are made and an agreement is obtained.http://www.lexpress.mu/article/municipales-victoire- de-l%E2%80%99opposition-mmm-msm-qui-contr%C3%B4le-trois-villes-sur-cinq  Early Deal  Sir Anerood Jugnauth who was Prime Minister from 1982 to 1995 initiated the deal in early 2000. In 1995 the 60-0 victory of the MMM-MLP was outstanding as Sir Jugnauth lost his parliament seat. He had no choice to give more to the MMM so as to secure his party. Mauritian Labor Party and Mauritian Militant Movement began an alliance in 1995 and ousted the MSM out of the game. Under the transition Navin Ramgoolam, leader of MLP, became Prime Minister for the five years and MMM leader Paul Berenger remained as Deputy Prime Minister for the five-year term. Sir Anerood offered Berenger more so as to attract him to form the coalition. He therefore offered Berenger two years of being prime minister, a higher price than being Deputy for five years. He accepted and both signed the deal in August 2000. The Medpoint Deal was based on equal power shared by both parties and the office of the Prime Minister being head of government was in the ratio 3:2. MSM would have the office for three years and MMM for the two remaining. Sir Anerood had announced that he will be retiring as Prime Minister and that his last mandate would be the 2000 elections. He also initiated the idea that his son Pravind Jugnauth would become Leader of the MSM and he would stood down so as to make way for his son for the office of the Prime Minister. Paul Berenger agreed that he would be appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for 3 years, and after that he would succeed to Sir Anerood who was to be dismissing from office during the same period.  Persons in the deal  There were four main persons concerned out the deal made in 2000. Sir Anerood Jugnauth, Paul Berenger, Pravind Jugnauth and Karl Offmann. Then President of the Republic, Cassam Uteem was at his last mandate as Head of State and was due to leave office in 2002. Karl Offmann who was a former Minister and Member of the MSM agreed to succeed to Uteem and it was on one condition, that he would work as President only when Sir Anerood Jugnauth would be Prime Minister .Therefore, the leaders were both aware that Offmann would not have five years mandate as President but less. The deal also mentioned that as from September 2003, Pravind Jugnauth was to be appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance . All those four people were playing the political prepared game and everyone was trained like a soldier on battlefield so as to snatch the government of the hands of Navin Ramgoolam who was then Prime Minister. Results On 11 September 2000, the MSM/MMM team won over the general elections with a bigger majority that they had themselves expected. They had won 56 seats out of 60 seats in the parliament.http://psephos.adam- carr.net/countries/m/mauritius/mauritius.txt Sir Anerood Jugnauth was elected 1st Member of Piton & Riviere du Rempart and Paul Berenger elected 1st Member of Upper Rose Hill. They both began their deal and set up the new government with based equal power to both Parties. The new government elected Sir Jugnauth as prime minister as mentioned in the deal. New turn 2003 As expected, the two parties were friends with each other and also shared same power. In September 2003, Sir Jugnauth announced his departure and resignation as Prime Minister and Leader of the MSM in order to let Pravind become Leader. He accepted to step down in favor of Paul Berenger. Cassam Uteem resigned 6 months before his mandate ended and the entire deal was taking a new turn. Nevertheless, Karl Offmann took office earlier that year and as mentioned accepted to only work with Sir Jugnauth. Berenger on his part announced that he entering the Clarisse House (House of the Prime Minister) would be meaning political democracy and freedom as to allow a non-Hindu to hold the office of Prime Minister. Presidential deal Sir Anerood Jugnauth made another deal within the MSM/MMM deal in 2003. He did not need to resign from office but for the sake of his son he accepted his departure. This deal was made upon the leadership of Jugnauth and Offmann who were both Head of State and Head of government. Karl Offmann agreed to step down as President in favor that Sir Anerood became his successor. In order to become Prime Minister, Paul Berenger had to announce the nomination of Jugnauth for President to the Parliament as well as elect his son Pravind as Deputy Prime Minister. The deal was settled and SAJ announced in early September that he will be resigning as Prime Minister, but that the population would not have to worry for the upcoming years as he would become President after some time. He resigned in September 2003 and Berenger took office of Prime Minister and nominated Jugnauth as President. After one week, in the start of October, Sir Anerood Jugnauth became president and also head of state.

To begin the preliminary work a small party of NCOs and men of the Royal Engineers arrived in November 1853 on the site of the present Princes Gardens in the town making them the first soldiers to arrive in Aldershot. These engineers were responsible for surveying and making the preliminary arrangements for The Camp at Aldershot.Aldershot Military Cemetery on the English Heritage Listed Buildings site The Camp was established at Aldershot in 1854 on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, Viscount Hardinge.Hardinge, memorandum dated 23 Sept 1853: The National Archives, WO 33/1.Illustrated London News, 15 April 1854.

Rabinovich began her studies in 1921 at the Lepeshinsky (–ú–û–ü–®–ö) experimental art-school commune in Moscow where she was taught drawing by Yakov Aleksandrovich Bashilov. The artist's work was first exhibited in 1925 as part of the 8th AKhRR (Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia) Exhibition. Lubov Rabinovich studied at the Proletarian Institute of Art in Moscow, graduating in 1930. She went on to study at the Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Leningrad where she studied under A. Savinov and K. Petrov Vodkin. She was awarded a diploma in 1936 for the painting \\"Kuban, 1920 ‚Äì The Reds Have Come\\". The next five years Rabinovich taught in Saratov, becoming, in 1939, the head of the local artist's union. During the Second World War she supervised the \\"Agitokon\\" art collective (also in Saratov). After war Rabinovich came to Stalingrad and participated in work on the Volga-Don Canal. In the spring of 1954 Rabinovich, with a brigade of fellow artists journeyed to southern Siberia as part of Khrustchev's Virgin Lands Campaign, working on a collective farm in the Omsk Region and at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station. The artist later moves to the Novosibirsk Akademgorodok and becomes familiar with several scientists of the Siberian branch of Academy of Sciences. Rabinovich continued to travel throughout the 1950s and 1960s, visiting (and painting) the White Sea, The Crimea, Pushkin, Dubna, Stalingrad, Novorossisk, The Baltics, and Pereslavl- Zalessky The artist's works of the period capture the self-confidence and optimism of the many ambitious Soviet projects of the period as well as more pastoral scenes and portraits. Notable works include: ¬´First wedding on Virgin Soil¬ª (1959), ¬´The Student (The Thirtieth is Difficult)¬ª (1963), and \\"On a farm\\" (1970). Many of Rabinovich's works are held in state and private collections of Russia, Kazakhstan, France, Belgium and the USA.
