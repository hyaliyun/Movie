VMA-121 A-4E making an arrested landing at Chu Lai, March 1967 Two VMA-211 A4-Es refuel at Chu Lai, 12 July 1967 On 8 March 1965, the U.S. 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade landed at Da Nang to protect the Da Nang Air Base from possible communist attack. On 6 May units from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division and 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines secured the Chu Lai area. On 7 May, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (3rd MEB), composed of the 4th Marine Regiment, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, elements of Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12) and Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 10 landed at Chu Lai to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area. At first, only a \\"short airfield for tactical support (SATS)\\" was installed. The SATS consisted of a runway with an aluminum surface of interlocking lightweight metal alloy planking, a catapult and a carrier deck-type arresting gear. It also included a tactical airfield fuel dispensing system. The base of soft sand at Chu Lai caused much difficulty with the installation of the SATS, but the first landing of an Douglas A-4 Skyhawk was made on 1 June 1965, by Colonel John D. Noble, Commanding Officer of MAG-12 from Marine All- Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242 (VMA-225) landed. On the same day, the first combat mission was flown, led by Lieutenant Colonel R. W. Baker, CO of VMA-225. The aircraft took off using jet-assisted takeoff rockets on the partially completed runway as the Seabees continued lengthening the runway. It was involved in Operation Starlite on 18 August 1965, when the Marines made a pre-emptive strike on gathering Viet Cong forces who were preparing to attack the base. By mid- October 1965, the base was home to more than 80 A-4 Skyhawks from MAG-12. On the night of 27 October 1965 the Viet Cong penetrated the air base destroying 2 A-4s and severely damaging a further six. The Marines killed 15 of the attacking 20-man sapper squad. In September 1966, a new runway, with taxiways, was completed, just west of the SATS strip. With the opening of the new runway, Marine Aircraft Group 13 with three McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II squadrons arrived at Chu Lai and remained until September 1970. In April 1967, Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 533 (VMA(AW)-533), equipped with the Grumman A-6A Intruder all-weather attack aircraft, arrived to provide air support for Marines in I Corps, and to deliver ordinance on targets in North Vietnam under all weather conditions. On the morning of 31 January 1968 as part of the Tet Offensive, the Viet Cong attacked the base with rockets and mortars triggering an explosion in the bomb dump. MAGs 12 and 13 suffered three aircraft destroyed and 23 damaged. The last Marine sorties were flown from Chu Lai by aircraft from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314) on 11 September 1970.http://airwarvietnam.com/mag12.htm From 1967 the 54th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) with Bell UH-1D Huey's were deployed here.

It produces myriocin, from which the synthetic drug fingolimod, a treatment for multiple sclerosis, was developed. Bushy Park, New Zealand, showing the fruiting bodies and parasitised cicada nymphsalt=  Taxonomy  Isaria sinclairii is the name of the anamorph; the teleomorph is Cordyceps sinclairii, Cordycipitaceae. The species was first described in 1855 by Miles Joseph Berkeley from specimens collected in the garden of Archdeacon William Williams at T≈´ranga, Poverty Bay. It was moved to the genus Isaria in 1923 by Curtis Gates Lloyd.  Ecology  Isaria sinclairii is a fungus which attacks insects, including cicada larvae. The larvae typically die just beneath the soil surface, and the fungus produces white tufts which grow up from the soil and release powdery white spores. I. sinclairii is found from Asia (particularly China, Japan, and Korea) through to New Zealand. In New Zealand it attacks cicadas of the genera Amphipsalta and Melampsalta. In the lab it can be cultured on the bodies of silkworms. Cicada nymphs parasitised by I. sinclairii Uses Isaria sinclairii and similar vegetable caterpillar species such as Ophiocordyceps sinensis have been used in traditional Tibetan medicine and in traditional Chinese medicine as tonics believed to impart eternal youth. A sphingolipid derivative produced by I. sinclairii, myriocin, was discovered to have powerful immunosuppressive properties, a function of the way the fungus attacks living insects. Because myriocin is too toxic to use in humans, a synthetic derivative was developed in 1992, named FTY720 or fingolimod. Under its trade name Gilenya, fingolimod was approved by the FDA in 2010 as the first oral drug for treating the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod shows promise as a cancer medication, and has been tested as a possible treatment for obesity.

The hills form part of the eastern Rhenish Massif and, to a lesser extent, to the Berg-Mark Hills (Bergisch-M√§rkisches H√ºgelland).  Geography = Location = The Ardey Hills, together with the Haarstrang, run from east to west, separating two major natural units: the Westphalian Lowland including the Emscher Depression and Hellwegb√∂rde in the north from the S√ºder Uplands and lower Sauerland in the south, the Ardey being counted as part of the S√ºder Uplands and the Haarstrang the Westphalian Lowland. From a topographical perspective, the Ardey Hills are the western foothills of the sparsely wooded and mainly agricultural Haarstrang. However it is different, not only from a cultural landscape point of view, but also geologically (a decisive factor being the carboniferous boundary near the surface). In the north, on the territory of the city of Dortmund, the Ardey Hills descend gradually into the plain of the Westphalian Lowland in the area of M√ºnsterland. To the south and west they are bounded by the River Ruhr, their rugged slopes often dropping steeply into its valley.

They are the source of the Ruhr Sandstone which is extracted in large quarries. The Ardey and Haarstrang together were on the edge of the northern ice sheet from the last ice age.  Landscape  Along the Ruhr the Ardey has a decidedly hilly character with large height differences, steep, rocky slopes and deep V-shaped valleys. Seen from the north and east the Ardey Hills have a gentler appearance. Here there are gently curved hilltops covered in woods and meadows. Due to its proximity to the city of Dortmund and town of Witten the northern edge of the hills is a popular residential area and, as a result, densely populated. The ridges (Eggen or \\"edges\\") of the Ardey are covered by beech woods. Its slopes are incised by the V-shaped valleys of small streams, known as Seipen and divided into small landscape units. The Ardey Hills are an old cultural landscape. Traces of historic woodland usages like coppicing, wood pasture and charcoal burning may still be found in many places today.  Walking  A particularly attractive section of the Ruhr Ridgeway (Ruhrh√∂henweg) maintained by the Sauerland Mountain Club (Sauerl√§ndischer Gebirgsverein) runs along the heights of the Ardey Hills from the source of the Ruhr to its confluence. The path has many viewing points especially in the Ruhr valley. The Westphalian Way (Westfalenweg) also runs over the Ardey Hills.

Origins=Anatole Mallet= The system of dividing drive was originally developed by Anatole Mallet in the 1870s on a number of rigid-wheelbase compound locomotives, and then during the 1880s, on Mallet articulated locomotives. =Francis Webb= Mallet's ideas inspired Francis Webb in Britain who introduced 2-(2-2)-0, 2-(2-2)-2, 2-2-2-2T, 2-2-(4-0)T divided drive locomotives between 1882 and 1903. =Alfred de Glehn= Alfred de Glehn introduced a successful divided drive 2-(2-2)-0 compound based on Webb's ideas,. Use in the UK Dugald Drummond of the London and South Western Railway used divided drive (not very successfully) in his simple expansion T7 and E10 Classes of 4-2-2-0. In the latter two instances the divided drive was adopted to allow the driving wheels to be spaced more widely than normal without the need for long coupling rods. This enabled an extra-long firebox. Divided drive could also be used on simple expansion locomotives with coupled driving wheels. The NER Class X (LNER Class T1) 4-8-0T shunting engines designed by Wilson Worsdell for the North Eastern Railway had three cylinders with divided drive. Similarly Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway (Great Britain) designed the SR Lord Nelson class with divided drive between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders 'to give better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow'. Sir Nigel Gresley of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) used divided drive on his B17 class 4-6-0 for hauling passenger services on the severely weight restricted Great Eastern Main Line. Gresley's successors Edward Thompson and Arthur Peppercorn both adopted divided drive on their larger designs as a consequence of their wish to overcome the maintenance problems associated with the Gresley conjugated valve gear.http://www.a1steam.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=50&Itemid;=66 Use in the United States The concept was further developed in the early 1930s in the United States by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, with their duplex locomotives, which divided the drive between two sets of outside cylinders.

Life He was a younger son of Prince Otto I of Olomouc and his wife Euphemia, a daughter of the √Årp√°d king B√©la I of Hungary. He thereby was the grandson of the Bohemian duke Bretislav I. His father ruled in Olomouc since about 1055, troubled by the centralist efforts of his elder brothers Spytihnƒõv II and Vratislav II ruling as Bohemian dukes. When he died in 1087, Otto II and his elder brother Svatopluk were expelled from Olomouc. While the dynastical struggles within the P≈ôemyslid family continued, Otto II and Svatopluk were able to return to Moravia in 1091. Svatopluk finally ascended the throne in Prague in 1107, having deposed his cousin Bo≈ôivoj II. Otto temporarily acted as a Bohemian regent; in 1108/09 he and Savatopluk were taken hostage by King Henry V of Germany. When Svatopluk was killed in September 1109, his brother Otto, though with considerable support by the Bohemian nobility, was not able to assert his claims to the Prague throne, which was taken by Otto's cousin Vladislav I. Around 1113 Otto married the Swabian countess Sophia, daughter of Count Henry I of Berg. Sophia's sister Richeza of Berg had married Duke Vladislav I about 1111. Otto's marriage produced three children: Euphemia, Otto III of Olomouc (1122‚Äì1160), and Dƒõtleb, Bishop of Olomouc. Otto found himself in constant conflict with Duke Vladislav. Nevertheless, in 1123 he was able to succeed Vladislav's younger brother Sobƒõslav as Prince of Brno. When Duke Vladislav died in 1125, Otto again claimed the Bohemian throne according to the principle of agnatic seniority. When Vladislav's brother Sobƒõslav succeeded, Otto turned to King Lothair II who marched against Bohemia with a German army. Both sides met in the Battle of Chlumec on 18 February 1126: Lothair's forces were decisively defeated and Otto was killed in action. After the battle, Sobƒõslav approached King Lothair and received the Bohemian duchy as an Imperial fief. Otto's widow Sophia returned to Swabia and probably retired to Zwiefalten Abbey.

Anti-austerity protests became a prominent part of popular demonstrations across the 2010s, particularly the first half of the decade. UK trade unions, and the Trade Union Congress took a large role in supporting the movement. Organisations that formed during the movement- such as People's Assembly Against Austerity, UK Uncut, the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, Scotland United against Austerity, the Radical Assembly and the Occupy London Stock Exchange have all been seen as key in the movement's growth and activities. Background In May 2010, the United Kingdom general election resulted in no political party achieving sufficient support to form a working majority government on their own. For this reason, the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government together. The Conservative leader David Cameron became prime minister, whilst Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg became deputy prime minister. They believed that most of the government cuts were designed to target the working class, while big businesses and financial businesses, in particular businesses with connections to British MPs, were going unpunished whilst avoiding paying any tax, despite their perception that the latter was the main reason for the financial crisis and the subsequent recession. The government planned to put into action sharp spending cuts, stating that they were necessary to address the United Kingdom's record peacetime deficit, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, saying that Britain risked suffering a debt crisis like those seen in Greece, Ireland and Portugal if it failed to reduce the budget deficit. The austerity measures that they planned proved to be the toughest in the United Kingdom since the Second World War, which saw cuts in welfare benefits, local government budgets, and an increase in taxes such as VAT. Organisers said the government's plans to eliminate the deficit in four years, and to focus on cutting spending rather than raising tax, did not have national support. They say they want to give a voice to all the people affected by the cuts, and to demonstrate to Westminster that the public rejects the argument that there is no alternative. They and many protesters argue that the cuts will threaten the country's economic recovery.Anti-cuts March for the Alternative draws 500,000 protestors in London. Time, 26 March 2011 They suggest that since the government recently spent billions bailing out indebted banks, the government should create new taxes for banks and close loopholes that allow some companies to pay less tax. Labour MP Chuka Umunna declared that it was \\"shocking\\" to learn that Barclay's Bank paid only 1% of its 2009 profits in taxes while the corporate tax in the UK is 28%. Max Lawson, of the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, said: \\"If banks paid their fair share we could avoid the worst of the cuts and help those hit hardest by the financial crisis they did nothing to cause.\\" Dave Prentis, general secretary of UNISON, remarked that \\"These are ordinary families and working people, many with their children to send a strong message to David Cameron to halt the damaging cuts which are leading to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and the closure of services including libraries and care homes.\\" =Objectives= Journalist and former anti-austerity activist Ellie Mae O'Hagan described the mission objectives of the anti-austerity movement during the coalition government years as being pushing the coalition to collapse by raising their agenda and have an impact on the Liberal Democrats. However she challenged this critically, saying \\"Why exactly did we think a party who had never been in government would give up its one taste of power simply out of a sense of shame? It was nonsensical.\\" Timeline of events=2010= Student protests in November and December 2010, focused on cuts and changes to the funding of higher and further education in England. A previous student protest also saw some \\"violence\\" when students targeted the automobile in which Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall were riding. =2011=January‚ÄìFebruary On 29 January, the NCAFC (National Campaign Against Cuts & Fees) held a small protest in London. Some minor violence was reported. In Manchester there was a protest of around 5000 people called by the TUC, UCU and the NUS against fees and cuts, billed as \\"a future that works\\" rally. On 1 February, a disused building at the University of Glasgow, Scotland was occupied and re-opened as the Free Hetherington anti- cuts space. It has since attracted much controversy due to heavy-handed attempts to evict the students, staff and community members from the building, which resulted in multiple injuries and arrests. On 12 February, council workers in Darlington, including members of the unions UNISON and GMB, staged a We Love Darlington protest against council cuts in the North-East town. On 24 February a Hull City Council meeting was interrupted by protests. On the previous evening, a Sheffield City Council meeting was invaded by protesters over proposed cuts to local children's centres.Protest Against Cuts to Children's Centres; The Real Steel News; 24 February 2011 March Demonstrators march along Whitehall on 26 March 2011. On 3 March, the GMB and UK Uncut held a protest on Knightsbridge against tax evasion. A protest was also held on the same day by UK Uncut outside the Barclays bank in Victoria Square, Bolton, opposite Bolton Town Hall. The protest was against tax evasion. On 5 March, there was a protest of around 2,000 people in Manchester about cuts being implemented on the city. UK Uncut held protests in Perth, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Ipswich, Edinburgh, Colchester, Bristol, and Aberdeen. Protests in Perth were against the Scottish Liberal Democrats and tax evasion; protests in Manchester, Ipswich, and Aberdeen were anti-austerity in general; protests in Liverpool were against the Big Society; protests in Leicester and Colchester were against tax evasion and big bonuses for bankers; protests in Edinburgh were against the closure (by the government) of two nursery schools in the city, and tax evasion; and protests in Bristol were against the closure of a library in the city. On 6 March, UK Uncut arranged to hold a protest in Taunton against government cuts. UK Uncut held protests in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets on 7 March, mainly around the Barclay's Bank headquarters in Canary Wharf. During the protest, a group of around a dozen people gathered in front of a sculpture in the bank lobby, and chanted, \\"Barclays Bank pays no tax, Tower Hamlets gets the axe,\\" and, \\"Barclays, pay your tax.\\"Tower Hamlets protesters vent fury over tax at Barclays headquarters; The Guardian; 7 March 2011 According to protest organiser UK Uncut, \\"Around twenty people, all living or working in Tower Hamlets, occupied the foyer of Barclays HQ while startled bankers were directed out a side entrance.\\" UK Uncut held a protest on 9 March, at a budget cuts council meeting in the London Borough of Bexley. During the emotionally charged and noisy meeting, there were shouts of \\"shame\\" and \\"cutting respite care is not right\\" from the residents in the gallery numbering about 165, and protesters at the back doors chanted \\"care, not cuts\\" as councillors entered. Police were brought in to guard the civic offices and residents had their bags searched; those with cameras were banned from entering.Fury as Bexley council votes through ¬£35.3 million cuts ; London 24; 10 March 2011 On 12 March, around 5,000 people marched from Devonshire Green to the venue of the 2011 Liberal Democrats spring conference, where one man was arrested for public order offences and discharge of a firework in a public place. Barricades were set up on Fargate and Surrey Street following several incidents, including a group of protesters running into a Topshop store on Fargate. The event has been \\"good- natured on the whole\\", police said. A large group of protesters, separate from the main group, caused violence along the march, including trying (and failing) to set fire to a police car. Much smaller protests were held by UK Uncut in Ipswich and Poole, with five protesters attending the latter. Protesters also occurred in Barker's Pool, Sheffield, on the Day of Rage (12 March). UK Uncut arranged to hold anti-cuts protests in Basildon on 14 March. On 22 March, Around 4,000 people from universities and colleges across Scotland marched down the Royal Mile to the Scottish Parliament and staged a rally against introduction of tuition fees and cuts to education. Politicians, student leaders and trade union representatives, including Education Secretary Mike Russell, Labour Party's Des McNulty and Margaret Smith, of the Liberal Democrats addressed the protesters at the rally.Students heckle Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP over fees; The Guardian; 22 March 2011 On the same day the University of Glasgow management evicted the Free Hetherington occupation.

Protesters preparing ahead of the 26 March protests broke into 61 Curzon Street in London and occupied the building, calling it a \\"meeting place\\". On 26 March, 250,000 people attended a protest in central London. Further outbreaks of violence were reported in London on 27 March. Several hundred people protested in Barker's Pool, Sheffield; the branch of John Lewis was damaged by rioters throwing smoke bombs and rocks. The police arrested 201 people in connection with civil disobedience. The two men charged have been released on bail ahead of court appearances. The other 199 are being held in various police stations around London. According to The Daily Telegraph, the movement represented \\"the biggest public backlash against the Government's spending cuts since it came to power.\\" April‚ÄìJuly On 28 May, hundreds of protesters at 40 locations across the country staged protests against proposed cuts to the NHS. Dubbed \\"Emergency Operation\\", protesters organised by UK Uncut and trade unions converged on high street banks and held demonstrations to draw attention to the bank's role in creating the deficit.UK Uncuts hosts 40 direct actions in protest at NHS reforms; New Statesman; 29 May 2011Anti-cuts groups descend on banks in NHS protest; Guardian News; 28 May 2011 On 30 June, a one-day strike, officially called \\"J30\\", was held by public sector workers to protest the government's planned unconventional changes to pension plans and retirement policies, including raising the retirement age from 60 to 66 and the replacing of final salary pension schemes with a career-average system. The Driving Standards Agency had recently announced that it was to launch a localised trial to determine whether delivering examiners from non-established test centres could help with growing pupil demand, starting in Warrington, Wiltshire, Ayrshire, Wales and Dumbarton.TRL ‚Äì Majority of driving examiners 'attended work during strikes' TRL News Hub In the one-day strike, pickets and a series of anti-cuts rallies by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), University and College Union (UCU) and the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) went ahead largely as planned. Over 11,000 schools in England were affected by the strike, according to the data released by the Department for Education (DfE). Nearly 400 schools were closed in greater Birmingham and the Black Country, with another 70 partially shut. According to union reports, across the rest of England, 3,200 schools were shut and 2,200 were partially closed, out of about 22,000 state-funded schools. Only 18 out of 750 Jobcentre Plus offices in the country were closed due to the lack of strike activity by their staff, while 90% of the civilian call centre staff at the Metropolitan Police did strike. The Coastguard also reported some minor walkouts. According to the Department for Transport, some 76 per cent of driving examiners went to work. Approximately 180 prison office staff and workshop instructors mounted a picket line outside HMP Gartree Prison near the town of Market Harborough. The event was officially called the \\"J30\\" after the date it was held on. The \\"J30\\" events were to be followed by a partial one-day overtime ban on 1 July. The PCS chose to have a month-long overtime ban instead The pension cuts and reforms were, like the planned budget cuts in the NHS and Education budget, the main causes of the union's simmering malcontent with the government of that time. The UNISON union warned of further strike action in Birmingham. August‚ÄìDecember An additional one-day strike took place across the country on 30 November. The strike was organised by various unions with the Trade Union Congress calling it the biggest strike in a generation. Nearly two-thirds of England's 21,476 schools were closed, all but 33 of Scotland's 2,700 states schools were closed and 7,000 operations in hospitals were cancelled. Twenty-one arrests were made, as Occupy London activists marched from Piccadilly Circus to Panton House, the headquarters of international mining company Xstrata, where the highest paid CEO in the United Kingdom works. The activists entered the building with a large banner saying \\"All power to the 99%\\" and subsequently entered onto the rooftop and strapped the banner to the front of the building. Videos of the violent arrests were posted on social-video site YouTube, including a video showing an undercover police officer, tasked with infiltrating the Occupy London march. A total of 75 activist-related arrests were logged in the capital that day. =2012‚Äì2015= On 20 October 2012 the Trades Union Congress had organised simultaneous marches in Belfast, London and Glasgow. Though the TUC gave an estimate of 150,000 people turning up to the London event, official police figures have not been confirmed. Labour leader Ed Miliband spoke at the event, and gained controversial responses from the crowd when advocating that austerity was necessary, but the Conservative scale was aggressive. In January 2013, the Daily and Sunday Mirror and Sunday People launched campaigns opposing cuts to housing benefit popularly known as the 'bedroom tax' (a term coined by the Mirror). In 2013 the People's Assembly Against Austerity was launched to \\"push the arguments against austerity\\" it sees as missing from British politics and to fight for the people it sees as being disadvantaged by Government policies. It published its own manifesto The People's Charter, which received support from political parties and trade unions in the UK. The initiative was backed by trade unions as well as campaigning groups, individuals and political parties. On 22 June 2013, over 4,000 people attended a conference at Westminster Central Hall in London. This followed meetings and rallies across the country. Local activist groups subsequently formed and held meetings across the UK. In Scotland, there were two major demonstrations on 30 March 2013 against the changes to welfare resulting from the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Around 3,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Glasgow and around 1,000 demonstrators assembled outside of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Participants in the protests include the Scottish Socialist Party and the Radical Independence Campaign. There were Yes Scotland and Scottish Green Party banners present at both events. Some parliamentarians from the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Labour Party issued statements of support. The People's Assembly organized a demonstration which took place on 21 June 2014, marching from outside the BBC Trust's Portland Place offices to Parliament Square, with speeches from comedians and political commenters Russell Brand and Mark Steel. Sources confirmed the march to have 50,000 demonstrators. As well as putting on national events, the majority of work is carried out by the local People's Assemblies, that were either founded after the founding People's Assembly, or incorporate pre-existing local anti-cuts groups. On 9 May 2015, after the Conservative party achieved a majority government in the 2015 general election, an impromptu anti-austerity protest was staged. Four police officers and a member of police staff were injured and five protesters were arrested. A minor protest in Bristol of 1,000 demonstrator on 13 May 2015‚Äîsix days after the election result‚Äîprotested the ¬£12bn of welfare cuts planned to be enacted by 2018. London protest, 20 June 2015 The People's Assembly Against Austerity and Scotland United Against Austerity organised demonstrations across the UK a year later on 20 June in Bristol, London, Liverpool and Glasgow. Several guest speakers including high-profile political activists such as Russell Brand, Charlotte Church, Richard Coyle and Julie Hesmondhalgh, the People's Assembly's leader Sam Fairbairn, trade union leaders and politicians Diane Abbott Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas and Martin McGuinness attended the London crowd which walked from the Bank of England and Parliament Square. The People's Assembly Against Austerity estimated the turnout at 250,000 demonstrators at the London march, and The Guardian displayed estimates \\"between 70,000 and more than 150,000\\", with a confirmed number of 10,000 demonstrators at the Glasgow march, and 350 demonstrators in Liverpool. The People's Assembly's organised a further demonstration in London on 8 July the same year with an additional 40 side protests, featuring guest speakers such as Owen Jones and RMT union leader Mick Cash at the London demonstration and strikers from Barnet Council, Bromley Council, the National Gallery and the London Underground participating. As well as 60,000 strong protest at the 2015 Conservative party conference in Manchester on 5 October. =2016‚Äì2018= On 16 April 2016, the National People's Assembly led a further national demonstration labelled the \\"March for Health, Homes, Jobs, Education\\", or the '#4Demands' march. It was reported that the march was attended by 50,000 to 150,000 protesters, who marched from London's Euston Road to Trafalgar Square. On 4 March 2017, 250,000 marched in London. More than 100,000 people attended the \\"Not One Day More\\" protest in London on 1 July. Aside from being an Anti-austerity rally, both the renewal of Theresa May's premiership ‚Äì three weeks after she secured a minority government in the snap election ‚Äì and the Grenfell Tower fire featured highly on picket signs. Labour Party politicians including Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey and journalist Owen Jones spoke at the event, with political musicians Shy FX, Wolf Alice and Sam Duckworth performing on the stage. A minute of silence for the victims of Grenfell Tower and a minute of applause for the emergency services were held during the protest. The Bristol branch of the People's Assembly Against Austerity organised an anti-austerity march 9 September 2017 ending at College Green. The demonstration was called to protest the ¬£104 million of cuts to the Bristol City Council budget between 2017 and 2021 which will hurt Social and Children's services, social care and libraries. Over thirty local and regional organisations (Including Bristol's Labour and Green parties; People's Assembly and regional trade union offices) supported the march and promoted the event through word of mouth and, however a large array of street art advertising the event appeared around the city in the weeks leading up to the march, described as being \\"promoted in a typically Bristol fashion\\". Incumbent mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees supported the march in the wish to use the turnout as political mandate to his handing over of the Core Cities Group green paper on greater funding for the largest cities in the United Kingdom. Media sources anticipated a large turnout for the march prior to the day, though official figures of the turnout have never been confirmed. The following month a march took place at Belfast City Hall. It was initially advocated by People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll and Labour peer Baroness Blood and Unite the Union and the Labour Party in Northern Ireland were involved in its organisation. The march coincided with the start of the 2017 Conservative Party Conference held in Manchester 1 October and- inline with the arguments of the Bristol demonstration- directly protests against the ¬£70 million to be subtracted from the Belfast City Council's budget by 2021. On Sunday 1 October, the first day of the conference, two marches were held in Manchester, an Anti-austerity march and a march opposing exiting the European Union. With anticipation of up to 50,000 attendees by the People's Assembly and 30,000 by police estimates. No arrests were made. On 3 February 2018 the 'Fix It Now' march took place in London. Organised by the national healthcare group 'Health Campaigns Together' and 'the People's Assembly'‚Äîwith vocal support from Jeremy Corbyn‚Äîand focused entirely on greater funding for the NHS- demonstrators marched from Gower Street to Downing Street. There were high-profile speakers at the event such as shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley, Cecilia Anim, Ralf Little and several trade union and health campaign representatives, notably Tamsyn Bacchus. Organisers claimed the demonstration attracted 250,000 demonstrators in London, while smaller demonstrations occurred in areas such as Exeter, Isle of Wight, Macclesfield, Margate and Southampton. Protesters were attracted by both the high-profile sell-offs of assets to private companies, notably Virgin Care and the financial pressure that has led to 100,000 unfilled job vacancies in the service and the recent crisis in the system over the winter. On 18 February a small protest in Chelmsford, Essex, happened in response to the merging of three local hospitals into a single trust, which protestors feared would impact on service, and general underfunding of the healthcare sector. On 28 September 2,000 headteachers and school leaders from across England, Wales and Northern Ireland protests outside 10 Downing Street because of the austerity cuts in schools. The protest was organised by WorthLess?, who focus on reduction in the education budget. =2019‚Äìpresent= In January 2019 there was a struggle during a series of protests across London for anti-austerity protesters to \\"reclaim\\" the imagery of the Yellow Vests used by the populist, anti-austerity movement in France called gilets jaunes from pro-Brexit activists associated with the far-right. Many protestors part of the event see synergy between their own anti-austerity demands and the gilets jaunes protests. . However figures like journalist Mike Stuchbery who focuses on the far-right's rise in Britain believed it was too late. There were far-right, pro-Brexit protestors present at rallies at the same time, however they were far smaller. Journalist and anti-austerity campaigner Owen Jones was assaulted by far-right protestors at one of these events. In September several left-wing Labour MPs under the banner \\"Labour Assembly Against Austerity\\" provided an alternative economic plan for post-Covid19 recovery, this was co-signed by over 9,000 Labour Members. On 17 October 2020, the People's Assembly plans nationwide demonstrations in protest of the government's handling of coronavirus and what the PAAA believe will be another wave of austerity. Public opinion A YouGov poll, published 26 March 2011, found that a 52% majority supported the \\"campaign against public sector spending cuts\\" with 31% against. 55% of voters thought the cuts were necessary, against 32% who thought they were unnecessary, but most felt the cuts were too deep and too fast. The same YouGov poll showed that 38% blamed Labour for the cuts, 23% blamed the coalition and 26% blamed both. The results contained a strong partisan divide, with 83% of Labour supporters and only 19% of Tory supporters backing the anti-austerity movement. YouGov surveyed 2,720 adults online between 20‚Äì21 March 2011.How unpopular are the cuts now?; New Statesman; 25 March 2011 However, a Reuters/Ipsos MORI poll in June 2011 found around an even divide over whether public sector workers were right to strike about cuts. From 2013 opinion polling has shown a consistent consensus that austerity has been a bad thing for the country. Polling from Ipsos MORI in October 2015 showed that though a majority (56%) of the public believed that public services have gotten worse, and that the government's policies aren't effective for good public service, trust in the government's overal economic policy hadn't decreased. Data accumulated by YouGov in the same time period suggested a majority of those surveyed advocated easing (30%) or ending (22%) the austerity, a majority over those suggesting to continue (43%) or Other/unsure (5%) A ComRes poll into public opinion into economics in November 2016 found a majority of those asked (53%) favoured the government increasing public spending, rather than cutting it. Sky News additionally found that 43% of those asked in their poll wanted to end austerity, with 24% believing it should continue and 12% saying they did not know. The 2017 British Social Attitudes Survey found that 48% of those surveyed during the previous year wanted higher taxes to pay for more public spending, the first time since 2008 that more people wanted an increase in taxation and spending than opposed it, and the highest proportion to support such measures since 2004. Polling of members of the four political parties in the United Kingdom in 2017 (Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Labour, Scottish National Party) showed a stark difference in perception of austerity: 11% of Conservative members agreed that austerity has been taken too far, however 98% for Labour, 93% in the Scottish Nationalist Party and 75% among Liberal Democrat members believed austerity had gone too far. An April 2018 opinion poll by Number Cruncher Politics in the Financial Times found that 66% of British adults, including majorities of all major parties' supporters, thought austerity had \\"gone too far\\". Responses The Conservative led governments of 2010, 2015 and 2017 have consistently rejected the calls to end austerity, arguing that austerity is necessary to cut the country's deficit. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, speaking to Reuters news service, accused the Labour Party leadership of \\"whipping up people's fervour\\" and succumbing to \\"the worst kind of infantile opposition politics.\\" The education secretary Michael Gove said on BBC Radio 4's Today early on the morning of 26 March, \\"Of course people will feel a sense of disquiet, in some cases anger, at what they see happening, but the difficulty we have as the Government inheriting a terrible economic mess, is that we have to take steps to bring the public finances back into balance.\\" He also speculated that the march could \\"move from being [a] family event into being something darker\\". Daniel Hannan, a journalist and the Conservative MEP for South East England, stated that the protesters \\"have decided to indulge their penchant for empty, futile, self-righteous indignation.\\" He wrote, \\"After 'No Cuts!' the marchers' favourite slogan was 'Fairness!' Alright, then... How about being fair to our children, whom we have freighted with a debt unprecedented in peacetime?\\" In Gulf News, columnist Ayman Mustafa remarked about anti-austerity strikes and protests that \\"People still see the financial sector not being punished although it was the main culprit of the financial crisis and the subsequent recession\\". He also wrote that \\"most of the government cuts are targeting workers, while big businesses and financial businesses in particular are being incentivised with the clich√© that Britain must encourage bankers and fund managers to stay\\". In 2011, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, proposed to Parliament the implementation of new police powers to remove face coverings and balaclavas, as well as banning orders, similar to those used to ban hooligans from football matches. The Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, strongly backed May on this. During the May 2015 London protest which occurred in response to the Conservative victory in the 2015 election graffiti of \\"fuck tory scum\\" was spray painted on the memorial to the women of World War Two. Similar media focus was drawn to a banner that said \\"hang the Tories\\" and depicted men in suits hung off the banner in Manchester during the demonstrations at the 2017 Conservative Party Conference, which was condemned by the city's metro mayor Andy Burnham. Analysis of the protest movement Bart Cammaerts in his book The Circulation of Anti-Austerity Protest argues that two core political discourses have risen due to the anti-austerity movement: \\"a renewed politics of redistribution and 'real democracy'\\". Others have suggested this movement has occurred alongside 'new social movements', movements such as \\"ecology, feminism, LGBT rights, anti-nuclear, etc\\". Richard Youngs, writing for openDemocracy see this movement being birthed out of the global trend during the 2010s of protests of varying purposes taking place, broadly stating \\"invariably they emerge out of background grievances that fester for years ‚Äì a slow decline in political freedoms, poor economic performance.\\" Others had noted how other left-wing causes prior to austerity, such as the 2009 protests against Israel's treatment of Palestinians, had trained up established activists in skills and techniques that were useful. Analysis of participants in the anti-austerity marches in 2011 showed a higher proportion of unemployed people and students than other European countries with anti-austerity movements, such as Belgium and Italy. Cammaerts points out from his research that for many participating in the anti-austerity marchers their presence there was out of a \\"common sense\\" resistance to austerity measured, rather than out of an ideological position. However other research shows over 80% of those who participate consider themselves left of centre. State repression has been a common theme in the decline of the anti-austerity movement in the United Kingdom. Cammaerts noted the struggle that the anti-austerity movement had in reaching non-active citizens because the mainstream media gave it little press coverage. O'Hagan noted how aggressive arrest tactics from the government led to many activists being demoralised and stopped engaging in political activities. Negative perceptions of the protestors in print media such as the Daily Mail has also contributed to it's decline. Despite its initial momentum at the beginning of the movement, the protests eventually started to \\"peter out\\" after 2012 according to journalist Ellie Mae O'Hagan. She attributed this to the lack of interest and listening from the government whilst they continued their austerity measures. Cammaerts criticised how the movement broadly left the economic conditions in which austerity are implemented- neo-liberalism- unaddressed and the lack of ideological position taken by the movement was part of its decline. This was argued by some to unite its disparate supporters. However this lack of ideological position was due to a poor amount of communication between the groups and activists and so there was no consensus on what ideology to push. Anarchists were disappointed by the People's Assembly Against Assembly fixation on attempting to shift the Labour Party's policies to the left, its bureaucratic nature, lack of action and wish for high taxes on the rich in the People's Assembly. Michael Chessum, a prominent People's Assembly activist who went on to Momentum and Another Europe Is Possible argued that movement focused too much on organising mass demonstrations, rather than the local campaigns necessary to build the movement.

Bombing of Tokyo by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses with firebombs on the night of May 26, 1945. A night bomber is a bomber aircraft intended specifically for carrying out bombing missions at night. The term is now mostly of historical significance. Night bombing began in World War I and was widespread during World War II. A number of modern aircraft types are designed primarily for nighttime bombing, but air forces no longer refer to them as night bombers. More common terms today include interdictor and strike fighter, and such aircraft tend to have all-weather, day-or-night capabilities. World War I Strategic bombing and night bombing were new in World War I, and there was much experimentation at night with aircraft such as the Gotha G.IV, Gotha G.V, Handley Page Type O, and various giant airplanes such as the Riesenflugzeuge and the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets. Navigation was difficult and precision was almost nonexistent but the psychological effect was strong. Night bombing worked as a terror weapon. Prior to the introduction of radar, aircraft flying at night were nearly impossible to locate accurately enough for attack. Acoustic location was used to obtain preliminary rough coordinates. Searchlights scanning the sky could illuminate aircraft by chance and might track them long enough for anti- aircraft artillery to fire a few shots. Alternatively, night fighters were used for interception; they either cooperated with searchlights or tried to spot the bombers in the moonlight. The success rate of such defences were so low that it was widely believed that \\"The bomber will always get through\\", in the words of British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Since World War I, the bomber had been seen as a terror weapon, and was later seen as a primary strategic weapon of total war. As Baldwin later said, their primary purpose was to \\"kill the enemy's women and children more rapidly than they killed yours\\".Keith Middlemas and Anthony John Lane Barnes, Baldwin: A Biography, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1969, p. 722. Interwar period and World War II As aircraft capabilities grew, so did their defensive firepower. By the mid-1930s, opinions were changing and the idea of daylight raids of aircraft providing their own self-defense came to the fore. In practice these aircraft proved entirely vulnerable to modern fighter aircraft and were rapidly returned to the night bombing role. However, these aircraft had not been designed for night navigation, and were generally lacking any effectiveness in these missions: > I don't think we realized at the time that our equipment wasn't really up to > it. They'd forgotten to design or produce any navigation equipment, so the > Wellington bomber, which was intended to be a day bomber, had to operate at > night because it was so vulnerable during the day. It had virtually the same > equipment that the Tiger Moth had, with one exception‚Äîthe Wellington had a > loop aerial. Here we were flying 500 or 600 miles over enemy territory, > trying to locate a target in total blackout, often with cloud below us and a > lot of industrial haze. It's not surprising that our bombers were 5, 10 > miles away. There was no bomber stream. We were largely on our own, perhaps > 10 or 14 aircraft at intervals. :‚ÄîJohn Gee, Bomber Command pilot\\"Reforming > the Command\\", Operations, Personal Stories, The Bomber Command Association The USAAF was the only force to press ahead with daylight strategic bombing raids during World War II. This proved as disastrous as the earlier Royal Air Force and Luftwaffe attempts, and had to be called off in late 1943. The arrival of the P-51 Mustang fighter in the \\"bomber escort\\" role allowed these missions to start again in 1944, and the fighter was so successful that the Luftwaffe fighter force was largely wiped out by the end of spring. Attrition of the Luftwaffe was so great that the RAF was also able to take to the daylight skies later that year. The USAAF also applied the same concept with the bombing raids against Japan in June 1944-early 1945 with daylight precision bombing against Japanese industrial facilities using Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers. However, the results weren't successful because of the frequent jetstream blowing the high explosives off target, navigation problems, anti-aircraft fire, and searchlights, resulting in high losses among the B-29 crewmen. As a result, in February 1945, the USAAF switched to low- level incendiary raids against Japanese cities, most of them took place at night. The most devastating air raid in the war was the firebombing of Tokyo on the night of March 9‚Äì10, 1945, which destroyed 16 square miles, killed 100,000 Japanese, and made a million people homeless.B-29s Victory in the PacificSUICIDE ATTACKS ON B-29s References Bomber aircraft ","title":"Night bomber"},{"id":"31301169","text":"Gettin' Down On It is the first full-length album by the Fort Wayne, Indiana, blues rock duo Left Lane Cruiser.

He was the founder of Brent Walker. Early life Born in Stepney, London, Walker was the son of William James Walker, a brewery worker, drayman at Watneys brewery, and wife (Limehouse, April/June 1925) Ellen Louisa n√©e Page (Southwark, October/December 1903). He was the eldest of four brothers. Walker attended the Jubilee School in Bedford, Essex, leaving at 14 to work in an aircraft factory. He later worked as a salesman and a porter in Billingsgate Fish Market and did his National Service in the Royal Air Force. Boxing A former prize-fighter, Walker was a keen amateur boxer becoming British amateur heavyweight champion in 1951. He turned professional and fought 14 professional fights winning 11 with eight knockouts. He was pitted unsuccessfully against Welsh champion, Dennis Powell for the British light- heavyweight title relinquished by Randolph Turpin.The Times, Sports in Brief, 7 January 1953 Crime Walker then drifted into crime, working for East End gangster, Billy Hill, and eventually being convicted for theft and serving two and a half years in Wormwood Scrubs. Business On release he became the owner of a motor garage and manager for his brother, Billy Walker a professional heavyweight boxer. Walker launched London's first discoth√®que, Dolly's in Jermyn Street, and a chain of cafes, Billy's Baked Potato, with his brother. In 1970 Walker completed a reverse takeover of Hackney & Hendon Greyhounds Ltd. This meant his private company bought a public company and the new merger resulted in a new company called Brent Walker, the property and leisure empire. The company developed the Brent Cross shopping centre (the UK's first stand-alone shopping centre) on the site of Hendon Greyhound Stadium, during 1972. Walker sold his equity in Brent Cross in 1979 netting ¬£3.7 million in profit. Hackney Wick Stadium remained under the control of Brent Walker until 1991 when the bank took control of it. Brent Walker had a turbulent career through the 1980s, being worth about 250 million pounds at its zenith but eventually collapsing in 1990 after taking over William Hill Bookmakers in a leveraged buy out. Walker was accused of fraud after an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office but was cleared of all charges after a lengthy trial in 1995. He was however made bankrupt and moved to Russia where he ran a series of businesses selling cigarettes and perfume and later opening a chain of betting shops. Marriage and issue Walker was married in 1957 to Jean Maureen Hatton (West Ham, January/March 1936) who he had known since he was 16 years old, daughter of George (Georgie) James Hatton (West Ham, January/March 1907 - ?), a professional gambler and garage owner in Plaistow, and wife (West Ham, July/September 1929) Lilian Elizabeth n√©e Attreed (West Ham, January/March 1908 - ?). Walker had two daughters and a son. Sarah Georgina Walker, their eldest daughter, was married secondly from 1989 to 1996 to the Marquess of Milford Haven.

The album is credited to be the first proper Urdu metal album released in Pakistan. Lyrically, the album contains references to life, death, nature and the environment a person lives in. The album was recorded and produced by vocalist and lead guitarist Faraz Anwar. The album is the second album produced by Faraz. The album is entirely a progressive rock and heavy metal album and the first concept album which is released in Pakistan. Maazi, Haal, Mustaqbil was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Five singles have been released in promotion of the album along with their music videos; \\"Meri Terhan\\" and \\"Insaan\\" in 2002, \\"Izhar\\" in March 2003, \\"Kitne Sadian\\" in April 2004 and \\"Panchi\\" in September 2005. \\"Kitne Sadian\\", \\"Insaan\\" and \\"Meri Terhan\\" did very well at the local music charts. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album sold more than 30,000 copies upon its release and is the band's highest selling album.  Background  After Akhthar Qayyum left the band, Faraz Anwar recruited two new members Jamal Mustafa on rhythm guitars and Irfan Ahmed on drums. The band then started working on their second studio album. Firstly, the band struggled to strike a record deal as no record label was willing to release a progressive rock album as the general Pakistani audience were not aware of the genre. Leaving aside the record labels, the band also faced opposition from the local music channels as they banned the band from playing their music videos which were initially given a lot of air time. Music videos of singles \\"Insaan\\", released in October 2002, and \\"Meri Terhan\\", released in December, were banned from playing on many local music channels. However, the band did not gave up and went on recording and releasing their third single music video, \\"Izhar\\", for the 2003 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Pakistan cricket team. The video of the song was made in a very short period of time and was released in March 2003. The video was a success and received a lot of air time play on music channels and was even played internationally on the Dubai based sports channel Ten Sports. After the release of \\"Izhar\\", Khalid Khan also left the band due to playing bass for two bands at one time, Mizraab and Aaroh. Aaroh had already broken into the mainstream and Mizraab was not going to remain underground much longer. Realising that it was difficult for him to continue with both these demanding acts, the band decided that Khalid should limit himself to one of these. So, Khalid ended up parting ways with the band and became a full-time band member of Aaroh. Faraz Arshad, an ex-student of Faraz Awar, replaced Khalid Khan on bass guitars.  Reception  On April 14, 2004, Mizraab released their fourth single \\"Kitni Sadian\\" music video directed by Babar Sheikh from their upcoming second studio album. On March 8, Mizraab released their second studio album Maazi, Haal, Mustaqbil,Chris Ruel: Mizraab ‚Äì Maazi Haal Mustaqbil (Album Review) Retrieved on March 16, 2011 which found the band renewed popularity and success.

As a scientist from the German Mining Museum, he focused his research mainly on Western Asia, especially on Oman, Jordan, Palestine, and Iran. Education and career From 1957 to 1959, Gerd Weisgerber studied at the teacher training college of Saarbr√ºcken and began his career as a secondary school teacher. Later on, he found a passion on archaeology and finished his doctorate in 1970 at Saarland University over \\"R√∂mische Quellheiligtum von Hochscheid im Hunsr√ºck\\". He started his archaeological career as professor Rolf Hachmann's assistant at the same university. In April 1973 he started his work at the German Mining Museum as a mining archaeologist, where he was active until the very end of his life. Since 1984 he was the assistant director of the museum.

(subscription required) Sometimes unkindly referred to as Uncle Frank and \\"a bus-company manager\\" Frank Searle died just too young to see the true advent of the era of mass air-travel‚Äînot yet on-stage but, as he rightly suspected, 'waiting in the wings'. Career He was apprenticed to the Great Western Railway at Swindon Works and became a locomotive engineer but Searle soon recognized that the new petrol engines offering a higher power-to-weight ratio would be better than steam power. =Consultant motor engineer= Having seen that mechanized road transport would present better prospects for making money Searle entered business as a consultant motor engineer located in the West End of London. In 1905 he was in Paris, France where he represented the Turgan and Lacoste et Battman companies. He sold several Lacoste et Battman chassis to the London and District Motor Omnibus Company, which traded as \\"Arrow\\". The Lacoste et Battman buses were unreliable, and suffered frequent breakdowns. Searle was forced to abandon his consultancy when the final part of the order was cancelled due to the unreliability of the vehicles. Arrow took Searle on as a mechanic to keep the fleet of buses on the road. Searle patented and sold to LGOC for ¬£1,000 an ingenious silent roller-chain constant-mesh gearbox.Charles F Klapper, The Golden Age of Buses, 1978, Routledge & Kegan Paul. =Omnibuses= B-type Omnibus entered service 18 October 1910 Ole Bill\\" troop transport In 1907, the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) employed Searle as Superintendent at its Mortlake garage at an annual salary of ¬£350. He was soon transferred to Cricklewood and on 18 May 1907 was appointed as Chief Motor Engineer at a salary of ¬£450, later rising to ¬£500. At the time, LGOC had a varied fleet of some 600 motor-buses all of which proved unable to cope with the stresses of operating in London's traffic. Searle persuaded LGOC to allow him to design a vehicle that was fit for the job. The best features of existing vehicles were taken and incorporated into the new design named the X-type bus. The prototype was completed on 12 August 1909 and, due to licensing delays, entered service in December. The next year Searle produced an improved design, the B-type bus, which entered service on 18 October 1910. Rumours reached the LGOCs board that Searle had been offered a senior position with the Daimler Company's planned new motor-omnibus business. Searle's salary was increased from ¬£1,000 to ¬£1,250 on condition that he devote all his time to LGOC and took no outside employment. He prevaricated. Searle was ordered to appear before the board at their meeting on 4 May 1911. Offered a salary of ¬£2,000 provided he signed a new contract there and then, Searle refused and was dismissed with three months' salary in lieu of notice. The details of his new position with Daimler's The Premier Motor Omnibus Company were announced in The Times on 6 May 1911.The New Motor-Omnibus Company. The Times, Saturday, 6 May 1911; pg. 10; Issue 39578By the following Wednesday The Times was able to report 'widespread excitement' because of apparent difficulties with Daimler's Premier Motor Omnibus flotation (denied, in fact deferred and the proposal lost Daimler support) which had previously caused a 'severe fall' in the price of LGOC shares and (revived) rumours of LGOC involvement with a group of underground electric railways (confirmed). (The Latest Omnibus Development. The Position In The Stock Exchange. Features Of The Past Account. The Times, Wednesday, 10 May 1911; pg. 19; Issue 39581) The following November the directors of LGOC announced the proposed amalgamation of their business with Metropolitan District Railway and Underground Electric Railways Company of London which was completed in April 1912.(London Traffic Amalgamation. A Combination Of Omnibus And Railway Companies., ¬£33,000,000 Capital Involved. The Times, Thursday, 2 Nov 1911; pg. 6; Issue 39732) The following February there was a new flotation, The Premier Omnibus Company, established to provide a motor-omnibus service in London and districts using \\"the well-known De Dion Bouton type omnibus\\". It was intended to manufacture buses at the former LGOC Walthamstow plant without link to Daimler other than a director being J S Critchley \\"formerly manager of The Daimler Company Limited\\". With Daimler since 1896 Critchley (1865-1944) was responsible for the creation of Daimler's Coventry factory.(The Premier Omnibus Company, Limited.

In 1913, Hall and Searle was floated on the stock exchange as The Searle Unburstable Inner Tube Company. =BSA group ‚Äî Daimler=Omnibuses and commercial vehicles In May 1911 Daimler announced the flotation of shares in a new subsidiary to operate a London bus service, The Premier Motor Omnibus Company, to run Daimler buses with Searle \\"who has resigned his position with London General Omnibus for the purpose\\" as General Manager. Days later these plans were scrapped. It had been intended that this new London bus company would use Daimler's new KPL petrol-electric hybrid. Tilling-Stevens, a close associate of LGOC claimed a patent infringement and production was stopped. Twelve KPLs had been made. Searle's new responsibility was to design the replacement product, effectively a B-Type with a Daimler motor. Then he had to sell this new vehicle and seems to have done well at this job. In June 1912 LGOC's former bus manufacturing operation was hived off into AEC and Searle is described as \\"manager of the Daimler Company Limited 'bus and commercial vehicle department\\" when visiting North America to \\"inspect the bus transportation system in the large American and Canadian cities and also to attend the trials of agricultural gasoline tractors at the Winnipeg Man. exhibition.\\"Automotive Industries Volume 26 June 20, 1912 World War I Ernest Brooks.

He was temporarily promoted to major in November 1916. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was mentioned in despatches. In 1918 Colonel Searle was awarded a Distinguished Service Order and he was made a CBE the following year.

After the dynasty died out in the middle of the 13th century, Jean de Rodemacher became the legitimate proprietor in 1415 by marriage with Irmgard de Boulay. In 1479, Maximilian I confiscated the property and charged Christopher of Baden with its upkeep. As a result of the war between France and Burgundy, the castle and its chapel were seriously damaged. William of Nassau-Vianden, who inherited the castle, sold it to Fran√ßois-S√©bastien Baur of Everlange in 1674.

Call for an inquiry  The inquiry process into the accreditation process for International Medical Graduates and other matters was initiated after a question was put forward in front of the Australian parliament in September 2010 by Hon Warren Entsch, one of the elected representatives from the rural Australia. The question that was raised was regarding the sudden deregistration of a highly qualified cardiologist practicing as a successful cardiologist in the regional area in the constituency of the concerned member of parliament. Serious concerns were expressed about the processes involved in the registration process of the overseas graduates and specialists working in Australia. An inquiry was called for by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia) in Australia and submissions were invited from all stakeholders, including international medical graduates.  Public hearings  Many overseas doctors have made submissions to the inquiry committee which are followed by public hearings. During 2011 there were public hearings held in Canberra, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Cairns, Townsville, Adelaide, Newcastle, Gosford, Launceston, Tasmania and Darwin. Medical Board Chair Dr Joanna Flynn made a statement that Medical Board of Australia follows a risk-based approach in assessing overseas doctors in order to match the Board's primary responsibility to protect public. On the other hand, she also said that the overseas doctors are an asset to the Australian Medical force.http://www.ahpra.gov.au/News/Medical- Board-of-Australia-Chair-presents-to-Parliamentary-Inquiry.aspx The current mind-set and the risk-based approach towards the assessment may be the root cause of the problem and the ongoing inquiry into the registration process of overseas doctors highlighted the urgent need for the Medical Board of Australia to consider a serious change in its approach towards registration process of the overseas doctors from risk-based assessment to a facilitative role. In another recent public hearing in front of the inquiry committee Dr Joanne Mary Flynn, Chair of the Medical Board of Australia made her second appearance in August 2011. The committee members requested the Medical Board chairman to provide them with a rough estimate of the number of overseas doctors in Australia who are currently finishing their mandatory four-year deadline and were unable to the achieve the general registration as mandated by the Medical board. Dr Flynn replied that the four-year period starts for all the overseas doctors on 1 July 2010, no matter how long they have been in Australia before that. She also mentioned that while the medical board requires these doctors to demonstrate progress, they can renew that registration under the national law three times http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/r241.pdf  Submissions  Several colleges and the public health employing authorities from all the individual states in Australia have also made submissions to this inquiry process. Some of the submissions so far have highlighted the difficulties faced by the international medical graduates currently employed in Australia. The introduction of national registration process under the Medical Board of Australia and regulated by the AHPRA resulted in introducing many more obstacles to the progress of overseas doctors in Australia in the name of regulation. The introduction of Medical Board of Australia and its handling of the registration process for overseas doctors is causing unnecessary distress and panic among the international medical graduates who are already established in Australia and serving in highly responsible positions in the community serving people. Serious concerns were raised about the massive impact on rural health in Australia due to the unforeseen barriers imposed upon overseas doctors serving rural communities in the bush. The inquiry committee did make a comment in the public hearings held so far that the current registration processes need closer evaluation and there may also be a need for regulation of the current registration process. The inquiry committee also have repeatedly expressed doubts about the validity of the Accreditation process for International Medical Graduates applied to the foreign doctors by many of the colleges. Many of submissions have also highlighted the inconsistencies and the unpredictable discrepancies in the accreditation process of international medical graduates with overseas specialist qualifications. The affected doctors included many international medical graduates from countries like India,http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/overseasdoctors/subs/sub21.pdf South Africa,http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/overseasdoctors/subs/sub100.1.pdf and Canada.http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/overseasdoctors/subs/sub111.pdf Some of the specialists colleges made their individual submissions which included Royal Australian and New Zealand College of psychiatristshttp://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/overseasdoctors/subs/sub112.pdf as well as Royal Australian and New Zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists.http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/overseasdoctors/subs/sub45.pdf The transcripts of all the inquiry committee public hearings are available for public access on the parliamentary web site. Some of these hearings have highlighted the extent of damage inflicted upon the professional careers of many of these international medical graduates in Australia due to the severe and unpredictable restrictions enforced upon these doctors in the name of registration requirements. A cabinet reshuffle took place in December 2011 with The Hon Tanya Plibersek becoming the new health minister of Australia and Hon Nicola Roxon moving to take up the post of attorney-general.  Outcome  In March 2012 the final report was published. The AHPRA responded by welcoming the increased focus on International Medical Graduates and the suggestions for initiatives that could improve their experience of joining Australia‚Äôs healthcare system. Proposals from the report were expected to streamline and speed up the process used to approve doctors wanting to work in Australia who had trained elsewhere. Pilot studies that were undertaken after the report suggested that the process could be run at a relatively low cost. The report led to some recognition that Australia needed to make changes to how its health workforce is organised.

Sahara is a remake of the 1943 film of the same name starring Humphrey Bogart. Plot In June 1942, on the eve of the Battle of El Alamein, American Sergeant Joe Gunn (James Belushi) and the crew of his M3 Lee tank Lulu Belle are the sole survivors of their unit. Boxed in by the enemy, they have no choice but to head south. They come across a group of Allied stragglers at a destroyed first aid station. The stragglers, led by British doctor Captain Halliday (Jerome Ehlers), decide to ride with Gunn in an attempt to escape the advancing Afrika Korps. Along the way, they pick up first British Sudanese soldier Tambul (Robert Wisdom) and his Italian prisoner, Giuseppe (Angelo D'Angelo), then downed Luftwaffe pilot lieutenant von Schletow (Julian Garner). The group ends up at a deserted Saharan oasis in search of water. With the Germans right behind them, they decide to stay and defend the well, holding up a battalion of 500 Germans. The well has completely dried up by then. A standoff and battle of wills begins between Gunn and Major von Falken (Alexander Petersons), the German commander. Gunn keeps up the pretense that the well has much water and negotiates to buy time. Eventually, the Germans attack and are beaten off again and again, but one by one, the defenders are killed. During the fighting, von Schletow, the German flyer, tries to escape, injuring Giuseppe who tries to stop him. Giuseppe is then killed by German fire as he tries to alert Gunn. Tambul chases down and kills von Schletow, but is shot as he returns. Before he dies, he tells the others that the Germans did not learn that the well was dry. When the German commander attempts to resolve the impasse, embittered \\"Frenchie\\" Leroux (Michael Massee) meets him outside the fort and kills him, only to be shot down by a sniper while returning to his side. Without a leader, the thirst- maddened Germans' final assault turns into a full-blown surrender as they drop their weapons and claw across the sand towards the well. Gunn discovers, to his shock, that a German shell that exploded in the well has tapped into a source of water. Gunn and Bates (Alan David Lee), the only other Allied survivor, disarm the Germans while they drink their fill. Ultimately, a British Long Range Desert Patrol arrives at the oasis to take charge of the prisoners. Cast * James Belushi as Sgt. Joe Gunn * Michael Massee as Cpl.

Upon becoming president, former president Kufuor pushed through his idea of getting rid of ‚Äúcash and carry‚Äù and replacing it with an equitable insurance scheme that ensured that treatment was provided first before payment for Ghanaian citizens. In 2003, the scheme was passed into law. Under the law, there was the establishment of Ghana National Health Insurance Authority which licenses, monitors and regulates the operation of health insurance schemes in Ghana. Like many countries in the world, Ghana's health insurance was fashioned out to meet specific needs of persons resident in Ghana. The National Health Insurance Scheme is a form of social intervention established by the Government of Ghana in the year 2003. The scheme provides equitable access and financial coverage for basic health care services to residents in Ghana. The objective of the NHIS is to secure the implementation of the national health insurance policy that ensures access to basic healthcare services to all residents of Ghana. NHIS Policy The health insurance was set up to allow Ghanaian residents to make contributions into a fund so that in the event of illness members could be supported by the fund to receive affordable health care. Under this policy, three types of health insurance schemes were set up. They were: ‚Ä¢ The National Health Insurance Scheme. ‚Ä¢ The Private Mutual Health Insurance Scheme. * The Private Commercial Health Insurance Scheme. In order for the system to function well, the government decided to support the District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme concept to ensure that: * Opportunity is provided for all Ghanaian citizens to have equal access to the functional structures of health insurance. * Ghanaian citizens do not move from an unaffordable ‚ÄòCash and carry‚Äô regime to another unaffordable Health Insurance one. * A sustainable Health Insurance option is made available to all Ghanaian citizens. * The quality of health care provision is not compromised under Health Insurance. Premiums Like all insurance schemes, different types of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium that ought to be paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors is not the same and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in cash and carry system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes. Nature of the Scheme In order to ensure the continuity of the scheme, two major lists were made. One had the all the conditions that the scheme could cover with the other the excluded conditions. =Diseases covered under the scheme= The NHIS covers about 95% of diseases in Ghana including: * Malaria * Diarrhoea * Upper respiratory tract infection * Skin Diseases * Hypertension * Diabetes * Asthma However, all district-wide schemes were given the right under the law to organise their schemes to cover as many diseases and services for Ghanaian citizens as they desire, provided it was approved by the National Health Insurance Council. =Exclusion list= The NHIS has a list of conditions that are excluded in the Benefits Package. these include; * Optical aids * Hearing aids * Orthopaedic aids * Dentures * Beautification Surgery * Supply of AIDS drugs * Treatment of chronic kidney disease * Heart and Brain surgery, etc. All these constitute only 5% of the total number of diseases that Ghanaian citizens suffered from. Scheme coverage The government supports all 212 Districts, Municipal and Sub-metro schemes in Ghana for Ghanaian citizens to the various districts to facilitate the set-up of the schemes. Controversies Since the inception of the scheme in 2003, there have been a lot of controversies surrounding its operation and purpose. The first one was to do with members of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), whose members claimed that the scheme was one made for members of the then ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP). As such many members of NDC did not want to register with the scheme. The reverse of all the propaganda that surrounded the scheme at its inception were revisited in 2009 when the NDC took over power.http://www.modernghana.com/news/219867/1/nhis-seized-by- ndc.html The NDC during its campaign leading to the 2008 general elections promised to make the payment of premiums under the scheme a one-time event. This idea was included in the NDC's manifesto. The promise has so far not come into fruition as the date for its implementation is constantly postponed.http://news.myjoyonline.com/health/201007/49927.asp Many critics of the proposal claim that it is just not possible to support the scheme with a one-time premium since the sustainability of the scheme would not be possible if premiums were not paid yearly.http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=199496 The promise could however not be implemented during the 8 year reign of the NDC.

Historical North Carolina militias The North Carolina Provincial Congress authorized a militia in 1775 for the American Revolution. The militia continued after the war. In 1836, the North Carolina General Assembly of 18361837 passed a law establishing a permanent militia. The law enrolled all free white males between the ages of 18 and 45 in the State Militia. Exceptions were given for certain public officials and other occupations. Free black males could only be enrolled as musicians in the militia.

On the death of his father, when he was only three years old, he went to live at Birmingham with his guardian, Francis Eginton, the well-known glass-painter, who, finding he had an aptitude for art, sent him to London in 1811, and in the following year he was admitted to the school of the Royal Academy. In 1815 he entered the studio of Sir Thomas Lawrence as a pupil. At the end of 1817 he established himself as a portrait-painter, practising first at Birmingham and successively at Liverpool, and Manchester, also painting occasional subject pictures. In 1825 he settled in London, where he resided in Newman Street until 1834, when ill-health obliged him to move to Leamington. It was his intention to return to London in 1837, but having some portrait commissions in Manchester he first visited that town, and in the following April was seized with paralysis, from which he never recovered. Wyatt died at Prestwich, near Manchester, on 27 February 1840, and was buried in the churchyard of that village. He was a clever artist, a skilful draughtsman, and a good colourist, and both his portraits and subject-pictures earned him considerable popularity. \\"Vigilance\\" (Tate gallery) which was exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1836 (it was engraved by G.

He exhibited 80 pictures in London between 1817 and 1838, including 35 at the Royal Academy. His younger brother, Thomas Wyatt (1799?-1859), was also a portrait painter.

Development of Algerian railways, as with aviation, road, and water transport, has been overshadowed by big high-profile projects which are an inefficient use of resources; private sector investment is minimal and productivity of assets and employees is low.

Varghese Chelatt, then manager of the school, became the first President of the club while an Imbayi Mather became secretary. Ernakulam Eagles were active until the late 1990s, but professional commitments of its members made the administration of the club difficult. They then folded the club due to those reasons. The team then announced their second coming in October 2010 as Kochi Eagles Football Club and made it clear that they have great plans to make history in keeping with their lineage. The team is now owned by Ziqitza Sports Management Pvt Ltd. Eagles F.C. entered into an agreement with Reading F.C. in April 2013 where Reading would send coaches and identify players for training at the Madejski Stadium in Reading. The aim is to identify young talent from Kochi in the age group around 13 and take at least one of the best to play in the Premier League by 2018. Reading officials have assured Eagles FC that if Eagles enters the first division they would pump in money into the club. Eagles FC Kerala got an entry into Federation Cup 2014 after Langsning FC pulled out of the campaign.

It was established during the First World War, and operated from 1917 until 1979. Establishment Construction of new berths during the First World War The yard as initially established as an emergency shipyard to repair ships damaged in the war. It was incorporated as a Private company in 1917 and covered an 85 acre site on the north bank of the River Tees at Haverton Hill, opposite Middlesbrough. As completed it included 50 acres reclaimed from tidal land with 2,500 feet of river frontage, with twelve building berths and a fitting-out basin measuring 1,000 feet by 250 feet. It operated as a subsidiary within the Furness, Withy Shipping Company, with the first ship being laid down in March 1918, before the yard had been completed. It initially built ships for the British Government and foreign companies, as well as ships for Furness, Withy & Co and its subsidiaries. During the 1920s it built colliers, tramp steamers, twin-funnelled passenger/cargo liners, whaling ships and five deep-sea tankers. In the late 1920s it built a number of ships for service on the Great Lakes of North America, transporting grain and gypsum rock. These vessels were of the bridge- forward/engines-aft design typical of the lake freighters. One such ship built by the Furness Shipbuilding Company was the Cementkarrier, one of the first diesel-electric ships built in the North East of England. RFA Wave Conqueror, a Wave-class oiler of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, launched from the shipyard in 1943 With the economic decline of the 1930s affecting shipping and shipbuilding companies, the yard had few orders during the early 1930s. Business improved during the mid-1930s, and in 1936 the yard produced 11 ships. During the Second World War, between 1939 and 1946, 26 deep-sea tankers, sixteen coastal CHANT tankers, six tramp ships and three whale factory ships were built. To cope with wartime demand, the yard added four extra berths. The postwar years also saw significant orders from the yard, with 76 large ships and tankers built between 1947 and 1963. In around 1951 ownership of the yard was vested in Haverton Holdings, and by 1961 the yard employed 2,750 workers and was producing ships of to 52,000 tons deadweight tonnage and steelwork for bridges and gasholders. Decline The yard was modernised in 1963 to be able to build supertankers and bulk carriers, building its first bulk carrier, Essi Gina, shortly afterwards. A slump in orders followed, and in 1967 the holding company owning the Furness Shipbuilding Company sold off its shipbuilding interests. In March 1968 it was announced that the yard was to be closed with the loss of 3,000 jobs, and that same year it was merged into the Swan Hunter group. Further orders were placed, and on 12 October 1970 the yard launched the first of six Bridge-class ore/bulk/oil carriers, Furness Bridge. Five others were launched at the rate of one per year. In 1977 the yard and the other Swan Hunter assets were nationalised into the British Shipbuilders Corporation, and two years later, in 1979, the yard was finally closed. Legacy The derelict slipways of the Furness Shipbuilding Company in 2005 The site of the yard passed into the ownership of the Tees Alliance Group, which acquired it to build offshore structures for the oil industry. With the bankruptcy of the company in 2014, its assets, including the shipyard site, were acquired by the Dano-German venture Offshore Structures (Britain) Ltd.

The venue is located at the heart of Yerevan in walking distance from the Republic Square, where the Prime Minister‚Äôs office, several ministries and the National Museum of History and National Gallery of Paintings are located. Activities of ACCEA/NPAK Main objectives of ACCEA/NPAK have been, and continue to be, encouraging and assisting free and uninhibited expression, and opening ‚Äúnew horizons‚Äù in arts and artistic expression of Armenian artists, as well as discovery of new and young artistic talents and providing them opportunity of presenting their work. This is the main objective of annual festival of alternative art organized by ACCEA/NPAK. At the center active parts are played by ‚ÄúThe Project Room‚Äù, where artists present new and experimental projects, and the ‚ÄúOpen Studio‚Äù, which has been initiated in 2011. Here individual artist creates a single work during a limited period, showing the creative process as well as the end result at the end of the period. As an indicator of successes of the center suffice it to state that while in 1992-1994 period it started with one group exhibition per year, during 2001 through 2010 period the number of individual and group exhibitions have fluctuated between 10 and 20 per year. During the last decade parallel with exhibitions the center has organized two international festivals of experimental theater and video (short and feature films) per year. In appreciation of cultural services provided to the Armenian contemporary art in early 2002, Government of Republic of Armenia issued a decree by which the space occupied by ACCEA/NPAK was provided to it for indefinite period free of charge. In 2003 by sponsorship of late writer and architect Rouben H. Avanessian (Pen- name: R. Ben) ACCEA/NPAK initiated erection of quadruple-scale bronze cast of forefather of Armenian Contemporary art Yervand Kotchar‚Äôs ‚ÄúMelancholy‚Äù sculpture in Yerevan, in front of the entrance of the center. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in social and cultural life of the Capital of Armenia. Educational activities On the informal level of education ACCEA/NPAK as a rule always publishes booklets and sometimes extensive catalogues for exhibitions, which contain texts by curators describing the conceptual basis and arguments leading to organization of events and exhibitions. Sometimes the publications include artist‚Äôs statement. The body of these publications form an informal public education initiative for introducing and promoting contemporary concepts of art. ACCEA/NPAK is in the process of initiating Independent Study Program (ISP) based on the model of New York‚Äôs Whitney Museum ISP, where newly graduated artists get opportunity to meet experienced masters in the arts and culture and enrich their insight and global appreciation of art.

Mountain and hill ranges  The uplands include several mountain and hill ranges that are commonly referred to as the Sauerland: * Rothaar Mountains (Langenberg, 843 m) * Saalhausen Hills (Himberg, 688 m) * Ebbe Mountains (Nordhelle, 663 m) * Lenne Mountains (Homert, 656 m) * Plackwald (582 m) In listing these ranges the Bergisches Land with its 519 m high peak of Homert (Oberbergischer Kreis) is often counted. However these are foothills of the Ebbe Mountains, whilst the historic Bergisches Land lies on the slopes of the S√ºder Uplands as they gradually descend to the Rhine. In a similar way the highest elevations of the historic Siegerland (such as the 678 m high Riemen) are not in the natural region of Siegerland (see major landscape units), but in the Rothaar Mountains. And the 633-metre-high Alte Burg lies geographically in the Siegerland, but is not the highest elevation of an independent ridge. Rather, it is part of the Siegerland Rothaar Foothills (Siegerl√§nder Rothaar- Vorh√∂hen), which form the western slopes of the Rothaar Mountains.

Life In 1712, Simon Butler, with his good friend Simon Mathews, immigrated from Wales to Pennsylvania. They landed in Philadelphia and lived for a time in New Castle County.[The History of Bucks County(1905) by William W.H. Davis] In 1720, he purchased 176 acres of land that included much of the then-standing \\"Village of Chalfont\\" from a former land grant founded by William Penn. In 1730, he finished construction of his house and mill and then purchased over 400 more acres of land in 1745 including much of present-day Chalfont and New Britain. During this time, Butler built a number of gristmills on the sites of original mills, such as the Funk sawmill and the Shellenberger's mill. He then acted as the sole justice of the peace in the county, and until his death he was the economic and legal power in the area. Among other important duties he wrote wills and was well known for his extremely sound judgement. He was also a devout Baptist and helped construct one of the first Baptist churches in the area, the New Britain Baptist Church. After his death in August 1764, his land was parceled to many people, most notably George Kungle, who opened a public house in the 1760s.Chalfont History ‚Äì Chalfont Borough Simon Butler Elementary School Butler lives in local memory through the lending of his name to Butler Pike, laid out in 1712 and the local Butler Elementary School.

Background  After previously advancing rapidly along the coast of the Gulf of Sidra in a previous offensive, the rebels were quickly pushed back. They had initially advanced from Ajdabiya to just from Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte. However, they were rolled back in a government counter-offensive and by 30 March, were back to their starting positions at Ajdabiya with Brega being retaken by the loyalists that night. The battle 31 March - In the morning, rebels counter-attacked Brega in an attempt to push out government forces. The first attack lasted only five minutes before the rebels were in a new retreat following a heavy artillery attack on their positions. By late afternoon, coalition forces had bombed the Libyan army near Brega. Trying to use the air-cover provided by the coalition, the rebels attempted a new attack and managed to break into Brega. Street fighting started with gun battles between government forces and rebels throughout the town. By the end of the day, after heavy fighting, government forces had repelled the rebel counter-attack and were in control of Brega. 1 April - The rebels moved more experienced fighters and heavier weapons to the frontline, though the fighting force was still significantly under-armed and undertrained. In the evening, a coalition air-strike hit a rebel convoy advancing on Brega from Ajdabiya, killing 14 fighters. Also, the loyalist troops successfully ambushed rebels who entered Brega's university complex, where a large number of loyalists were positioned, and the rebels withdrew having lost several men. 2 April - In the early morning, rebels managed to break through the eastern gate of the city. They took control of most of the city before loyalist artillery hit them. By mid-afternoon rebels had retreated from the town and were regrouping at a checkpoint to the east. Later on, the rebels managed once again to enter the town. However, a large number of loyalists were holed up at the university and the rebels were still not able to get into the city center. 3 April - During the morning, the rebels tried to take the university campus and attack the industrial area only to be ambushed. They also came up on roadside mines. The operation led to the bulk of rebel forces retreating 30 to 35 kilometres from the town. Some of the better trained rebels continued fighting on Brega's outskirts locked in skirmishes and artillery duels with loyalist forces in the town. By the end of the day, the battle had come down to a stalemate with the rebels waiting on the road east of the city for more NATO air-strikes on loyalist positions in Brega. However, the few strikes that happened had little to no impact on the situation. According to witnesses, a truck of armed \\"western\\" men had arrived at the front line in Brega on the rebels side, raising the possibility that the coalition may be beginning to send in military advisors. The bulk of loyalist forces was reported to be centered around Brega's university campus, about a mile from the old town, and reluctant to engage the rebels due to exposure to air-strikes. They were instead digging in and acting as Brega's outer defense line, not allowing rebels into the town itself. 4 April - On 4 April, the rebels attempted another push and managed to capture the so-called New Brega, a housing district about from the old town. However, the loyalists still controlled the university and the old town which contains the seaport and industrial districts with the oil refinery. Fighting continued around the university with rebel forces advancing to within before bombardment from loyalist artillery positioned in Old Brega forced them to retreat once again. Rebels returned later and re-engaged in fighting with two fronts forming - one at the university and one at Brega's industrial complex. Rebels were able to hold on in New Brega district. However, even there, there was still ongoing fighting, with rebels trying to clear out any remaining loyalists. An opposition commander believed that there were 50 carloads worth of Gaddafi's forces still in Brega. By evening, the rebels were in control of New Brega. Loyalist forces were still positioned at the university and in Old Brega. Residents of New Brega began an evacuation.\\"Libyan Rebels Gaining Ground in Brega\\". United Press International.\\"Libyan Forces Push Back into Oil Town of Brega, Say Greater Organization Bolsters Advance\\". Canadian Business. 5 April - The next day, after a night of fighting, rebels were pushed from inside the town to the outskirts. While the rebels were resting, loyalists used the night cover to take up positions and ambush the rebels in the morning while they were preparing to re-take their frontline positions. The rebels retreated some from the eastern edge of town to re-assemble and prepare for further fighting. While they were regrouping, an eight-vehicle loyalist convoy, approached the rebel's positions. It was hit by air-strikes destroying two vehicles while the rest turned back. An Agence France-Presse reporter and others confirmed there were no bodies found on the site of the air strike. At that point, while the opposition forces were cheered up by the air-strike, loyalist artillery started firing on the rebels which had led them to pull back from Brega in a panicked long retreat east towards Ajdabiya. In the afternoon, the rebel Saaiqa 36 Battalion fired Grad rockets at loyalists taking positions in the small village of al-Arbaeen, halfway between Brega and Ajdabiya. During the exchange, four loyalist artillery shells hit a concentration of rebels causing a number of casualties. Later, both an NTC spokesman and Al Jazeera confirmed that following the early-morning artillery-backed counter-attack, loyalist troops had secured the whole of Brega. The next day, a BBC correspondent stated that heavy and accurate shelling from government troops had pushed most of the disorganised and poorly equipped rebel army back to the fringes of Ajdabiya. 6 April - In a continuation of the seesaw battle, rebels regained the outpost of al-Arbaeen, and amassed at the outskirts of Brega in preparation of another attack.\\"Libya Live Blog - April 6\\". Al Jazeera. CNN reported that the rebels managed to re-take 10 out of 40 kilometres of road between Brega and Ajdabiya they lost the previous day to the loyalists. 7 April - During the night, the rebels brought 17 tanks to the frontline east of Brega. However, in the morning, what appeared to be NATO air-strikes hit rebel positions and destroyed three of them, killing between 10 and 13 rebels and wounding between 14 and 22. Five tanks were also damaged. Following the air- strikes, government troops started an artillery attack on the rebels. This led to another retreat away from Brega. Later during the day, rebels speculated that the air-strikes may have come from one of Gaddafi's fighter jets small enough to not be picked up on radar.\\"April 7th Updates\\". libyafeb17.com. The NTC stated it believed that the cause of the attack was due to Gaddafi's planes evading the no-fly zone. Following the attacks, loyalists chased the rebels to Ajdabiya, and both civilians and some rebels were on the verge of retreating from the city amid rumours Gaddafi's forces were preparing for an attack. By nightfall, Gaddafi's forces advanced to within of Ajdabiya and were in range to conduct rocket attacks on the city.  Aftermath By 8 April, most civilians had left Ajdabiya, but rebels regrouped in Ajdabiya which was still in rebel hands, after their forces fled in panic to several different directions near Ajdabiya. NATO acknowledged that it was responsible for the air-strikes on the rebel tanks, but refused to apologise for attack because they \\"had not been aware that the rebels were now using tanks\\". During the day, pro-Gaddafi forces used the panic that the NATO air-strike caused to move within 17 to 19 kilometres (11 to 12 miles) from Ajdabiya, putting them once again at its gates, less than two weeks after previously retreating from the town. By the next day, the battle for the city had already started.

It originally aired on NBC on April 14, 2011. The episode was written by Daniel Chun and directed by Paul Lieberstein. This episode marks the first appearance of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) in the series. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) replacement appears in the office, to start receiving training from Michael. The new manager, Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell), has everyone hoping to make good first impressions: Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) finds himself awkwardly typecast while Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) worry that they've come on too strong. Only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is apathetic about the new leader. \\"Training Day\\" received mixed reviews from television critics, with many commenting on Ferrell's appearance. The episode was also viewed by 4.16 million viewers and received a 4.0/11 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking first in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is waiting in a hotel bar for his replacement Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to show up. While waiting, he meets a man at the bar and the two instantly hit it off. When Michael calls Vickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually Deangelo, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this. Deangelo comes to the branch the next day, and most of the staff is eager to make a good first impression. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) wears his toupee, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) believe they have started off well by mentioning their baby, and Deangelo designates Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) as the office \\"funny guy\\" when he reveals that he carries name tags around to avoid situations like the one Deangelo and Michael were in. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Though Deangelo's introduction goes smoothly, Michael becomes disturbed when Deangelo wants to make some changes, such as how Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) answers the phone. While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \\"this is my life now\\". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \\"multipurpose room\\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room. In another effort to impress Deangelo, Jim and Pam bring in Cece, to which Deangelo reacts positively. While they celebrate getting back on his good side, Deangelo reveals to the camera that he is in fact indifferent to Cece and was just being polite. Production \\"Training Day\\" marked Will Ferrell's first of four appearances on The Office. The episode was written by co- executive producer Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four- episode arc on the series and is also one of series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, \\"The Inner Circle\\", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because \\"I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I just thought it was time for my character to go\\". Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell's last season, because he is \\"a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell‚Äôs swan song\\". He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the 2004 film, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include a sequence in which Michael and Deangelo discuss cancer jokes and the 2010 film Megamind‚Äîan animated film that featured the voice of Ferrell‚Äîwhile drinking vodka, shots of Michael and Deangelo discussing their enjoyment for coffee, and Dwight attempting to appease his new boss. Reception=Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Training Day\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.871 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.0% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Garage Sale\\", which can be attributed to Ferrell's guest appearance. The episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating the Fox crime drama Bones, which scored a 3.5/10 percent relating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic; a rerun of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy and a rerun of the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. =Reviews= \\"Training Day\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo was not given a proper introduction and that he was not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that \\"it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know what to do with them anymore\\". However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season's improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised Michael's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo, calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone \\"quite effective\\", and that Dwight's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael's replacement made it more \\"meaningful\\". Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not \\"sophisticated\\" enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look \\"stupid\\" for \\"cheap humor\\" and a \\"enormously shallow laughter\\". He ultimately gave the episode a \\"C+\\". Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between Ferrell and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael \\"being petulant about not being the center of attention every minute of every day\\", negatively comparing it to \\"Viewing Party\\". Despite this, he noted that Ferrell's presence did involve several funny moments. Bonnie Stiernberg, for Paste, was more positive, writing that she preferred the use of comedy, following the emotional episode, \\"Garage Sale\\". She ultimately gave it an 8.7 out of 10. Will Ferrell's performance was especially noted by critics. McNutt complimented Ferrell's \\"nuanced\\" performance, but called his character \\"uninteresting\\". Stiernberg praised his dynamic with Carell, comparing it to their previous roles in Anchorman. His later appearances in the series also received similar mixed reviews For instance, McNutt called Ferrell's scenes a \\"momentum killer\\" in \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", whereas Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called his performance in the same episode \\"pure magic\\".

The concept was first proposed in January, 2011 for long-duration (1 to 24 months) exo-atmospheric space journeys for a six-person crew. In order to limit the effects of microgravity on human health, the spacecraft would be equipped with a centrifuge. The design was intended to be relatively inexpensive by crewed spaceflight standards, as it was projected to only cost US$3.7 billion. In addition, it was suggested that it might only need 64 months of work.  Objectives  The original goal of Nautilus-X was to be a stopover to long-term missions for the Moon or Mars. To ease route planning of the whole mission, the station would be placed at the Lagrange point L1 or L2 of the Moon or Mars, depending on which location is to be visited. It would also have served as an emergency station and hospital for current mission crews. Other objectives included: * Self-sustained for long- duration missions with crews as large as 6. * Support crewed landing missions. * Satisfy requirements of NASA Authorization Act of 2010.  Description = Design = Nautilus-X Main module dimensions The proposal notionally included a main corridor, a rotating habitable centrifuge, inflatable modules for logistical stores and crew use, solar power arrays, and a reconfigurable thrust structure. The design was modular, enabling it to accommodate any of a number of mission specific propulsion modules, manipulator arms, docking port for an Orion or commercial crew capsule, and landing craft for destination worlds. In theory the engines and fuel could be swapped out depending on the mission. The proposal also had an industrial slide-out airlock unit and a command, control and observation deck. On the other end of the docking port would have been the spacecraft's centrifuge equipped with an external dynamic ring-flywheel. Behind the centrifuge would be water and slush hydrogen tanks, which could mitigate the dangers of cosmic radiation for the crew, to a certain degree. In the aft of the craft are the communication and propulsion systems. The standard version of Nautilus-X had only three inflatable modules. The Extended Duration Explorer variant on the Nautilus-X design concept would have several more, plus docking bays for science payloads and away-mission vehicles. Nautilus-X Extended duration explorer Nautilus-X Extended duration explorer - frontview = Technologies = Nautilus-X ISS demonstrator In order to deploy this massive spacecraft as easily as possible, it would consist of a variety of rigid and inflatable modules and solar dynamic arrays. The expandable modules are based on the technology used by the inflatable living quarters proposed by Bigelow Aerospace, which has continued the development of inflatable modules initially designed and developed by NASA. = Attributes = * Robust Environmental Control and Life Support and communication suite * Large storage volumes (for food, mechanical parts or medical supplies) * Real- time visual command and observe capability for crew * Low crew irradiation * Semi-autonomous integration of multiple mission specific propulsion units  Status as of 2011  The Nautilus-X design concept did not advance beyond the initial drawings and proposal. = ISS centrifuge demonstration = In order to assess and characterize influences and effects of the centrifuge relative to human reactions, mechanical dynamic responses and influences, the demonstration of a similar centrifuge first would be tested on the ISS. If produced, this centrifuge would have been the first in-space demonstration of sufficient scale for artificial partial-g effects. The demonstrator would be sent using a single Delta IV or Atlas V launcher. The full cost of such a demonstrator would be between US$83 million and US$143 million.

She was a founder of the peasant Saint Soleil art movement. Saint Fleurant's paintings often depict maternal scenes of females, children, trees, wildlife, and Haitian Vodou Loas. Her folk painting style is often colorful and vibrant and expresses a distinct female perspective on the Saint Soleil movement and Haitian Vodou art. Biography Louisiane Saint Fleurant was born on 11 September 1924, in Petit-Trou-de-Nippes, Haiti. She was not formally trained in art and began painting only in her late 40s. In her fifties, Louisiane Saint Fleurant took a job as a cook for the Saint Soleil Group when she came to Soissons La Montagne. Here, she was discovered painting small pictures in her room by her employer, Maude Robbart. Along with Prospere Pierre-Louis, Dieuseul Paul, Denis Smith, and Levoy Exil, she formed the renowned Cinq Soleil (Five Suns) art movement. The Five Suns group formed out of the Saint Soleil movement, of which Saint Fleurant was the oldest and only female artist. In 1974, she joined Poisson Soleil, initiated by Tiga and Maude Guerdes Robart, in an inaugural exhibition at the Museum of Haitian Art. Saint Fleurant was originally introduced to the Saint Soleil art community as a peasant cook and after receiving some direction from Jean-Claude Garoute, she started her practice in painting and sculpture. In 1965 she moved to Petion-Ville where she had a tiny shop of her own selling her work and that of her two sons, Ramphis and the late Stivenson Magloire. Aliciane Magloire (ceramic potter) and Magda Magloire (painter) were two of her daughters (she had a fifth child of which little information is unknown). Saint Fleurant painted and sculpted for 30 years until the age of 80 when poor vision precluded her ability to continue in 2002. Saint Fleurant died in her home on 1 June 2005. A second tragedy hit her family when the cemetery where she was buried was bulldozed following the 2010 Haiti earthquake to allow a bus station to be built. Her work has been exhibited in Asia, Europe, and the United States and has recently been part of fundraising, relief, and awareness efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. March 2007 the French Institute of Haiti paid her a posthumous tribute. Saint Fleurant's folk paintings are well regarded by collectors for their unique manifestations of motherhood and her female perspective on Haitian and Vodou folk art. Characteristic of her paintings are flat pictures with a lack of linear perspective typically in crowded spaces. Women, children, houses, birds and animals are her preferred topics. She also sold her ceramic sculptures that showed her since of humor for example putting bird heads on human bodies.

The Klee‚ÄìMinty cube or Klee‚ÄìMinty polytope (named after Victor Klee and ) is a unit hypercube of variable dimension whose corners have been perturbed. Klee and Minty demonstrated that George Dantzig's simplex algorithm has poor worst-case performance when initialized at one corner of their \\"squashed cube\\". On the three-dimensional version, the simplex algorithm and the criss-cross algorithm visit all 8 corners in the worst case. In particular, many optimization algorithms for linear optimization exhibit poor performance when applied to the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube. In 1973 Klee and Minty showed that Dantzig's simplex algorithm was not a polynomial-time algorithm when applied to their cube. Later, modifications of the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube have shown poor behavior both for other basis-exchange pivoting algorithms and also for interior-point algorithms .  Description of the cube  The Klee‚ÄìMinty cube was originally specified with a parameterized system of linear inequalities, with the dimension as the parameter. When the dimension is two, the \\"cube\\" is a squashed square. When the dimension is three, the \\"cube\\" is a squashed cube. Illustrations of the \\"cube\\" have appeared besides algebraic descriptions. The Klee‚ÄìMinty polytope is given byGreenberg, Harvey J., Klee-Minty Polytope Shows Exponential Time Complexity of Simplex Method University of Colorado at Denver (1997) PDF download : \\\\begin{align} x_1\\\\le 5\\\\\\\\\\\\ 4x_1+x_2 \\\\le 25\\\\\\\\\\\\ 8x_1+4x_2+x_3 \\\\le 125 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2^Dx_1+2^{D-1}x_2+ \\\\dots +4x_{D-1}+x_D \\\\le 5^D \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1\\\\ge0, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\dots , \\\\, \\\\, x_D \\\\ge0. \\\\end{align} This has D variables, D constraints other than the D non-negativity constraints, and 2D vertices, just as a D-dimensional hypercube does. If the objective function to be maximized is :2^{D-1}x_1+2^{D-2}x_2+ \\\\dots + 2x_{D-1}+x_D, and if the initial vertex for the simplex algorithm is the origin, then the algorithm as formulated by Dantzig visits all 2D vertices, finally reaching the optimal vertex (0, 0, \\\\dots , 5^D).  Computational complexity  The Klee‚ÄìMinty cube has been used to analyze the performance of many algorithms, both in the worst case and on average. The time complexity of an algorithm counts the number of arithmetic operations sufficient for the algorithm to solve the problem. For example, Gaussian elimination requires on the order of D3 operations, and so it is said to have polynomial time-complexity, because its complexity is bounded by a cubic polynomial. There are examples of algorithms that do not have polynomial-time complexity. For example, a generalization of Gaussian elimination called Buchberger's algorithm has for its complexity an exponential function of the problem data (the degree of the polynomials and the number of variables of the multivariate polynomials). Because exponential functions eventually grow much faster than polynomial functions, an exponential complexity implies that an algorithm has slow performance on large problems. = Worst case = An illustration of a three-dimensional polytope which is the feasible region for a linear programming problem. The simplex algorithm traverses the edges between vertices until it reaches an optimal vertex. In the case shown, the simplex algorithm takes five steps. However, the simplex algorithm visits every vertex in the worst case of a problem whose feasible region is the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube, so the number of steps rises exponentially with the dimension of the problem. In mathematical optimization, the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube is an example that shows the worst-case computational complexity of many algorithms of linear optimization. It is a deformed cube with exactly 2D corners in dimension D. Klee and Minty showed that Dantzig's simplex algorithm visits all corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension D in the worst case. Modifications of the Klee‚ÄìMinty construction showed similar exponential time complexity for other pivoting rules of simplex type, which maintain primal feasibility, such as Bland's rule. describes Bland's rule. describes the worst-case complexity of Bland's rule. Another modification showed that the criss-cross algorithm, which does not maintain primal feasibility, also visits all the corners of a modified Klee‚ÄìMinty cube. Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits all 8 corners of the three-dimensional cube in the worst case.  Path-following algorithms  Further modifications of the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube have shown poor performance of central-path‚Äìfollowing algorithms for linear optimization, in that the central path comes arbitrarily close to each of the corners of a cube. This \\"vertex- stalking\\" performance is surprising, because such path-following algorithms have polynomial-time complexity for linear optimization. = Average case = The Klee‚ÄìMinty cube has also inspired research on average-case complexity. When eligible pivots are made randomly (and not by the rule of steepest descent), Dantzig's simplex algorithm needs on average quadratically many steps (on the order of O(D2). Standard variants of the simplex algorithm takes on average D steps for a cube.More generally, for the simplex algorithm, the expected number of steps is proportional to D for linear-programming problems that are randomly drawn from the Euclidean unit sphere, as proved by Borgwardt and by Smale. : When it is initialized at a random corner of the cube, the criss-cross algorithm visits only D additional corners, however, according to a 1994 paper by Fukuda and Namiki. Both the simplex algorithm and the criss-cross algorithm visit exactly 3 additional corners of the three-dimensional cube on average.

He taught Mathematics for two years at what is now the Nicolae BƒÉlcescu National College in BrƒÉila, rising to director in that time. He moved on to B√¢rlad's Gheorghe Ro»ôca Codreanu National College in 1868, remaining there until his retirement in 1898.

An issue of interest to him was that of school textbooks, and in 1872, he authored the first Romanian-language high school arithmetic textbook, which went through four printings. He commanded a battalion during the Romanian War of Independence, becoming an officer of the Order of the Crown in 1882 for his deeds. In 1909, he was raised to grand cross of that order for his educational activities. He established a private fund for the direct aid of the most promising pupils at his B√¢rlad school; this operated from 1906 to 1916; among the beneficiaries was ≈ûtefan Procopiu. He donated the building for what is now B√¢rlad's Stroe Belloescu Library, as well as schools for the peasant children of Trestiana and Grivi≈£a, and a church for the latter village. Also there, in the schoolyard, in 1912, he financed the first bust of Alexandru Ioan Cuza in Romania. The school in Ple≈üa was donated by him as well, and named after him. Together with his coachman, he was suffocated to death during a robbery in his home. He left a widow, Raluca.  Death  Having the utmost respect to him, the citizens honored him with the confidence to represent them within the committees and societies and even in the Parliament of the Country as a senator. For the citizen services, he received the \\"Crown of Romania\\" in the degree of \\"Great Cross\\", one of the greatest distinctions of the time. On October 20, 1912, Stroe S.

The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.Hangers, 1803, p. 99 At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The \\"Perfect Merchant\\" or \\"Perfect Dealer\\" was a man of culture motivated to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business.

The kilderkin is still currently used. It is the unit of choice of CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale, for calculating beer quantities for beer festivals in the UK. Ales are usually delivered in firkins, cider and other drinks are usually in boxes, bottles or other containers measured in gallons or litres, and all (except wine) are sold in pints or parts thereof. For CAMRA internal accounting, all are calculated in kilderkins. A kilderkin is a 144 pint container but there is not 144 pints of cask conditioned consumable beer in a kilderkin (see Firkins below for explanation). =Firkin= The ale or beer firkin (from Middle Dutch meaning \\"fourth\\") is a quarter of an ale or beer barrel or half a kilderkin. This unit is much smaller than the wine firkin. Casks in this size (themselves called firkins) are the most common container for cask ale. :;firkin (Ale) :From the mid 15th century until 1688 the ale firkin was defined as 8 ale or beer gallons (36.97 litres).

It is therefore exactly or approximately . Most English cask conditioned beer bought by publicans is delivered in 72 pint containers (i.e. Firkin) but the volume of consumable beer in the container is far lower. For example a 72 pint container of Greene King IPA currently only has 66 \\"full\\" pints of consumable beer that can be sold or drunk, the other 6 pints are sediment, finings, beer stone, hops, proteins or less than a imperial measure and therefore not consumable or saleable. HMRC does not charge duty on any portion of beer that cannot be consumed, brewers should make a declaration to the first customer (i.e. publican) to inform them what are the actual duty paid contents of the beer so customers are fully aware of how much is being sold to them.https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/beer- manual/beer3430 =Pin (Imperial)= A pin is equal to half a firkin (). Plastic versions of these casks are known as \\"polypins\\" and are popular in homebrewing and the off-trade (deliveries for home consumption). They are also popular at beer festivals where non-standard beers are sold. =Gallon= Originally the 282-cubic-inch ale or beer gallon was used.

It was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by series producer Don Scardino. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 4, 2010. Elizabeth Banks and Buck Henry guest star in this episode, and there are cameo appearances by Ann Curry, Lester Holt, and Meredith Vieira. In the episode, Avery Jessup (Banks) becomes suspicious of the relationship her fianc√© Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) has with his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), so she orders Jack to set boundaries in their friendship. This proves a problem for Liz when her father, Dick Lemon (Henry) arrives in town on a break from his marriage. Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is upset when he discovers that his pre-recorded NBC obituary shows him to have done nothing worthwhile in his life, and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that she doesn't have an obituary so decides to make a video of her own. The episode received generally good reviews from television critics, especially in regard to guest star Buck Henry. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\" was watched by 5.311 million viewers during its original broadcast and received a 2.4 rating/7 share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Plot Elizabeth Banks guest starred in \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\" as Avery Jessup, who points out the strange nature of Liz and Jack's relationship Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are trying to decide what to name their soon-to-be-born-daughter. However, when Avery suggests naming the baby Charlotte, Jack declines, saying that his employee and mentee Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) knew somebody called Charlotte in middle school and did not like her. This annoys Avery, who is concerned about the nature of Jack's relationship with Liz and tells him that he needs to put some boundaries in place. Despite Jack's argument that Liz is his mentee and that he does not choose such people lightly, Avery demands that he starts treating Liz like his other employees. Despite this, Liz finds she cannot resist calling Jack for advice and pretends to be German when Avery answers Jack's phone. Meanwhile, Liz has her own problems when her father, Dick Lemon (Buck Henry) calls her to say that he is coming to visit her in New York, but will not be bringing his wife and Liz's mother, Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette), with him. When he shows up at her apartment, he reveals that he and her mother are on a break. Liz, however, believes that he is just pretending that there are problems with his marriage and that he is actually in town for a \\"gentleman's intermission\\", so she refuses to let him stay with her. Unfortunately, her attempts to turn to Jack for help are thwarted by Avery, who is insistent that she work out her own problems instead of always coming to Jack. At the 30 Rock studios, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is shocked when he discovers a group of editors putting together an obituary for actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan). However, he is calmed when they inform him that it is simply a routine procedure that NBC carries out for some of its more famous stars. Kenneth decides to show the obituary to Tracy himself, who, far from being pleased, laments the way that his legacy looks on television and declares that he does not want to be remembered the way he is. TGS co-star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) finds out about Tracy's obituary and is upset that one has not been made for her, so she decides to record one herself. It transpires that both Liz and Jack have trouble functioning properly without each other‚ÄîLiz is used to Jack helping her to deal with her personal life and work problems and struggles to cope on her own, whilst Jack finds that there is a void in his life without his mentee, and attempts to find somebody else to take Liz's place. Ultimately, after trying out his assistant Jonathan, Tracy, Jenna and Avery herself, Jack realizes that only Liz can be his mentee. Eventually, Avery realizes that there is nothing untoward about Jack's friendship with Liz and reunites the pair, saying that they both need the relationship. Jack is able to quickly sort out Liz's problem with her father, by calling him and pretending to be the angry boyfriend of one of the women he has picked up while in town. Meanwhile, Tracy formulates a plan to make his legacy better‚Äîa masked Kenneth will pretend to attack a cat with a hammer, at which point Tracy will come to the rescue with a katana. However, this plan goes wrong when Tracy hears that his film Hard To Watch is likely to win him an Oscar and becomes distracted, partially because of the news, and partially because he suddenly remembers that he left his son in Atlantic City. Instead, Jenna unwittingly ends up saving the cat and taking all the credit, managing to improve her own legacy after all. Production Ann Curry appeared in the episode, announcing that Tracy Jordan's film Hard To Watch would likely win an Oscar \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\" was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by series producer Don Scardino. This was Riggi's ninth writing credit, and Scardino's twenty-ninth helmed episode. \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\" originally aired in the United States on November 4, 2010, on NBC as the sixth episode of the show's fifth season and the 86th overall episode of the series.

The unusual friendship between the pair has been a focus of much fan speculation, however Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, had previously promised fans that she would never put them together, commenting: \\"They're never going to do it [...] I just think it's lazy, when you get to season five or season six [of a TV show] and everyone just starts doing it\\". Alec Baldwin, who plays Jack Donaghy, was asked if the two characters will ever hook-up, he responded \\"I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work.\\" Actor/screenwriter Buck Henry made his second appearance as Dick Lemon, Liz's father. Henry played the role in the December 13, 2007, episode \\"Ludachristmas\\" which aired during the show's second season. This episode of 30 Rock featured cameo appearances from The Today Show correspondents Ann Curry, Meredith Vieira, and Lester Holt. \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\" was Vieira's fifth guest appearance as herself, having appeared in the episodes \\"Greenzo\\", \\"Larry King\\", \\"The Bubble\\", and \\"Floyd\\". This was Holt's fourth cameo on the show. In \\"Gentleman's Intermission\\", Tracy Jordan sees his eulogy with Holt reporting it. Holt appeared in the episodes \\"Cleveland\\", \\"Hiatus\\", and \\"Floyd\\". Curry reports that Tracy's movie Hard To Watch, a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto, is garnering Oscar buzz which makes Tracy happy. This was Curry's first appearance on 30 Rock. In addition, Tracy's fictitious film Hard To Watch was mentioned during this episode. The film originally appeared as part of the plot in the fourth season episode \\"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\\". Cultural references In one scene from the episode, Tracy tells Kenneth that when he dies he does not want to be known as an idiot millionaire. After saying this, Jenna enters Tracy's dressing room and asks if Mark Cuban is the idiot millionaire they are talking about and says that Cuban tried to run her over with a jet ski. Cuban is an entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, an NBA team. Later, Jenna says that she played Arts and Literature in the film version of Trivial Pursuit. The latter is a board game in which progress is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. In an earlier scene, Kenneth leads a tour into the editing suite and sees an obituary for Tracy on TV. Believing Tracy dead, he drops to his knees and loudly shouts, \\"I'm not done with him, Jacob! He stays on this side!\\" This is a reference to the Lost character of the same name. In another scene, Kenneth mentions that Tracy had starred in a production of Henry IV in Central Park, playing Prince Hal. However, he simply forgot all of his lines, loudly shouting \\"I don't know any of my lines!\\". When Liz is in disguise while talking to her father at the bar, she introduces herself as Dorothy Michaels, a reference to Dustin Hoffman's character in Tootsie. Reception In its original American broadcast, this episode of 30 Rock drew in 5.311 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The show claimed a 2.4/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The figure was an increase over the previous episode, \\"Reaganing\\", which was seen by 5.182 million American viewers. Juli Weiner for Vanity Fair wrote \\"This may have been our favorite episode of the season so far!\\" Weiner said that the main plot \\"didn't quite track.\\" Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline wrote that the episode was a strange one in the 30 Rock world \\"but the emotional component that actually makes us care about the status quo being threatened worked as planned. The uncle/niece-mentor/prot√©g√© bond between Jack and Liz was restored with minimal sentimentality, but the emotional weight was palpable between the two.\\" The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin was complimentary towards Buck Henry's role as Liz's father. \\"It helps that the two look like they could conceivably be products of the same sturdy/nerdy Midwestern gene pool, but iconically, it makes all the sense in the world.\\" He was also very positive toward the episode, commenting that it \\"[had] the emotional component that separates a merely good 30 Rock episode from a pretty great one [...] and Liz and Jack's strange father/daughter mentor/prot√©g√© bond was reaffirmed with zero sentimentality but plenty of well-earned emotional resonance.\\" Den of Geek writer Ian McDonald described Henry as \\"hilarity personified\\". He also went on to praise Jane Krakowski, commenting that \\"[she] certainly nails the insane act pitch-perfectly. It's kind of frightening how believably insane she can appear\\". Meredith Blake for the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"Pop culture would have us believe that most male-female friendships are destined to turn into romance by Season 5. Jack and Liz are the rare exception. Not only have they never 'gone there,' the very idea of anything other that a friendship seems, well, gross. They represent that rare thing in TV land: A completely platonic friendship between two heterosexual people.\\" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix wrote that the Tracy/Kenneth/Jenna obituary subplot was \\"more hit-and-miss\\". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun wrote that the Tracy and Jenna plots were \\"slightly less believable\\". Bob Sassone of TV Squad opined in his recap that the Jack and Avery characters will not last as Elizabeth Banks \\"is too busy to be on a sitcom every week, so you know that Jack and Avery are going to separate at some point.\\" Sassone also added that the pregnancy story \\"complicates the plot a bit, so maybe she will stay on in some way.\\" Sassone was positive towards Tracy's obituary story but disliked \\"Liz's dad getting tired of his 45-year marriage and wanting to go to clubs.\\" He explained that Henry returning as Tina Fey's father and doing this plot \\"was, well, unnecessary.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2010 American television episodes 30 Rock (season 5) episodes ","title":"Gentleman's Intermission"},{"id":"31302721","text":"Aylestone School (previously Aylestone Business and Enterprise College) is a co-educational high school in Herefordshire, England, founded in 1976.

The trolleybuses operated by Derby Corporation led to the last Derby tram being eventually withdrawn from regular routes at the end of June with a special last journey on 2 July 1934. By the standards of the various, now defunct, trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, the Derby system was a medium-sized one, with a total of 11 routes, and a maximum fleet of 73 trolleybuses. The system was much cheaper to run than motorbuses but the end was signalled when proposed extensions to the network were blocked by protest to the additional poles and cabling that would be required. The system was closed on . map of trolleybus routes from late 1950s There were over the years 165 Derby trolleybuses although this figure includes six that were second-hand.

It was directed by the show's composer and producer (and Tina Fey's husband) Jeff Richmond, and written by Josh Siegal & Dylan Morgan. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 24, 2011. Guest stars include Ken Howard, Aaron Sorkin and Will Arnett. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) discovers that without Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), NBC is putting TGS on a forced hiatus. However, when she passes on the news to the cast and crew, they all assume that the show will be cancelled and turn to their backup plans, leading Liz to wonder about her own. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is forced to hire his nemesis Devon Banks in order to turn around his disastrous acquisition of TWINKS, a network for gay men. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Plan B\\" was watched by 4.359 million viewers during its original broadcast and received a 1.9 rating/5 share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) calls Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to his office to inform her that while its primary star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is in Africa, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) will have to be placed on a forced hiatus. Initially, Liz herself is optimistic and believes that Jack will be doing all that he can to save the show. However, when her cast and crew hear the news, they quickly scramble to find other employment. Concerned, Liz decides to contact her agent Simon (Josh Fadem) to see if he can get her other work. Jack gets Liz an interview with Nick Lachey for a writing job in The Sing-Off, where she meets Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin, in a walk and talk sequence, advises Liz that writing is a dying art, and then starts sucking up to Lachey himself. Ultimately, Liz doesn't get the writing job, and is forced to try and save TGS, which even Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) has lost all hope of rescuing. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy has recently acquired a television network for gay men (TWINKS) which has turned out to be a ratings disaster. Kabletown boss Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) is unhappy with TWINKS and advises Jack to find a gay version of himself (to run the network) or drop the network altogether. At that point, Jack realizes that there is a gay version of himself, and calls upon his old nemesis Devon Banks for help. As it turns out, Banks has fallen from grace and is living in Brooklyn with his partner and three \\"gaybies\\". Eventually, Liz's attempts to save TGS are met with a slight possibility of succeeding when Kenneth informs her that during his webcam talks with Tracy he sometimes orders pizza from the same restaurant as she does. Liz immediately realizes that Tracy never left New York City. Jack's plans for reviving TWINKS backfire when Devon Banks brings one of his \\"gaybies\\" to work and Hank Hooper, a family man himself, promotes him. However, Devon has an epiphany and realizes that he loves his children too much to leave them for Kabletown, turning down Hooper's offer in the process. Whilst victorious, Jack realizes that he hasn't been spending enough time with his own baby daughter. Reception Aaron Sorkin's appearance in \\"Plan B\\" as himself was particularly appreciated by critics According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.359 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 1.9 rating/5 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The figure was an improvement on the previous episode, Queen of Jordan, which was seen by 4.192 million households. Caitlan Smith of The Atlantic particularly praised the appearance of Aaron Sorkin, calling it \\"one of the most unexpected and excellent cameos this year\\". Dan Forcella of TVFanatic also praised Sorkin's appearance, as well as that of Ken Howard, whom he described as \\"a joy to watch on screen\\". However, he criticised the primary storyline, commenting that \\"Liz acting frantic is never really that funny\\".

She founded the former haute couture fashion house \\"Gr√®s\\" as well as the associated perfume house \\"Parfums Gr√®s\\" which still exists today in Switzerland. Remembered as the \\"Sphinx of Fashion\\", Gr√®s was notoriously secretive about her personal life and was seen as a workaholic with a furious attention to detail, therefore she preferred to let her work do the talking. Called the \\"master of the wrapped and draped dress\\" and \\"queen of drapery\\", Gr√®s is best known for her floor-length draped Grecian goddess gowns. Gr√®s's minimalistic draping techniques and her attention and respect for the female body have had a lasting effect on the haute couture and fashion industry and she is credited for inspiring a number of recent designers.  Biography = Early life = Madame Gr√®s was born and raised in Paris, France. Early in life, Gr√®s studied painting and sculpting. Gr√®s originally dreamed of becoming a sculptress but after many objections made by her family she shifted her interests towards the art of fashion design and clothing making. Using her formal training in sculpture, Gr√®s was able to apply her sculpting techniques to her fabric forms. Gr√®s's first job in the industry of fashion was a woman's hat maker where she excelled until she began focusing on couture dressmaking. After distinguishing her area of interest, Gr√®s received her early training in haute couture dressmaking at the fashion house, Maison Premet, a house known for requiring extreme perfection. = Alix Era = In 1932, Gr√®s opened her first couture fashion house, La Maison Alix. In 1933, Gr√®s and her coworker, Juliette Barton, combined their names to create Alix Barton, which she designed under for a short amount of time. Gr√®s dropped the \\"Barton\\" in 1934 and designed under her own name, \\"Alix\\", for the remainder of the 1930s and up until 1942. During this time, Gr√®s's signature style of classical drapery and elegant gowns became the signature of the couture fashion house. At this time she became known for her technique of using live mannequins, designing and creating garments directly on the models. Her early work shows Greco-Roman sculpture influences as well as simple lines and attention to the female body. Her preferred media during this time was silk jersey and paper taffeta While operating her haute couture fashion house under the name Alix, she first gained positive attention and critical acclaim for designing costumes in 1935 for Jean Giraudoux's play, \\"The Trojan War Will Not Take Place\\". After receiving much applause for her theatrical costume designs, Gr√®s became one of the leading designers of that time designing for many notable figures such as the Duchess of Windsor, Paloma Picasso, Grace Kelly, Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Garbo. = Madame Gr√®s Era = In 1942, after marrying Russian painter, Serge Czerefkov, Gr√®s began designing under the name \\"Madame Gr√®s\\", a partial anagram of her husband's first name During World War II, after creation of the Madame Gr√®s label, German troops invaded Paris and soon occupied it. During the war, German forces demanded that Madame Gr√®s design bleak and utilitarian clothing which was in complete contrast to her entire collection. Gr√®s defied their orders and continued to design garments that mirrored the colors of the French flag. Consequentially, after defying German's orders, German forces ordered Gr√®s's haute couture fashion house to be closed claiming her generous use of fabric during wartime as their reasoning. After the closing of her first couture house, Gr√®s fled to the Pyrenees and stayed there until Paris was liberated. In 1944, with the closing of her first couture house, Gr√®s began designing again and opened her second house returning to her now signature name, Madame Gr√®s. Throughout the 1940s, Madame Gr√®s began constructing and perfecting her most notable garment, the elegantly draped Grecian goddess gowns. These dresses could take anywhere up to three hundred hours to complete with each pleat being done by hand draping the cloth so the body shaped the dress. Gr√®s's signature dress perfectly captures who Gr√®s was as a fashion designer. Her painstaking attention to detail, regard for the human body, and simplistic effects can be seen in each of her gowns. In the 1950s, Gr√®s experimented with simpler cuts and purer lines using ethnic traditions such as saris, kimonos and serapes as her inspiration. In addition, Gr√®s tried her hands as tailoring women's suits over the course of the 1950s. Gr√®s's design focus remained mostly on her couture gowns throughout the rest of her career. Gr√®s debuted her bestselling fragrance, Cabochard, in 1959 which translates to \\"stubborn\\". In 1970, Gr√®s strayed away from her signature draping style and highlighted naked flesh. She highlighted the flesh by constructing vertical peek-a-boo openings in the bodice. In 1980, she launched her first two ready-to-wear collections in collaboration with the designer Peggy Huynh Kinh. Then she reiterated in 1983, with a collection which manufacturing process she wanted to master from start to finish. Gr√®s continued to design at her fashion house up until her 80s when she retired from the Gr√®s fashion house in the late 1980s. The final garment designed by Madame Gr√®s was a swelling bodice dress ordered by Hubert de Givenchy in 1989. Soon after Madame Gr√®s retired from the couture fashion house, The House of Gr√®s, began to suffer. In 1984, The House of Gr√®s was bought by Bernard Tapie and then later Jacques Esterel. Due to unpaid rent, a bankruptcy petition was issued and the house's assets were liquidated and the fashion house was sold to Yagi Tsusho Limited, a Japanese company, in 1993 they hired Lloyd Klein as the head designer . = Retirement/ Death = After retiring, Madame Gr√®s lived life in even more secrecy than before. Due to poor business dealings regarding the licensing of her signature perfume, Cabochard, Madame Gr√®s lost the fortune that she worked six decades to build leaving her living in poverty. With help from friends, Hubert Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, and Yves Saint Laurent, Gr√®s was able to rent an apartment in the 16th arrondissement in Paris and continue sewing garments for friends. In 1993, Gr√®s's daughter, Anne, moved her to a retirement home in near Toulon, France. On 24 November 1993, just a few days before her 90th birthday, Gr√®s died. Her death was made public a year later. =Marriage and children= Madame Gr√®s married Serge Czerefkov, a Russian painter, in the late 1930s. The two had one daughter named Anne at some point during their marriage. Gr√®s's daughter is most notable for concealing her mother's death in 1993 for over a year and forging Gr√®s's handwriting in documents.

She was later charged with a number of violent offenses, including a February 2014 assault on two patrons at a downtown bar in Boulder, Colorado for which she was convicted in May 2015 of a Class 4 felony. Background Iman al-Obeidi was one of ten children born in Tobruk to Aisha and Atik al-Obeidi. Her father was a customs agent. Her mother told CNN that Iman had always wanted to be a journalist, but due to the lack of press freedom in Libya, Iman decided to study law instead.Sayah, Reza. \\"Enraged mother stands by daughter, allegedly raped by Gadhafi's men\\", CNN, March 30, 2011.

After finding foreign journalists in the restaurant, she showed them her injuries, which The New York Times described as \\"a broad bruise on her face, a large scar on her upper thigh, several narrow and deep scratch marks lower on her leg, and marks that seemed to come from binding around her hands and feet.\\" She told the journalists she had been stopped two days earlier at a checkpoint on Salahiddeen Road in Tripoli, while in a car with her sister's husband, later reported as Salih Hamid al-Aguri. When the security personnel heard her eastern Libyan accent, she was ordered to produce her identity card, and when they learned she was from Tobruk‚Äîwhere rebel forces were active‚Äîthey detained her.

She said local residents near the place she was held had helped her escape. There was a scuffle in the hotel as government officials and hotel staff tried to silence her. Several journalists were kicked, punched, and knocked over as they tried to help or speak to her. Security forces punched Jonathan Miller of Channel 4 News in the face for coming to her defense, pushed Charles Clover of the Financial Times to the ground and kicked him, smashed a CNN camera, and pointed a gun at a television crew. Clover was later deported; before the incident, he had been told there were \\"inaccuracies in his reports.\\" A member of the hotel's staff told Miller that the people involved in the violence, who were wearing hotel uniforms, did not in fact work for the hotel. Her attackers accused al-Obeidi of being a \\"traitor to Gaddafi\\"; two women grabbed table knives to threaten both her and the journalists, one then throwing a blanket over al-Obeidi's head in an attempt to muffle her. She had specifically asked to speak to Reuters and The New York Times; Michael Georgy of Reuters was able to talk to her briefly before she was taken away. She was finally subdued, dragged out of the hotel, and driven in an unmarked car to an unknown location. =Gaddafi government response= There was confusion for several days as to whether she was in government custody or with her family. At a press conference on March 26, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said investigators had found al-Obeidi was drunk and possibly mentally ill, a suggestion that raised fears she would face indefinite incarceration in a government-controlled mental institution, continuing the list of forced disappearances the opposition charges the Gaddafi regime with. After journalists demanded to see her, Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told CNN that five men, including the son of a high-ranking Libyan police officer, had been arrested in connection with the alleged rape.\\"Libyan woman bursts into hotel to tell her story of rape\\", CNN, March 26, 2011. Kaim said al-Obeidi was being held at the headquarters of Libyan National Intelligence, was doing well, and would be provided with legal aid. Ibrahim withdrew the allegation that she was mentally ill,Sly, Liz. \\"After Libyan woman‚Äôs rape claims, methods of Gaddafi government put on display\\", washingtonpost.com, March 26, 2011. but then suggested she was a thief and a prostitute () who had been on a prearranged meeting with one of the alleged rapists. This was rejected by al-Obeidi's 21-year-old sister Mawra: \\"We come from a good family. We study at university. Is this the type of people who engage in such horrible acts?\\" Ibrahim expressed frustration about the international furore over al-Obeidi while Libya was suffering daily air-raids and massive civilian casualties. On March 27 he said al-Obeidi had been released and was with her sister. On March 28 her parents denied this, saying she was being held at Gaddafi's compound in Bab al-Azizia. According to one rebel activist, Gaddafi government representatives telephoned her mother at three o'clock in the morning on March 27, offering al-Obeidi \\"a new house and a lot of money and anything she wanted\\" if she would change her story. Her mother is reported to have spoken to al-Obeidi by telephone, and she replied, \\"I will die rather than change my words.\\" On March 29 Ibrahim told reporters that the men al-Obeidi accused of rape were making a case against her, and that she was facing criminal charges: \\"The boys she accused are bringing a case against her because it's a very grave offense to accuse someone of a sexual crime.\\" He said al-Obeidi's criminal case against her alleged rapists had been dropped because she refused to undergo a medical examination. On April 3 Gaddafi supporters posted on the Web what they said was a pornographic video made by al-Obeidi. A state media reporter gave a copy to The New York Times, which described it as a homemade video of a belly dancer, relatively chaste according to the newspaper, and bearing little resemblance to al- Obeidi.Kirkpatrick, David D. \\"After Rape Report in Libya, Woman Sees Benefit in Publicity\\", nytimes.com, April 4, 2011. *Also see Kirkpatrick, David D. \\"Militia members sue woman who accused them of rape\\", nytimes.com, March 29, 2011. Release from detention, interviews=April 3: Telephone interview with Libya TV= Al-Obeidi was first heard from again in public on April 3, when she talked by telephone to Libya TV, a new opposition satellite channel. During an emotional interview, she told them she had been in government detention for three days, but had been released and was in Tripoli; she said the Attorney-General had refused a request for her to visit her family in Tobruk. She said that during her detention she had been interrogated by Libyan intelligence‚Äîthe Jamahiriya el-Mukhabarat‚Äîas well as the Criminal Investigation Department, and the Directorate of Security. Their \\"only request,\\" she said, was that she \\"come out on the Libyan state channel and say that those who kidnapped [her] were not from Gaddafi's security forces, rather they were from the revolutionaries and armed gangs.\\" She refused. She said a medical examiner confirmed her rape claim and the Attorney-General's office said it would \\"take all necessary measures to arrest those who were responsible.\\" =April 3‚Äì5: Telephone interviews with CNN= She spoke to CNN by telephone several times between April 3 and 5, interviewed via an interpreter by Anderson Cooper, and on April 6 Gaddafi's son, Saadi, arranged for CNN reporter Nic Robertson to interview her on camera.\\"Eman al-Obeidy interview\\", CNN, April 7, 2011. *For details of how the interview was arranged, see \\"Al-Obeidy interview 'didn't come easy'\\", CNN, April 7, 2011. *For the above details in text, and for Saadi Gaddafi's comment that the men should face charges, see Robertson, Nic. \\"Gadhafi's son arranges CNN interview with Al-Obeidy\\", CNN, April 7, 2011. During the first telephone interview, she offered graphic details of her ordeal at the hands of 15 members of Libya's security forces. She said they poured alcohol into her eyes so she could not see them; raped her; sodomized her with a Kalashnikov; tied her up; bit her; and would not allow her to use the bathroom, eat, or drink. \\"One man would leave and another would enter,\\" she said. \\"He would finish and then another man would come in.\\" She said they told her: \\"Let the men from Eastern Libya come and see what we are doing to their women and how we treat them, how we rape them.\\" There were other women held with her, including a 16-year-old who was able to untie al-Obeidi's hands and feet. This allowed her to escape, and she caught a taxi to the Rixos Hotel, where she heard there was some form of fact-finding team. She was able to enter the hotel by telling the taxi driver she worked there to get round the restriction on meeting foreign journalists. After security forces removed her from the hotel, Libyan officials bought her new clothes, and said they expected her to go on state television to say she had been kidnapped by rebels, not government forces. When she refused, she said she was taken to jail. She said interrogators pointed guns at her, poured water on her face, threw food at her, and accused her of being a traitor, in an effort to persuade her to retract her statement. Eventually, a medical exam confirmed she had been raped, and they released her. She told Cooper other girls were still being held in the building where she was assaulted, and that local residents had complained to the police about it, but that no one had acted to help them. She said her life and reputation had been ruined by the assault and the subsequent allegations on state television that she was a whore, a prostitute, drunk, and mentally ill, and that people were laughing at her. She said there was no safe place for her in Tripoli, and that she was unable to leave the house she was staying in; when she tried to, she had been taken to the police station, then released again. She alleged that officials abducted her three times in all: once from the hotel, once when she tried thereafter to escape to Tunisia, and again on April 3 to stop her from complaining to police. She said: \\"My life is in danger, and I call on all human rights organization [...] to expose the truth and to let me leave now. I am being held hostage here. They have threatened me with death and told me I will never leave prison again, if I go to the journalists or tell them anything about what's happening in Tripoli.\\" She paid tribute to her family for standing by her, saying they had allowed her sister to study overseas without a male chaperone, and had raised both women well. When asked whether she feared someone would kill her, she replied: \\"I don't know. My emotions change. Sometimes I feel no, they are going to kill me. But at the same time I feel afraid but I have a motivation that says there is nothing to be afraid of. We have lost everything. What is left to be afraid of? It is done.\\" She told Cooper: \\"I have reached the end of my tolerance for this as a human.\\" On April 5, CNN connected her by satellite phone to her mother in Tobruk, and broadcast part of the conversation. She told her mother she had been threatened in court that day by a court official, who al-Obeidi said told her he was going to \\"kill this failure who reports on our brigades.\\" Other people pulled him away, and a car took her back to the house she is staying in, which she said belongs to one of her sister's friends. The next day, Nic Robertson of CNN was able to meet her and take photographs, but without sound or video.\\"Alleged rape victim in Libya tells mother of ordeal, threat\\", AC360, CNN, April 5, 2011. *\\"This is a very, very strong lady\\", CNN.com, April 6, 2011. =April 6: On-camera interview with CNN= Nic Robertson and cameraman Khalil Abdallah of CNN recorded an on-camera interview with her on April 6, an interview arranged by Al-Saadi Gaddafi, one of Gaddafi's seven sons. He made his office available and sent a car for al-Obeidi. Transmission of the interview was delayed by 18 hours because Saadi Gaddafi wanted the Libyan government to review it. A spokesman did look at it and was heavily critical, but Gaddafi waved that off, according to Robertson. It was first broadcast on April 7, the first time al-Obeidi had been seen by the wider public since March 26. Ten seconds of the interview‚Äîduring which al-Obeidi expressed support for people in the rebel-held east of the country and in Misrata‚Äîtriggered an objection from Gaddafi. Al-Obeidi did not consent to her comments being removed, and said if they were, she would withdraw consent for the entire interview, but she later agreed to the removal so long as the interview made clear which comments had been cut. She told Robertson she had been kidnapped by two cars belonging to the armed forces and the Gaddafi brigades. They were drunk, and took her to one of their residences, where she was tortured and raped. She said her hands and legs were tied behind her for two days. When she was released, she used her cell phone to take photographs of the bruises and marks on her body. She said she wanted to follow up on her case legally, though when she tried to begin the process in a courthouse, a court employee took a gun and threatened to kill her. She told Robertson she is an ordinary Libyan citizen, a well-educated, conservative Muslim from a good family, and everything that has been said about her by Libyan state television was a lie. She said she wanted to pursue justice and her rights under the law, had appealed to Gaddafi, and wanted Libya to be seen as a country of law: \\"If there is no law, I call upon all judges, district attorneys, prosecutors to stay home, and tell them that the Libyan TV is the one who investigates, and questions, and judges people, so there is no need for you.\\" She also spoke privately to Saadi Gaddafi, describing him later as a humble and understanding man, who treated her well. Robertson wrote that Gaddafi appeared shocked after the meeting, and commented on al-Obeidi's strong character and willingness to disagree with him. He said he would take up her case, and told Robertson: \\"The people responsible for raping her should face charges. She is a strong woman.\\" During a telephone interview on April 11, al-Obeidi told Anderson Cooper she had seen one of the men who raped her; she said she saw him on the street the previous week. She said he was related to a public official who was part of Gaddafi's circle, and that she feared he might kill her.\\"Story of woman accusing Gadhafi soldiers of rape takes many turns\\", CNN, April 12, 2011. =April 11: Interview with NPR and AP= On April 11 al-Obeidi gave her first uncensored interview since March 26, after Lourdes Garcia-Navarro of National Public Radio and an Associated Press reporter managed to avoid their government minders to interview her. Al-Obeidi repeated many of the details she'd given in previous interviews, and added that the most brutal of her attackers was the son of a government minister. She also explained how she had escaped. She told NPR that, after the 16-year- old girl held with her untied al-Obeidi's hands and feet, she managed to jump out of a window, covered only in a tablecloth. The compound was surrounded by a wall, and there were two African guards sleeping by the electric gate. She said she grabbed a piece of metal and ran at them, screaming, and they opened the gate for her. After that, she was helped by people in the neighborhood, who put her in a taxi, paid the fare, and told the driver to take her to the Rixos Hotel.Garcia-Navarro, Lourdes. \\"Libyan Woman Tells Her Story of Rape, Uncensored\\", NPR.org, April 12, 2011. She told NPR she was under intense pressure to recant her allegations; even her own lawyers want her to change her story. Garcia-Navarro reported that the government no longer denies al- Obeidi was raped, but continues to discredit her. She interviewed government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim, who said al-Obeidi \\"has a file\\" proving that she was a prostitute. For some time afterward, Libyan state television continued to run the video purportedly showing al-Obeidi dancing suggestively, but Garcia- Navarro said al-Obeidi has only nine fingers, and has scars on her stomach from an operation. The woman in the video has all 10 fingers, and no scars.Memmott, Mark. Iman Al-Obeidi: 'I Want My Freedom', NPR.org, April 12, 2011. Escape from Libya On May 8, 2011, CNN announced that on May 5, she had escaped to Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and Libyan rebels. She wore a traditional Berber headdress to cross the border, which concealed her face, apart from one eye. On May 11, Al Jazeera English reported that al-Obeidi had fled to Doha, the capital of Qatar, citing a report by the rebel diplomat Ali Zaidan at a press conference the same day.AJE Libya Live Blog ‚Äì May 11, 8:49pm According to CNN, after fleeing to Tunisia, she was met at the border by French diplomats, who handed her off to Transitional National Council officials who helped her escape to Qatar. On May 18, she granted an interview with CNN's Nic Robertson at her new home in Qatar. She said that she felt \\"liberated\\" now that she was out of Libya.Robertson, Nic. Libya's al-Obeidy in exile: My soul is liberated. CNN, May 18, 2011. On June 2, Sybella Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR, said that al-Obeidi had been deported from Qatar and was back in Libya, in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.Profile, aljazeera.net, June 2, 2011; accessed June 24, 2015. Reportedly, the National Transitional Council had pressured the Qatari government, which is allied with the rebels, to deport her. She had been in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee. =Refugee status in the United States= On June 5, 2011, her sister announced that the previous day al-Obeidi had been granted asylum in the United States. On July 27, after spending 54 days at a UN refugee center in Timi»ôoara, Romania, al-Obeidi arrived in New York City. In an interview to CNN she thanked the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for their support and assistance. A refugee agency helped al-Obeidi to settle into life in the USA. In mid-December 2011, al-Obeidi said she suffered from depression and could not find a job. She visited the Libyan Embassy in Washington, D.C. and Ambassador Ali Aujali gave her an educational scholarship and health insurance. In 2012, al-Obeidi lived in Denver where she was studying ESL.CNN: Eman al Obeidi just wants to be left alone, cnn.com; April 8, 2012; accessed June 24, 2015. As of 2014, she was residing in Boulder, Colorado and was living on a monthly stipend of $1,800 from the Libyan embassy. Response=Governments and international organizations= The Libyan National Transitional Council released a statement on March 27, 2011 condemning the treatment of al-Obeidi as \\"criminal, barbaric, and an unpardonable violence against her dignity, the dignity of the Libyan people, and all of humanity\\" and demanding the immediate release of both al-Obeidi and all other women, children, journalists, and civilians being held by Gaddafi and his regime. Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said incidents of such sexual violence in Libya were a demonstration of Gaddafi government's \\"absolute disregard for any understanding of human rights.\\" The Human Rights Sub- Committee of the European Parliament demanded her immediate release, and said the incident was \\"emblematic of the situation of dissident women in Libya.\\" Amnesty International called al-Obeidi's story \\"stomach-churning\\", and demanded that she be released that an investigation be opened. =Mainstream and social media= The story spread within hours around the world, with video and photos going viral on the Internet. Time magazine called the story \\"the Libyan regime's other crisis,\\" adding that her charges \\"could not have been more dramatic‚Äîor more badly timed for the regime of Libyan dictator\\". Canadian journalist Neil Macdonald dismissed the Libyan government's response as \\"ham- fisted, dull-witted\\" damage control, based on his experience in the Arab world where \\"rape ... is routinely used as a punishment by security forces.\\" He called her act \\"not just incredibly courageous but near-suicidal\\", because of the social repercussions suffered by rape victims in societies like Gaddafi's Libya. He suggested she was a real hero who deserved to be seated beside the First Lady of the United States during the next State of the Union address. A number of hashtags associated with her story appeared on Twitter, including #EmanAlObeidy, #EmanAlObeidi, #EmanAlObaidy and #WhereIsEmanAlObeidy. A petition was launched on Avaaz.org calling on the Turkish government to intervene on her behalf and had collected 500,000 signatures by April 3. =Public protests= A group of mostly women in Benghazi marched with posters in support of al-Obeidi on March 27.For an image of a protest in support of al-Obeidi, see *Tran, Mark. \\"Libya: Woman allegedly raped by militia has been freed, says regime\\", The Guardian, March 27, 2011. On March 30, a group of North African women held a rally along Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House. They dismissed the Libyan officials' allegations that al-Obeidi was drunk, mentally unstable, or a prostitute, as signs of oppression, and said that \\"what happened to Eman has been happening to thousands of male and female Libyans. That's how Gadhafi retaliates against civilians, by violating their honor.\\" The group said they planned to rally every week until al-Obeidi was found. Recognition Recognizing the prominence that Iman al-Obeidi incident gained worldwide, BBC included her in the list of \\"Faces of the year 2011\\", or women who made international headlines, for the month of March. The list featured al-Obeidi along with US Congresswomen Gabrielle Giffords and Michele Bachmann, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, and Prince Albert of Monaco spouse Charlene Wittstock. Position of sex-crime victims in Libya David Kirkpatrick of The New York Times writes that rape is often seen in Libya as a crime against the honor of a woman or her family, rather than an attack against an individual. Women who have been raped risked being shunned, or forced to marry the rapist. They may be confined for years in rehabilitation centers, where according to human rights advocates they are deprived of education except for lessons about Islam, placed in solitary confinement or handcuffed if they resist, and subjected to what Kirkpatrick calls unscientific virginity tests. They are allowed to leave only when released by a husband, or when a man offers to marry them. Kirkpatrick writes that, according to one Human Rights Watch source, men arrive at the centers looking, in part, for docile wives. Legal troubles in the US and assault convictions In February 2014, al-Obeidi was arrested in Boulder, Colorado on a second-degree assault charge after physically attacking two patrons at a downtown bar, seriously wounding one. In May 2015, she was convicted of the 2014 assault after the jury rejected her claim of self-defense. A Class 4 felony, the charge carries a sentence of up to 6 years in prison. Prior to this incident, she had been arrested three times in Colorado: for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assault. In the second of these incidents, in August 2013, she was initially charged with second-degree felony assault on a police officer and misdemeanor counts of third-degree assault, obstructing a police officer and resisting arrest. The following September, the charges were reduced to a single misdemeanor count of attempted third-degree assault to which al-Obeidi pleaded guilty, and the court imposed one year of probation and ordered her to seek mental health counseling and help for alcohol abuse. While still on probation and while on bond for the February 2014 assault, she was arrested in November 2014 for having tested positive for opiates and alcohol. The following December, she was sentenced to seven months of work release for that violation. However, after violating the terms of that program, al-Obeidi was confined at the Boulder County Jail in January 2015. On September 2, 2015, al-Obeidi was sentenced in Boulder District Court to 6 years in prison for the February 2014 assault. In denying a request by al- Obeidi's attorney Eric Zale for reconsideration of the sentence after 120 days and possible probation, Judge Andrew Macdonald said, \\"It's terrible, I don't know how else to describe it... It is really clear to me that Ms. Ali has a pretty serious mental health issue, most likely related to the trauma in Libya. But it's also concerning that she is refusing to get treatment.\\" Concluding the hearing, Judge Macdonald told al-Obeidi, \\"I have grave concerns that when you get out, you'll be right back in this situation.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Report and video footage, CNN.com * Report and video footage, sky.com * Video footage, telegraph.co.uk * Video footage, n-tv.de * Video footage by Jonathan Miller, Channel 4 News. * YouTube video: Libya's official TV responds to the al-Obeidi case * Photographs by Thomson Reuters: . *Amnesty International's call upon Libya to end Campaign to Discredit Eman Al- Obeidi * Photo coverage of the Washington DC rally by Libyan women in support of Iman Al-Obeidi by Arabian Business, April 2, 2011. *Askin, Kelly. \\"When rape is a tool of war\\", CNN, April 7, 2011. 1980s births Libyan lawyers Living people Libyan women People from Tobruk People of the Libyan Civil War (2011) Rape in Libya War crimes in Libya Wartime sexual violence 20th-century Libyan women 21st-century Libyan women 2011 crimes in Libya ","title":"Iman al-Obeidi"},{"id":"31302969","text":"Laurence or Lawrence Parsons may refer to: * Laurence Parsons, 1st Earl of Rosse (1749‚Äì1807), Irish peer and politician * Lawrence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse (1758‚Äì1841), Irish peer * Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse (1840‚Äì1908), Irish peer * Lawrence Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse (1906‚Äì1979), Irish peer * Laurence Parsons (priest) (1883‚Äì1972), Anglican clergyman & grandson of the 3rd Earl of Rosse * Lawrence Parsons (British Army officer) (1850‚Äì1923), British general * Laurence Parsons (MP), Member of Parliament (MP) elected 1659 from Boroughbridge ","title":"Laurence Parsons"},{"id":"31302974","text":"Brian O'Conner is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists of The Fast and the Furious franchise. He is portrayed by Paul Walker and first appeared on film, alongside fellow protagonist Dominic Toretto, in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Brian was created by screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson, who was inspired by an article on street racing that was published in the May 1998 issue of Vibe magazine. Walker was directly approached by director Rob Cohen to play the character. O'Conner, under the alias Brian Earl Spilner, first interacts with Dominic as an undercover police officer tasked with bringing him to the law. However, he helps him evade police capture twice, and also helps erase the criminal record of childhood friend Roman Pearce. These events help build many of his attributes: often the second in command to Dominic, Brian is shown to be honorable, honest, and protective, especially in regards to his family and wife, Mia Toretto. Brian is also respectful, and believes in delivering fair justice. He is also an keen driver, and challenges Dominic, the implied strongest racer in the group, to races throughout the series. Brian is one of the most popular characters in modern cinema, and is the role that allowed Walker to become a bankable Hollywood star. He won the 2002 and 2014 MTV Movie Awards for Best On-Screen Team with Vin Diesel for his performances, and Walker has become strongly identified with the character, with Brian being widely considered among the primary reasons of the longevity of the series.Paul Walker's 'Fast & Furious' Character to 'Retire' in 'Fast & Furious 7'. Posted January 3, 2014 by Kelly Woo. After Walker's death in a single vehicle accident on November 30, 2013, the character was retired. Backstory Brian grew up in Barstow, California along with childhood friend Roman Pearce (played by Tyrese Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious). It was while growing up with him that he first got into cars and street racing (and other sorts of trouble). When Brian was only two months out of the Police Academy, his friend Roman Pearce was caught in a garage with eight stolen vehicles. Roman is later sent to jail then afterwards is on probation with an ankle monitor. He blamed Brian for the arrest although he had no knowledge of what had happened in the carjacking incident, but more as a form of betrayal as Brian had joined forces with the police force, an organization he opposed. After learning about Mia's pregnancy and Dominic's close relationship with his father, Brian later revealed that he never knew anything about his father since he was never in Brian's life. Appearances=The Fast and the Furious= During the events of the first film, Brian is working as an undercover detective with the LAPD, who assigns him the task of solving a series of semi-trailer truck hijackings. He is given a very short amount of time to find the people responsible before the truckers start arming themselves with shotguns and taking matters into their own hands. Their only lead is a description of the vehicles used, black Honda Civics with green neon underglow. When investigating the street race scene, he then meets Dominic Toretto whose crew he later infiltrates, first as a rival racer, in a race which he loses, then as a member after helping Dom escape the police. While running with Dom, he proceeds to investigate rival race crews led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune) and Hector (played by Noel Gugliemi). He even goes as far as to organize and lead a large SWAT team into Johnny Tran's house after finding large amounts of merchandise, the kind from the highway robberies, while infiltrating his garage. Although the merchandise is illegal, they find nothing on Tran except a few minor charges‚Äîwhich leaves only Dom as a suspect. Brian soon finds out Toretto is responsible after watching him suddenly leave in the middle of a party at Race Wars and seeing Mia weeping to herself. He then reveals himself to Mia as a police officer and convinces her that if he does not get to her brother and his crew fast, they could get seriously injured or killed by the truckers who have begun to carry firearms. As Brian and Mia race out to stop Dominic from making another highway robbery, two of his drivers, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Vincent, are injured in the process, with Letty rolling her car on the side of the road and Vincent being shot in the side by a shotgun from the truck driver who they tried to hijack. Brian saves Vincent only to reveal to Dom that he's a cop. Brian later finds Dominic at his house attempting to look for Jesse (played by Chad Lindberg) when Tran and his accomplice roll up on their motorbikes pulling a drive by shooting on the Toretto house, narrowly missing everyone there except for Jesse who is killed in the process. Both men then drive after Tran and his accomplice, with Dom running the accomplice of the road while Brian fatally shoots Tran. Afterward he chases Dominic, who he then races resulting in Dominic winning closely just before he is hit by another car. After surviving his car rolling over, Brian later pulls him out of the wreckage only to give him the keys to his vehicle, claiming \\"I owe you a ten second car\\" (the price he paid for losing the earlier race was his car). This leads to his aiding and abetting charge, resulting in his removal from the LAPD. =The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious= Brian leaves Los Angeles before the LAPD gets chance to arrest him for letting Dominic escape. While the FBI launch a national manhunt for him, Brian travels across Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, winning every street race he participates in, with his red Dodge Stealth. However, he is forced to ditch his car at a motel in San Antonio when police officers are notified of his presence. When they collect the car, he manages to hitch a ride from an unknown woman (Minka Kelly), despite her knowing who he really is. She drops him at a used car lot, with him realizing she knows that he is a wanted man. There, he buys a green Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. Later, collecting money from street races, he modifies the car with new rims and repaints it silver before traveling eastbound and winning more races on the way. Upon reaching Jacksonville, Florida, Brian heads south toward Miami. =2 Fast 2 Furious= Brian, now living in Miami, Florida competes part time as a street racer for his friend Tej Parker (Ludacris). While racing, he is caught by the local authorities and is facing jail time for his minor charges such as destruction of property (while infiltrating Toretto in the first film) and aiding and abetting Dominic Toretto. However, US Customs Agent Markham (James Remar) later gives him an offer to work undercover to infiltrate a local drug kingpin named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) in exchange for a clean record. Seeing that they could not pin any charges on Verone until evidence of his payoff is in transit, O'Conner was in charge of being placed as a driver while undercover for Verone. Brian is given a partner named Dunn, who he quizzes regarding his knowledge of cars, and Dunn fails. Brian then proceeded to request his own driver, saying if he doesn't get the driver he wants, he won't participate in the operation and take his chances in Chino. When Markham agrees to Brian's terms, Brian and his old FBI boss, Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) seek out his childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) who is now a Demolition Derby driver. Not being on good terms, they scuffle on the ground much like from their childhood days since Pearce is unhappy with Brian being a police officer, and was arrested two months after Brian got out of Police Academy for possessing eight stolen cars, which Pearce blames Brian for, despite his knowing nothing about it. He is able to convince Pearce to accept the deal. After the agreement is settled, Bilkins and Markham then introduce Brian and Roman to Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes),an undercover US Customs agent working with Carter. Brian and Roman are then given there cars. Brian drives a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VII, and Roman drives a 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. While infiltrating Carter Verone, both men are successful in getting into the organization, aided by Monica Fuentes. Monica, who has fallen in love with Brian, warns him that Verone intends to kill them at the end of their mission. Now the stakes are that if they fail, they go to jail or if they succeed, they get executed. With those choices, both men hatch a scheme to avoid jail time and being shot dead. Pearce reconciles with Brian, accepting that his arrest was not his fault. With help from Tej, they orchestrate a \\"scramble\\"‚Äîafter driving into a garage they later have hundreds of race cars coming out, having switched cars with Tej and Suki (Devon Aoki) while in the garage. The cars they later move out in are outfitted with ejection seats to rid themselves of unwanted guests. Brian is forced to meet up with Verone, but after beating up Carter's henchman (with help from Pearce) he proceeds to do a classic car jump onto Verone's boat. Afterward they arrest Verone and are off the hook. He and Monica exchange a meaningful glance, and the end scene is shown between O'Conner and Pearce walking away with their pockets full of Verone's drug money planning to open up a high performance garage. =Fast & Furious= Paul Walker reprises his role as Brian O'Conner in the fourth installment of the film series. This film takes place after the events of The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, much before the events of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Brian O'Conner, now a fully reinstated FBI Agent is given the task of bringing down Arturo Braga, a known trafficker in Los Angeles and his connections to the street racing world. Brian is also not surprised to see Dominic Toretto doing a Suge Knight style balcony interrogation of possible lead David Park. Brian knows that it is because of Letty's recent murder that Dominic has returned to get answers. Also, it was Brian who was contacted by Letty with her proposal to infiltrate Braga's organization in exchange for Dom's safe return to Los Angeles. Despite being a full agent again, he is still seen doing his trademark bending the rules and occasionally breaking them to solve the case. Brian and Dom both infiltrate Braga's crew, neither aware of who Braga really is. After having the FBI do a fingerprint database search for Braga, it turns up to be the messenger Campos but not before an FBI Agent envious of O'Conner sends in a SWAT team (possibly intentional in ruining the bust as the agent responsible was at odds with O'Conner) forcing Braga to go back into hiding. Later, as O'Conner and Dominic go into Mexico to search for Braga, they are given a tip off by one of Braga's people, in this case, one of his females named Giselle Harabo (Gal Gadot) who has taken an attraction to Dom. Brian and Dom successfully apprehend Carlos Braga after doing a series of follow ups in Mexico and helps Dom kill Fenix Rise (Laz Alonso), who is responsible for Letty's death, by holding his ankles while Dominic impales him with a henchman's '73 Chevy Camaro F-Bomb, and is even present at Dominic's trial when he is given a sentence of \\"25 years to life without the possibility of early parole\\". Despite Dom's sentencing, Brian, Mia, and two of Dom's Latino accomplices from the beginning of the film (Leo and Santos, played by Don Omar and Tego Calder√≥n respectively) are seen driving towards his prison bus in similar style to Dominic's heists about to bust him free, which later leads to Dominic's appearance in Tokyo, Japan during the end film events of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. There is no mention of the fate regarding his plans for opening an automotive shop with childhood friend Roman Pearce in Miami. It is also revealed in this film why he let Dominic go in the first film‚Äîthat he respected Dominic more than he did himself, and perhaps due to the fact that his raid on Tran's estate indirectly caused Jesse's death. During the course of the film, Brian also rekindles his old romance with Mia Toretto, Dominic's younger sister. After seeing her in an FBI interrogation room, he releases her, and the two go out for coffee. During the conversation they share, she reveals her anger at his \\"betrayal\\" of their group at the end of the first film, questions why he let Dom go (to which Brian claims he doesn't know), and tells him how hurt she was when he left her suddenly, with no explanation. While Brian initially puts professional distance between himself and Mia, he finally admits to her that leaving her was the hardest thing he ever did, and later, when Mia breaks down, Brian comforts her, resulting in a passionate reunion between the two. =Fast Five= O'Conner and Toretto get caught in a crossfire with corrupt businessman and ruthless drug lord Hernan Reyes's in Rio de Janeiro and plot to steal all of Reyes' money to buy their freedom. It is revealed in Fast Five that O'Conner's father was not there for him and O'Conner does not know anything about him, unlike the close bond that Toretto's father had with both his children. He is often worried that he will behave in the manner that his father did, but Toretto reassured him that he won't because he will keep an eye on him if he does. O'Conner had been in juvenile detention with Roman before he became a cop. O'Conner has also rekindled his relationship with Mia, and she becomes pregnant with his child. =Fast & Furious 6= O'Conner, Toretto, and Mia live peacefully in the Canary Islands in Spain, where Mia gives birth to their son. O'Conner joins Toretto's team in complying with the request of Agent Hobbs to take down rival gang leader Owen Shaw. When the team realizes that Braga worked for Shaw, O'Conner decides to enter the United States to interrogate him about Shaw. After successfully questioning Braga and returning to London, O'Conner starts to feel guilty for letting Letty go undercover, which led to her amnesia and subsequent work for Shaw. The group captures Shaw and convinces Letty to side with them. O'Conner apologizes to Letty, who says that she might not remember him, but if she did work for him, she would have done of her own free will. Shaw reveals that he had captured Mia, leading to a high-speed chase after Shaw's airplane, where Mia is rescued and Shaw is crippled and put into a coma. Hobbs then grants the group's amnesty, and the entire crew move back to America, where Mia, Toretto and O'Conner have decided to reside in the old Toretto home. =Furious 7= Brian and the rest of the crew return to the U.S. and live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, but misses the old life he once enjoyed. Meanwhile, Dom learns from his sister, Mia, that she is pregnant again, but fears to tell Brian because of his longing for missing the bullets. However, their house is destroyed by Deckard Shaw, brother to Owen Shaw, who has come out of hiding for vengeance, which forces Brian, Roman, Tej, Letty and Dom to go after him. Before leaving, Brian makes a promise to Mia that after Shaw is dealt with, he will dedicate himself to his family. To rescue Ramsey, a hacker who has a device known as 'God's Eye' that can locate anyone on Earth, the team airdrops their cars over the Caucasus Mountains and ambush Jakande's convoy and rescue Ramsey, finding out that she is a young woman. They then head to Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye. The team break into his penthouse and manage to steal the flash drive. On the both occasions, the team is pursued by Shaw, who engages in combat with Dom, with the team barely managing to escape. With God's Eye, the team manages to track down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian and Mr. Nobody, along with a covert ops unit, attempt to capture Shaw but are ambushed by Jakande and Jakande's militants, who have allied with Deckard. After the ambush, Nobody's men are killed and Nobody is injured, though he manages to escape with Toretto and Brian, while Jakande obtains God's Eye. Nobody warns Brian and Dom that Jakande will use God's Eye to hunt down Ramsey, who is the only one who can destroy it. They drive off, leaving Nobody behind to be evacuated by one of his 'stand-by' helicopters. Left with no other choice, the team return to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men on their home turf. Dom plans to confront Shaw alone while Brian and the rest of the crew prepare to deal with Jakande. Just as they are preparing, Brian calls Mia and professes his love, fearing he may not survive, and learns that she is pregnant with a baby girl, motivating him to come back alive. While Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the crew with a stealth attack helicopter and a UAV, using God's Eye to track down Ramsey, they barely survive and manage to shut down God's Eye with Brian's help to establish a connection for Ramsey to hack it. In the aftermath, Hobbs kills Jakande by shooting the bag of grenades that Dom managed to throw inside the helicopter, while also taking out the UAV. Deckard is defeated by Dom and imprisoned. Finally at peace, the team celebrate at the beach. While Brian and Mia play with their son, Dom, Letty, Ramsey, Roman and Tej observe, appreciating their happiness and acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. Dom silently leaves, not wanting to disturb the happy moment and drives off. Brian notices and manages to catch up to him, asking Dom \\"You thought you could leave without saying goodbye?\\" As he pulls up beside Dom's car in his white Toyota Supra they look at each other and smile, then bid each other farewell as Brian turns off the main road, and Dom continues on ahead. =The Fate of the Furious= Brian does not appear in The Fate of the Furious, but he, alongside Mia, is seen in a photo in Dom's car. He is also mentioned by Roman and Letty as when Dom betrays the team, Roman suggests that Brian be called to help them figure out why Dom betrayed them. But Letty reminded him that they all agreed to keep Brian and Mia retired from the team due to them wanting a normal life and for the safety of their children. Dom later names his son after Brian. Character, traits and abilities His charismatic, level-headed personality often contrasts with Toretto's aggressive behavior. Despite his composure, Brian is a secret adrenalin junkie; once, he confides in Dom (when describing the challenges of fatherhood) that he misses the dangerous lifestyle. He is also shown to be brave, particularly when protecting friends or loved ones by making seemingly lethal, impulsive or courageous decisions. O'Conner was first unknown with the car tuning community, but after with meeting Toretto, he became more positive, active in the racing scene, becoming a skilled mechanic. He is very interested in tuners, especially Nissan Skyline models. He owned two Nissan Skyline GT-R R34's (one in the second movie and one in the fourth), Nissan C10 Skyline and finally a Nissan GT-R. Apart from Skylines, he has owned: a tuned Mitsubishi Eclipse in the first film (but it's hinted this was paid for by the LAPD-FBI task force he had gone undercover for), a Lancer Evo, a Subaru (twice) and a Supra (twice). Cars O'Conner's Nissan Skyline GT-R from 2 Fast 2 Furious. The following cars are driven by Brian O'Conner throughout the series: * 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse - Shot at by Johnny Tran and later destroyed after ruptured nitrous tanks explode; equipped with a 420A motor with an upgrade to a T3 turbo and front mount intercooler, standalone fuel management and nitrous. This was the car Brian used to race Dom in the beginning of the first film. * 1995 Toyota Supra - Brian handed over the keys to Dominic after he crashed his Dodge Charger R/T, claiming he owed him a ten second car. In the movie, Jesse referred to spending $10,000-$15,000 on this car when in reality there was over $150,000 dollars invested in the Supra. * 1999 Ford F-150 Lightning - Seen bumping the curb outside of Harry's performance shop \\"The Racer's Edge\\", and when Brian is pulled over and arrested by Sergeant Tanner. * 1995 Dodge Stealth - Seen in The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious; now a fugitive, he races with it until it's impounded by the FBI then later replaces it with a Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 on his way to Miami. * 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII - Provided for Brian, in 2 Fast 2 Furious for his undercover mission of taking down drug lord Carter Verone in Miami. It is fitted with a tracking device. He later switches cars in an elaborate scramble sequence, continuing his mission undetected. Note: The Evo VII had the tail lights from the Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally and it was both the 2002 Evo VII and 2002 Lancer OZ Rally. * 1969 Yenko Camaro - Won from fellow racer Korpi, this is the car Brian switches into after the scramble sequence, and drives for the rest of the film. It is outfitted with an ejector seat, which somehow fails, and is forced to drive with Verone's henchman to the checkpoint. Brian later uses the Camaro to drive off the shore onto Verone's boat to rescue Monica after she is taken captive. * Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 - Driven by Brian in 2 Fast 2 Furious and Fast & Furious. In the second film, it is colored silver from House of Kolors and blue stripes. In the fourth film, Brian is given a second Skyline and drives this car in the race against Dominic, which he very narrowly loses after Dom cheats near the end of the race. Later, when he and Dom confront Fenix Rise about Letty's death, Dom (having anticipated betrayal) blows up all the racers' cars (including Brian's) by igniting the nitrous tanks equipped in his own car. * 2006 Hummer H1 - Briefly driven by Brian and Dom after his own car is blown up to escape from Rise; it contains the heroin being transported to Braga. He later hides it in the LAPD impound lot in plain sight. * 2009 Subaru Impreza WRX STI - \\"Given\\" to Brian by Dom after he blows up his Skyline, claiming the line from the first film that Dom now owes him a \\"ten second car\\". He drives this car for the rest of the film, using it to apprehend Braga in a cathedral in Mexico and racing against Rise with it. * 1970 Dodge Charger R/T - Dominic Toretto's car but driven by Brian at the end of Fast & Furious when he, Mia and the two Latinos intercept Dom's prison bus.

Its fa√ßade is pink-brown sandstone, brick and marble while the side elevations, where the service and workers entrances were located, are in glazed white brick and the rear common brick. The warehouse loading bays are between the blocks and were linked to the packing rooms in the basement by shafts. Many warehouses were built to a common design, often with steps to a raised ground floor with showroom and offices and the first floor contained more offices and waiting rooms for clients and sample and pattern rooms all decorated to impress customers. The working areas above were plain with large windows to allow in natural light. Orders were packed there and sent to the basement on hoists powered by Manchester's hydraulic power system and packed into bales using hydraulic presses before dispatch. The warehouse was lighted by gas. Asia House was converted for residential use in 2003 and the basement is a car park.

Early life Ruth Aarons was born in Stamford, Connecticut to Leila (n√©e Hughes), an opera singer, and Alfred E. Aarons, a Broadway theatrical producer. She came from a wealthy Jewish family, and lived in New York City, where she attended and graduated from St. Agatha Episcopal High School in 1936. Table tennis career Originally a tennis player, Aarons was reportedly introduced to table tennis by mere chance, in the summer of 1933. During a rainstorm, which ended a tennis match early, she discovered and quickly became fascinated by table tennis. Over time, Aarons developed and mastered her own defensive technique centered on the \\"shakehand\\" grip, for which she became notable. Aarons would spend the next five years traveling the United States and Europe, competing in various table tennis matches and championships, and enjoying much success, eventually building a reputation as a strong defensive player. Her main achievements were winning two gold medals in the singles competition at the World Table Tennis Championships in 1936 and 1937, being the only American competitor to do so at the time. She also won doubles and team medals for the United States in the World Table Tennis Championships. Upon winning the gold medal in Prague in 1936, Aarons refused to shake the hand of Astrid Krebsbach, her opponent from Nazi Germany, proclaiming: \\"I am Jewish\\".Davar Newspaper 24 March 1936, front page The champion of Woman's Singles in 1937 was declared vacant due to time limit rule in force at the time. In 2001, it was decided to declare the two players (i.e., Ruth Aarons and Gertrude Pritzi) Co-Champions. While still involved in professional table tennis, Aarons, thanks to her father's theatrical connections, performed in vaudeville for several years, in both America and England, in a routine centered on the game. These performances enjoyed much success in the United States, as the United States Table Tennis Association (USATT) had granted her permission as an active member, to play the game for compensation. In England, however, Aarons faced sanctions by the English Table Tennis Association (ETTA), who had jurisdiction over her USATT-made performance contracts for shows in England, and eventual suspension by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) in January 1937. Officials claimed that Aarons violated the newly enacted (December 1936) policy prohibiting active members from accepting compensation for public table tennis playing. Aarons would later come back for the 1937 Women's World Singles Championships, and then retire altogether. She also won two English Open titles. In 1966, Aarons was inducted in the USATT Hall of Fame for her contributions to and success in the sport of table tennis. Later years After her retirement from table tennis in 1938, Aarons found much success as a show business manager, forming her own management firm (Aarons Management), and guiding to success the careers of clientele including Jack Cassidy, Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Shaun Cassidy, Susan Dey, George Chakiris, Janis Paige, Claibe Richardson, and Celeste Holm. Later in life, Aarons developed an addiction to prescription medication, particularly Seconal. According to close friend David Cassidy, he would discover thousands of pills in her home while visiting. The medication eventually took its toll physically and psychologically, exacerbated greatly by the tragic death of longtime friend and actor Jack Cassidy in December 1976. By 1979, all her clients had lost faith in her capability as a manager and moved on. On June 6, 1980, just five days before her 62nd birthday, Aarons was found dead in the shower of her Beverly Hills home, presumably from falling and hitting her head. According to Cassidy, her drug use was so profound that her muscles often atrophied, which rendered her unable to leave her bed, much less to stand.

Through marriage, the Gondersdorf family inherited the castle and in 1630 transformed it into a luxurious residence for their daughter. In 1677, it was inherited by Charles Fran√ßois baron de Failly de Sancy and Marie Marguerite de Giraldin. By that time, it was no longer of any military value as a quiet park had replaced its defences. Abandoned by the Prel family in the 19th century, it was used as a rectory. During the Second World War, the castle was damaged as a result of its use first by the Germans and then by American troops.

In brief, Uyghur history is the story of a small nomadic tribe from the Altai Mountains competing with rival powers in Central Asia, including other Altaic tribes, Indo-European empires from the south and west and Sino-Tibetan empires to the east. After the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in AD 840, ancient Uyghur resettled from Mongolia to the Tarim Basin, assimilating the Indo- European population, which had previously been driven out of the region by the Xiongnu.A meeting of civilisations: The mystery of China's Celtic mummies. The Independent. 28 August 2006. Ultimately, the Uyghurs became civil servants administering the Mongol Empire.  Contested history  The history of the Uyghur people, as with the ethnic origin of the people, is an issue of contention between Uyghur nationalists and the Chinese authority. Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history. Uyghur politician and historian Muhemmed Imin Bughra wrote in his book A history of East Turkestan, stressing the Turkic aspects of his people, that the Turks have a 9000-year history, while historian Turgun Almas incorporated discoveries of Tarim mummies to conclude that Uyghurs have over 6400 years of history and the World Uyghur Congress claimed a 4,000-year history. Chinese historians however generally traced the origin of the Uyghurs to the Tiele, some to the Dingling as well as other people mentioned in ancient Chinese texts such as the Guifang. Official Chinese view asserts the Uyghurs to be of Tiele origin and only became the main social and political force in Xinjiang during the ninth century when they migrated to Xinjiang from Mongolia after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate, replacing the Han Chinese that they claimed were there since the Han dynasty. Many modern Western scholars however do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate of Mongolia, rather they are descendants of a number of people, of which the ancient Uyghurs are but one. Some Uyghur nationalist claimed that they were descended from the Tocharians. Discovered well-preserved Tarim mummies of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of an Indo-European people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the Bronze Age around 2,000 BCE. These people probably spoke Tocharian and were suggested by some to be the Yuezhi mentioned in ancient Chinese text and who later founded the Kushan Empire. The Uyghur claim is based partly on a word, which they argued to be Uyghur, found in written scripts associated with these mummies, although other linguists suggested that it was a Sogdian word later absorbed into Uyghur. Later migrations brought peoples from the west and northwest to the Xinjiang area, probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the Saka tribes. Other ancient people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the Xiongnu who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years. Some Uyghur nationalists claimed descent from the Xiongnu (as well as being related to the White Huns), however this view is contested by modern Chinese scholars. This Xiongnu claim originated from various Chinese historical texts; for example, according to Chinese history Weishu, the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler.Ëàä‰∫î‰ª£Âè≤ Jiu Wudai Shi, Chapter 138.

It takes its meaning from turning round to strike rapidly like a falcon. Colonel James Churchward choose an image of the dual headed sculpture titled 'The Dual Principal' believed to be from the ancient capital of the Uyghurs, as a frontispiece for his book The Sacred Symbols of Mu, published 1933 by James Churchward. To this sculpture he reports: \\"The city has been destroyed about 18,000 to 20,000 years ago - Chinese records say 19,000 years ago - is probably the oldest record of man being created with the dual principle.\\"  Pre-Imperial  An 8th-century Uyghur Khagan Many historians traced the ancestry of the Uyghur tribe to the Altaic pastoralists called Tiele (Tura in Uyghur), who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River. The Tiele first appear in history AD 357 under the Chinese ethnonym Gaoche (Qangqil in Uyghur), referring to the ox-drawn carts with distinctive high wheels used for yurt transportation. Tiele tribal territories had previously been occupied by the Dingling, an ancient Siberian people, some of whom had been absorbed into the Tiele. The Tiele practiced some minor agriculture and were highly developed metalsmiths due to the abundance of easily available iron ore in the Yenisei River. The Tiele were subjugated by the Xiongnu in c 300 BC, who put them to work manufacturing weapons. After the collapse of the Xiongnu empire they were passed as vassal metalsmiths to the Rouran and Hepthalite States.Duan Lianqin, \\"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\\", p. 325‚Äì326. A Tiele tribe of twelve clans, the Fufuluo (), gathered enough power to create a state, the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom (AD 481‚Äì520), in Dzhungaria. The Fufulo are often listed as Uyghur ancestors in Chinese history, famously in the Suishu.Suribadalaha, \\"New Studies of the Origins of the Mongols\\", p. 46‚Äì47. In AD 546, the Fufulo led the Tiele tribes in a struggle against the T√ºrk tribe in the power vacuum left by the breakup of the Rouran state. As a result of this defeat, they were forced into servitude again. This incident marked the beginning of the historic T√ºrk-Tiele animosity that plagued both G√∂kt√ºrk Khanates. (Note: at this time Tiele replaces Gaoche in Chinese history.) At some point during their subjugation, nine Tiele tribes formed a coalition called Tokuz-Oguzes Nine-Tribes which also included the Xueyantuo (Syr-Tardush), Basmyl, Oguz, Khazar, Alans, Kyrgyz, Tuva and Yakut under the leadership of the Xueyantuo. In AD 600, Sui China allied with Erkin Tegin, Bey of the Uyghur tribe, against the G√∂kt√ºrk Empire, their common enemy. This alliance was the first historical mention of the Uyghur tribe, which then resided in the Tuul River Valley with a population of 10,000 yurts (~40,000 people). In AD 603, the alliance dissolved in the aftermath of Tardu Khan's defeat, but three tribes came under Uyghur control: Bugut, Tongra and Bayirqu. In AD 611, the Uyghur led by the Seyanto (Ch. Xueyantuo) defeated a G√∂kt√ºrk invasion; however, in AD 615 they were placed under G√∂kt√ºrk control again by Shipi Qaghan. In AD 627 the Uyghur, now led by Pusa Ilteber, participated in another Tokuz-Oguz revolt against the G√∂kt√ºrks, again spearheaded by the Seyanto tribe. In AD 630 the G√∂kt√ºrk Khanate was decisively defeated by the Emperor Tang Taizong. The Uyghur occupied second position after the Xueyantuo in the Tokuz-Oguz. However, in AD 646 when the Uyghur bey, Tumitu Ilteber (ÂêêËø∑Â∫¶) was granted the Chinese title Prefect () it established a legal precedent for Uyghur rule. Chinese crushed the Xueyantuo in 646 and appointed Uyghur khagan as Anbei Protector (ÂÆâÂåóÈÉΩË≠∑) over the Mongolian steppe. From AD 648‚Äì657, the Uyghur, under Pojuan Ilteber (Â©ÜÈó∞), worked as mercenaries for the Chinese in their annexation of the Tarim Basin. In AD 683, the Uyghur bey Tuchiachi was defeated by G√∂kt√ºrks and the Uyghur tribe moved to the Selenga River Valley. From this base, they struggled against the Second G√∂kt√ºrk Empire. By AD 688, the Ugyhur were controlled again by the G√∂kt√ºrks. After a series of revolts coordinated with their Chinese allies, the Uyghur emerged as the leaders of the Tokuz-Oguz and Tiele once again. In AD 744, the Uyghur, with their Basmyl and Qarluq allies, under the command of Qutlugh Bilge K√∂l, with Chinese general Wang Zhongsi (ÁéãÂø†Âó£) defeated G√∂kt√ºrks. The following year, they founded the Uyghur Khaganate at sacred Mount √ñt√ºken. Control of Mt. √ñt√ºken had been, since the Xiongnu, a symbol of authority over the Mongolian steppe.  Uyghur Khaganate (AD 744‚Äì840)  Uyghur Khanate in geopolitical context c AD 800 Properly called the On Uyghur Toquz-Oghuz Orkhon Khanate, the Uyghur Khaganate stretched from the Caspian Sea to Manchuria and lasted from AD 745 to 840. It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu-Baliq, one of the biggest ancient cities in Mongolia. During the imperial phase, the term Uyghur () denoted any citizen of the Uyghur Khaganate, as opposed to the Uyghur tribe. Large numbers of Sogdian refugees came to Ordu-Baliq to escape the Islamic conquest of their homeland. They converted the Uyghur nobility from Buddhism to Manichaeism. Thus, the Uyghurs inherited the legacy of Sogdian Culture. Sogdians ran the civil administration of the empire. They were helpful in outflanking the Chinese diplomatic policies which had destabilized the G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate. Peter B. Golden writes that the Uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the Indo-European Sogdians, such as Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Christianity, but also looked to the Sogdians as \\"mentors\\" while gradually replacing them in their roles as Silk Road traders and purveyors of culture.Peter B. Golden (2011), Central Asia in World History, Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, p. 47, . Indeed, Sogdians wearing silk robes are seen in the pra·πáidhi scenes of the Uyghur Bezeklik murals, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing Sogdian donors to the Buddha.Gasparini, Mariachiara. \\"A Mathematic Expression of Art: Sino-Iranian and Uighur Textile Interactions and the Turfan Textile Collection in Berlin,\\" in Rudolf G. Wagner and Monica Juneja (eds), Transcultural Studies, Ruprecht-Karls Universit√§t Heidelberg, No 1 (2014), pp 134‚Äì163. . See also endnote #32. (Accessed 3 September 2016.) In AD 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the Kirghiz, another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control migrated to what is now northwestern China, especially to the modern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the Han Chinese during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uyghurs in the capital to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uyghurs because they practiced usury The magistrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect \\"purity\\" in Chinese custom.  Uyghur Kingdoms  Following the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate, the Uyghur gave up Mongolia and dispersed into present day Gansu and Xinjiang. In 843 Chinese forces watched over Uyghur leftovers located in Shanxi province during a rebellion, until reinforcements arrived. The Uyghur later founded two kingdoms: Yugur, the easternmost state formed by the Yugur people, was the Ganzhou Kingdom (AD 870‚Äì1036), with its capital near present-day Zhangye in the Gansu province of China. There, the Uyghur converted from Manichaeism to Tibetan and Mongol Buddhism. Unlike Turkic peoples further west, they did not later convert to Islam. Their descendants are now known as Yugurs (or Yogir, Yugur, and Sary Uyghurs, literally meaning \\"yellow Uyghurs\\") and are distinct from modern Uyghurs. In AD 1028‚Äì1036, the Yugurs were defeated in a bloody war and forcibly absorbed into the Tangut kingdom. These Yugurs stayed Buddhist and did not convert to Islam. Kingdom of Qocho, created during AD 856‚Äì866, is also called the \\"Idiqut\\" (\\"Holy Wealth, Glory\\") state, and was based on the cities of Qocho (winter capital) near Turpan, Beshbalik (summer capital), Kumul, and Kucha. A Buddhist state, with state-sponsored Buddhism and Manichaeism, it can be considered the center of Uyghur culture. The Uyghurs sponsored the construction of many of the temple caves in nearby Bezeklik. The Uyghurs abandoned the old alphabet and adopted the scripts of the local population which later came to be known as the Uyghur script. The Idiquts (title of the Karakhoja rulers) ruled independently until they become a vassal state of the Kara-Khitans. In 1209, the Kara-Khoja ruler Idiqut Barchuq declared his allegiance to the Mongols under Genghis Khan and, as the kingdom existed as a vassal state until 1335. After they submitted to the Mongols, the Uyghurs went into the service of the Mongol rulers as bureaucrats, providing the expertise that the initially illiterate nomads lacked. The Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy by the Mongols, but was finally destroyed by the Chaghataid Mongols in the late 14th century. Kara- Khanids, or the Karakhans (Black Khans) Dynasty, was a state formed by a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yaghmas and other Turkic tribes. Some historians argued that the Karakhanids were linked to the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate through the Yaghmas, a people associated with the Toquz Oghuz, although other historians argued differently. The Karakhanid Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan (920‚Äì956 AD) converted to Islam in 934, and a mass conversion of the Karakhanids followed in 960. The first capital of the Karakhanids was established in the city of Balasagun in the Chu River Valley and later was moved to Kashgar. The reign of the Karakhanids is considered a significant part of Uyghur culture and history by modern Uyghurs. During this period mosques, schools, bridges, and caravansarais were constructed in the cities. Kashgar, Bukhara and Samarkand became centers of learning, and Turkic literature developed. Among the most important works of the period is Kutadgu Bilig (English: \\"The Knowledge That Gives Happiness\\"), written by Yusuf Balasaghuni between the years 1060‚Äì1070, and Lughat-at-Turk (The Turkic dictionary) by Mahmud of Kashgar. The tazkirahs of later periods such as the Tazkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams that tells the story of the early Karakhanids helped forge the identity of the settled Turkic Altishahr people who would become the modern Uyghurs. After the rise of the Seljuk Turks in Iran, the Karakhanids became vassals of the Seljuks. The Karakhanid states later submitted and served the suzerainty of the Kara-Khitans who defeated the Seljuks in the Battle of Qatwan. The Karakhanid states finally ended when they were divided up between the Khwarezmids and Kuchlug, an usurper of the Kara- Khitan's throne. Most Uyghur inhabitants of the Besh Balik and Turpan regions did not convert to Islam until the 15th century expansion of the Yarkand Khanate, a Turko-Mongol successor state based in western Tarim. Before converting to Islam, Uyghurs were Tengriist, Manichaeans, Buddhists, or Nestorian Christians.  Mongol period 1210‚Äì1760  The Uighur Idiqut, Barchukh, voluntarily submitted to Genghis Khan (r.1206‚Äì1227) and was given his daughter, Altani (·††·†Ø·†≤·††·†®) in 1209.Thomas T. Allsen- The Yuan Dynasty and the Uighurs in Turfan in: Ed. Morris Rossabi, China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th centuries, pp. 246 From the 1260s onwards, they were directly controlled by the Yuan Dynasty of the Great Khagan Kublai (r.1260‚Äì1294). Starting from the 1270s, Mongol princes, Qaidu and Duwa, from Central Asia repeatedly launched raids into Uighurstan to take the control from the Yuan. Most of the Uighurs including the ruling dynasty fled to Gansu (under Yuan Dynasty) due to the conflict between the Mongols. The Uighur troops served the Mongol war machine in Central Asia, China and the Middle East. Because they were one of the many highly developed nations under the Mongols, the Uighurs held high-positions at the Mongol court. Tata-tunga was the first scribe of Genghis Khan and mastermind behind the Uighur- Mongolian script that the Mongols used till now. The founder of the Eretna (1335‚Äì1381) in Anatolia was an Uighur commander of the Ilkhanate. The Chagatai Khanate was a Mongol ruling khanate controlled by Chagatai Khan, second son of Genghis Khan. Chagatai's ulus, or hereditary territory, consisted of the part of the Mongol Empire which extended from the Ili River (today in eastern Kazakhstan) and Kashgaria (in the western Tarim Basin) to Transoxiana (modern Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan). The exact date that the control of Turfan and other areas of Uighurstan was transferred to another Mongol Dynasty, Chagatai Khanate, is unclear.).Thomas T. Allsen- The Yuan Dynasty and the Uighurs in Turfan in: Ed. Morris Rossabi, China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th centuries, pp. 258 Many scholars claim Chagatai Khan (d.1241) inherited Uighurstan from his father, Genghis Khan, as appanage in the early 13th century.Barthold- Four Studies, pp. 43‚Äì53 By the 1330s, the Chagatayids exercised the full authority over the Uighur Kingdom in Turfan.Dai Matsui-A Mongolian Decree from the Chaghataid Khanate Discovered at Dunhuang, p.166 After the death of the Chagatayid ruler Qazan Khan in 1346, the Chagatai Khanate was divided into western (Transoxiana) and eastern (Moghulistan/Uyghuristan) halves, which was later known as \\"Kashgar and Uyghurstan,\\" according to Balkh historian Makhmud ibn Vali (Sea of Mysteries, 1640). By 1348, the Mogul (Mongol in Persian) khan, Tughlug Timur, had converted, along with their 160,000 subjects. A small Mongol Dynasty, Qara Del, was founded in Hami where the Uighurs also lived in 1389. = Mogulistan = Kashgar historian Muhammad Imin Sadr Kashgari recorded Uyghurstan in his book Traces of Invasion (Asar al-futuh) in 1780. Power in the western half devolved into the hands of several tribal leaders, most notably the Qara'unas. Khans appointed by the tribal rulers were mere puppets. In the east, Tughlugh Timur (1347‚Äì1363), an obscure Chaghataite adventurer, gained ascendancy over the nomadic Mongols, and converted to Islam. In 1360, and again in 1361, he invaded the western half in the hope that he could reunify the khanate. At their greatest extent, the Chaghataite domains extended from the Irtysh River in Siberia down to Ghazni in Afghanistan, and from Transoxiana to the Tarim Basin. Tughlugh Timur was unable to completely subjugate the tribal rulers. After his death in 1363, the Moghuls left Transoxiana, and the Qara'unas' leader Amir Husayn took control of Transoxiana. Tƒ´mur-e Lang (Timur the Lame), or Tamerlane, a Muslim native of Transoxiana who claimed descent from Genghis Khan, desired control of the khanate for himself and opposed Amir Husayn. He took Samarkand in 1366, and was recognized as emir in 1370, although he continued to officially act in the name of the Chagatai khans. For over three decades, Timur used the Chagatai lands as the base for extensive conquests, conquering the rulers of Herat in Afghanistan, Shiraz in Persia, Baghdad in Iraq, Delhi in India, and Damascus in Syria. After defeating the Ottoman Turks at Angora, Timur died in 1405 while marching on the Ming dynasty China. The Timurid dynasty continued under his son, Shah Rukh, who ruled from Herat until his death in 1447. By 1369, the western half (Transoxiana and further west) of the Chagatai Khanate had been conquered by Tamerlane in his attempt to reconstruct the Mongol Empire. The eastern half, mostly under what is now Xinjiang, remained under Chagatai princes that were at times allied or at war with Timurid princes. Until the 17th century, all the remaining Chagatai domains fell under the theocratic regime of Uyghur Apak Khoja and his descendant, the Khojijans, who ruled Altishahr in the Tarim Basin. Both the Tarim Basin as well as Transoxiana (in modern-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) became known as Moghulistan or Mughalistan, named after the ruling class of Chagatay and Timurid states which descended from the \\"Moghol\\" tribe of Doghlat, but was Islamicized and Turkified in language. This Moghol Timurid ruling class established the Timurid rule on the Indian Subcontinent known as the Mughal Empire. In the eastern portion of the Chagatai Khanate, known as the Eastern Chagatai Khanate to Chinese historians and as Moghulistan to Russian historians, the culture of the Karakhanids dominated the largely Muslim state, and the Buddhist populations of the former Karakhoja Idikut-ate largely converted to the Muslim faith. All Chagatai-speaking Muslims, regardless whether they lived in Turpan or Kashgar, became known by their occupations as Moghols (ruling class), Sarts (merchants and townspeople) and Taranchis (farmers). This triple division of classes among the same Muslim Turkic folk also existed in Transoxiana, regardless whether they were under Timurid or Chagatay. The Eastern Chagatai Khanate was marked by instability and internecine warfare kingdoms, with Kashgar, Yarkant and Qomul as major centers. Some Chagatay princes allied with the Timurids and Uzbeks of Transoxiana, and some sought help from the Buddhist Kalmyks. The Chagatay prince Mirza Haidar Kurgan escaped his war-torn homeland Kashgar in the early 16th century to Timurid Tashkent, only to be evicted by the invading Shaybanids. Escaping to the protection of his Mughal Timurid cousins, then rulers of Delhi, India, he gained his final post as governor of Kashmir, and wrote the famous Tarikh-i-Rashidi, widely acclaimed as the most comprehensive work on the Uyghur civilization during the East Turkestani Chagatay reign.PHI Persian Literature in Translation. The Khojijans were originally the Aq Tagh tariqa of the Naqshbandi order, which originated in Timurid Transoxiana. Struggles between two prominent Naqshbandi tariqas, the Aq Taghlik and the Kara Taghlik, engulfed the Eastern Chagatai domain in the late 17th century. Apaq Khoja triumphed both as a national religious and political leader. The last ruling Chagatay princess married one of the ruling Khojijan princes (descendants of Apaq) and became known as Khanum Pasha. She ruled brutally after the death of her husband, and singlehandedly slaughtered many of her Khojijan and Chagatayid rivals. She was known to have boiled alive the last Chagatayid princess who could have continued the dynasty. The Khojijan dynasty fell into chaos, despite the brutality of Khanum Pasha. During the Ming Turpan Border Wars, the Chinese Ming dynasty defeated invasions by the Uyghur Kingdom of Turpan. The Zhengde Emperor of the Ming dynasty had a homosexual relationship with a Uyghur Muslim leader from Hami. His name was Sayyid Husain, and he served as Muslim overseer in Hami during the Ming Turpan Border Wars. In addition to having relationships with men, the Zhengde Emperor also had relationships with women. He sought the daughters of many of his officials. The other Muslim in his court, a Central Asian called Yu Yung, sent Uighur women dancers to the emperor's quarters for sexual purposes. The emperor favored non Chinese women, such as Mongols and Uighur. The Zhengde Emperor was noted for having a Uighur woman as one of his favorite concubines. Her last name was Ma, and she was reportedly trained in military and musical arts, in archery, horse riding, and singing music from Turkestan. The invading of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty over the Jungars brought Qing military governorship to the Ili Valley north of Tarim basin. Khojijan princes struggled against Qing rule until the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the Xinhai Revolution.  Occupation and control of Qing dynasty 1760s‚Äì1860s  The Qing dynasty conquered Moghulistan in the 18th century.Map of China It invaded Dzungaria in 1759 and dominated it until 1864. The territory was renamed Xinjiang, soon after the Qing invasion of the Dzungars. \\"Historians estimate that a million people were slaughtered, and the land so devastated that it took a generation for it to recover.\\"Tyler, Christian. (2003). Wild West China: The Untold Story of a Frontier Land, John Murray, London. . p. 55. A widespread slave trade in Xinjiang was taking place. The Uyghurs were administered by a system of begs under the control of Manchu Military officials. The Han Hui (currently known as Hui Chinese) and Han Chinese had to wear the queue to demonstrate loyalty to the dynasty, but Turkic Muslims like the Chanto Hui (Uyghur) and Sala Hui (Salars) did not have to wear the queue.Morris Rossabi (2005). Governing China's Multiethnic Frontiers. University of Washington Press. . p. 22. After the invasion of Kashgar by Jahangir Khoja, Turkistani Muslim begs and officials in Xinjiang eagerly fought for \\"privilege\\" of wearing a queue to show their steadfast loyalty to the Empire. High ranking begs were granted this right. The eagerness of Turki begs to voluntarily wear the queue contrasted with the Han and Hui, who were forced to wear it.James A. Millward (1998). Beyond the pass: economy, ethnicity, and empire in Qing Central Asia, 1759‚Äì1864. Stanford University Press. . p. 204. Chinese did not distinguish between the Turki Uyghurs and the Central Asian invaders under Jahangir, killing Turks who tried to bribe Chinese and sought refuge with them. Many Chinese and Chinese Muslims (Dungan) had been killed by Jahangir, so they were eager for revenge.Christian Tyler (2004). Wild West China: the taming of Xinjiang. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press. . p. 68. Yettishar In the revolt of 1864, the Uyghurs were successful in expelling the Qing Dynasty officials from East Turkestan, and founded an independent Kashgaria kingdom, called Yettishar (English: \\"country of seven cities\\"). Under the leadership of Yakub Beg, it included Kashgar, Yarkand, Hotan, Aksu, Kucha, Korla and Turpan. The kingdom was recognized by the Ottoman Empire (1873), Tsarist Russia (1872), and Great Britain (1874), which established a mission in the capital, Kashgar. Uyghur Muslim forces under Yaqub Beg declared a Jihad against Chinese Muslims under Tuo Ming (T'o Ming) during the Dungan revolt. The Uyghurs thought that the Chinese Muslims were Shafi\`i, and since the Uyghurs were Hanafi, they should wage war against them. Yaqub Beg enlisted non-Muslim Han Chinese militia under Xu Xuehong (Hsu Hsuehkung) in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub in the Battle of Urumqi (1870), who planned to conquer Dzungaria. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory. At Kuldja some Taranchi Turkic Muslims massacred Chinese Muslims, forcing them to flee into Ili. Large Qing (Manchu) Dynasty forces under General Zuo Zongtang attacked Kashgaria in 1876. Fearing Tsarist expansion into East Turkestan, Great Britain supported the Qing invasion forces through loans by British banks (mostly through Boston Bank, located in Hong Kong). Qing reconquest After this invasion, East Turkestan was renamed \\"Xinjiang\\" or \\"Sinkiang\\", which itself means \\"New Dominion\\" or \\"New Territory\\" but should really known as \\"Old Territory Newly Returned\\" \\"ÊóßÁñÜÊñ∞ÂΩí\\" and was shortened to \\"Xingjiang\\" \\"Êñ∞ÁñÜ\\" in Chinese, by the Qing empire on 18 November 1884. Meanwhile, the \\"Great Game\\" between Russia and Britain was underway in Central Asia, with former ethnic cultures from Afghanistan through Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to Uyghurstan being divided. Artificial lines drawn between Shiite speakers of Eastern Persian and Tajik and Sunni Chagatai speakers within the same Uzbek cultural sphere gave rise to the modern Tajik and Uzbek nationalities, whereas the rather similar Sart-Taranchi populations around Kashgar(Xinjiang) and Andijan(Uzbekistan) divided into Uyghur and Uzbeks, Turpan, Hami, Korla, Kashgar, Yarkant, Yengihissar, Hotan, Yining through the Tarim Basin and the edges of Xinjiang, were categorized as Uyghur. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, the sedentary Uyghur inhabitants of the oases around the Tarim speaking Qarluq/Old Uyghur-Chagatay dialects, were largely known as Taranchi, Sart, ruled by their Moghul rulers of Khojijan. Other parts of the Islamic World still knew this area as Moghulistan or as the eastern part of Turkestan. Before being reorganized as the province of 'Xinjiang' by Qing, this region was more often known as Hui Jiang in China, or \\"Islamic territory\\".  Republican era 1910‚Äì1949  The Uyghur identified themselves to each other by their oasis, as 'Keriyanese', 'Khotanese', or 'Kashgari'. The Soviets met with the Uyghur in 1921 during a meeting of Turkic leaders in Tashkent. This meeting established the Revolutionary Uyghur Union (Inqilawi Uyghur Itipaqi), a communist nationalist organization that opened underground sections in principal cities of Kashgaria and was active until 1926, when the Soviets recognized the post Qing Sinkiang Government and concluded trade agreements with it. By 1920, Uyghur nationalism had become a challenge to Chinese warlord Yang Zengxin (Êù®Â¢ûÊñ∞) who controlled Siankiang. Turpan poet Abdulhaliq, having spent his early years in Semipalatinsk (modern Semey) and the Jadid intellectual centres in Uzbekistan, returned to Sinkiang with a pen name that he later styled as a surname: \\"Uyghur\\". He wrote the famous nationalist poem Oyghan, which opened with the line \\"Ey pekir Uyghur, oyghan!\\" (Hey poor Uyghur, wake up!). He was later martyred by the Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai in Turpan in March, 1933 for inciting Uyghur nationalist sentiments through his works. There were several Uighur factions during Yang's rule in Xinjiang, which did not intermarry and were fierce rivals. The Qarataghlik Uighurs were content to live under Chinese rule, while the Agtachlik Uighurs were hostile to Chinese rule. Uyghur independence activists staged several uprisings against post Qing and Sheng-Kuomintang rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully regained their independence(backed by the Soviet Joseph Stalin): the First East Turkestan Republic was a short-lived attempt at independence of land around Kashghar, and it was destroyed by Chinese Muslim army under General Ma Zhancang and Ma Fuyuan at the Battle of Kashgar (1934). The Uyghurs had revolted with the Kirghiz who were another Turkic people. The Kirghiz were angry at the Chinese Muslims for crushing their Kirghiz Rebellion so they and the Uyghurs in Kashgar targeted Chinese Muslims for killing along with Han Chinese during their revolt. The Second East Turkistan Republic existed from 1944 to 1949 in what is now Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. The Ili Rebellion was fought by the Kuomintang against the Second East Turkestan Republic, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic. The pro independence Uighurs were divided between pro Turkey and pro Soviet factions. They confronted each other violently.  1949‚Äìpresent  Map of East Turkestan (Xinjiang), the prefectures with Uyghur majority are in blue In 1949, after the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang) lost the civil war in China, Second East Turkestan Republic's rulers refused to form a confederate relation within Mao Zedong's People's Republic of China; however, a plane crash killed many of the East Turkestan Republic's delegation. The surviving leader, Saifuddin Azizi, joined the Chinese Communist Party and professed loyalty to the PRC.Wang, Ke- wen (1998). Modern China: an encyclopedia of history, culture, and nationalism. Taylor & Francis. p. 103. Soon afterward, General Wang Zhen marched on East Turkestan through the deserts, suppressing anti-invasion uprisings. Mao turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and appointed Azizi as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where they are the largest ethnic group.

On 26 October 1897, McLeod defeated Martin Burns to win the American Heavyweight Championship, which he would retain for four years. The most notable incident during his reign as champion came far away from the media spotlight when on 18 June 1899, McLeod met and defeated a young Frank Gotch in a hard-fought impromptu match on a cinder track. It was Gotch's very first professional match and he later recounted that McLeod had hustled all involved by pretending to be a simple furniture dealer from a neighboring town, but was sufficiently impressed by Gotch's talent to leave him a visiting card revealing his true identity. Gotch would go on to defeat McLeod on multiple occasions after much training under Martin \\"Farmer\\" Burns. McLeod occasionally used the \\"catch name\\" alias George Little.

The plot tells the story of Ken, a high school delinquent turned down by the girl he loved, Yumin, who promptly left Japan to become a police officer in Korea. Yearning to see the girl he loved, Ken dropped out of high school to travel to Korea and become an officer just like Yumin. Though Ken managed to travel to Korea, he found himself unable to become an officer and instead became a poor Shut-in with no money or job. After saving an old man from being abused by a group gang members, he was scouted by the head of a local gang led by Tae-Soo Park, who made him the new boss. The manga was licensed by JManga, but is now available through a read-only/print-only subscription at BookWalker and Crunchyroll. It was announced in Young King fourth issue of 2016 that the manga will end on February 22, 2016. Plot The story revolves around Ken (the main protagonist), a man from an upper-class family that was orphaned young due to his family's involvement with the Yakuza; he became a highschool delinquent known for fighting. The only thing that motivates him to take action is through his romantic affections for a classmate, Yumi. After learning she decided to move to Korea to become a police officer, Ken left his life in Japan behind and tried to follow in Yumin's footsteps; due to unforeseen circumstances, he incidentally becomes the head of a local gang and tries to hide it from Yumin. As the leader, the gang is renamed the Sun-Ken Rock Group. At the first, the gang only consisted of few members and didn't even have a base. As the story progresses The Sun-Ken Rock gang becomes bigger as they recruited new members and take over other gangs' territories and investments. The Sun-Ken Rock Group acquires an MMORPG company, a large casino, one of the biggest television media companies in Korea, as well as garnering political favors (making them the most powerful gang in Korea). However, throughout all of this, Ken has done his best to evade revealing himself to Yumin as a gang leader as she despises gangs. Ironically, Yumin was groomed to become an advanced plant in Korea to help her Yakuza group lay the foundations to expand their hold into South Korea; due to Yumin's refusal to join the \\"family business,\\" their plans were stalled as various members either tried to take her back to Japan or try to get her back into Yakuza control. In between Ken's rise, he and Yumin got closer and Yumin started to have feelings for Ken. However, things were always complicated by the interference of either Ken's gang activities and/or Yumin's Yakuza connections. The series, despite being very adult-oriented, espouses many shonen-esque values, such as the importance of friendship and the concept of being a \\"true man\\". The turning point in the story was when she was kidnapped by her own group and Ken was exposed as a gang leader in his attempts to rescue her from his greatest rival, Kim Ban Phong (a Vietnamese-Korean that has a vicious score to settle with Ken). The manga has three spin-offs \\"Dango Knight \\", \\"Sun Ken Rock Gaiden - Yumin\\" and \\"I Want Feed Yumin\\". Characters ; :A high-school delinquent and the primary protagonist who drops out of school and leaves Japan in pursuit of his love, Yumin. While in Korea he lives his life as a shut-in for an entire year being unable to find an actual job. After saving an old man from being killed by loan sharks, he was scouted and invited to join a local gang (gondal) to work under Tae-soo as one of his underlings. After fighting against Tae-soo, he was offered the position of boss instead. He initially declined since he wanted to join the police force alongside Yumin but Tae-soo eventually manipulates him into taking the position. His strength and sense of justice earns him the loyalty of his gang and the local community. As the leader of the Sun-Ken Rock Gang, he often hides his true identity from others (ex.: he tells Yumin he works at a video game company as a cover). Ken's parents were killed during a Yakuza war when he was 13. The manga ends with him handing all of his businesses over to Yumi, so that he and his gang can act as protectors of Japan rather than criminals, with the final panel showing him driving by the place where he first told Yumi he loved her, with the implication that, though they can never be together, Ken will always love her. The character design of Ken is heavily influenced from Vash of Trigun Manga. ; :Ken's love interest, a girl that left Japan to become a cop in the department in charge of organized crime. She initially claims to be a Korean girl by the name of Yumin, as she did not want anyone to be suspicious of her immediately leaving for Korea out of the blue. Her true name is Yumi and she is actually Japanese. She hates gangsters, later it is discovered that she is the daughter of a Japanese Yakuza Boss that killed Ken's parents. Her hatred of gangs is due to her mother and sister being killed by other Yakuza when she was young. As the daughter of a Yakuza boss, she has mastered some martial arts and is a very capable fighter. She also has feelings for Ken while not knowing he is an underworld boss. Later she was kidnapped by Kim Ban-Phuong's gang who hold her as their hostage. She is shocked when she finds that Ken is the boss from Ban- Phuong. Feeling betrayed at first, she confronts Ken only to forgive him after an apology later, after which she cheers him on the duel with Ban-Phuong. The two decide to attack her father's headquarters, but decide to first take time off at a popular vacation hotspot and finally make love in a church during a storm. It is eventually revealed that Yumi had been manipulating Ken to help her seize control of the White Dragon Clan at first, only to actually fall in love with him. After the two kill Ryu, Yumi destroys the White Dragon Clan headquarters and takes control of the organization, though she has become depressed over her feelings for Ken, which had changed into self-loathing for having betrayed his love. ; :A Korean gangster and the true mastermind behind most of the gang's more underhanded actions. Originally the boss of the gang, he passed leadership over to Ken as he realized his potential and charisma. He serves as Ken's right hand man, and has numerous underground connections and is in charge of handling the day-to-day business of the gang. He can be seen as the real evil behind the gang and is often doing dirty works for the gang, but his loyalty to Ken is unquestionable. He took over the gang after his father was killed. He was put into a coma by Ban-Phuong but later recovers. :While he initially puts full trust in Ken, the difference between their principles eventually renders their positions as 1st and 2nd in command in the gang blurry. He eventually usurps control from Ken in a bloodless coup, only to reveal that it was a ploy to make himself the scapegoat for all of Sun-Ken Rock Group's crimes and allow Ken and their friends to fight the White Dragon Clan without worry. ; :One of the original members of Tae-Soo's gang and one of Ken's henchman. He dislikes Ken and often comes into conflict with him. While his loyalty is sometimes questionable, he is highly competitive and does not back down from a fight. He left his village when he was 16 after he had sex with a farmer's wife. Later on San-dae finds his hometown turned into a US Army base and realizes that he can never go back to his previous life. His nickname comes from the fact that he uses an actual pickaxe in combat.

Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 12 They were well known for various stunts at Conservative Party meetings and conferences (acting as a constant irritant to the party). As time progressed, the group became primarily concerned with opposing non- white immigration into Britain and were instrumental in the founding (with other right-wing and neo-Nazi groups) of the National Front in February 1967. =White Defence League= The White Defence League was formed in 1958 as a splinter group from the League of Empire Loyalists, formed from those who resented the LEL's refusal to contest elections and its strong links to the Conservative Party. The WDL was vehemently against non-white immigration and used the provocative marching techniques popularised by Oswald Mosley, although with much less support than Mosley had in his heyday. In 1960 the party merged with the National Labour Party to form the old British National Party.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982M.

The widow of Arnold Leese served as vice-president of the party. The party's main policies were an end to immigration, repatriation of immigrants and belief in an international Jewish conspiracy.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p. 178 Elements within the party also expressed support for Nazism and a paramilitary arm, Spearhead, was set up by Tyndall. The BNP managed to secure an 8.1% share of the vote in Deptford in the 1960 London County Council (LCC) elections, a large result for a new party without name recognition. After some in-fighting Jordan and Tyndall left in 1962 to set up the National Socialist Movement, leaving the BNP in the hands of Bean. The group merged into the National Front in 1967. =The National Socialist Movement= The National Socialist Movement was formed on 20 April 1962, Adolf Hitler's birthday, by Colin Jordan, with John Tyndall as his deputy.Roger Eatwell \\"Obituary: John Tyndall\\", The Independent, 21 July 2005 as a splinter group from the original British National Party.

Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 15 =The British Movement= The British Movement (BM), later called the British National Socialist Movement (BNSM), was a neo-Nazi political party founded by Colin Jordan in 1968 as a continuation of the NSM. It contested the UK general elections in 1970 and in February 1974 on a neo- Nazi platform, attracting little support. Michael McLaughlin became the leader in 1975 and won the BM new support from the growing racist skinhead and football hooligan movements.N. Lowles & S.

The group attracted local pockets of support but struggled to cope with the emergence of the National Front the following year and faded in the 1970s. =The National Front= The National Front (NF) was formed in 1967 by the amalgamation of a number of other groups. Initially led by A.K. Chesterton it went through a number of stages of development. John Tyndall led the party twice during the 1970s, a time marked by his clashes with John O'Brien and John Kingsley Read, the latter forming his own National Party in 1976. Nonetheless the NF also reached its zenith in terms of support during the 1970s and had as many as 20,000 members in 1974.Nigel Fielding, The National Front, Taylor & Francis, 1981, p.38 The NF failed to make any headway at the 1979 general election, resulting in the group falling apart as various factions left to found the British Democratic Party, the Constitutional Movement and the New National Front. Under Andrew Brons the remaining members were regrouped for a time but in 1986 the NF fell apart completely as two parties, the Official National Front and the Flag Group, emerged. The Flag Group eventually regained control of the NF name in 1990 and the party has continued to date, albeit very much in the shadow of the British National Party. =The National Independence Party= The National Independence Party was a minor farright group established in the late 1960s that was close to John O'Brien. Although never a national force the party enjoyed support in the London Borough of Haringey where it had a councillor elected. =Minor groups= The Anti-Communist Commando was led by Victor Norris, a pro-Rhodesia activist and sometime member of the National Socialist Group, throughout the 1960s.

When the programme was broadcast, the BDP was left badly discredited.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 101‚Äì115 (Ultimately, when he returned to Britain, no charges were laid).

The Party comprised some of his neighbours in South Oxhey. The group had connections in France and these were exposed in 1984 by the Channel 4 documentary about Ray Hill, during which Malski was shown by a hidden camera claiming to have imported explosives. The NSAP went into immediate decline after this expos√©. Malski, who was dismissed by many on the far right in Britain as something of a Walter Mitty character, has occasionally surfaced at meetings, including speeches by David Irving, although the NSAP is defunct. The party's last appearance in the public eye came in 1986 when member Graham Paton was convicted of sending propaganda and a concealed razor blade to an anti-apartheid activist.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 189 Most recently he has been found guilty of racially harassing his neighbour, a woman of Pakistani origin.Racist taunts land neighbour in court He has, on occasion, stood for election to St Albans District Council, as an independent. =Our Nation= Our Nation was a minor movement briefly led by Martin Webster. He set it up after his expulsion from the NF in December 1983 but it proved unsuccessful. =Official National Front= The Official National Front was one of the two groups into which the NF split in 1986. Its members belonged to the \\"Political Soldier\\" tendency that eschewed electoral politics. Leading members included Nick Griffin, Derek Holland and Patrick Harrington. It disappeared in 1990 with the emergence of the Third Way. =Flag Group= The Flag Group was the other of the two NF factions. It sought to continue on the path previously followed by the NF in contesting elections and organising on a strongly anti-immigration basis. This group eventually regained control of the NF name. =International Third Position= The International Third Position was established in 1989 as a breakaway from the Official National Front after Patrick Harrington had sought a compromise with some radical Jews.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, pp. 45‚Äì46 Sharing the Political Soldier mission of its predecessor the ITP is still in existence as a minor group. =Minor groups= White Nationalist Crusade was set up in 1981 in an attempt to bring a number of the divided far right groups under one banner. Although its members included veterans such as Robert Relf it failed to achieve its goal of providing a rallying point.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 195 The Association of British Ex-Servicemen (ABEX), a parody of the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen, was established by British National Party founder Kenneth McKilliam in the early 1980s as vigilant group for Brixton. The aim was not fulfilled and ABEX disappeared. The National Action Party was set up by Eddy Morrison and Kevin Randall in the early 1980s and existed in some from for around ten years. With a strongly neo-Nazi ideology the group came under Randall's sole control when Morrison was expelled in 1986.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 186 The UK Patriotic Front was a minor extreme right-wing party that contested some council seats in the urbanised parts Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. It was formed during early 1982 by Brenda Steele and June Merrikin. John Tyndall thought it was too pro- European to join forces with the BNP. Peter Knowle was also a major figure at the time. Carol Prentiss and Jo Butcher took over the leadership in early 1984 and it was dissolved later that year. The National Socialist Workers Initiative, active in the early 1980s, was a Neo-Nazi group which also drew on elements of Ecofascism. Leading members included National Socialist Action Party leader Tony Malski, National Socialist Movement veteran David Thorne and other far-right stalwarts including Ian Kerr-Ritchie and Bill Whitbread.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 190 English Solidarity was established by Jane Birdwood in 1988. Along with Birdwood's other groups, the Self-Help Organisation and the Gentile Self-Defence League, the group was strongly anti-Semitic and co- operated with the BNP.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 182 1990s=National Democrats= The National Democrats were established by Ian Anderson in 1995 as a new name for the Flag Group-controlled NF. The move resulted in a split in the movement. The party contested the 1997 general election but made little headway and several prominent members, including Simon Darby and Martin Wingfield, re- emerged as BNP members. The party was effectively defunct long before Anderson's death in February 2011. =National Socialist Movement= The National Socialist Movement (NSM) was a British neo-Nazi group, best known in the UK for its association with David Copeland, the London nail-bomber, who was a member, and local unit leader for his area. The group was a splinter from Combat 18 in 1997 and in the few years that it existed was thought to have only had around 80 supporters. Two of its members, Charlie Sargent and Martin Cross, are serving life sentences for murder. The group's publications include Column 88, White Dragon and The Order. Prominent members include leader Tony Williams, founding member Steve Sargent, and David Myatt, the group's first leader. =Minor groups= British Resistance was the brainchild of Rosine de Bounevialle, the editor of Candour. The group's activities included hosting training camps and co-ordinating activities with other far- right organisations.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 179 2000s=White Nationalist Party= The White Nationalist Party (WNP) was founded in May 2002 as \\"the British political wing of Aryan Unity\\".Sykes, Alan The Radical Right in Britain Palgrave (2005), p 147Aryan Unity website The party was formed by Eddy Morrison, and Kevin Watmough \\"a key figure in Combat 18\\" and webmaster of Redwatch.Searchlight Magazine A highly radical party it no longer exists. =England First Party= The England First Party was formed by Mark Cotterill in 2004 and held two council seats in Blackburn for a spell. The party stood candidates in the 2010 local elections and has sought to co-operate with the English Democrats Party. It no longer exists. =Nationalist Alliance= The Nationalist Alliance was formed in 2005 in a largely failed attempt to unite groups to the right of the BNP. Its main leaders were initially Eddy Morrison and John G. Wood, both leading figures in the White Nationalist Party which it effectively replaced. The party was damaged by a schism that led to the formation of the British Peoples' Party and its registration with the Electoral Commission lapsed in December 2008.Searchlight, No. 391, January 2008, p. 23 =British Peoples' Party= The British Peoples' Party was a splinter group from the Nationalist Alliance established by Eddy Morrison in 2005. It also contested the 2010 local elections, albeit with a single candidate. =New Nationalist Party= The New Nationalist Party was a small party founded by former members of the BNP in 2006. It was based in the West Midlands and its most prominent member was the former BNP member Sharon Ebanks, who earlier in 2006 was briefly a councillor in the Kingstanding ward in Birmingham before being forced to resign when it was shown that she had been awarded it due to counting irregularities despite losing the election.Birmingham Kingstanding ‚Äì the hidden story (archived version)Register of Political Parties: New Nationalist Party (archived version) =Epping Community Action Group= Ian Anderson was the leader of the short-lived and allegedly far right Epping Community Action Group, which was registered with the Electoral Commission as a political party in April 2006.Electoral Commission registration The group stood two candidates, including Anderson, for election to Epping Forest District Council in the 2007 local elections, but came third in both wards.

The organisation was founded in 2013 by Benjamin Raymond and Alex Davies. Raymond is a former double-glazing salesman who graduated in Politics from Essex University and Davies is a former member of the Young BNP. Raymond has described his organisation as \\"like the BNP but more radical\\". The group was secretive, and had rules to prevent members from talking openly about the organisation. National Action attempted to gain attention through demonstrations and flashy videos. This included instances of violence towards police and counter-protestors. One of its supporters, Zach Davies, was convicted of attempted murder, which he stated was motivated by wanting to \\"avenge Lee Rigby's murder\\", and he spoke of \\"white power\\". National Action sought to deny any link with Davies, but other members have been arrested for threats or violence, including Garron Helm for religiously motivated threats against Luciana Berger MP on Twitter. National Action spread propaganda on at least 12 university campuses. Their first protest involved an attempt to deface the statue of Nelson Mandela in London. The group was proscribed in December 2016 after they celebrated the murder of Jo Cox MP by Thomas Mair, with comments including \\"Don't let this man's sacrifice go in vain.\\" =Britannica Party= The Britannica Party is a small party founded by Charles Baillie. =Britain First= Britain First, a far-right group founded by Jim Dowson who had formerly worked a call centre for the BNP before leaving after allegedly groping a female employee.BNP money man quits after model accuses him of groping her in hotel room.

The trio were concerned about an uptick in foreclosures and evictions meted out against low-income Bostonians due to the subprime mortgage crisis and set out to inform the occupants of foreclosed homes of their legal rights under the state laws of Massachusetts. Project No One Leaves makes use of newly filed foreclosures in the area to create a database of affected residences. Residents are then contacted in person by volunteers with the project, which include students at Harvard Law School and eight other Boston- area law schools and colleges, as well as undergraduates and members of concerned community groups. In 2009, more than 1,000 people living in foreclosed properties were contacted by Project No One Leaves and informed of their legal rights, with a view to helping keep victims of foreclosure in their own homes. Canvassers encourage residents to attend meetings of City Life/Vida Urbana to meet others in similar straits and help interested individuals to make contact with Harvard Legal Aid's Foreclosure Task Force and other legal aid organizations.Foreclosure Task Force information page.

His maternal grandparents were Poul Capizucchi di Cassini and Elisabeth Loy af Triest. =Family= His paternal grandfather, Carl Graf von Moltke (1798‚Äì1866), was a cousin of Adam Wilhelm Moltke (1785‚Äì1864), the first Danish Prime Minister in the Danish constitutional monarchy, and the great-grandson of Adam Gottlob Moltke (1710‚Äì1792), a Danish courtier, statesman and diplomat, and favourite of Frederick V of Denmark. His family was very involved in both Danish and German history. Career From 1908 to 1912, Moltke was the Danish Ambassador to the United States. He later represented his country as the Ambassador to Germany in Berlin. In 1920, the secretary of the Danish legation in Berlin during World War I, Count Bent Holstein, brought serious charges against Moltke, saying: > The radical Government tried every way to strangle the Slesvig question. The > Danish Ambassador in Berlin thus went to the German Foreign Department > during the war proposing that Germany give very many iron crosses to men > from North Slesvig in order to make them forget Denmark. Not a German, but > the Danish Ambassador under the Zahles Government tried Danish souls with > German iron crosses. In 1924, he was chosen by Thorvald Stauning, the first social democratic Prime Minister of Denmark, to be the Foreign Minister of Denmark, serving from 23 April 1924 to 14 December 1926, until Thomas Madsen-Mygdal became Prime Minister. In February and March 1930, he served as the chairman of the \\"Conference for Concerted Economic Action\\" in Geneva as part of the League of Nations. As chairman, he urged European economic unity to better conditions throughout the world with the aid of the Belgian Foreign Minister, Paul Hymans (who later served as the 2nd President of the League of Nations). He envisioned a broad conception of European economic organization and proposed a tariff truce, which he described as \\"the consolidation of duties.\\" Personal life On 29 June 1907, he married Cornelia Van Rensselaer Thayer Robb (1881‚Äì1960), an American who was the daughter of Nathaniel Thayer III. She was born in Boston and was the granddaughter of Nathaniel Thayer Jr. (1808‚Äì1883), who married Cornelia Paterson, the daughter of Stephen Van Rensselaer IV. She was also descended from Thomas Cornell as well as the Bayard, Livingston, and Schuyler families. At the wedding, Baron Rosencrantz was his best man. Together, they had a son: * Count Carl Adam Moltke (1908‚Äì1989), a member of the Danish underground in World War II, who married Mabel Wilson Wright (n√©e Comstock) in 1944 (1909‚Äì1988).

It was originally a Roman temple. In the 10th Century, the structure was modified and consecrated as a church and it was extensively altered in the 17th Century. History Reconstruction of the original appearance of the fa√ßade The original construction on the site was a pagan temple or perhaps a tomb, from around 160 AD. This is believed to have been dedicated to Ceres and Faustina, wife of Antoninus Pius, although one early historian, Pompilio Totti, believed that it was dedicated to Bacchus.Kirstin Noreen, \\"Sant‚ÄôUrbano alla Caffarella, Rome: Reconstruction of an ancient memorial\\", Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 47 (2002) The site lies on land that was formerly part of the Triopio, an estate owned by the Roman Senator of Greek origin, Herodes Atticus and his wife Aspasia Annia Regilla. It is considered that the temple was also dedicated to her by her husband after her death at the hands of one of his freed slaves.Comune di Roma The church was built over the temple in the 10th Century and was dedicated to St. Urban who was Pope from 222-230. Internal frescoes were added in the 12th Century. Often abandoned, the church was eventually restored by Pope Urban VIII and his nephew Cardinal Francesco Barberini, beginning in 1634. Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte was buried there. The columns at the front are in marble bought from Greece by Herodes Atticus.Parco Regionale Appia Antica, Guide ai servizi delle aree naturali protette del Lazio They originally formed part of a portico but walls between them were added during this renovation in order to provide stability. Interior fresco showing crucifixion of Christ Even after the renovation, the church‚Äôs remote position meant that it was often subject to vandalism and it was eventually abandoned. In 1962 it was annexed by the owner of the neighbouring property. The building was acquired by the city of Rome in 2002 and given to the Diocese of Rome and now serves as a rectory in the parish of San Sebastiano fuori le mura. It underwent restoration in 2010-11. Open to the public only on Sunday mornings prior to restoration, it was still closed to the public in late 2015, with the exception of occasional guided tours.
