It lies in an east to west direction and is approximately southeast of Loch Arienas and east of Loch Aline. It is long and wide, and is at an altitude of . The average depth is and its maximum depth is . The loch was surveyed on 18 August 1904 by James Murray as part of Sir John Murray's Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland 1897-1909. In the centre of the loch is a small, circular island which is thought to be the remains of a crannog. It is in diameter, built of timber and stone, and has two small inlets for boats. It is likely to have been occupied since the Middle Ages, and in local tradition it was said to have been used as a sanctuary for fugitives under the protection of the Lords of the Isles. In 2009 the company Hydroplan began construction of a hydroelectricity generating facility at the outflow of the loch. Power generation began in December 2012, and the scheme was officially opened in May 2013. In 2008, prior to construction of the hydro scheme, an archaeological survey was undertaken in and around the loch which documented 31 archaeological sites. The loch holds native wild brown trout and permits are required to fish the loch.

Blue coloring indicates low radar reflectivity areas, caused by bodies of liquid ethane, methane and dissolved nitrogen. Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T) is a space mission concept that would investigate the evolution and habitability of the Saturnian satellites Enceladus and Titan and is proposed by the European Space Agency in collaboration with NASA. The proposed mission would address key scientific questions regarding extraterrestrial habitability, abiotic/prebiotic chemistry and emergence of life, which are among the highest priorities of ESA's Cosmic Vision program. Overview The Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T) orbiter was first proposed in 2017 as a medium-class mission led by the European Space Agency in collaboration with NASA in response to ESA's M5 Cosmic Vision programme. Both Enceladus and Titan harbour subsurface oceans that are prime environments in which to investigate the conditions for the emergence of life and the habitability potential of ocean worlds as well as the origin and evolution of unique complex planetary systems. Goals The E2T mission has three scientific goals: *Investigate the origin and evolution of volatile-rich icy worlds by examining both Enceladus and Titan *Investigate the habitability and potential for life in ocean worlds on both Enceladus and Titan *Investigate Titan as an Earth-like world with an evolving climate and landscape. These goals would be accomplished by measuring the nature, abundance and isotopic properties of solid- and vapor-phase species in Enceladus' plume and Titan's upper atmosphere. Conceptual payload The payload would provide in-situ sampling, high-resolution imaging and radio science measurements from multiple flybys of Enceladus and Titan using a solar-electric powered spacecraft in orbit around Saturn. The two main instruments proposed are the Ion and Neutral Gas Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and the Enceladus Icy Jet Analyzer (ENIJA); these high resolution mass spectrometers would provide the data needed to discern the subtle details of the aqueous environment of Enceladus from plume sampling and of the complex pre-biotic chemistry occurring in Titan's atmosphere. The Titan Imaging and Geology, Enceladus Reconnaissance (TIGER) mid-wave infrared camera would map thermal emission from the plumes and Enceladus' tiger stripes at meter scales and investigate Titan's geomorphology at 50‚Äì100 m resolution. The Radio Science Experiment (RSE) measurements would provide constraints on the ice shell structure and the properties of the internal oceans of Enceladus and Titan. Propulsion The spacecraft concept calls for using an ion drive propulsion, proven to be extremely efficient and reliable. An ion thruster ‚Äîor ion drive‚Äî is a form of electric propulsion that creates thrust by accelerating ions with electricity. The required electricity is generated by solar panels mounted on the spacecraft.

Life  After his father Zhao Cui's death, Zhao Dun first appeared in the political theatre of Jin in 621 BCE when Jin army was having a military parade in Yi. Yang Chufu, his father's acquaintance, recommended Dun to the duke of Jin. Later, Dun's power was secured and the duke entrusted him the regency.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Wen, 6th year of Upon Duke Xiang of Jin's death in the autumn of 621 BCE, Dun installed his young son Yigao as the duke of Jin. Before the installation, Jin's nobles favored Duke Xiang's younger brother Yong. The mother of Yigao, Consort Muying of Qin, feared the possible persecution after Yong's accession. She came to Dun's house and begged him of his support of Yigao. Dun unwillingly accepted her request and made Yigao the next duke of Jin. In this year, Hu Juju of Hu clan(a kin of the Jin duke) executed Yang Chufu because Yang threatened Hu clan's political interests. Dun in turn executed Juju. In the autumn of 620 BCE, Zhao participated the league of Hu. He represented the state of Jin since the young duke was not able to perform such task. In the same year, he returned some of the lands occupied by Jin to the state of Wey.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Wen, 7th year of In the spring of 618 BCE, Chu invaded the state of Zheng, Dun reinforced Zheng with other states.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Wen, 9th year of In 615 BCE, Duke Kang of Qin invaded Jin's Jima. Dun, along with Xun Linfu, Xi Que, Fan Wuxu, and Luan Dun encountered the Qin force in the battle of Hequ. The two sides were not able to best each other and the battle resulted a draw. During the battle of Hequ, a Jin noble named Han Jue was intentionally tested by Zhao Dun, Han proved himself to be an upright person in the battle and Zhao promoted him to the position of Sima(Âè∏È¶¨).Guoyu, Volume 11, Jinyu 5. When the young duke Yigao grew older, Dun gradually lost his control over him. He tried altering the duke's misbehaviors by remonstrating with him. In 607, duke Ling of Jin attempted to assassinate Zhao Dun but failed. After knowing the duke's intention, Dun fled. His cousin Zhao Chuan killed the duke in a peech plantation while Dun was fleeing. Upon his return to Jin, Dun installed Duke Ling's uncle Heitun as the new duke of Jin. Zhao Dun died in 601 BCE and was succeeded by his son Zhao Shuo.

The goal of this institute was to follow a more scientific approach with regards to agricultural policies and innovations, and to promote the diffusion of agricultural innovations and know-how under the Congolese farmers. The creation of this institute was part of a larger 'indigenous peasantry programme'. This policy aimed to modernize indigenous agriculture by assigning plots of land to individual families (after rigorous prospection and soil analysis) and by providing them with government support in the form of selected seeds, agronomic advice, fertilizers, etc. The indigenous agricultural techniques were combined with new scientific discoveries, aimed at creating more efficient hybrid farming models and increasing the living standards in the traditional rural communities.Clement, Piet (2014), \\"Rural development in the Belgian Congo: the late-colonial indigenous peasantry programme and its implementation in the Equateur District\\", In Bulletin des Sc√©ances de l'Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-mer, Brussels, 60 (2), pp. 251‚Äì286 In this way, the Institute for Agronomic Study of the Belgian Congo had a vast impact on the practical implementation of the social and economic agricultural policy of the colonial government.

Oil palms have relatively low yield around Yangambi compared to coastal regions. This appears to be due to the lower night temperatures in the continental interior, which have a mean minimum at Yangambi of around . The scientific research undertaken by IN√âAC played an essential role in improving the supply of rubber and palm oil in support of the war effort during World War II. Post World War II After the second World War the indigenous peasantry programme became widely spread all over the rural parts of the Belgian Congo, based on the (economic) success of the pilot projects in the mid thirties. The Institute for Agronomic Study of the Belgian Congo also played an important role in the implementation of the Ten year plan for the economic and social development of the Belgian Congo (1950‚Äì1959), of which the agrarian development of the colony was one of the cornerstones.Drachoussoff, Vladimir, Focan, Alexandre en Hecq, Jacques (eds.), 'Le d√©veloppement rural en Afrique centrale 1908-1960/1962 : synth√®se et r√©flexions', Fondation Roi Baudouin, Bruxelles, 1991 Floribert Jurion et J. Henry, Can primitive farming be modernised?, Bruxelles, INEAC, 1969, 455 p. During this period, the institute studied a broad range of agricultural topics, gaining international reputation, with 32 research centers throughout the Belgian Congo and Rwanda-Urundi. By 1959, the scientific research department in Yangambi was made up of the divisions Climatology, Plant physiology, Agricultural engineering and mechanics, Zootechnics, Hydrobiology, Agricultural economics and a diverse range of research into specific crops. Criticism The indigenous peasantry programme was intended to increase the living conditions of the traditional rural communities, but critics state that the programme was mainly developed as a solution for the increasing soil depletion due to excessively intense cultivation and inadequate soil management. However, the paysannats programme was designed to be flexible and the implementation varied based on the geographic regions and districts. The institute has also been criticized for concentrating on large-scale agriculture mainly focused on the production of crops suited for export markets. Two years after independence, on 31 December 1962, the National Institute for Agronomic Study of the Belgian Congo (IN√âAC) changed its name into the Institut National des Etudes et Recherches Agronomique (INERA). Other Research The center developed a number of varieties of soybeans for use in different parts of the country.Early-maturing varieties yielded over 1,200 kg/ha of soybeans. Field trials showed that inoculation could increase yields by 80% to 300%. In the 1950s IN√âAC researchers discovered the 'Yangambi km 5' (AAA) dessert banana. This variety yields large numbers of small fruit with an excellent taste, is productive even on poor soils and is resistant to black leaf streak disease. There is some evidence that this cultivar may have originated in southern Thailand, introduced to the Kilo-Moto region in northeastern Congo and then brought to Yangambi before World War II.

A self- similar description is available for the solution in the following formSedov, L. I. (1993). Similarity and dimensional methods in mechanics. CRC press., :u = \\\\frac{ u}{r\\\\sin\\\\theta} f'(\\\\theta),\\\\quad v = -\\\\frac{ u}{r\\\\sin\\\\theta} f(\\\\theta). Substituting the above self-similar form into the governing equations and using the boundary conditions u=v=p-p_\\\\infty=0 at infinity, one finds the form for pressure as :\\\\frac{p-p_\\\\infty}{\\\\rho} = -\\\\frac{v^2}{2} + \\\\frac{ u u}{r} + \\\\frac{c_1}{r^2} where c_1 is a constant. Using this pressure, we find again from the momentum equation, :-\\\\frac{u^2}{r} + \\\\frac{v}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = \\\\frac{ u}{r^2} \\\\left[2u + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\right)\\\\right] + \\\\frac{2c_1}{r^3}. Replacing \\\\theta by \\\\mu=\\\\cos\\\\theta as independent variable, the velocities become : u = -\\\\frac{ u}{r} f'(\\\\mu),\\\\quad v = -\\\\frac{ u}{r} \\\\frac{f(\\\\mu)}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\mu^2}} (for brevity, the same symbol is used for f(\\\\theta) and f(\\\\mu) even though they are functionally the same, but takes different numerical values) and the equation becomes :f'^2 + ff = 2f' + [(1-\\\\mu^2)f]' - 2c_1. After two integrations, the equation reduces to :f^2 = 4\\\\mu f + 2(1-\\\\mu^2) f' - 2(c_1\\\\mu^2 + c_2 \\\\mu + c_3), where c_2 and c_3 are constants of integration. The above equation is a Riccati equation. After some calculation, the general solution can be shown to be :f = \\\\alpha(1+\\\\mu) + \\\\beta(1-\\\\mu) + \\\\frac{2(1-\\\\mu^2)(1+\\\\mu)^\\\\beta}{(1-\\\\mu)^\\\\alpha}\\\\left[c- \\\\int_1^\\\\mu \\\\frac{(1+\\\\mu)^\\\\beta}{(1-\\\\mu)^\\\\alpha}\\\\right]^{-1}, where \\\\alpha,\\\\ \\\\beta,\\\\ c are constants. The physically relevant solution to the jet corresponds to the case \\\\alpha=\\\\beta=0 (Equivalently, we say that c_1=c_2=c_3=0, so that the solution is free from singularities on the axis of symmetry, except at the origin).Batchelor, G. K. (2000). An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge university press. Therefore, :f = \\\\frac{2(1-\\\\mu^2)}{c+1-\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{c+1-\\\\cos\\\\theta}. The function f is related to the stream function as \\\\psi = u r f, thus contours of f for different values of c provides the streamlines. The constant c describes the force at the origin acting in the direction of the jet (this force is equal to the rate of momentum transfer across any sphere around the origin plus the force in the jet direction exerted by the sphere due to pressure and viscous forces), the exact relation between the force and the constant is given by :\\\\frac{F}{2\\\\pi u^2} = \\\\frac{32(c+1)}{3c(c+2)} + 8(c+1) - 4(c+1)^2\\\\ln \\\\frac{c+2}{c} . The solution describes a jet of fluid moving away from the origin rapidly and entraining the slowly moving fluid outside of the jet. The edge of the jet can be defined as the location where the streamlines are at minimum distance from the axis, i.e.,e the edge is given by :\\\\theta_o = \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1+c}\\\\right). Therefore, the force can be expressed alternatively using this semi-angle of the conical-boundary of the jet, :\\\\frac{F}{2\\\\pi u^2} = \\\\frac{32}{3}\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta_o}{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta_o} +\\\\frac{4}{\\\\cos\\\\theta_o} \\\\ln \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos\\\\theta_o}{1+\\\\cos\\\\theta_o} + \\\\frac{8}{\\\\cos\\\\theta_o}. When the force becomes large, the semi-angle of the jet becomes small, in which case, :\\\\frac{F}{2\\\\pi u^2} \\\\sim \\\\frac{32}{3\\\\theta_o^2} \\\\ll 1 and the solution inside and outside of the jet become :\\\\begin{align} f(\\\\theta)&\\\\sim \\\\frac{4\\\\theta^2}{\\\\theta^2+\\\\theta_o^2},\\\\quad \\\\theta<\\\\theta_o,\\\\\\\\\\\\ f(\\\\theta)&\\\\sim 2(1+\\\\cos\\\\theta),\\\\quad \\\\theta>\\\\theta_o. \\\\end{align} The jet in this limiting case is called the Schlichting jet. On the other extreme, when the force is small, :\\\\frac{F}{2\\\\pi u^2} \\\\sim \\\\frac{8}{c}\\\\gg 1 the semi-angle approaches 90 degree (no inside and outside region, the whole domain is considered as single region), the solution itself goes to :f(\\\\theta)\\\\sim\\\\frac{2}{c}\\\\sin^2\\\\theta.

She is considered to be the most significant 20th-century Nicaraguan sculptor. Her works are featured in public spaces throughout Nicaragua and abroad. Early life Edith Dorthe Gr√∏n was born on 19 February 1917 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Sofie (n√©e Rasmussen) and Vilhelm Andersen Gr√∏n. When she was 6 years old, in 1923, her family, which included her brother Niels, migrated to Nicaragua because her mother had been advised a warmer climate would help her arthritis. Her mother's illness coupled with the economic depression which existed in Denmark after World War I, prompted Vilhelm to bring the family to Central America. The family came with an immigration company which had contracted with the Nicaraguan government to resettle up to 2,000 Danish families in the country. One hundred settlers came in her migration group, which initially settled on a farm in the mountainous area around Matagalpa. After moving about the country several times, the family finally settled in Managua, where Vilhelm owned and operated a restaurant known as La Casa Dinamarca (\\"The Denmark House\\"). From an early age, she enjoyed producing artworks, first with paint and then clay. Gr√∏n completed both her primary and secondary education at the Colegio Bautista in Managua. In 1931, Gr√∏n was involved in a serious car accident, when her father lost control of the car, and she flew through the windshield, breaking all the bones in her face. After numerous surgeries, performed by missionary doctors visiting from North America, she recovered, but remained scarred. In 1942, she entered the National School of Fine Arts (), studying under Genaro Amador Lira, along with students like Roberto de la Selva and Fernando Saravia. In 1943, Gr√∏n won the Rub√©n Dar√≠o Art Prize, for her work Amo Muerto, which was then exhibited at the National Palace of Culture. The sculpture depicted a dog mourning at the grave of its young owner. Wanting to further her studies, Gr√∏n moved to Mexico City in 1944 to study at the Academy of San Carlos with . She studied Classic Arts and Architecture and in 1944, exhibited El Puntigado, which received notice in the Mexican press and secured her a scholarship at Columbia University in New York City. The sculpture was the figure of a crying child who had been whipped as a form of punishment. In 1946, she entered Columbia, studying ceramics and sculpture, completing her studies in 1948 and returning to Nicaragua. Career The bust of Dar√≠o which adorns the Rub√©n Dar√≠o National Theatre El Relevo, (The Relay) is in front of the Post Office, Managua From 1940 to 1952, Gr√∏n was in a relationship with Silvio Turcios, known as Bill. He was a boxer and fireman, and because of his physique, became her model for several sculptures, including the muscles for the athletes of El Relevo. According to her biographer, Jos√© Viv√≥, The Relay is known internationally as a symbol for the transfer of wisdom and knowledge. Gr√∏n held her first solo exhibit at the National Palace of Culture in 1953, exhibiting large Costumbrismo sculptures of figures and several nudes. For the centennial celebration of the Battle of San Jacinto, she sculpted , which was installed at the Hacienda San Jacinto in 1956. In 1958, she produced a sculpture of the head of journalist Gabry Rivas and that same year, she was decorated with the Order of Rub√©n Dar√≠o by the government of Nicaragua. The following year, she completed a monument dedicated to mothers, commissioned by historian Juli√°n N. Guerrero. The statue, Monumento a la Madre was installed in Boaco. Gr√∏n sculpted in clay, stone and wood, and molded in concrete and various metals. Her initial works were realistic and she strove for perfection, but she was influenced by the Romanian modernist Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, which led her to shift to more stylized forms. In 1960, she completed a statue of General Jos√© Dolores Estrada for the Nicaraguan Association of Writers and Artists. She was known for her sculptures of Rub√©n Dar√≠o, and also depicted personalities such as Josefa Toledo de Aguerri, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, among others. A 1958 sculpture of Dar√≠o was installed in a Miami, Florida park in 1961. That same year, Gr√∏n carved a stone head of Dar√≠o clothed in a Carthusian habit, titling it La Cartuja, in reference to the poet's 1913 work on the same theme. In 1962 to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the indigenous revolt against the Spanish conquistador Gil Gonz√°lez D√°vila, Gr√∏n sculpted an image of Cacique Diriang√©n to depict his courage and resistance. In 1964, she sculpted a bust of Dar√≠o from white Guatemalan marble, which has become an iconic image of the poet. In the 1970s, Gr√∏n developed mouth cancer and went to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for chemotherapy. She began losing her sight in 1981 and was forced to change to painting and inlay works with wood. Some of her most known paintings include: Muchacha en la hamaca (Girl in a hammock), C√°ndida, Desnudo (The nude), and Llanto despu√©s del desastre (Tears after the disaster), which was a reference to the 1972 Nicaraguan earthquake. Numerous sculptures by Gr√∏n adorn public places in Nicaragua, such as El Relevo, (The Relay) which is in front of the post office of Managua; a monument to Andr√©s Castro Estrada, which was commissioned in 1956 by students and teachers, who had trained with the educator ; a work on Jos√© Dolores Estrada which stands at the Masaya entrance to the Tiscapa Lagoon Natural Reserve; a statue of Cacique Diriang√©n which adorns the park Las Piedrecitas in Managua; a sculpture of Rub√©n Dar√≠o, located at the Central Bank of Nicaragua, which is the most reproduced depiction of the author in the country; and a bust of Dar√≠o completed in 1964, which adorns the National Theater bearing his name. Between 1959 and 1980, Gr√∏n sculpted more than 300 works. They are held not only in Nicaragua, but in Belgium, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Peru, and Spain, among other countries. She was honored with the Rub√©n Dar√≠o Order of Cultural Independence in 1989. Death and legacy Gr√∏n died from throat cancer on 15 March 1990 in Managua. In 2007, an exhibit of photographs of the sculptor and her works was presented at the Institute of Hispanic Culture of the Spanish embassy. In 2010, the Spanish writer, Joseph M. Viv√≥, published Edith Gr√∂n, Biograf√≠a de una Escultora (Edith Gr√∂n, Biography of a sculptor) to preserve her cultural legacy.

During the periods of turmoil, Tuggurt would revolt and refrain from paying taxes. Like what Yusuf ibn Hasan, a chief of Tuggurt did in the era of the Hafsid Sultan Abu 'Amr Uthman, who was obliged to Subjugate the city two times, one in 1449 and another in 1465. The Sultanate of Tuggurt came to birth in a period that witnessed the weakness and fall of the Hafsid dynasty.  History  The Sultanate was founded in the fifteenth century by the Banu Djellab, a dynasty whose exact origins remain obscure. They claimed to be the last descendants of the Marinid dynasty, and thus modelled their court and ruling system, such as the use of a praetorian guard of black slaves, on that of the Moroccan sultans. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, the founder was a certain Sulayman ibn Djellab, a Moroccan prince, related to the Marinid family, who after his return from the hajj founded a mosque in the region, and with the help of the local nomads, became recognised there as a ruler. He felt secure enough to retain local political structures, including the djemaa (council) to which he could appoint members. He equipped at his own expense a deira of five hundred horsemen who became the nucleus of his army. He then patrolled the neighborhood chastising rebels, restoring peace and levying tax.F√©raud, op. cit, p. 175-177 Sheikh Soliman came to terms with the Douaouda feudal family, who commanded the ‚ÄúRiah‚Äù - nomadic tribes controlling the plain from the to Ouargla, by marrying his daughter to the head of this family, Ben Sakheri, who bore the title of sheikh el Arab.F√©raud, op. cit, p. 175 As early as the sixteenth century, the Sultanate of Tuggurt had to face the hegemony of the regency of Algiers. Salah Ra√Øs, beylerbey of Algiers, led an expedition against Tuggurt in 1552. The Ben Djellab surrendered in the face of enemy artillery; politically they became vassals of Algiers and paid it tribute.

It was compiled by the poet Li Shangyin. Du Mu's preface to the collected poems of Li He, which predates the Short Biography, was compiled in 831, but it contains almost no biographical details on Li. Other, later, biographies are given in chapter 137 of the Old Book of Tang and chapter 203 of the New Book of Tang.  Contents  The work opens with an allusion to Du Mu's preface, and contrasts the \\"curiosity\\" of Li's poetry as discussed by Du Mu with the actual account of the man Li which the Short Biography purports to give. The opening passages also make a claim to being based on an account of Li given by his elder sister. The work's physical description of Li (\\"skinny, unibrow, long fingernails\\") resembles that given to Taoist immortals in hagiographies such as the Liexian Zhuan. The Short Biography goes on to discuss Li's poetic composition and his friendships with the renowned poet Han Yu, Wang Shenyuan (ÁéãÂèÉÂÖÉ/ÁéãÂèÇÂÖÉ), Yang Jingzhi (Ê•äÊï¨‰πã/Êù®Êï¨‰πã) and Cui Zhi.

He attributes it to this reason, for example, that the Short Biography completely neglects the notorious incident in which Li was prevented from pursuing a public service career because of a naming taboo, which saw Li famously defended by Han Yu. Wada further speculates that Wang Shenyuan, who was the younger brother of Li Shangyin's father-in-law Wang Maoyuan (ÁéãËåÇÂÖÉ), was the husband of Li He's sister.

This election pitted Grover Cleveland against James G. Blaine and the campaign for this election centered on corruption, civil service reforms, and scandals. In this election, Cleveland portrayed himself as the clean and honest candidate in contrast to the corrupt James G. Blaine. The nomination fight An 1884 cartoon which ridicules Blaine as the tattooed-man with many indelible scandals. In the years leading up to 1884, the Republican Party was divided into two factions‚Äîthe Stalwarts and the Reformers. In 1884, Reformer James G. Blaine was able to defeat incumbent Stalwart U.S. President Chester A. Arthur's attempt at renomination. In Arthur's place, Blaine himself was nominated as the Republican Party candidate for President in 1884. Meanwhile, U.S. Senator and former general John A. Logan was selected as Blaine's running mate after Robert Todd Lincoln withdrew his name from consideration. 1876 Democratic candidate and former New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden was initially the 1884 front-runner for the Democrats. Due to his poor health, however, Tilden withdrew his name from consideration for the 1884 Democratic nomination. After Tilden's withdrawal, then-current New York Governor and former Buffalo Mayor Grover Cleveland (known as \\"Grover the Good\\") emerged as the front-runner for the Democrats. As Governor, Cleveland was notable for implementing civil service reform in New York as well as for preserving Niagara Falls as a state park. In addition, Cleveland's position on the tariff issue was unclear‚Äîthus allowing him to appeal to both high tariff supporters and low tariff supporters. Plus, the fact that he was from a swing state (New York) further strengthened Cleveland's appeal among Democrats. Finally, Cleveland won a lot of support for cutting off the patronage of the corrupt New York City political machine known as Tammany Hall while he was New York Governor. On the first ballot at the 1884 Democratic National Convention, Cleveland won 392 delegates to 170 delegates for his closest rival, Delaware U.S. Senator Thomas F. Bayard. Afterwards, Cleveland's campaign managers worked behind the scenes to prevent opponents of Cleveland's from consolidating around any single candidate. This strategy was successful as Cleveland won the nomination with 683 delegates at the second ballot. For Vice President, Indiana U.S. Senator Thomas A. Hendricks (previously the 1876 Democratic Vice Presidential nominee) was chosen (as Cleveland's running mate). During the campaign, Hendricks would serve as an attack dog for Cleveland and constantly hammer the Republican ticket and Republican Party for their record, agenda, and character. Campaign Running on a platform of honesty and reform, Cleveland was helped by the fact that many reformist Republicans‚Äîknown as Mugwumps‚Äîwere uncomfortable with their candidate (James G. Blaine). Specifically, the Mugwumps disliked Blaine's corruption, his imperialist foreign policy as President Garfield's Secretary of State, and his opposition to civil service reform and other reforms. Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal. While a revelation by the Buffalo Evening Telegraph on July 21, 1884 about Cleveland allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock (by Maria Halpin) threatened to hurt Cleveland's campaign, Cleveland was able to take control and handle this issue by telling the truth. Specifically, Cleveland pointed out that, while he didn't think that this child was his, he nevertheless took responsibility for this child due to him being the only bachelor among his friends. Also, Cleveland pointed out that he put the child up for adoption (with this child later being adopted by a wealthy couple) once Mrs. Halpin's alcoholism threatened this child's welfare. This clarification, Cleveland's apparent honesty, and the fact that Cleveland stood his ground allowed him to successfully recover from this scandal. Maria Halpin herself (in an 1884 interview) and Charles Lachman (in a 2011 article) questioned the veracity of Cleveland's side of this story. In spite of Blaine's conversion in support of civil service reform, the Mugwumps were unconvinced and continued to support Cleveland. Meanwhile, two events hurt Blaine's campaign in its final days. Firstly, Catholic Irish-Americans voters were alienated from Blaine when Blaine supporter and clergyman Samuel Burchard portrayed the Democrats as the party of \\"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.\\" Secondly, Blaine attended a dinner at a New York restaurant called Delmonico's which was filled with wealthy people (such as Jay Gould and John Jacob Astor); in turn, this caused Blaine to be portrayed as a supporter of the wealthy and as uncaring about the plight and needs of the working class. Results Due to the very close vote in New York, it was several days before the results of this election became known. Ultimately, Cleveland won New York state by 0.10% (1,149 votes)--and with it the decisive votes in the Electoral College‚Äîwhile winning the national popular vote by less than 0.30%. Specifically, Cleveland was helped in New York state by the support of the reformist-minded Mugwumps as well as by the fact that Prohibitionist nominee John St. John took some votes in New York from Blaine. After the election, Blaine attributed his loss in New York to the bad weather as well as to Samuel Burchard's gaffe; without these factors, Blaine believed that he would have won New York by 10,000 votes (and thus won the U.S. Presidency). Overall, 1884 was the first time in 28 years‚Äîspecifically since before the American Civil War‚Äîthat the Democrats won an election for the U.S. Presidency.

Out of a total of 33 seats, 14 were directly elected by universal suffrage under the highest averages method, while 12 were voted on from the Functional constituency, and 7 from nomination by the Chief Executive. Background Formerly a Portuguese colony, Macau has been a Special Administrative Region within China since 1999. As a Special Administrative Region it is entitled to a high degree of autonomy from the mainland Chinese legal system through the year 2050, although China represents the city on foreign policy matters. Macau's economy is based primarily on its status as a tech and financial sector, as well as its internationally famous casino industry. The previous legislative election took place in 2013. The pro-establishment camp ACUM, led by Chan Meng Kam, received 18.02% votes with 3 seats, and the next largest party, the pro-democracy camp ANMD+APMD, led by Ant√≥nio Ng, received 15.73% of the votes with 2 seats while the pro- establishment camp UGM received 11.09% with 2 seats. Due to the characteristics of the Macanese election system, only 14 members are directly elected. On 10 July 2017 twenty-five parties have submitted their nominations for the direct election including current incumbents (Ho Ion Sang, Ant√≥nio Ng Kuok Cheong, Jos√© Pereira Coutinho, Leong Veng Chai, Song Pek Kei, Si Ka Lon, Wong Kit Cheng, Au Kam San, Angela Leong On Kei, Lei Cheng I, Melinda Chan Mei Yi, Zheng Anting, Mak Soi Kun) and new candidates.  Macanese Election Laws  Macau's direct electoral system is based around proportional representation, with elections carried out through a closed party-list balloting system. This means that each geographic electoral district has multiple members, with the number of its seats filled by each competing party determined by the proportion of the vote that party receives. Parties nominate a slate of candidates (generally, one per seat in each district where the party is competing). After the election, party leaders decide who from the slate will fill the party's legislative seats. Shortly before usual campaign period for the 2013 elections, the Electoral Affairs Commission of Macau banned the use of commercial advertising by election candidates. The new election rules stipulate that candidates should not carry out activities that could influence voters in the two-month period between their registration and the start of the campaign period on August 31. Commercial advertising is barred from most public areas, except those specially designated by the government. Even in areas where campaigning is permitted, it is still limited to a 14-day official campaign period. These restrictions are intended to limit the advertising advantage of wealthy business interests. However, they have been criticized for limiting the amount of canvassing candidates with less money can do, thus encouraging clientelistic bloc voting where parties simply strike deals with associations, business interests and community leaders to turn out assured votes in their favor. Working around the rules, candidates resorted to using loudspeakers to promote their campaigns. Among the most powerful special interests in Macau are casinos. Macau's casino industry has a long history of Triad and other organized crime connections. Since laws around casinos were liberalized in 2002 to promote more foreign investment, the Triad has lost its stranglehold on Macau's casino industry (although it remains deeply embedded in it). Casinos have long played a major role in clientelistic politics in Macau, and since liberalization their influence has further increased.

Personal Finch grew up in Clinton, Maryland. He graduated from Niceville (FL) High School, though he attended Edmond North High School in Oklahoma for his sophomore year. He grew up a fan of the New England Patriots. On April 16, 2018 it was announced that Finch had been arrested by police officers in Edmond, Oklahoma for allegedly assaulting a police officer the previous weekend. In late June 2019 criminal charges against Finch related to kidnapping and domestic abuse were dropped after a key witness failed to appear for a preliminary hearing.

He is a Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he is the director of the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory, and is the author of the book Field Theories of Condensed Matter Physics (2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 2013). Education and Career Fradkin earned a master's degree from the University of Buenos Aires. He completed his doctorate from Stanford University in 1979, under the supervision of Leonard Susskind, and came to Illinois faculty as a postdoctoral researcher with Gordon Baym and Michael Wortis, later staying on as an assistant professor.  Research  Fradkin has worked in many areas in theoretical condensed matter physics and is notably broad and versatile in his research topics. Among his most researched areas in condensed matter include the fractional quantum Hall systems and high-temperature superconductivity. He is considered one of the earliest proponents of, and one of the leading figures in, using quantum field theoretical concepts and methods in condensed matter physics, and is well known for popularizing such approaches through his early book Field Theories of Condensed Matter Physics (1st ed. Addison Wesley) in 1991. In his doctoral work at Stanford, he made major contributions to lattice gauge theories, where his results (separately with Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind) have, among other things, had far-reaching applications and implications to two-dimensional quantum spin liquids and other topologically ordered phases in two-dimensional lattices. He has done many important works in the area of fractional quantum Hall physics, in which he gave the first fermionic Chern-Simons field theory for the effect, described various field theories for non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states (with Chetan Nayak and others), quantum Hall edge physics and, more recently, theories for describing nematicity and geometry in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of his most influential works has been the introduction and elucidation of the powerful new paradigm in quantum many-body physics of electronic liquid crystalline phases in various strongly correlated systems (with Steven Kivelson and Victor Emery), in particular in quantum Hall systems and high-temperature superconductors, and, more recently in this area, elucidation of the notion and significance of \\"intertwined orders\\" in the context of cuprate high-temperature superconductors and more generally in strongly correlated systems (with Steven Kivelson and John Tranquada). He has also made important contributions to the physics of quantum dimer models (partly with Shivaji Sondhi and others), models for unconventional quantum phase transitions involving topologically ordered phases (with Paul Fendley and others), and quantum entanglement properties of these and related problems. He also gave one of the earliest approaches to higher dimensional bosonization of fermionic field theories (with Fidel Schaposnik) as well as two-dimensional Fermi surfaces (with his then student Antonio Castro-Neto) and has later applied them to important problems in condensed matter. Some of his other important works in recent times that have not already been mentioned above include a graph-theoretic lattice discretization scheme for Chern-Simons theories and its applications to condensed matter problems, and novel field theoretic approaches to describe fractional topological insulators. Awards and honors In 1998, he was awarded the Guggenheim fellowship. In 2013 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Physical Society.

It is used by some feminists to avoid the spelling woman (which contains and derives fromRaymond Scupin, Cultural Anthropology: A Global Perspective (2019), page 96 the word man), and to foreground transgender, nonbinary, and other marginalized women. Advocacy groups and organizations, including university organizations in the U.S. and U.K., have adopted the term to reflect their values of inclusivity and diverse perspectives. Many have since abandoned the term due to extensive criticism from the trans community. Primary criticisms include the fact that the term was created by cisgender feminists on behalf of trans women, the implication that trans women are not considered women, and the fact that the same intersectional treatment is not usually given to the word men, though mxn is sometimes used with this purpose.  Definition  Dictionary.com, which added womxn and 300 other words to its dictionary in 2019, defines womxn as \\"a woman (used, especially in intersectional feminism, as an alternative spelling to avoid the suggestion of sexism perceived in the sequences m-a-n and m-e-n, and to be inclusive of trans and nonbinary women);\\" Jennie Kermode, chair of Trans Media Watch, stated that the organisation would not use the term, considering that women already includes trans women. The Boston Globe calls the term \\"a powerful, increasingly popular label, encompassing a broader range of gender identities than 'woman'‚Äîor even older feminist terms such as 'womyn'... a nontraditional spelling for people whose gender identity doesn‚Äôt fit in the traditional boxes\\". Harvard sociologist Keridwen Luis says that feminists have experimented for decades to devise a suitable alternative for the term identifying the female gender. Such terms have included \\"wimmin\\" (in the 1990s), based upon the original Old English term, and \\"womyn\\" (since at least 1975). The New York Times stated that while womxn was difficult to pronounce, it was \\"perhaps the most inclusive word yet\\", using a similar approach to the term \\"Latinx\\". The term, which is an attempt to avoid patriarchal language, includes not only cisgender women, but also trans women, non-binary people, and \\"femme/feminine-identifying genderqueer\\". Sociologist Nita Harper praised the ambiguity regarding the pronunciation of \\"womxn\\", saying that it forces users to \\"stop and think\\" and represents the complexity of gender. Some authors have respelled men as mxn to similarly foreground marginalized (e.g. nonwhite) men.J. M. J. Marvuso et al, \\"Overcoming Essentialism in Community Psychology\\", in Floretta Boonzaier, Taryn van Niekerk (eds.), Decolonial Feminist Community Psychology (2019, Springer, ), page 12  Current uses  Womxn's March on Seattle, January 2017 Womxn's March on Seattle, 2018 In 2017, the Womxn's March on Seattle chose to use the term \\"womxn\\" to promote the march. Elizabeth Hunter-Keller, the event's communications chair, told The New York Times that they chose it based upon the recommendation of a core organizer, who was a nonbinary person, and to reflect the organizing group's diversity. Hunter-Keller reported that although there were some questions, most supporters encouraged the choice. In January 2018, Portland held the Indigenous Womxn‚Äôs March, dedicated to missing and murdered indigenous girls, women, and transgender people. In October 2019, the Wellcome Collection, a museum and library in London, made an announcement through Twitter using the term in order to demonstrate their goals to include diverse perspectives; hundreds of followers complained and the museum later apologized and removed the term from its website. Labour Party politician Jess Phillips responded to the incident by saying, \\"I've never met a trans woman who was offended by the word woman being used, so I'm not sure why this keeps happening\\". Clara Bradbury-Rance from King's College London conjectured that the push-back was because the use of the term was seen as too simplistic and a \\"fix-all\\". In 2019, the following campus groups in the U.S. had adopted use of the term \\"womxn\\": * University of Iowa's Womxn's Resource and Action Center * University of California, Davis' undergraduate Womxn in Economics Society * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Womxn of Worth Initiative * Texas State University's \\"Womxn of Color\\" website * University of Richmond's Connecting Womxn of Color Conference * University of California, Berkeley's Womxn of Color Initiative As of 2018, the following campus groups in the U.K. had adopted use of the term \\"womxn\\": * King‚Äôs College London‚Äôs Womxn in Physics Society * University of London's Goldsmiths Students‚Äô Union * Durham University's Womxn's Association  See also  * Feminist language reform * Fourth-wave feminism * LGBTQIA+ linguistics * Transfeminism * List of transgender-related topics References Feminism Feminist terminology Nonstandard spelling Women-related neologisms Gender in language Person of color Transfeminism Intersectional feminism Black feminism ","title":"Womxn"},{"id":"55263347","text":"Georg Didrik Boldt (24 August 1862 ‚Äì 21 June 1918) was a Finnish philosopher of religion who was known as a socialist and tolstoyan.  Life  Boldt entered the University of Helsinki in 1880. After earning his doctorate in 1902 on the dissertation on the relation between Immanuel Kant and protestantism, Boldt moved to Turku where he worked as a teacher. In the early 1900s, Boldt was interested in socialism. He was a member of the Swedish- speaking socialist group, publishing the 1908 established newspaper Arbetet. Other key members included the businessmen Walter Borg and Ivar H√∂rhammer, trade unionist William Lundberg, the newspapermen Axel √Öhlstr√∂m and K. H. Wiik, and the university student Allan Wallenius. Boldt strongly criticized the state, conservative society and the established religious authorities. According to Boldt, the Christian leaders like Paul and Augustine had distorted the words of Jesus Christ. Boldt was influenced by the reneissance philosophers like Thomas More and Tommaso Campanella. He was also familiar with Petr Kropotkin and Mikhail Bakunin, although did not support anarchism, and was particularly interested on the pacifist philosophy of Leo Tolstoy. When the Finnish Civil War broke out in January 1918, Boldt opposed the armed revolution and condemned the violent actions of the local Red Guard. As Germany invaded the √Öland Islands in early March, Boldt and William Lundberg had negotiations with the Germans of their potential actions against the Red controlled Turku. The Reds finally left the town on 12 April. Boldt fled to Helsinki, where he was captured in late May. As a keen pacifist, Boldt was shocked by the atrocities of both sides of the war. After having a nervous breakdown, Boldt was taken into a mental institution, where he died in June 1918.  Family  Boldt was born to the family of the general Johan Didrik Boldt and Anna Christina Frosterus, who was the daughter of the bishop Robert Frosterus. His brothers were the local historian Robert Boldt (1861‚Äì1923), the anarchist Jean Boldt (1865‚Äì1920) and the author Alexander Boldt (1873‚Äì1956). Boldt was married with Hildur Katarina Karlsson in 1906.

She traveled across the United States performing a series of slave narratives and songs. She was one of the earliest people to teach the public about The Bible Quilt and its background. Biography Finch attended the University of Chicago for five years, though she did not graduate. Mammy's Stories Early in her dramatic career, she developed a program consisting of slave narratives and songs called her \\"Mammy Stories\\". Finch traveled across the United States and performed in theaters and colleges. She also performed at the University of California, Berkeley Wheeler Hall to positive reviews: \\"The artist ... has achieved a reputation for her work through the novel means she employs in giving a true portray of minstrel and vaudeville negro humor. With no stage settings or \\"make-up\\" she tells her stories of plantation superstitions and sings the songs of jubilees and revivals of a day gone by, from an arm-chair in the simple narrative fashion.\\" In 1931, Finch hosted a 15-minute radio program called Stories of the Old South. The Bible Quilt In 1914, Outlook Magazine published \\"A Sermon in Patchwork\\" by Finch. The article describes a unique covering stitched by Harriet Powers of Athens, Georgia. Powers, a former slave, created an appliqued quilt featuring Bible stories. The article included quotes, presumably, from Powers, who had died four years earlier as well as a photograph of the quilt, known as the Bible Quilt. The Finch article was one of the earliest known about The Bible Quilt, now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. Later Career In the 1930s, Finch taught drama at the Edgewood School in Greenwich, Connecticut. Additionally, she and partner Clare Hamilton owned the Little Shop, an antiques and gift store, according to the Greenwich, Connecticut, city directories from the 1930s to 1941.

The campaign, which attracted international attention, features posters of team members accompanied by words such as \\"queen\\", \\"fairy\\" and \\"pansy\\". The club has toured towns and cities across South Africa such as Bloemfontein, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Stellenbosch spreading the message of tolerance and inclusiveness in sport.

Media Launch  With a small number of members, and difficulty the recruiting sponsors or number of members needed to be taken seriously as a rugby club, then-Chairman Teveshan Kuni approached then head-of Havas Public Relations Chris Verrijdt to see if some media attention could be generated to help bolster numbers. Verrijdt created the \\"Rugby That's So Gay!\\" campaign that focused on the same ideals the team were founded upon; an all-inclusive rugby team that uniquely addressed the issue of homophobia by way of sports. The media campaign, which consisted of seven images of current players accompanied by a homophobic slur, and a group image announcing the name of the campaign was a success - grabbing the attention of over 315 million people in over 126 countries and was picked up by many international news outlets including Australia, United States of America, and a large amount of support via social media.

Biography Davis was born on December 19, 1908 in Leeton, Missouri. He received his B.A. from Whitman College in 1931 and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1934. After law school, Davis practiced law in Cleveland for less than a year before joining the faculty of West Virginia University in 1935. He held a position at the Department of Justice from 19391940 before resuming teaching. His teaching career took him to the University of Texas (19401948), Harvard (19481950), the University of Minnesota (19501960) and the University of Chicago (19611976). In 1976 he moved to the University of San Diego where he taught until his retirement in 1994. In 1946, Davis helped draft the Administrative Procedure Act. His 1958 Administrative Law Treatise defined the field of American administrative law by \\"pulling together information scattered through works on constitutional, procedural and evidence law\\" and explaining their relevance to \\"thousands of lawyers who practice before governmental administrative agencies and the judges who review agency decisions\\" in the context of modern government. He is also known for his 1969 monograph Discretionary Justice and its 1976 follow-up Police Discretion, in which he argued that more legal restrictions should be placed on administrators in their ability to develop policies. Discretionary Justice has been described as a \\"short masterpiece\\". Administrative Law Treatise  Davis' 1958 Administrative Law Treatise, itself an expansion of his 1951 Administrative Law work, was his magnum opus. Earl W. Kintner, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, heralded the work in a contemporary review as \\"...one of the truly monumental events of this generation of legal writing.\\" Davis updated the Treatise with supplemental volumes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to keep the work up-to-date. In 1978, Davis formed the K.C. Davis Publishing Company in San Diego to publish the 2nd edition of the Treatise. In 1994, he took on Richard J. Pierce as a co-author for the 3rd edition. Following Davis' death, Pierce took over as the sole author of the Treatise which remains in publication to this day.  Legacy  Davis died of natural causes on August 30, 2003 in San Diego, California. He is remembered as \\"one of the twentieth century's outstanding authorities on administrative law\\", although his influence was recognized well before his death. Contemporary reviewers refer to his intellectual \\"stature\\" and praise his \\"vivid opinions, his exuberant delight with effective innovation\\" In 1987, the Los Angeles Times described him as \\"a lion of jurisprudence, a scholar whose seminal thinking about law and how it is created have made him well-known in the nation's law schools and courthouses.\\" Following his death, Bill Funk, chairman of the ABA Admin Law section said \\"Davis‚Äô shadow falls over virtually all that administrative lawyers do,[...] To say he was a giant in his field is like saying Mt. Everest is a big mountain.\\" In 2009, The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law referred to his Treatise as the \\"canonical reference\\" of Administrative Law.

He is currently Professor and Plough Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis.

Frontiers Psychology, 10. doi:https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00729. This work emphasizes that thus far there has been no demonstration in other apes of the extensive production of exploratory vocalization such as that seen in human infants, nor of the extensive vocal interactions that occur between human infants and their caregivers.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(16), 6318-6632. Early Vocal Development Oller's seminal work on the development of babbling in the human infant helped establish a stage model of vocal development, Oller, D. K. (1980). The emergence of the sounds of speech in infancy. In G. Yeni-Komshian, J. Kavanagh, & C. Ferguson (Eds.), Child phonology, Vol 1: Production (pp. 93-112). New York: Academic Press. This work provided definitions for protophones, non-cry sounds that are produced from the first day of life and are precursors to speech. In this model, pre-linguistic babbling develops through the first months until by the second half year canonical babbling begins, with its characteristic reduplicated forms such as ‚Äúbaba‚Äù and ‚Äò‚Äôdada‚Äù, the point at which infants have the capacity to produce sounds that can serve as words (Oller, D. K., 2000). Oller and his colleagues' work has shown that the human infant is both an active explorer of vocalization and an interactor in vocal exchanges. Jhang, Y., & Oller, D. K. (2017). Emergence of Functional Flexibility in Infant Vocalizations of the First 3 Months. Frontiers in Psychology, 8. doi:doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00300. Their research has contributed to the understanding of the importance of babbling and how problems or delays with it may be signs of later speech and language disorders. Multilingualism Oller and his colleagues have studied early Spanish-English bilingualism in Miami, FL and in Memphis, TN. Their work has highlighted the ‚Äúdistributed characteristic‚Äù of bilingual vocabularies, where some words tend to be distributed between the two languages rather than having translation equivalents occurring in both. Oller, D. K. (2005). The distributed characteristic in bilingual learning. Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism, Tempe, AZ, 1744-1749. As a result, bilingual vocabularies often appear relatively small in both languages compared with monolingual vocabularies of age-matched children. Umbel, V. M., Pearson, B. Z., Fern√°ndez, M. C., & Oller, D. K. (1992). Measuring bilingual children's receptive vocabularies. Child Development, 63, 1012-1020. Especially in collaboration with Barbara Z. Pearson, the research introduced the construct of ‚Äúconceptual scoring‚Äù to assess bilingual vocabularies: that is, counting all the word meanings that a child knows in either language, an adjustment that tends to yield equivalent vocabulary sizes for age-matched monolingual children and bilinguals in Spanish and English. Pearson, B. Z., Fern√°ndez, S. C., & Oller, D. K. (1993). Lexical development in bilingual infants and toddlers: Comparison to monolingual norms. Language Learning, 43(1), 93-120. A study of 1000 bilingual and monolingual school children in Miami carefully matched for socio-economic status, language of the home, and language of the school illustrated that two-way bilingual education in English and Spanish (half the school day having subject matter taught in each language) from Kindergarten through 5th grade tends to yield little if any deficit in English language performance, while helping to maintain the Spanish language. Oller, D. K., & Eilers, R. E. (2002). Language and Literacy in Bilingual Children. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters.

Cobb was born in Kennebunk, Maine in 1803 and she married Rev. Sylvanus Cobb in Hallowell, Maine in 1822. She was a devoted and efficient assistant to his religious work as a Universalist preacher. Her eldest son, Sylvanus, Jr., derived much of his noted faculty for story-telling from her practice of telling him stories ‚Äì often continued from evening to evening, as he sat at her feet when a child. She wrote hymns, and occasional poems, and obituary lines. Her faith in God was expressed in all her poetry. As a public speaker, she was very persuasive and convincing. She was the first female president of the Ladies Physiological Institute, of Boston, and served it in that capacity for some 15 years. Early years and education Eunice Hale Waite Cobb was born in Kennebunk, January 27, 1803, the second child of Elizabeth Stanwood and Captain Hale Waite. Her father had removed to Kennebunk from old Ipswich, Massachusetts, a short time before Cobb was born, and he returned there soon after her birth, so that Ipswich was associated with her earliest childhood. Captain Waite died when Cobb was five years old, leaving a widowed mother and four children, two of whom died at a very early age. After her father's death, Cobb was cared for by her maternal grandparents, who were Calvinists. At the age of ten, her mother married Samuel Locke, of Hallowell, a man of liberal education who was a school preceptor by profession. He was known to have exerted an influence on his stepdaughter. Thoroughly imbued with the Calvinistic doctrine by her grandparents, Cobb, at an early age, became a prominent member of the Baptist church of Hallowell. Asking her stepfather for spiritual guidance, he responded: \\"I will not try to shake your faith, but I would have you study candidly, patiently, intelligently, fearlessly, the Bible.\\" Genealogy Of her genealogy, the following was contained in a son's memoir: ‚Äî Thomas Waite of Ipswich is first mentioned in 1658. He was appointed sergeant in 1664. His wife was complained of before the court for wearing a silk dress, but it was decided that she was entitled to do so. From various circumstances, it is supposed that Thomas Waite was of the same family with the Maiden Waites, and with'them descended from Samuel Waite of Wethersfield, Essex County, England; but the evidence of such descent seems unattainable. Of his five children, the second son, John, was born in 1658, died May 21, 1736. He married for his first wife, Kathren Carroll, August 14, 1685; for second wife, Hannah Dorr, November 16, 1712. Their children numbered eight. Jonadab, the third son, was born February 20, 1690, married Hannah Adams, September 11, 1725, and died July 6, 1761. They had one child, John, baptized August 17, 1729. He was married to Sarah Kimball, November 30, 1749; died in February, 1752, leaving his widow, Sarah Waite (who in 1773 married John Hodgkins), and two children, of whom John, the youngest, was born April 24, 1752. In the year 1773 he married Eunice Hale of Newbury. March, 1782, she died; and December 29, 1785, he took for his second wife, Judith Hale. John Waite died August 6, 1789. Of the three children by his first marriage, Hale was the second, born April 30, 1779; died 1807. He married Elizabeth Stanwood, and had two daughters, the youngest of whom was Eunice Hale, who married Sylvanus Cobb. In March, 1684, Sergeant Thomas Waite was granted land on which to build a house for his son John; and it was in that house that Hale Waite, the father of Mrs. Cobb, was born. Philip and Jane Stanwood were living in Gloucester in 1653, and from them Elizabeth was directly descended. Isaac Stanwood, born May 2, 1755, married Eunice Hodgkins of Ipswich, February 26, 1778. Their second child, and first daughter, was Elizabeth, born September 29, 1781; baptized October 14, 1781. Career Writer Cobb followed her stepfather's advice, and the result was an article written by her, \\"The First Article\\", for the Universalist Magazine of April 21, 1821, a paper published by Henry Bowen, in Boston, and edited by Rev. Hosea Ballou. The article occupied one-fourth of the paper. Ballou decided to have this first article printed in sheets and distributed for the purpose of strengthening others who stood doubtful between the old and the new theologies. Two copies were printed on white satin and sent to the author. In May, 1821, at the age of 18, Cobb commenced a diary, which she kept until she died. In that same month, she heard a sermon by Rev. Sylvanus Cobb, a Universalist preacher. They were married in Hallowell, at her stepfather's house, on September 10, 1822. As a minister's wife, Cobb was first settled in Waterville, Maine. Her second settlement was in Malden, Massachusetts. Her next change was to their home of 22 years, in East Boston, with which church she was connected for 40 years. This home was so pleasant, they named it the \\"Castle of Peace\\". Cobb was a frequent contributor to the religious press. She wrote a good deal for Universalist papers, writing in prose and verse. The most and best of her writings were of personal and local interest. Cobb's name as a writer appears in the work devoted to the poets of Maine, published at the end of the nineteenth-century, her poetry devoted to the good of humanity. Immediately after the death of her youngest son, James Arthur, at nine years of age, Cobb wrote his memoir. Activist Cobb's life was spent in work for the public welfare, including Sunday schools. She had interests in all the great reforms of her day. In the cause of temperance, she was an effective worker and speaker. She was a champion for the rights of woman in the broadest sense. While she was not identified with the public advocates of woman's rights, she counted among her warmest and most devoted friends eminent leaders of this reform, and sympathetically interchanged views on this topic. She attended, by invitation, the first Woman's Rights Convention held in Massachusetts ‚Äì at Worcester. Cobb and her husband joined with Professor Charles P. Bronson in founding the Ladies' Physiological Institute of Boston, the leader of all similar institutions in this country, Rev. Cobb obtaining the charter for it. Professor Bronson acted as president, by courtesy, the first year. Cobb then became the first elected president, and served until old age compelled her to resign the leadership. She continued her official connection with the organization by serving as corresponding secretary until a short time before her death. Personal life Cobb and her husband had nine children, including: *Sylvanus, Jr. (1823‚Äì1887) *Samuel Tucker (born 1825) *Eunice Hale (1827‚Äì1871) *Ebenezer (1829‚Äì1898) *George Window (born 1831) *Sarah Waite (1832‚Äì1853) *Cyrus (1834‚Äì1903) *Darius (1834‚Äì1919) *James Arthur (1842‚Äì1852) Five of her family served in the American Civil War: four sons, Sylvanus, Jr., George, Cyrus and Darius, as well as Lafayette Culver, husband of her daughter, Eunice Hale. Sylvanus, Jr., commanded at Fort Kittery, Maine, and the others served in Virginia and North Carolina. Stanwood Cobb was a grandson. Rev. Cobb died October 81, 1866, age 68, of hypertrophy of the heart. He was the author of a \\"Commentary on the New Testament,\\" a \\"Compend of Divinity,\\" and several other works. He founded, and for many years edited, the \\"Christian Freeman\\". He had been a Freemason. Cobb was told that her name was inscribed on the Masonic record in such a manner as virtually to make her an honorary member of the order.

All six crew members on board died when their aircraft plunged into the sea near the Murchison platform while trying to locate the Baffin Seal seismic survey vessel. The Accidents Investigation Branch of the United Kingdom issued the final report on the cause of the crash on 22 June 1984. It concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine a conclusive cause of the accident, although adverse weather, total darkness, and a difficult mission profile were all major factors. Accident details Background The large petroleum reserves under the North Sea have been exploited since 1965. The Treasure Finder semi- submersible accommodation platform supported a number of offshore oil rigs and normally carried a group of four Bell 212 support helicopters for inter-rig transfers of passengers and freight and medical evacuation. Treasure Finder also contained hospital facilities servicing the Brent oilfield. On 14 September 1982, a crewman on the Baffin Seal seismic survey vessel suffered an injury, and the captain sent a request for medical assistance to the Treasure Finder. The Baffin Seal's helicopter deck was obstructed, so the rescue helicopter would not be able to land on the vessel but instead would have to winch the casualty aboard. To accomplish this, the helicopter took off with a full crew of pilot, co-pilot, winch operator, winchman, doctor and medic. Flight summary The Bell 212 lifted off at 2.25 am (all times are UTC) on a course to the Baffin Seal's reported location with a plan to lower the two medical personnel onto the ship and, if necessary, winch them back onboard with the injured crewman. At 2.31 am the co-pilot told approach control that they were unable to establish marine VHF communication with the vessel, and asked for navigational assistance from the Murchison platform. Witnesses on the platform and its stand-by vessel later saw the helicopter pass by in a northeasterly direction in driving rain and poor visibility. At 2.36 am approach control informed the helicopter that the survey vessel had a searchlight and could turn it on and point it vertically to assist in location and the co-pilot replied a minute later that they could see the Baffin Seal and were in radio communication. At 2.41 am approach control attempted to call the helicopter but received no reply. The last transmission from the aircraft was on marine radio at 2.42 am: \\"Five miles north of the Murchison platform letting down to surface contact.\\" After repeated attempts to contact the helicopter were unsuccessful, approach control declared an alert at 2.50 am. Four helicopters, a Royal Air Force Nimrod, a United States Orion and several support vessels in the area searched for the missing aircraft. At 10.23 am two inflated life rafts were spotted floating upside-down northeast of the Murchison platform. Other pieces of helicopter debris and three bodies were found and recovered northeast of this platform during the day. On 17 September an underwater locator beacon led searchers to the bulk of the wreckage and two more bodies, from the platform at below water. Company operations At the time of the accident, Bristow Helicopters was the largest private operator of helicopters in the United Kingdom, with a fleet of 70 aircraft. Bristow was responsible for providing four search-and-rescue helicopters based on the Treasure Finder with pilots and crew. Normally, fourteen pilots were on the rig and a similar number ashore, of which four were qualified for nighttime search-and-rescues. The pilot of the accident aircraft, who was also the Chief Pilot for the Brent Field, was one of only two such qualified pilots available that night; the other night-qualified pilot had flown extensively earlier that day. The accident was one of a series suffered by Bristow helicopters in the North Sea in just over a year. These included the 12 August 1981 loss of another Bell 212 and the 13 August 1981 loss of a Westland Wessex. Soon after the crash, former Labour Secretary of State for Social Services David Ennals called for a Trade Department inquiry into the safety of helicopter operations in the North Sea oil industry. The accident brought the total number of dead from North Sea helicopter accidents by all UK operators to 40. Accident aircraft The Bell 212 registered as G-BDIL was a twin-engine two-bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 July 1975. For the flight the rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch, leaving only two rear seats available and the remaining two cabin crew using safety harnesses. The aircraft had a Certificate of Airworthiness that was valid until 30 January 1983 and a Certificate of Maintenance that was valid until 27 October 1982 or 7,567.5 airframe hours. The airframe had a total of 7,532.25 hours at the time of the accident. The gross weight of the aircraft and the estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits. The aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion survival suits and life vests with personal locator beacons. The aircraft was also equipped with a SARBE beacon and an underwater locator beacon, both activated by immersion in salt water. Available navigation equipment installed included a Decca Navigator System, VOR, and ADF receivers. During the flight, the co-pilot had asked for the non-directional beacon on the Murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding the Baffin Seal but the beacon remained off until after the accident because the platform's radio operator was fixing an equipment issue. Investigation Two oilfield diving support vessels were placed at the service of investigators on the day of the accident, the Kommandor Michael and the British Voyager, equipped with sonar, underwater video equipment, lifting gear, and an underwater location beacon receiver. Kommandor Michael was also equipped with two remote-control unmanned submersibles while British Voyager carried two manned submersibles. After locating the wreckage on the sea floor on 17 September at in about of water, one of British Voyager's submersibles performed a video survey and located the bodies of two of the missing aircrew. Due to the water depth, the impact damage to the airframe, and a prolonged period of dangerous weather, it was not until 10 October that the semi-submersible lifting vessel Uncle John was able to retrieve the wreckage for analysis. The damage to the airframe showed that it had sustained a severe impact to the front right quarter, consistent with a high-speed impact with the ocean surface while nose-down, banked to the right, with both the main and tail rotors spinning. Investigators did not document any pre- impact damage to the helicopter, its engines, transmission, rotors, avionics, or other systems nor were there any documented physiological impairments to the aircrew. Evidence recovered from the navigational systems and the position of and damage to the wreckage indicated the helicopter lost altitude during a turn to the right while flying at a low altitude searching for the Baffin Seal. The investigation was unable to determine a specific cause of the accident. The flight took place in darkness and weather conditions of high wind and rain soon after the aircrew had been awakened, and at a very low altitude while attempting to locate a difficult target‚Äîin such conditions there was a low margin for safety and any loss of altitude would have been fatal.

The building has become an iconic symbol of the university, as well as a prominent landmark in the city of London. The building sits atop a hill (known as UC hill) and faces the Thames River. Along with the Physics and Astronomy Building, University College is one of the first buildings that was built on the present campus in 1922. The building currently houses the Faculty of Arts and Humanities.  History   Background  The Western Board of Governors purchased 165 acres of land in 1916 for development of the new campus. This proposed campus was to house a number of new buildings, dedicated to serving the Faculty of Arts. At the time, this proposed campus was distant from the rest of downtown London. More land was purchased in 1922 to increase total acreage to over 250.  Construction  A photograph (c. 1924) of the Arts Building (now University College) at the University of Western Ontario Construction on the building began in 1922 as part of the first phase of the campus construction. This phase included the Arts Building, as well as the Science Building (now the Physics and Astronomy Building), a Boiler House (now known as the Power Plant), greenhouses, a playing field for sports, and a running track. As well, the bridge over the Thames River was constructed at this time. Credit Valley sandstone, as well as Indiana limestone, was used for the exterior facade of the entire building. The original interior consisted of hollow tile on the floor, with Terazzo finish on top. All floors were laid with the Terazzo flooring except for the main Auditorium, where a white oak wood floor was laid. Oak panelling lined the main Auditorium, with matching beamed ceilings. A large water tank was situated inside the main tower to facilitate the plumbing of the building. The cornerstone was laid on June 18, 1923, and the building was finished in the summer of 1924, just in time for summer school classes to use the building. The official opening of all the buildings built in the first construction phase was on October 16, 1924.  Additions  Two major additions to the building were built in the 1960s. The West Addition was built in 1962, and the North Addition was built in 1967.  Renovations  The University College building underwent a $34-million renovation from January 2016 to August 2018. During the majority of the renovation period, the building was closed to the public. The renovations encompassed almost the entire building (117,000 sq. ft.), across all four floors. One of the main objectives of the renovations was to modernize the interior parts of the building such as ventilation, wiring, and plumbing. New open-concept student lounge spaces were added to the building. Careful attention was given to any historical features such as Conron Hall and its accompanying stained glass windows, and the exterior building facade remained untouched. In-depth landscaping removed overgrown trees to help enhance the exterior of the building and lighting was added to showcase the stained glass windows. The laneway in front of the building, Kent Drive, was refurbished to allow only pedestrians as part of the \\"Open Spaces Strategy\\".  Architecture and features  The building is constructed in the Collegiate Gothic style of architecture. Architect John M. Moore designed the building, along with help from Frederick H. Spier. Spier's influences are seen primarily in the tower and main auditorium.  Exterior  The exterior of the building is clad in sandstone backed with concrete, and uses limestone for trim features and sills. Ornate stone carvings adorn most of the doors of the building, with a large coat of arms atop the main door. = Stained Glass = Stained glass windows are seen to the left of the front face of the building. This glass contains school crests of other Canadian colleges and universities.  Tower  The main iconic attraction of the building is the central tower. Known as the Middlesex Memorial Tower, this tower was made in part from a $100,000 donation given by the County of Middlesex in 1921, and is a memorial to those from Middlesex County who died in World War 1. The tower stands at 130 ft, with a flagpole at the top. The main entrance to the building is located at the base of the tower, along with a large plaque explaining the memorial. The original design of the tower was done by Spier, but London architect John Moore increased the height of the belfry to accommodate a bell carillon. Ultimately, the carillon was never installed. (The reference incorrectly refers to the carillon as a \\"Clarion\\". While both are instruments, the carillon is a common bell instrument that would be put into belfry towers while a clarion is a manual stop on an organ.)  Auditorium  Known as Conron Hall, (formerly known as Convocation Hall) the main auditorium showcases the architectural design of the collegiate gothic style. The hall is a large space, with 650 seats. Seats span the main floorspace as well as a balcony. The stained glass windows are seen all throughout the hall, as well as the oak panelling and oak beam construction. Graduation ceremonies were held in this auditorium until 1932.

In December 2017, it was revealed that he was a joint citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia. He was the first captive the USA called an enemy combatant since 2009. Early life Doe attended a college in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2005-2006. A college friend told CNN that he was an active partier, who liked to drink to excess, and gamble. The News York Times reported that he returned to the United States in 2014, when his wife gave birth. Time in Daesh territory and capture Seamus Hughes of the George Washington University Program on Extremism, said that US intelligence officials could learn important information from this individual, stating: \\"You're looking at a man who was there to the bitter end. Would he have insight on whether they're sending folks away from Iraq and Syria in a systematic way? Are they hunkering down?\\" Spencer Ackerman suggested that he should be transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, and that he should face charges there before a Guantanamo Military Commission. He noted that then candidate Donald Trump said he would try American citizens before military commissions. However, Karen Greenberg pointed out that detaining Americans at Guantanmo simply wasn't legal. Ackerman suggested that a legal challenge of military detention by this American could trigger the US judicial branch stripping the president of their authority to continue fighting ISIS. When President Obama initiated military action against ISIS he called on the authority of the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force, passed shortly after September 11, 2001. That act authorizes the president to order military action against Al Qaeda, and its allies. ISIS and al Qaeda aren't allies; while they hold similar ideologies, they are bitter rivals. Ackerman quoted Matthew Waxman, who wrote: In September 2017, Carol Rosenberg reported that the US military had begun steps to allow the detainee to meet with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. She wrote that the Trump presidency faced a conundrum due to this captive, since he had campaigned on re-filling the Guantanamo detention camp, but as an American citizen there were legal restrictions on charging him there. Rosenberg said that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and Military Commissions Act of 2009 only authorized charging foreigners before Guantanamo military commissions, and that if this American captive were to be transferred to Guantanamo, restrictions passed during Obama's presidency would bar transferring him to the United States, so he could not be repatriated to the USA to face charges in a US civilian court. Lolita Baldor, quoting anonymous US officials, who confirmed the American ISIS fighter was being held in US facilities in Iraq as of September 28, 2017. Comparison with Yasser al Himdy His case was compared with that of Yasser al Himdy, the first individual to be released from the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. When the USA transferred al-Himdy from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, they thought he was just one of the approximately 150 Saudi citizens in Guantanamo. Soon after they realized he was also a US citizen the Bush presidency agreed to return him to Saudi Arabia if he surrendered his US citizenship. The New York Times speculated that he might be offered a similar deal to that offered to al-Himdy, repatriation to Saudi Arabia if he surrendered his American citizenship. Discussion over transferring John Doe to Syria In June 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that some elements of the US government have advocated transferring John Doe back to Syria. Human rights workers have claimed a transfer to Syria was essentially a death sentence. The New York Times reported his lawyers said a forced return to Syria would be a \\"death sentence\\". In response to the Department of Justice's suggestion that Doe be flown back to Syria, and released in the desert where he was first taken into custody, judge Tanya Chutkan stated: Doe's account, from court documents In June 2018, CNN published details of Doe's account of himself, from court documents that had recently been made public. Doe claimed he had traveled to Daesh controlled territory to serve as a freelance journalist. The documents seem to refute descriptions that he was captured \\"on the battlefield\\", instead describing peacefully being taken into custody at a border crossing. Doe claimed he had made thirty previous attempts to escape from Daesh controlled territory. Doe claimed that Daesh kidnapped him two days after his arrival, and that he had spent eight months in Daesh custody. He claimed he only agreed to work for the Daesh regime in order to win release from the Daesh prison. Other court documents described a flash drive Doe was carrying containing a bomb-making manual and a Daesh spreadsheet named \\"Islamic State Spoils and Booty Bureau.\\" Release In late October 2018, the detainee was released, with no charges being filed against him. His name was never made public, but The New York Times reported they had determined his name, from Daesh records. The country to which he was released was not made public, but The New York Times reported it was Bahrain. The New York Times reported that, unlike Yasser al-Himdy, he did not have to relinquish his US citizenship, in order to be released. The State Department did cancel his passport.

It is expressed as the percent of households located in census tracts with high levels of concentrated disadvantage. Associations and effects Concentrated disadvantage has been found to be positively related to homicide rates and reduces probability of high school completion. A positive association between concentrated disadvantage and rates of violence more generally has also been found; this relationship is mediated primarily by collective efficacy. There is also evidence that juvenile court officials perceive more disadvantaged neighborhoods as more dangerous, and so are less likely to release youth from such neighborhoods into their communities. Child development is enhanced the most in neighborhoods with approximately equal amounts of concentrated disadvantage and affluence. Calculation According to one formula, concentrated disadvantage is calculated based on five metrics. These metrics are: #Percent of individuals below the povertyline #Percent of individuals on public assistance #Percent female-headed households, #Percent unemployed, and #Percent less than age 18.

It can be viewed as an extension of the more widely-known fundamental group; as such, it captures information about the homotopy type of a topological space. In terms of category theory, the fundamental groupoid is a certain functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groupoids.  Definition  Let be a topological space. Consider the equivalence relation on continuous paths in in which two continuous paths are equivalent if they are homotopic with fixed endpoints. The fundamental groupoid assigns to each ordered pair of points in the collection of equivalence classes of continuous paths from to . As suggested by its name, the fundamental groupoid of naturally has the structure of a groupoid. In particular, it forms a category; the objects are taken to be the points of and the collection of morphisms from to is the collection of equivalence classes given above. The fact that this satisfies the definition of a category amounts to the standard fact that the equivalence class of the concatenation of two paths only depends on the equivalence classes of the individual paths.Spanier, section 1.7; Lemma 6 and Theorem 7. Likewise, the fact that this category is a groupoid, which asserts that every morphism is invertible, amounts to the standard fact that one can reverse the orientation of a path, and the equivalence class of the resulting concatenation contains the constant path.Spanier, section 1.7; Theorem 8. Note that the fundamental groupoid assigns, to the ordered pair , the fundamental group of based at . Basic properties Given a topological space , the path-connected components of are naturally encoded in its fundamental groupoid; the observation is that and are in the same path-connected component of if and only if the collection of equivalence classes of continuous paths from to is nonempty. In categorical terms, the assertion is that the objects and are in the same groupoid component if and only if the set of morphisms from to is nonempty.Spanier, section 1.7; Theorem 9. Suppose that is path-connected, and fix an element of . One can view the fundamental group as a category; there is one object and the morphisms from it to itself are the elements of . The selection, for each in , of a continuous path from to , allows one to use concatenation to view any path in as a loop based at . This defines an equivalence of categories between and the fundamental groupoid of . More precisely, this exhibits as a skeleton of the fundamental groupoid of .May, section 2.5. Bundles of groups and local systems Given a topological space , a local system is a functor from the fundamental groupoid of to a category.Spanier, chapter 1; Exercises F. As an important special case, a bundle of (abelian) groups on is a local system valued in the category of (abelian) groups. This is to say that a bundle of groups on assigns a group to each element of , and assigns a group homomorphism to each continuous path from to . In order to be a functor, these group homomorphisms are required to be compatible with the topological structure, so that homotopic paths with fixed endpoints define the same homomorphism; furthermore the group homomorphisms must compose in accordance with the concatenation and inversion of paths.Whitehead, section 6.1; page 257. One can define homology with coefficients in a bundle of abelian groups.Whitehead, section 6.2. When satisfies certain conditions, a local system can be equivalently described as a locally constant sheaf.  Examples  * The fundamental groupoid of the singleton space is the trivial groupoid (a groupoid with one object * and one morphism } * The fundamental groupoid of the circle is connected and all of its vertex groups are isomorphic to (Z, +), the additive group of integers.  The homotopy hypothesis  The homotopy hypothesis, a well-known conjecture in homotopy theory formulated by Alexander Grothendieck, states that a suitable generalization of the fundamental groupoid, known as the fundamental ‚àû-groupoid, captures all information about a topological space up to weak homotopy equivalence.

Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity. Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope. Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity. The onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of single-layer graphene and oxygen gas is below . Graphene combusts at . Graphene is commonly modified with oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, determination of structures of graphene with oxygen- and nitrogen- functional groups requires the structures to be well controlled. Contrary to the ideal 2D structure of graphene, chemical applications of graphene need either structural or chemical irregularities, as perfectly flat graphene is chemically inert. In other words, the definition of an ideal graphene is different in chemistry and physics. Graphene placed on a soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate under ambient conditions exhibited spontaneous n-doping (1.33 √ó 1013 e/cm2) via surface- transfer. On p-type copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) semiconductor itself deposited on SLG n-doping reached 2.11 √ó 1013 e/cm2. Oxide Using paper-making techniques on dispersed, oxidized and chemically processed graphite in water, monolayer flakes form a single sheet and create strong bonds. These sheets, called graphene oxide paper, have a measured tensile modulus of 32 GPa. The chemical property of graphite oxide is related to the functional groups attached to graphene sheets. These can change the polymerization pathway and similar chemical processes. Graphene oxide flakes in polymers display enhanced photo-conducting properties. Graphene is normally hydrophobic and impermeable to all gases and liquids (vacuum-tight). However, when formed into graphene oxide-based capillary membrane, both liquid water and water vapor flow through as quickly as if the membrane was not present. Chemical modification Photograph of single-layer graphene oxide undergoing high temperature chemical treatment, resulting in sheet folding and loss of carboxylic functionality, or through room temperature carbodiimide treatment, collapsing into star-like clusters. Soluble fragments of graphene can be prepared in the laboratory through chemical modification of graphite. First, microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with carboxyl groups at their edges. These are converted to acid chloride groups by treatment with thionyl chloride; next, they are converted to the corresponding graphene amide via treatment with octadecylamine. The resulting material (circular graphene layers of 5.3 angstrom thickness) is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, tetrachloromethane and dichloroethane. Refluxing single-layer graphene oxide (SLGO) in solvents leads to size reduction and folding of individual sheets as well as loss of carboxylic group functionality, by up to 20%, indicating thermal instabilities of SLGO sheets dependent on their preparation methodology. When using thionyl chloride, acyl chloride groups result, which can then form aliphatic and aromatic amides with a reactivity conversion of around 70‚Äì80%. Boehm titration results for various chemical reactions of single-layer graphene oxide, which reveal reactivity of the carboxylic groups and the resultant stability of the SLGO sheets after treatment. Hydrazine reflux is commonly used for reducing SLGO to SLG(R), but titrations show that only around 20‚Äì30% of the carboxylic groups are lost, leaving a significant number available for chemical attachment. Analysis of such SLG(R) reveals that the system is unstable. Using a room temperature stirring with HCl (< 1.0 M) leads to around 60% loss of COOH functionality. Room temperature treatment of SLGO with carbodiimides leads to the collapse of the individual sheets into star-like clusters that exhibited poor subsequent reactivity with amines (c. 3‚Äì5% conversion of the intermediate to the final amide). It is apparent that conventional chemical treatment of carboxylic groups on SLGO generates morphological changes of individual sheets that leads to a reduction in chemical reactivity, which may potentially limit their use in composite synthesis. Therefore, chemical reactions types have been explored. SLGO has also been grafted with polyallylamine, cross-linked through epoxy groups. When filtered into graphene oxide paper, these composites exhibit increased stiffness and strength relative to unmodified graphene oxide paper. Full hydrogenation from both sides of graphene sheet results in graphane, but partial hydrogenation leads to hydrogenated graphene. Similarly, both-side fluorination of graphene (or chemical and mechanical exfoliation of graphite fluoride) leads to fluorographene (graphene fluoride), while partial fluorination (generally halogenation) provides fluorinated (halogenated) graphene. Graphene ligand/ Graphene complex Graphene can be a ligand to form a graphene complex by introducing functional groups and coordinating metal ions. Structures of graphene ligands are similar to e.g. metal-porphyrin complex, metal- phthalocyanine complex and metal-phenanthroline complex. Copper and nickel ions can be coordinated with graphene ligands.

'Graphene' is typically used to refer to the crystalline monolayer of the naturally occurring material graphite. Due to quantum confinement of electrons within the material at these low dimensions, small differences in graphene morphology can greatly impact the physical and chemical properties of these materials. Commonly studied graphene morphologies include the monolayer sheets, bilayer sheets, graphene nanoribbons and other 3D structures formed from stacking of the monolayer sheets. Monolayer sheets In 2013 researchers developed a production unit that produces continuous monolayer sheets of high-strength monolayer graphene (HSMG). The process is based on graphene growth on a liquid metal matrix. Bilayer  Bilayer graphene displays the anomalous quantum Hall effect, a tunable band gap and potential for excitonic condensation. Bilayer graphene typically can be found either in twisted configurations where the two layers are rotated relative to each other or graphitic Bernal stacked configurations where half the atoms in one layer lie atop half the atoms in the other. Stacking order and orientation govern its optical and electronic properties. One synthesis method is chemical vapor deposition, which can produce large bilayer regions that almost exclusively conform to a Bernal stack geometry. Superlattices Periodically stacked graphene and its insulating isomorph provide a fascinating structural element in implementing highly functional superlattices at the atomic scale, which offers possibilities in designing nanoelectronic and photonic devices. Various types of superlattices can be obtained by stacking graphene and its related forms. The energy band in layer-stacked superlattices is more sensitive to the barrier width than that in conventional III‚ÄìV semiconductor superlattices. When adding more than one atomic layer to the barrier in each period, the coupling of electronic wavefunctions in neighboring potential wells can be significantly reduced, which leads to the degeneration of continuous subbands into quantized energy levels. When varying the well width, the energy levels in the potential wells along the L‚ÄìM direction behave distinctly from those along the K‚ÄìH direction. Precisely aligned graphene on h-BN always produces giant superlattice known as Moir√© pattern. Moir√© patterns are observed and the sensitivity of moir√© interferometry proves that the graphene grains can align precisely with the underlying h-BN lattice within an error of less than 0.05¬∞. The occurrence of moir√© pattern clearly indicates that the graphene locks into h-BN via van der Waals epitaxy with its interfacial stress greatly released. The existence of the giant Moir√© pattern in graphene nanoribbon (GNR) embedded in hBN indicates that the graphene was highly crystalline and precisely aligned with the h-BN underneath. It was noticed that the Moir√© pattern appeared to be stretched along the GNR, while it appeared relaxed laterally. This trend differs from regular hexagons with a periodicity of ‚àº14 nm, which have always been observed with well-aligned graphene domains on h-BN. This observation gives a strong indication of the in-plane epitaxy between the graphene and the h-BN at the edges of the trench, where the graphene is stretched by tensile strain along the ribbon, due to a lattice mismatch between the graphene and h-BN. Nanoribbons Graphene nanoribbons (\\"nanostripes\\" in the \\"zig-zag\\" orientation), at low temperatures, show spin-polarized metallic edge currents, which suggest spintronics applications. (In the \\"armchair\\" orientation, the edges behave like semiconductors.) Fiber In 2011, researchers reported making fibers using chemical vapor deposition grown graphene films. The method was scalable and controllable, delivering tunable morphology and pore structure by controlling the evaporation of solvents with suitable surface tension. Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors based on such fibers were demonstrated in 2013. In 2015 intercalating small graphene fragments into the gaps formed by larger, coiled graphene sheets after annealing provided pathways for conduction, while the fragments helped reinforce the fibers. The resulting fibers offered better thermal and electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. Thermal conductivity reached 1290 watts per meter per kelvin, while tensile strength reached 1080 megapascals. In 2016, kilometer- scale continuous graphene fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity were produced by high-throughput wet- spinning of graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by graphitization through a full-scale synergetic defect-engineering strategy. 3D  Three dimensional bilayer graphene was reported in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, a three-dimensional honeycomb of hexagonally arranged carbon was termed 3D graphene. Self- supporting 3D graphene was produced that year. Researchers at Stony Brook University have reported a novel radical-initiated crosslinking method to fabricate porous 3D free-standing architectures of graphene and carbon nanotubes using nanomaterials as building blocks without any polymer matrix as support. 3D structures can be fabricated by using either CVD or solution-based methods. A 2016 review summarized the techniques for fabrication of 3D graphene and other related two-dimensional materials. These 3D graphene (all-carbon) scaffolds/foams have potential applications in fields such as energy storage, filtration, thermal management and biomedical devices and implants. In 2016, a box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure resulted from mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite has been reported. (Russian translation is available). The discovered nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface that displayed quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm, the typical width of channel facets makes about 25 nm. Potential applications include: ultra-sensitive detectors, high- performance catalytic cells, nanochannels for DNA sequencing and manipulation, high-performance heat sinking surfaces, rechargeable batteries of enhanced performance, nanomechanical resonators, electron multiplication channels in emission nanoelectronic devices, high-capacity sorbents for safe hydrogen storage. Gyroid In 2017 researchers simulated a graphene gyroid that has five percent of the density of steel, yet is ten times as strong with an enormous surface area to volume ratio. They compressed heated graphene flakes. They then constructed high resolution 3D-printed models of plastic of various configurations ‚Äì similar to the gyroids that graphene form naturally, though thousands of times larger. These shapes were then tested for tensile strength and compression, and compared to the computer simulations. When the graphene was swapped out for polymers or metals, similar gains in strength were seen. A film of graphene soaked in solvent to make it swell and become malleable was overlaid on an underlying substrate \\"former\\". The solvent evaporated, leaving behind a layer of graphene that had taken on the shape of the underlying structure. In this way the team was able to produce a range of relatively intricate micro-structured shapes. Features vary from 3.5 to 50 Œºm. Pure graphene and gold-decorated graphene were each successfully integrated with the substrate. An aerogel made of graphene layers separated by carbon nanotubes was measured at 0.16 milligrams per cubic centimeter. A solution of graphene and carbon nanotubes in a mold is freeze dried to dehydrate the solution, leaving the aerogel. The material has superior elasticity and absorption. It can recover completely after more than 90% compression, and absorb up to 900 times its weight in oil, at a rate of 68.8 grams per second. At the end of 2017, fabrication of freestanding graphene gyroids with 35nm and 60nm unit cells was reported. The gyroids were made via controlled direct chemical vapor deposition and are self-supporting and can be transferred onto a variety of substrates. Furthermore, they represent the smallest free standing periodic graphene 3D structures yet produced with a pore size of tens of nm. Due to their high mechanical strength, good conductivity (sheet resistance : 240 Œ©/sq) and huge ratio of surface area per volume, the graphene gyroids might find their way to various applications, ranging from batteries and supercapacitors to filtration and optoelectronics.  Pillared  Pillared graphene is a hybrid carbon structure consisting of an oriented array of carbon nanotubes connected at each end to a graphene sheet. It was first described theoretically in 2008. Pillared graphene has not been synthesized in the laboratory. Reinforced  Graphene sheets reinforced with embedded carbon nanotubes (\\"rebar\\") are easier to manipulate, while improving the electrical and mechanical qualities of both materials. Functionalized single- or multiwalled carbon nanotubes are spin-coated on copper foils and then heated and cooled, using the nanotubes as the carbon source. Under heating, the functional carbon groups decompose into graphene, while the nanotubes partially split and form in-plane covalent bonds with the graphene, adding strength. œÄ‚ÄìœÄ stacking domains add more strength. The nanotubes can overlap, making the material a better conductor than standard CVD-grown graphene. The nanotubes effectively bridge the grain boundaries found in conventional graphene. The technique eliminates the traces of substrate on which later- separated sheets were deposited using epitaxy. Stacks of a few layers have been proposed as a cost-effective and physically flexible replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) used in displays and photovoltaic cells. Nanocoil In 2015 a coiled form of graphene was discovered in graphitic carbon (coal). The spiraling effect is produced by defects in the material's hexagonal grid that causes it to spiral along its edge, mimicking a Riemann surface, with the graphene surface approximately perpendicular to the axis. When voltage is applied to such a coil, current flows around the spiral, producing a magnetic field. The phenomenon applies to spirals with either zigzag or armchair orientations, although with different current distributions. Computer simulations indicated that a conventional spiral inductor of 205 microns in diameter could be matched by a nanocoil just 70 nanometers wide, with a field strength reaching as much as 1 tesla, about the same as the coils found in typical loudspeakers, about the same field strength as some MRI machines. They found the magnetic field would be strongest in the hollow, nanometer-wide cavity at the spiral's center. A solenoid made with such a coil behaves as a quantum conductor whose current distribution between the core and exterior varies with applied voltage, resulting in nonlinear inductance.

The earliest TEM images of few-layer graphite were published by G. Ruess and F. Vogt in 1948. Later, single graphene layers were observed directly by electron microscopy. Before 2004 intercalated graphite compounds were studied under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Researchers occasionally observed thin graphitic flakes (\\"few-layer graphene\\") and possibly even individual layers. An early, detailed study on few-layer graphite dates to 1962 when Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide. Starting in the 1970s single layers of graphite were grown epitaxially on top of other materials. This \\"epitaxial graphene\\" consists of a single-atom-thick hexagonal lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, as in free-standing graphene. However, significant charge transfers from the substrate to the epitaxial graphene, and in some cases, the d-orbitals of the substrate atoms hybridize with the œÄ orbitals of graphene, which significantly alters the electronic structure of epitaxial graphene. Single layers of graphite were observed by TEM within bulk materials, in particular inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation. Efforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990, but nothing thinner than 50 to 100 layers was produced before 2004. Naming The term graphene was introduced in 1986 by chemists Hanns-Peter Boehm, Ralph Setton and Eberhard Stumpp. It is a combination of the word graphite and the suffix -ene, referring to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Discovery Initial attempts to make atomically thin graphitic films employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method. Multilayer samples down to 10 nm in thickness were obtained. Earlier researchers tried to isolate graphene starting with intercalated compounds, producing very thin graphitic fragments (possibly monolayers). Neither of the earlier observations was sufficient to launch the \\"graphene gold rush\\" that awaited macroscopic samples of extracted atomic planes. One of the first patents pertaining to the production of graphene was filed in October 2002 and granted in 2006. It detailed one of the first large scale graphene production processes. Two years later, in 2004 Geim and Novoselov extracted single-atom-thick crystallites from bulk graphite. They pulled graphene layers from graphite and transferred them onto thin silicon dioxide () on a silicon wafer in a process called either micromechanical cleavage or the Scotch tape technique. The electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it, providing nearly charge- neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the could be used as a \\"back gate\\" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range. , filed in 2002, describes how to process expanded graphite to achieve a graphite thickness of one hundred-thousandth of an inch (0.25 nm). The key to success was high-throughput visual recognition of graphene on a properly chosen substrate that provides a small but noticeable optical contrast. The cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene, which provided direct evidence of graphene's theoretically predicted Berry's phase of massless Dirac fermions. The effect was reported by Geim's group and by Kim and Zhang, whose papers appeared in Nature in 2005. Before these experiments other researchers had looked for the quantum Hall effect and Dirac fermions in bulk graphite. Geim and Novoselov received awards for their pioneering research on graphene, notably the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. Commercialization In 2014, the National Graphene Institute was announced to support applied research and development in partnership with other research organizations and industry. Commercialization of graphene proceeded rapidly once commercial scale production was demonstrated. In 2014 two North East England commercial manufacturers, Applied Graphene Materials and Thomas Swan Limited (with Trinity College, Dublin researchers), began manufacturing. In East Anglia Cambridge Nanosystems operates a graphene powder production facility. By 2017, 13 years after creation of the first laboratory graphene electronic device, an integrated graphene electronics chip was produced commercially and marketed to pharmaceutical researchers by Nanomedical Diagnostics in San Diego.

She was the tenth woman in New Zealand to be admitted to the bar. MacKay was born in Oamaru, in New Zealand's South Island, in 1903. Her father, Adam MacKay, had emigrated to Oamaru from Kilmarnock, Scotland, with his widowed mother and brother. He established a grocery business in the town. MacKay initially worked as a junior typist in her uncle‚Äôs Oamaru law firm, Grave & Grave. She studied law by correspondence through the University of Otago. She was admitted to the bar in 1929, becoming the tenth woman in New Zealand and the second woman in Otago to be admitted to the bar. MacKay was promoted to the position of managing clerk, and in 1946 she became a partner in Lee, Grave & Zimmerman, but opposition from one partner meant that her name was not added to the partnership list until his retirement in 1961. In 1948 MacKay's uncle, A.J. Grave, died and left his private golf course at Waianakarua to MacKay. She maintained and played on the course until her death. MacKay was also actively involved with Presbyterian Support Services and the establishment of Iona Home and Hospital. A wing of the house is named after her. The Otago Women Lawyers Society awarded MacKay life membership in recognition of her pioneering career in law in Otago. MacKay died in 1998, aged 95.

They made their fortunes in mining then left for London, where they continued to operate, living in a grand style. They are remembered for their horse racing triumphs, which included two Melbourne Cups. History Robinson and Clark went into partnership in 1890 and developed a large and profitable business dealing in mining shares during the Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie mining booms. In 1895 Clark & Robinson moved their office to Adelaide, initially located at 27 Grenfell Street from April 1896 to October 1897, then Cowra Chambers, 23 Grenfell Street, then from March 1899 Brookman Building, 35 Grenfell Street. Robinson made substantial investments in the Hainault Goldmiming Company, which proved highly profitable. Robinson began an association with Kalgoorlie and its \\"Golden Mile\\" when the Great Boulder Proprietary opened up its 200 ft. level, and in the late '90s deputised Sydney J. Yeo to open the company's Kalgoorlie office. A large and lucrative business was developed with London, and Robinson moved there to handle this business in person. The rules of the London Stock Exchange not only demanded that he relinquish his membership of Australian Exchanges before he could join, but could not belong to an overseas partnership, so that with Clark was dissolved in May 1899 by mutual agreement. For a couple of years Robinson and Clark ran their respective offices independently, then decided to reunite in London. Clark and his accountant Guy Stanton left for England in May 1902. Clark, who had renounced membership of the Stock Exchanges of Melbourne and Adelaide, was elected a member of the London Stock Exchange as from 1 January 1905, and on the same day Clark joined Robinson as a partner of the firm of Lionel Robinson and Co., renamed Lionel Robinson, Clark & Co., with offices at 24 Throgmorton Street, London. Within two years it was the largest finance house dealing in Australian mining shares in London. Business was good and the company prospered even better than it had in Australia, and each became very wealthy. The Adelaide office was taken over by Arthur J. Walkley, previously an employee, and became a minor partner of the new company; he died 1 March 1942 after being struck by a tram. Other employees who later became partners were Andrew D. Young, Sydney E. Knights (later a member of the London Stock Exchange), and C. B. Jessop. Robinson was ever on the lookout for business opportunities in Australia: in 1905 when the Broken Hill mines were struggling with a host of problems he organised a luxury private carriage on the \\"Barrier\\" train for an invited group of industrialists and investors, who invested thousands of pounds of British capital into the North and South mines, Zinc Corporation, and Amalgamated Zinc Companies. Robinson and Clark formed a company Broken Hill Syndicate Limited with W.L., E.L. and W. Baillieu and others. In 1919 the stockbroking firm of Knights, Jessop & Stanton was involved in the takeover of Lionel Robinson, Clark & Co. Although he made his fortune through mining stocks, Robinson was also interested in industrials: he was a major shareholder director of the London Motor Omnibus Company, and the London Underground Railways. As a director of the omnibus company he was concerned at the reputation motor 'buses had for unreliability, and insisted on a daily overhaul of each bus, whether giving problems or not, with immediate beneficial results. Robinson and Clark invested heavily in establishing woollen mills and associated factories in Victoria. From 1915 to 1921 Robinson was a committee member of the London Stock Exchange, and in 1916 became High Sheriff of Norfolk. After Robinson's death, Yeo in Adelaide said:‚Äî *Lionel Robinson was a loyal friend and a thorough-going gentleman, and I would work the skin off my bones for him.\\" In announcing the death of Robinson to members of the Stock Exchange of Adelaide, the President (W. B. Carr) said that although it was some years since he had been associated with the Adelaide Exchange, Robinson was well known to all the present-day members, who would deeply regret his death. The success they achieved in Adelaide they followed up in London, where they quickly gained a high reputation in leading financial circles. As a man Lionel Robinson was beloved by all his associates on the Exchange. He had a charming personality, and his cheerful disposition made him a host of friends who still retained a pleasant recollection of the days he spent among them. When Robinson was alive the pair were known in the house as \\"the Siamese twins.\\" and were inseparable both in business and sport, but on the death of his partner Clark lost a great part of his enthusiasm for racing, and allowed his stable to become became a skeleton of its earlier self. Old Buckenham Robinson purchased the historic Hall at Old Buckenham in Norfolk in 1906, and seldom left for London unless on urgent business. A feature of the property was a fine cricket field, and a pitch second to none in England. Every distinguished visiting Australian sportsman and Australian XI was treated to the finest hospitality and given access to the best of facilities for the duration of their stay. One cricket commentator wrote: > There is hardly a more beautiful place in Norfolk than Mr. Lionel Robinson's > 'Buckenham Hall.' During the visit of the A.I.F. team to his home Mr. > Robinson had the favorite for the English Derby, and told us to have a > little on it, as it was very highly fancied.

In 1921 he fielded a team against Warwick Armstrong's Australian XI at Old Buckenham Hall, which attracted a large number of spectators. Lionel Robinson died there of cancer on 27 July 1922, having taken little part in financial affairs after the war. He left an estate valued at around ¬£240,000.Peter Richardson, 'Robinson, Lionel George (1866‚Äì1922)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/robinson-lionel-george-8549/text14441, published first in hardcopy 1988. Retrieved 17 September 2017. Around 1937 Old Buckenham Hall became the new site of a school for boys, which was founded in 1862 by the Misses Ellen and Margaret Ringer in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Both Lionel and Mary Robinson were buried in the churchyard on the property. Windlesham Moor Clark purchased Windlesham Moor, a picturesque Surrey mansion in 50 acres of grounds on the edge of Windsor Forest, in 1921 and, like Robinson, never returned to Australia. :The mansion was built at the end of The Great War by Sir Byron Peters and run by Lady Peters as a convalescent hospital. Robinson and the 50 acres laid out as a formal garden by noted landscape gardener Gomer Waterer. They sold the property to South African millionaire Philip Hill in 1942, and on his death passed to his wife, who became Mrs. Warwick Byant. Windlesham Moor was rented for Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten as a country retreat directly after their marriage in November 1947 and while Sunninghill Park, which had been largely damaged by fire, was being rebuilt. In 1950 Mrs. Bryant put it on the market, and was purchased in 1953 by Melbourne bicycle and motor vehicle wholesaler William L. Buckland. Horseracing ;In Australia Clark and Robinson were partners as racehorse owners as well as in business. Clark engaged Richard Bradfield, who had recently lost a major client in Frederick W. Purches (c. 1852‚Äì1937), as their trainer in Australia, and that was the beginning of the long and fruitful connection of Clark and Robinson (dubbed \\"The Firm\\") with Bradfield's stable. Their Australian successes included: *SAJC Derby with Hainault (1898); with Rienzi (1902) *SAJC St Leger with The Victory (1898) *SAJC (Queen's) Birthday Cup with The Victory (1898) *VRC Standish Handicap with The Victory (1902) *Maribyrnong Plate with Niphetos (1901) *Melbourne Cup with The Victory (1902); Backwood (1924) Although Clark and Robinson were living in England they continued over a long period to keep a few horses with Bradfield. When racing was curtailed in England during The Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 they sent out Magpie, King Offa, Lanius, Lucknow, Elsdon, Shadowland, Coq d'Or and Escombe to Bradfield, who won races with most of them. *Futurity Stakes with Eudorus (1913); Flash of Steel (1915); Lucknow (1919) *Caulfield Cup with King Offa (1918); Lucknow (1919). This was a great one for Bradfield, who had trained the three placed horses: Lucknow, Night Watch, and Chrome. *The Metropolitan with St Spasa (1914) *Adelaide Cup with St Spasa (1916); Elsdon (1918) *Lanius was successful in some weight-for-age races *Magpie was successful in some weight-for-age races The 1924 Melbourne Cup was won by Backwood for Clark, his son-in-law Clive Baillieu, and Alan Hughes. Robinson had died two years previously and without his old friend and business partner Clark had lost some of his enthusiasm for racing. He had also lost hope in Backwood's chances, as since his importation from England the horse had not shown any sign of his earlier promise. Their Australian racing manager was Isaac Earnshaw, and on his death in 1914 C. Leslie Macdonald took over. Macdonald retired three years later and the position was taken by S. Bloomfield. ;In England Unlike the principal Australian clubs, the English Jockey Club did not permit racing partnerships, and for that reason horses belonging to the Clark-Robinson partnership were raced in England in the name of one or other of the partners. At their Old Buckenham stud at Attleborough, Norfolk, they bred and trained dozens of top-flight thoroughbred racehorses. Gingal, Linacre, Merrylips, Demure and Sham Fight won 11 races in 1907. Other winners were All Black, Basil, The Whirlpool, and Linacre in 1908; Slipton, Basil, and Budorus in 1909; Prince Galahad in 1920. Some or all were trained by J. E. \\"Jack\\" Brewer ( ‚Äì May 1931), and their jockeys included Stanley Wootton.

Background Incumbent Mayor Dove-Myer Robinson was re- elected against past president of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce Edgar Faber, who despite possessing a low public profile and comparative lack of local body experience did better than expected. The election also saw the Labour Party split from the Civic Reform ticket. Faber was a reluctant candidate from the beginning, who was only persuaded to run for the mayoralty after a group of Citizens & Ratepayers (C&R;) councillors (Fred de Malmanche, Charlie Passmore and Reg Savory) told him exaggerated stories of Robinson's personal conduct and his behaviour during council business. During the campaign Faber began to regret his candidacy and when it began to adversely affect his health he planned to withdraw from the contest, but the C&R; trio were insistent that he stay in the race.

Origins The subventio generalis had its origins in the obligation of the holders of fiefs in the Kingdom of Sicily to provide military service to the monarchs. They were required to serve in the royal army without compensation for maximum 90 days for each 20 ounces of their annual income. They could get rid of this irksome duty, if they pay a special fee, known as adohamentum or adoha. Most barons and counts preferred to pay the fee which thus developed into a tax already under the Norman kings of Sicily. The landowners collected the fee from their tenants, thus in practice the peasants were to pay the adoha. Those who lived in the royal demesneall burghers and the majority of the peasantrywere subjected to levies in money or in kind, known as collecta. The monarchs could in theory freely demand such levies, only their fear of riots limited their greed. The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who was also king of Sicily, summoned the host in each year after 1231.

Bernard Pr√©zelin, Les Flottes de combat 1940-1942, Challamel Publishing, 1942, p. 644 Service Romanian War of Independence In 1877, during the Romanian War of Independence, according to a Russian-Romanian treaty signed in April that year, R√¢ndunica served under joint Romanian-Russian command. She was also known as Tsarevich by the Russians. Her crew consisted of two Russian Lieutenants, Dubasov and Shestakov, and three Romanians: Major Murgescu (the official liaison officer with the Russian headquarters), an engine mechanic and a navigator. The attack of R√¢ndunica took place during the night of 25‚Äì26 May 1877, near MƒÉcin. As she was approaching the Ottoman monitor Seyfi, the latter fired three rounds at her without any effect. Before she could fire the fourth round, R√¢ndunicas spar struck her between the midships and the stern. A powerful explosion followed, with debris from the Ottoman warship raising up to 40 meters in the air. The half-sunk monitor then re-opened fire, but was struck once again, with the same devastating effects. The crew of Seyfi subsequently fired their rifles at R√¢ndunica, as the latter was retreating and their monitor was sinking. Following this action, Ottoman warships throughout the remainder of the war would always retreat upon sighting spar torpedo boats. The Russian Lieutenants Dubasov and Shestakov were decorated with the Order of St. George, while Major Murgescu was decorated with the Order of Saint Vladimir as well as the Order of the Star of Romania. R√¢ndunica was returned to full Romanian control in 1878, after the Russian ground forces had finished crossing the Danube.Mihai Georgescu, Warship International, 1987: The Romanian Navy's Torpedo Boat RindunicaCristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Romanian navy torpedo boats, Modelism, 2003, pp. 13-18 The Ottoman monitor Seyfi was a 400-ton ironclad warship, with a maximum armor thickness of 76 mm and armed with two 120 mm guns.Navypedia: Hƒ∞ZBER river monitors (1876) World War I R√¢ndunica was modernized in 1900 at the Gala»õi shipyard, most notably being fitted with a superstructure for better crew living conditions.Mihai Georgescu, Warship International, 1987: The Romanian Navy's Torpedo Boat Rindunica On 27 August 1916, just after Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary, R√¢ndunica attacked the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla stationed in the Bulgarian port of Ruse. Commanded by Captain Aurel Negulescu, she was fitted with two torpedoes in wooden tubes. In the evening of 27 August, she launched her two torpedoes at one of the Austro-Hungarian monitors, but only one barge loaded with fuel was struck, which exploded and sank.

It, alongside the likes of Sichuanese garden and Jiangnan garden, is one of the major styles of Chinese garden.ÂäâÂ∫≠È¢®. (2003). Â∂∫ÂçóÂúíÊûó: Á¶èÂª∫, Ëá∫ÁÅ£ÂúíÊûó. ÂêåÊøüÂ§ßÂ≠∏Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ. The Lingnan region is the south of the Ng Leng Mountains, spanning southern Fujian, Gwongdung, and Gwongsai, located in the Eurasian continent's southeastern edge. With such a natural barrier as the Ng Leng Mountains and extensive river network, the region has strong sunlight and receives regular monsoon. Plants are lush throughout the year, showing a subtropical natural landscape. With this rich natural scenery, people in Lingnan have been able to create a rich and colorful style of traditional gardens distinct from gardens in other Han Chinese regions.Yuanyuan, C. (2008). Inspiration of Lingnan Garden to Inhabitation Landscape Design [J]. Huazhong Architecture, 11, 042. Classification By types Lingnan garden consists of several substyles, such as royal gardens, private gardens, public gardens, and so on. A good example of royal Lingnan garden is Gwongzau's Gauyiu Garden (Jyutping: Gau2 jiu6 jyun4; Traditional Chinese: ‰πùÊõúÂúí, literally \\"garden of nine glories\\"), built by Lau Ngam, the first king of Southern Han.Ëñ¨Ê¥≤ ÂçóÂõΩ‰º†ÁªèÂú∞ÔºåÊí≠ÁßçÊñáÊòéÂÖ≠ÁôæÂπ¥ - „ÄäÂçóÊñπÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÊä•„Äã Built in the style from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (10th century), it laid down the foundation of modern Lingnan style and is one of the more well-preserved gardens from that period. Prominent examples of private Lingnan gardens include the \\"four great gardens of central Canton\\": Yuyum Sanfong, Leung's Garden, Ching Fai Garden, and Ho Garden. Among them, Yuyum Sanfong is considered the best example of classical Lingnan garden, having utilized features such as lintels with stone carvings, mock mountains made of stone heaps, geometric pool shapes, and massive use of wood carvings. By regions Gwongdung's gardens have been the mainstream of Lingnan gardens. They have been noted for their inclusion of stone heaps as mock mountains, slowly rising roofs and alleys, various sculptures and carvings, contrasting colors of blue and green, and plants that bloom in all four seasons. Gwongsai's gardens tend to be based more on natural landscapes, manifested in stone cliffs and engraved walls. Characteristics Overall, the most commonly discussed characteristics of Lingnan garden include:Âë®Áíê. (2012). Â≤≠ÂçóÂõ≠ÊûóÁâπËâ≤Êé¢Êûê. ÁªøËâ≤ÁßëÊäÄ, (2), 53‚Äì54. Layout Lingnan garden primarily utilizes courtyard layout. The use of courtyard is a prominent trait of Lingnan garden, whose smallness and fineness are said to be comparable with those of classical Japanese garden. The vast majority of private Lingnan gardens utilize courtyard layout. Elements =Artificial mountains= When it comes to artificial mountains (Jyutping: Gaa2 saan1; Traditional Chinese: ÂÅáÂ±±), Lingnan garden utilizes (1) cliffs; (2) islands; (3) artificial reefs; and (4) heaps. This style rarely uses mud to build artificial mountains. =Water= Lingnan garden is said to be heavily based around control of water, involving waterways of various patterns: (1) \\"cliff-waterfall-depth\\" pattern; (2) lake pattern; (3) depth without waterfall; (4) curving waterways; and (5) wellspring. =Stones= Lingnan garden uses a different set of stones from those used by Jiangnan and Northern Chinese gardens. It utilizes local minerals such as Minnan granite, Hainan coral stone, and Taiwan Guru stone. Gardens of this style prefer not to stack up its stones, but instead have them spread outward horizontally, with various methods and patterns of outward spreading. Architecture Lingnan garden utilizes towers, bridges, and corridors. This style either uses \\"high walls and cold lanes\\" to divide a garden into a combination of multiple courtyards, or simply connect the buildings and the courtyards as one single whole. The architecture involves high pillars, wide corridors, and thick walls. \\"Three carvings and three sculpting\\" (Jyutping: Saam1 diu1 saam1 sou3; Traditional Chinese: ‰∏âÈõï‰∏âÂ°ë) - carvings made of wood, brick and stone, and sculptures made of clay, mud, and granite - are prevalent. Classical Lingnan gardens utilize full gardens of three carvings and three sculpting, as shown in Bou Mak Garden (Jyutping: Bou2 mak6 jyun4; Traditional Chinese: ÂØ∂Â¢®Âúí, literally \\"Garden of Treasure and Ink\\") in Punyu, Gwongzau. Buildings in Lingnan garden are typically constructed in classical Lingnan style.He, J. (2005). The Classic Chinese Lingnan Garden in Housing in Sustainable Development - A comparative study in Canton, China. The 2005 World Sustainable Building Conference. Calligraphy and paintings Yuyum Sanfong utilizes some calligraphy as decorations, alongside massive amount of carvings - the latter of which is typical of Cantonese gardens. Classical Lingnan garden uses calligraphy and paintings only sparingly, and modern Lingnan garden is even less inclined to do so. There are, however, several notable instances of such in Lingnan garden design. Yuyum Sanfong, for instance, has the calligraphy \\"È§òÂú∞‰∏âÂºìÁ¥ÖÈõ®Ë∂≥ÔºåËî≠Â§©‰∏ÄËßíÁ∂†Èõ≤Ê∑±\\" (Classical Chinese, literally \\"This land is just as large as three bows, but rich in red rain; Though it is just a corner under the sky, it is abundant with green clouds\\") written on its main door. Plants Vegetation in Lingnan garden is summarized with the sentence \\"all-season flowers, scenery of tropical rain belt\\". Lingnan gardens use native, mainly subtropical plant species such as palm trees (including coconut trees), flamevine, orchids, Chinese banyan, and Lychee trees. Philosophy Lingnan garden is said to embody the philosophy behind Cantonese cultureÊµÖÊûêÊ∏Ö‰ª£Â≤≠ÂçóÁßÅÂÆ∂Âõ≠ÊûóÈÄ†Âõ≠Ëâ∫ÊúØ  commerce, pragmatism, and openness to foreign ideas. For much of the past millennium, Cantonese people have served as major merchants of the Chinese Empire, especially when it came to trade activities with Western Europeans and Southeast Asians. This results in a strong commercial tradition among Cantonese. This distinguishes them from other Han Chinese groups - such as the Northern groups, who have formed the empire's politicians and bureaucrats, or the Wuyue group, who have served prominently as scholars and artists. Cantonese gardens are less bounded by royal standards and frequently adopt foreign (i.e., non-Chinese) elements like stained glass. Also, Cantonese are far less heavily invested in Confucian philosophy, resulting in a style closer to the average people - such as a tendency to fuse gardens with buildings that have mundane purposes. Brief history According to historical records, people in Lingnan were already building gardens during the reign of the Nanyue king Ziu To (? - 137 BC) in Gwongzau. Their royal gardens took after the styles of the Qin Empire's. Afterwards, however, with the decline of the Nanyue regime, Lingnan royal gardens also disappeared. In much of the two millennia that followed, Lingnan had served as the fringe territory of various Chinese dynasties, resulting in a relative lack of royal garden styles. Nonetheless, the area around Gwongzau has become an important port for these dynasties, resulting in a gradual rise of the social and economic importance of the region. This and frequent cultural exchanges with outside powers caused the development of a folk garden style - the classical Lingnan garden.Luo, S. Y., & Zhang, W. Y. (2008).

It was a major Byzantine victory, although it could not reverse the Muslim conquest of Sicily. In 880, a succession of naval successes under the admiral Nasar allowed the Byzantine emperor Basil I the Macedonian to envisage a counter-offensive against the Aghlabids in southern Italy and Sicily. In Sicily, however, the Aghlabids still held the upper hand: in spring 881, the Aghlabid governor al-Hasan ibn al-Abbas raided the remaining Byzantine territories and in the process defeated the local commander, Barsakios, near Taormina. In the next year, however, AH 268 (881/2 CE), according to the Ibn al-Athir (The Complete History, VII.370.5‚Äì7), the Byzantines had their revanche, defeating an Aghlabid army under Abu Thawr so completely that reportedly only seven men survived. The victorious Byzantine commander is identified by modern historians with Mosilikes, who is known to have served in the area in the early 880s. According to the hagiography of the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatios, the general invoked the patriarch during the battle, and he appeared on a white horse in the air before him, advising him to launch his attack towards the right. Mosilikes followed the advice, and won. The battle gave its name to the locality: the 12th-century geographer Muhammad al- Idrisi records the Qal øat Abƒ´ Thawr (\\"Castle of Ab≈´ ·πÆThawr\\"), which is the origin of the modern name Caltavuturo. Over the next years, the Muslims launched several raids against Catania, Taormina, and \\"the king's city\\" (possibly Polizzi) in 883, against Rometta and Catania in 884, and again against Catania and Taormina in 885. These expeditions were successful in so far as they yielded sufficient booty or tribute to pay the army, but failed to capture any Byzantine strongholds.

Sedd√ºlbahir in 1915 seen from the sea. Sedd√ºlbahir during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915. Bigalƒ± Mehmet √áavu≈ü (1878‚Äì3 February 1964), (literally Sergeant Mehmet of Biga) was an Ottoman Army sergeant, who fought during the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I. He is remembered as a hero, and is considered to be the eponym of the common name \\"Mehmet√ßik\\" used for an Ottoman or a Turkish soldier. Early life He was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in 1878. During the Russo-Turkish War (which saw Russians taking Plovdiv on 16 January 1878), Mehmet's family emigrated to Anatolia, and settled in Bah√ßeli village of Biga, √áanakkale in the Ottoman Empire. He participated in the Balkan Wars. Battle Sgt. Mehmet took part in the Gallipoli Campaign (1915‚Äì1916), stationed at the beach in front of the Sedd el Bahr Fort () and artillery batteries on the Gallipoli Peninsula. He fought the landing of the British Army. At 14:45 local time on March 4, 1915, a fleet consisting of five dreadnoughts and seven torpedo boats of the Allies of World War I bombarded Sedd√ºlbahir. They landed sixty troops in three boats at Sedd√ºlbahir from a battleship under the shield of mitrailleuse fire to capture the Ottoman fortifications in order to secure the passage of their naval forces through the Dardanelles. Although the artillery batteries in Sedd√ºlbahir were evacuated by the Ottomans, a squad led by Bigalƒ± Mehmet √áavu≈ü was deployed to the Sedd√ºlbahir Fort. The formation was part of the 10th Company, 3rd Battalion, 27th Regiment of the 9th Division commanded by Colonel Halil Sami Bey, who was responsible for the defense of the area. The 30 Turkish men were armed by rifle and grenade only. During the three- hour-long fierce battle, the Turks continuously changed their positions in the fort, giving an impression of being stronger in numbers than they actually were. No more Allied troop landing took place due to this tactic. During the battle, Sgt. Mehmet's rifle barrel broke into pieces, so he threw his broken rifle at the enemy, and instead started to attack them with stones. This attack caused Sgt. Mehmet to be wounded in the head and on the right chest. When his comrades saw Sgt. Mehmet fighting with stones, they broke cover and began to fire openly. Finally, the invading Allied troops retreated to their battleships following a sword bayonet thrust launched by the Turks. As the Ottoman reserve force came to the scene in the evening, there were 6 dead, 13 wounded among the Ottoman soldiers, and only 12 left were capable to keep up with any fight. Aftermath Lieutenant colonel Mustafa Kemal, commander of the 19th Division at Haraptepe, sent a report to Cevat Pasha, commander of the Dardanelles fortifications, and asked him to award Sgt. Mehmet with a medal. Vice Commander-in-chief Enver Pasha visited Sgt. Mehmet at the military hospital in √áanakkale, and decorated him with the Ottoman War Medal. Sgt. Mehmet served sixteen years in the army. Later, he lived a modest life in Bah√ßeli village of Biga in √áanakkale Province; refusing financial assistance as he had fought for his country and not for money. He died at age 86 on 3 February 1964, and was buried next to his wife's grave in his village. Legacy A similar war medal is on display in the \\"Bigalƒ± Mehmet √áavu≈ü Arts Gallery\\". It is considered that the common name \\"Mehmet√ßik\\" (literally \\"Little Mehmet\\") for an Ottoman or a Turkish soldier was coined after him. In 2017, his burial site was transformed into a monumental grave, and a war gallery was established next to it. Some high-ranked military officers and local politicians have visited his grave to pay their respects. He is remembered as a hero.

Ballastless track of the type \\"Low Vibration Track\\" in a turnout in the Gotthard Base Tunnel's Faido multifunction station.  Characteristics  In ballastless tracks, the rails are rigidly fastened to special types of concrete ties/sleepers that are themselves set in concrete. Ballastless tracks therefore offer a high consistency in track geometry, the adjusting of which is not possible after the concreting of the superstructure. Therefore, ballastless tracks must be concreted within a tolerance of . The elasticity of the ballast in the traditional railway superstructure is replaced by flexibility between either the rails and the concrete ties/sleepers or the ties/sleepers and the concrete or asphalt slab as well inherent elasticity within the conglomerate of the tie/sleeper, whereas the concrete or asphalt slab is usually inelastic.  Advantages  The advantages of a ballastless track over a traditional superstructure are its highly consistent track geometry, its longer life span, and the reduced need for maintenance. A ballastless track‚Äôs track geometry is achieved mainly due its relative inelasticity in comparison to a traditional superstructure that results in far fewer deformations and generally smoother running; drivers of the London Overground's East London Line have informally declared the Low Vibration Track system as the smoothest superstructure they have experienced. Measurements conducted in Switzerland in 2003 and 2004 showed a standard deviation of the gauge of less than . This in turn increases the track‚Äôs life span and reduces the need for maintenance. The usual preventive maintenance is limited to rail grinding, since tamping is not necessary due to the absence of ballast. Curative maintenance beyond rail replacement is required only after several decades. The Swiss Federal Railways replaced the ties/sleepers and rubber shoes of the ballastless track in the -long Heitersberg tunnel between 2014 and 2016, whereas no maintenance of the concrete slab was necessary 39 years after the tunnel‚Äôs opening. Due to its good experiences with the system, the Swiss Federal Railways are looking to install ballastless track wherever there is a rigid substructure‚Äîin tunnels as well as on viaducts. Further advantages of ballastless tracks include better and controlled drainage, the elimination of flying-ballast damage on rolling stock and civil engineering structures, a shallower superstructure, and the possibility run-over sections such as crossings over which pneumatic vehicles can be driven. When used in stations, ballastless tracks are easier to clean.  Disadvantages  The primary disadvantage of a ballastless track is its significantly higher cost of initial construction. While numbers vary depending on construction type and track infrastructure (ballastless tracks are generally more suitable to infrastructures that are also made of concrete, as is the case in tunnels or on viaducts), the Deutsche Bahn estimated in 2015 that construction costs of ballastless tracks are 40 percent higher than those of traditional superstructure. However, the life-cycle cost of ballastless tracks are generally lower than those of ballasted tracks due to significantly lower maintenance. Further disadvantages of ballastless tracks are the impossibility of adjusting or correcting track geometry once concrete has been set, the necessity of a stable infrastructure (since no adjustments can be made to the superstructure), higher noise emissions, and longer repair times when the concrete slab is damaged (e.g. due to construction faults or wear and tear).  Construction Types  Early slab track projects a range of construction types, sub-bases and fastening technologies. The following list contains construction types of ballastless tracks that have been internationally used in heavy-rail systems (as opposed to light railways, tramways, or metros) in chronological order of their first usage.  SBB B√∂zberg/STEDEF (SBB)  The B√∂zberg/STEDEF system consists of twin ties/sleepers that are connected by a steel track rod and enclosed in a rubber shoe. All of its components can be exchanged individually. B√∂zberg/STEDEF was first used by the Swiss Federal Railways in the B√∂zberg tunnel in 1966. STEDEF was further developed by SATEBA prior to the system‚Äôs installation on the French LGV M√©diteran√©e. Ballastless track of the type \\"Rheda 2000\\" between rail tunnels under the Dordtsche Kil  Rheda (Rail.One)  The Rheda system consists of three layers: a base course and two slabs that are joined by rebars, as are the individual ties/sleepers. Rheda was first used by the Deutsche Bahn in Rheda-Wiedenbr√ºck station, after which it is named, in 1972. It has since been installed on the Dutch HSL-Zuid route between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the Spanish Guadarrama and Sant Joan Desp√≠ tunnels, and on various Chinese high-speed lines including Wuhan‚ÄìGuangzhou High-Speed Railway.  B√∂gl (Max B√∂gl)  The B√∂gl ballastless track is characterised by its use of prefabricated concrete slabs in lieu of a continuous structure that is cast on site. Mortar is used to connect the 9-ton-slabs to the infrastructure and to one another. The B√∂gl system was developed in Germany and first tested in Dachau in 1977. The first serial installation took place in Schleswig-Holstein and Heidelberg in 1999. For its use on the high-speed link between Beijing and Shanghai, 406,000 slabs were installed.Firmengruppe Max B√∂gl: \\"Hochgeschwindigkeit in China mit FF B√∂gl\\" MB Quadrat (in German). 2010. pp. 18f.  FF √ñBB/PORR (PORR)  The √ñBB/PORR ballastless track (FF stands for German Feste Fahrbahn, meaning ballastless or, literally, fixed track) consists of an elastically supported track slab. It was first tested in 1989, became the standard system in Austria in 1995, and has been used for over 700 kilometres of track worldwide, including the German Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit Nr. 8 (German Unity Transport Project 8) and the Doha metro. The system will be used on the first phases of the United Kingdom's High Speed 2 line, except in tunnels and for some specialist structures. Ballastless track of the type \\"Low Vibration Track\\" in the Gotthard Base Tunnel's Sedrun multifunction station.  Low Vibration Track (Sonneville/Vigier Rail)  The Low Vibration Track (LVT) system is similar to B√∂zberg/STEDEF in that it also uses twin ties/sleepers enclosed in rubber shoes. However, LVT does not feature a tie rod. The system was developed and tested by Roger Sonneville together with the Swiss Federal Railways in the 1990s before the rights were sold to Vigier Rail in 2009. LVT has been in service in the Channel tunnel since 1994. Due to the tunnel‚Äôs German name Eurotunnel, LVT is sometimes referred to as Euroblock. LVT has been used for over 1300 kilometres of track worldwide, including the Swiss L√∂tschberg, Gotthard and Ceneri base tunnels, the South Korean high-speed Suin Line between Songdo and Incheon, the Turkish Marmaray project, and the London Overgound's East London line, as well as on viaducts in urban areas. LVT has become the standard ballastless-track system in Switzerland.  IVES  The IVES system (Intelligent, Versatile, Efficient and Solid) is a product of Rhomberg Rail. The system consists of a base layer (preferably common asphalt concrete) and concrete lateral structural elements, in which the rail fastening elements of the type DFF 304 are directly embedded ‚Äì no ties/sleepers are needed. The necessary elasticity is given only by a flexible intermediate plate in the rail fastening elements. The structural elements of this system are individually manufactured and can be positioned laterally or longitudinally onto the base layer. The structural elements have recesses in the top, where the rail fastening elements are placed into. Afterwards, the rails are lifted onto the fastening elements and a track grid is established. The grid‚Äôs exact position can now be adjusted vertically and laterally. At last, the rail fastening elements are friction- locked to the structural elements with high-strength grouting mortar. Thanks to its versatile construction and easy installation, IVES is suitable for all rail types. After testing, the first IVES track has been installed in the Asfordby Tunnel of the Old Dalby Test Track in Great Britain in 2013 and since then, 7 more IVES tracks have been built. The longest IVES track runs through the Bruggwaldtunnel in Switzerland, with a total length of 1,731 m.

Social background The area around Amtala is a rich agricultural area, which is somewhat cut off from the outside world. The nearest railway station is around 23 km away and buses for Baharampur few and far between. The population is largely Muslim and education particularly amongst the girls was not encouraged. They were married off early. The social reformation started with the setting up of Amtala High School, a co- educational institution. However, the conservative community was not eager to send the girls to such a school, post class VIII. The young girls continued to be married off early. With the help of a few liberal intellectuals, the forward-looking section of the population established a girls‚Äô school, Anandaoni Balika Vidyalaya. Very slowly the education of girls was promoted and more and more people were getting convinced about the need for girls‚Äô education. The next hurdle was a college. The nearest college was 22 km away. Jatindra Rajendra Mahavidyalaya was started in 1986 with 36 students, one third of them being girls. Education Jatindra Rajendra Mahavidyalaya was established in 1986 at Amtala. Guru Prasad Biswas and Birendranath Biswas made a handsome contribution, and the college was named after the fathers of both the donors. The land was provided by Amtala High School. Affiliated with the University of Kalyani, it offers honours courses in Bengali, English, Arabic, history, philosophy, political science and education. Amtala High School was established in 1919. It is a coeducational institution up to 12th class. Amtala Anadamani Balika Vidyalaya was established in 1972. It is a girls‚Äô school up to 12th class.

History The barracks were designed to accommodate an infantry regiment in transit for operations overseas and were built between 1856 and 1859. Initially named \\"New Barracks\\", the barracks were built in the colonial style with flat roofs and verandas. The site was first occupied by the 86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot in August 1859. A gymnasium was added in 1868. During the Second World War the barracks were used by the Royal Navy as a training facility for new recruits, initially under the name of HMS Victory IV and then as HMS St George. After the War the barracks were occupied by the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and were renamed St George Barracks. The barracks were handed over to the 20 Landing Craft Tank Support Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport in 1968 and, after that unit vacated the barracks. They continued in Ministry of Defence civilian use until 1998 when they were handed back to the Crown Estate for disposal; the site was subsequently acquired for residential use.

It is the administrative seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church and its head, the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Finished in 1935, the building was declared a cultural monument on 18 December 1984.Cultural monuments in Serbia - Building of the Patriarchate  Location  View from the Kralja Petra Street The building is located in the neighborhood of Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac, formerly known as Varo≈° Kapija, in the municipality of Stari Grad. It is bounded by the streets of Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac on the west, Kneza Sime Markoviƒáa on the east and Kralja Petra on the south, occupying majority of the block formed by these streets. Being located in the oldest part of Belgrade outside of the Belgrade Fortress, the building is surrounded by many historical and important edifices and localities: Belgrade Fortress and Kalemegdan Park on the north, University of Arts in Belgrade, Park Mihailo Petroviƒá Alas, Mika Alas's House, the Sava river and the historical district of Savamala on the west, Faculty of Applied Arts and Princess Ljubica's Residence on the south, St. Michael's Cathedral and kafana ?, the oldest, still functioning kafana in Belgrade, on the east. The official address of the building is 6 Kneza Sime Markoviƒáa Street.  History   Metropolis building  The lot on which the building stands today was bought by the Serbian state in 1818. One of the konaks of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá was located there. The building which was the seat of the Metropolis of Belgrade and Karlovci was built in 1863. It was a one-storey building, with simplified and reduced ornaments on the fa√ßade. Though modest in terms of architectural value, it was important historically. Before it was demolished to make room for the new building, Patriarch Varnava commissioned the painter Kosta Hakman to paint the edifice. Hakman made two paintings in 1933, one of the central building and another of a small auxiliary kitchen object. Popular myth at the time claimed that in the kitchen object the severed head of Karaƒëorƒëe was kept in 1817, before Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá sent it to Istanbul. The paintings are kept in the Museum of the Patriarchate at the Patriarchate Court in Sremski Karlovci.  Origin  Serbian Orthodox Church adopted the new Constitution in 1930. Article 48 called for the construction of the new seat of the Patriarchate in the neighborhood of Savinac, on the Vraƒçar Plateau. In the process, the church also decided to demolish the old Metropolis building in Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac and build the new one. As the project on Vraƒçar was envisioned as a monumental one, it was decided that the new Metropolis building will be constructed first. Further problem was caused by the slow and uncertain construction of the, also monumentally planned, Church of Saint Sava, which drained the largest funds, postponing the construction of other planned sacral objects. Additionally, the old Metropolis building was in bad shape anyway so it got a priority and was to serve as the temporary seat of the church until the project on Savinac is finished.  Construction  The building is a project of the Russian √©migr√© architect Viktor Lukomski. Among other buildings, he designed the small Church of Saint Sava on Vraƒçar, the eponymous hotel on the Avala Mountain and the Royal Palace within the Royal Compound on Dedinje. The plan was finished in 1932 when the construction began. By 1933 the old Metropolis building was demolished and the new edifice was finished in 1935. After it was completed, the government said that there is no more money left for another, monumental administrative church building, implying that the new building is quite suitable to be the seat of the entire Serbian Orthodox Church, not just one of its eparchies. Though even today one lot next to the Church of Saint Sava is reserved for the planned building, the construction never started. During the digging for the foundations, the underground corridors, or lagums were discovered. They connected the Princess Ljubica's Residence, Cathedral Church and the Metropolis building. They were dug on the orders from Prince Milo≈°, so that he could meet with the leaders of the church, unbeknownst to the Ottomans who ruled Serbia at the time. The lagums were used by the builders of the new edifice to conduct the heating pipes.  Architecture  The front fa√ßade The function of the building influenced the style. In his project, Lukomski adjusted the bulky Academism to the modernized Serbo-Byzantine Revival style in his own, free interpretation. His solution was original, but complex and heterogeneous, as he needed to satisfy his conservative patrons. The building has a rectangular base and is solidly and sturdy built. National style is observed in the pyramidal structure of the parts of the building and their step-like placement onto each other, arches and arched niches, consoles and the details of the decoration. Academism can be seen in the disposition of the base, layout of the rooms, division of the fa√ßade in three horizontal zones, regularly shaped openings, prominence of the garlands which divide the sections of the fa√ßade and the strict use of backspace ornaments. Modernist influence of the day is evident in the simple and neutral surface of the fa√ßade and characteristic rectangular windows on the highest floor of the side wings. Due to the significant decline of the terrain, as the entire neighborhood of Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac is on the mass-wasting prone slope of the Sava river, the edifice has an uneven number of floors on the lateral, lengthwise sides. The interior design, though representatively shaped, has a certain austerity due to the function of the building. The basement and the ground floor are reserved for the various institutes of the Serbian Orthodox Church, offices, archives and the premises of the Spiritual Court. The entire first floor constitutes the quarters of the Patriarch. It consists of the Patriarch's apartment, cabinet, chapel, library, dining room, reception hall and apartment for the guests. On the second floor there are working offices and halls for the sessions of the various councils and the Synod. In the largest hall there is a famous painting \\"Migration of the Serbs\\" by Paja Jovanoviƒá, hanging on the wall. An annex with the apartments for the ecclesial dignitaries leans on the eastern block of the edifice. The front fa√ßade, facing the Cathedral Church, is marked by the massive portico with the decorated and arch-like portal. The portal's prominence is accentuated by the characteristic, deformed short columns, which are a common and recognizable motif of the church architecture projected by the Russian √©migr√© architects. Two other distinctive objects on the portal are the coat of arms and a mosaic. The relief coat of arms of the Patriarchate was done by the sculptor Vladimir Zagorodnjuk and is located above the semicircular entrance. The composition represents two angels which are crowning the coat of arms with the episcopal mitre. On the upper section of the front fa√ßade, in the niche above the portal, there is a large, elongated mosaic representing John the Baptist. It was made on the draft by the painter Vladimir Predojeviƒá. When finished, the building was praised, both by public and the press, which described it as an \\"imposing, magnificent edifice\\" and that its \\"simplified Neo-Byzantine style fits into the sacral area of Belgrade\\".  Complex   Chapel  In the inner yard, east of the building, there is a chapel dedicated to Saint Symeon the Myrrh-streaming, with the large dome above it. In the chapel there is a woodcut iconostasis, made by the masters from Ohrid, with the icons painted by Predojeviƒá in 1935.  Museum  The Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church is situated in the northern block of the building. Its rich collection has a significant religious, cultural and historical value. Though majority of the preparatory work has been done by the Patriarch Varnava and professor , the museum was officially open during the tenure of Patriarch Vikentije II in 1954. Bulk of the exhibits comes from the churches and monasteries in Syrmia and Fru≈°ka Gora which were looted by the Usta≈°e during the World War II. The exhibits were returned from Zagreb after the war. The collection consists of the religious paintings, portraits of the church dignitaries, old Serbian engravings, handwritten and printed srbuljas, numerous chasubles, sacral objects, votive offerings, religious embroideries, seals, historical documents, etc. The most valuable artifacts include the rich collection of Byzantine-style icons from the period of Ottoman rule, the robe of Prince Lazar with his heraldic mark on the buttons (a helmet with the ox horns), the shroud of King Milutin and a glass donated to the Mile≈°eva monastery by Ivan the Terrible in 1558 (his grandmother was Serbian noble Ana Jak≈°iƒá).  Library  The Library of the Patriarchate occupies the central south part of the edifice. Its collection is the oldest library in Serbia. Some of the books originate from the period of the Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá, who took them with him from the Patriarchate of Peƒá when the Great Migrations of the Serbs from Kosovo and Metohija began in 1690.

History The Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities was established in 1997 by initiative of three constituent communities from Moscow, Kaluga and Obninsk. On 19 July 1997 Vadim Stanislavovich Kazakov from Kaluga's community was elected as the leader of the USC SNB. On 21 July 2011 Kazakov resigned and Maksim Ionov became his successor through a vote held by the veche (assembly) on 23 July. Annually, on Perun's Day (20 July) the \\"All-Slavic Veche\\" takes place in Kaluga. The assembly deals with issues including the further widening of the organisation, the cooperation with other organisations, and also the nominations of the chief and of the high priesthood. Hundreds of representatives of many Slavic communities scattered throughout Russia come to the yearly veche. In April 2011, the USC SNB bought a 4,77-hectares plot of land just five kilometres away from the city of Kaluga, on the left bank of the river Kaluzhka, located in the village of Krasotinka, with the purpose of building a temple. In 2014, the USC SNB was officially registered by the government of Russia as an interregional organisation for the development of Slavic culture. On 22 June 2015, the day of summer solstice, the Temple of the Fire of Svarozich (–•—Ä–∞–º –û–≥–Ω—è –°–≤–∞—Ä–æ–∂–∏—á–∞) was officially opened in the village of Krasotynka. Ideology The union claims to represent Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), that is to say the revival of historical Slavic religion, upon which indigenous Slavic customs and traditions rely. The organisation aims at the consolidation of Slavic Native Faith communities across the different Slavic states, as well as the cooperation with non-Slavic modern Pagan organisations in Europe, the United States and Canada. The USC SNF requires believers in Slavic Native Faith to be genealogically Slavs. Constituent groups * Moscow Slavic Community \\"Svetoyariye\\" * Moscow Slavic Community \\"Circle of the Viatiches\\" * Kaluga Slavic Community * Oryol Slavic Community * Balashov Slavic Community * Stavropol Slavic Community \\"Slavic Heritage\\" * Cherepovets Slavic Community \\"Gromnitsa\\" * Novokuznetsk Slavic Community * Anapa Slavic Community * Ozersk Slavic Community * Magnitogorsk Slavic Community * Slavyansk-na-Kubani Slavic Community \\"Sventovid\\" * Tambov Slavic Community \\"Zhiva\\" * Smolensk Slavic Community \\"Morning of Svarog\\" * Kemerovo Slavic Community \\"Goryuch Stone\\" Splinter organisations and cooperation Some organisations branched out of the Union of Slavic Native Faith Communities due to ideological differences.

Nesbitt was the son of Thomas Nesbitt of Lismore, County Cavan and his wife Jane. He was apprenticed to his uncle Albert Nesbitt, a London merchant, and became his partner and heir. His uncle died on 12 January 1753 and Nesbit inherited his business, his estate at Icklesham and his political connections with the Pelham family. Lord Sandwich allowed Nesbitt to take over his uncle's seat as Member of Parliament for Mitchell at a by-election in 1753 and was prepared to support him again in 1754 but Henry and James Pelham insisted upon his standing then at Winchelsea. He married Susanna Thrale, daughter of Ralph Thrale MP on 28 November 1758. At this time he had several government contracts and worked in close partnership with James and George Colebrooke. These contracts included ones for money remittances to America in 1756, and for victualling troops at Louisburg and St. John's in North America & Guadeloupe and Quebec between 1758 and 1760. He had interest in a Dublin bank with George Colebrooke, and he was underwriting Government loans on a large scale. Nesbitt was asked to stand down at Winchelsea in the 1761 general election and instead was returned at Cricklade. Although he had purchased the borough and hundred of Cricklade in 1764, he was defeated there at the general election of 1768, and only re-entered Parliament for Winchelsea in a by-election in January 1770. He was by then in partnership with Adam Drummond holding contracts for victualling troops in North America and Canada. After the outbreak of the American War, the size of the contracts was doubled and he received a grant of 20,000 acres in St John's Island. In the 1774 general election Nesbitt was returned as MP for Winchelsea unopposed, and as MP for Cricklade after a contest. He chose to sit for Cricklade until his death in 1779. He is not recorded as having spoken in all his time in Parliament. Nesbitt died aged 57 on 7 April 1779 and left most of his estate to his nephew John Nesbitt, after providing for two illegitimate sons Colebrooke Nesbitt and Arnold Nesbitt.

The story is about a mother Kunti Devi who demands a perfect daughter-in-law with five qualities, from God for her son Kanhaiya. However, as a result of a strange twist she ends up with five daughters-in-laws with one quality each. Plot This story is based on how a mother, Kunti Devi's desire turns into disappointment. The five qualities she requires in her daughter-in-law are beauty, wisdom, romance, culinary skills and religious devotion. With the blessing of lord Shiva, Kanhaiya was married to Pari (meaning fairy- beautiful),Prarthana (meaning prayer), Panjiri (a kind of north Indian food), Prema (meaning love) and then Pratibha (intelligence) - with qualities matching with their names. The plot is inspired by the story of Draupadi, who had requested Lord Shiva in her previous life to be granted a husband with great qualities, but erred by repeating each quality five times and therefore was granted the boon of five husbands. The Paanchal family lives in Meerut. The Second Season (Second Innings) was going on air from 23 October 2018 to 21 January 2019, where Kunti's new greed of having another quality in each of her bahu leads to Lord Shiva fulfilling it by giving a boon of 5 children to the daughter in laws that is Surili (means melodious) to Pratibha, Shakti (means strength) to Prema, Chanchal (playful) to Prathna, Buddhi (means intelligence) to Pari and Dhairya (means patience) to Panjiri to complete their qualities.

The main cave has been excavated and the finds indicate three periods of occupation over many centuries. Cave and access The cave stands about 300 yards from the northern end of the red sandstone cliffs and was formed by wave action working at a weak point, a fissure, at the base of red sandstone cliffs that run from the Brigurd Point to Portencross however it now stands about above the level of the old raised beach that runs down to the sea. The cave is not very large (high, wide, and about long) and is now best accessed by entering the Hawking Craig Wood near the 'Three Sisters' cliffs and carefully walking along the base of the escarpment. The Wishing or Holy Well A spring known as the 'Wishing Well' was located near the rock shelter or cave, one reference stating that this deep well it is actually located within the cave or at the entrance. The name 'Wishing Well' has been interpreted as deriving from Saxon and meaning the \\"Wise man or Instructor's Well\\" The most popular time to visit the well was on the first Sunday in May when water was collected for its supposed curative properties and it is further recorded that on occasions the local minister was persuaded to visit the well to baptise children using its holy water. The well's name also implies the common practice of making wishes and offerings of coins and other items. History and excavation The entrance to the Holy Cave. When excavated in 1879 the cave was measured at 27 ft long and 6 ft high and wide for 15 ft to the rear. The excavation went down to a depth of 6ft before hitting bedrock and three levels were discernible, each made up of layers of well-trodden ashes and seashells, the first at 18 in, a second at 30in, and the basal layer at 39ins deep. Many bones were found including Deer, cat, pig, horse, sheep, goat, ox, and rabbit bones were found, the horse bones between the upper and second level with dog bones between the middle and basal levels. A significant find was a bone object with a rectangular hole at one end found on the second level and a flint object was found just above the basal level. An object made of slate was found. Some pottery fragments were found including a coarse, unglazed, reddish appearance and a thinner example with a green-brown glaze similar to Scottish Medieval pottery. The National Museum of Scotland holds the bone implement and some pottery fragments (Accession Numbers. HM 3-4). A shelter would most likely have once existed at the cave entrance although no recognisable signs survive of concavities etc used to support such an arrangement. Some apparent man-made workings on the rock face exist close by however there is an absence of religious symbols or graffiti of any kind, however, the soft red sandstone is easily eroded by rain and wind action and any such markings may have been lost even if they ever existed. ;The Ardeer Cave Smith's Cave or rock shelter at the Hawking Craig. A cave exists near the site of the old Ardeer House in Stevenston. Until covered over the remains of a dressed stone frame formed an iron grille over a hole in the cave roof suggesting its use as a grotto in the 19th century. The visible remains suggested a souterrain, but the near absence of records of these in south-west Scotland make this unlikely. The passage is lined with corbelled drystone walling, roofed with capstones, and leads into a natural cave section which may have been formed by wave action as it shows a water-scour likely to have been created by wave action. Some areas of undisturbed stratified deposits have been found, together with evidence of occupation, such as a hearth, bones, and a fragment of glass.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2017-9-16 ;St Molaise's Cave A similar cave or rock shelter survives on Holy Island (off the east coast of Arran) where Saint Molaise, an early Irish saint and abbot of Old Leighlin in Co. Carlow, who is supposed to have lived in the 6th and 7th centuries. Parallels can also be drawn with Saint Ninian's Cave at Glasserton in Dumfries and Galloway. Micro-history The name 'Hawking Craig' refers to the medieval practice of collecting young sparrowhawks and goshawks for the sport of falconry. The famous Hunterston Brooch was found by workmen at the Hawking Craig in 1826. Prior to the Battle of Largs in 1263 a skirmish is said to have taken place on the raised beach area in front of the cave and a cairn or cairns once stood here that were said to be the graves of Vikings killed during the engagement. Wilson records in the early 19th century seeing several graves made of six stones that only contained ashes and a large cairn at the base of the cliff where the skirmish took place in which coins were found. These were removed when the author was a boy. Local legend has it that three sisters, Meg, Jean and Lizzie, were witches and whipped up the storm that caused such havoc amongst King Haco's fleet. The 'Three Sisters' are named for them.

Biography Sutherland with his bull terrier. Early years Sutherland arrived in Cape Town in 1896 at the age of 24, with no fixed ideas of a career. Initially he engaged in various occupations in Johannesburg, Mafeking, Matabeleland, Lake Tanganyika and the Congo, including professional boxing, running African trading stores, and working as a labour overseer on the construction of the Beira-Mashonaland railway. On the outbreak of the Anglo Boer War in 1899, he moved into the African hinterland to hunt elephant professionally. Professional hunter In 1904 Sutherland moved into German East Africa where he hunted for the next decade. From 1905 to 1906 he became involved in the Maji Maji Rebellion, fought with German colonial forces, and was awarded the Iron Cross for his conduct. In 1912, Sutherland met his lifelong friend Major G.H. \\"Andy\\" Anderson, who Sutherland introduced to elephant hunting. The same year, Sutherland published an account of his exploits to that date, The Adventures Of An Elephant Hunter. Upon his arrival in London in 1913, he was feted as the \\"World's Greatest Elephant Hunter\\". Military service In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Sutherland was hunting in German East Africa. The German authorities attempted to detain him but, by making a detour of , Sutherland made his way through Portuguese East Africa to Nyasaland, where upon arrival he was engaged by the Governor as an intelligence officer. Sutherland with Major G.H. \\"Andy\\" Anderson. In June 1915, Sutherland was severely wounded by a German sniper who shot him in the abdomen with an explosive bullet. After the conquest of German East Africa, Sutherland was made Chief Intelligence Officer and Provost Marshall on Brigadier-General Norley's staff with the rank of Lieutenant, and in 1916 he was promoted to Captain. Sutherland was mentioned in dispatches on several occasions and was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur for his services as a special guide to the Nyasaland Field Force. Return to hunting and death After the war, Sutherland hunted in Uganda, the Belgian Congo, and the French Congo. In 1929, Sutherland fell victim to a conspiracy by the Azande tribe against white people, and was poisoned. He recovered and continued to hunt, despite being partially paralyzed. Eventually Sutherland died from the poison's effects in the Yubo Sleeping Sickness Camp on 26 June 1932, and in his will he bequeathed all of his property to Major Anderson. Sutherland was buried near Yubo, and his friends later erected a bronze tablet on the spot, engraved with two elephants standing beneath a palm tree, which reads in part: > To the Memory of that great elephant Hunter ‚Äì JIM SUTHERLAND. Hunting preferences and records Plate from The Adventures Of An Elephant Hunter. Over the course of his life, Sutherland shot between 1,300 and 1,600 elephants.

On one occasion an elephant hurled him into the air and he landed on its back, holding on for dear life he managed to grab an overhanging branch, drop to the ground then, once he had recovered his rifle, follow up and kill the elephant.

The barracks were created by converting some late-18th century warehouses into military accommodation in 1825. The site had previously been a large timber-yard and carpenters' workshops; it was purchased by the government during the Napoleonic Wars and converted into an 'immense' stores complex for the Commissariat (responsible for supplying food, fuel and forage to the troops). These former warehouses are still in place, forming an asymmetrical open courtyard at the south-west end of what is now Portsmouth Grammar School: they stand three storeys high and originally contained open- plan store rooms accessed through external hoist doors on each storey. In October 1825 each floor was converted to form barrack rooms; the 9th Regiment (Fusileers) was the first to occupy the new barracks.[according to Slight & Slight in 1828 - perhaps 7th (Fusilier) Regiment?] At that time a guard-house formed the fourth side of the quadrangle. In 1856-58 the barracks were extended and enhanced to create accommodation for regiments in transit for operations overseas. An officers' quarters was built, fronting on to the High Street, with a large officers' mess on the first floor. At some distance behind it (so as to form a sizeable parade ground) a long, three-storey soldiers' barracks was erected, containing a series of back-to-back barrack rooms either side of a central office section, with a cook-house at the south- west end linking it to the older barrack blocks. It was at around this time that the barracks were named after Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge who had recently died. Subsequently a two-storey block was built, between the old barracks quadrangle and the new officers' quarters, containing offices for the Commanding Officer and others. In January 1887 there was a serious gas explosion at the site in which five members of the Worcestershire Regiment died and fourteen were injured. The 1st Battalion, the Northumberland Fusiliers was in transit at the barracks when the First World War broke out in August 1914. The barracks became disused and fell derelict after the First World War. The officers' quarters were acquired by Portsmouth Grammar School in 1926. The soldiers' barracks blocks were initially amalgamated into the adjacent Clarence Barracks; later, they too were acquired by the school, which now covers the entire former barracks site. The school library occupies the former officers' mess.

She was fluent in both Maori and English.  Career  Growing up Mary Wi Repa had a love of music and only began painting seriously around 1958, when she was in her 50s. She developed a love of landscape painting, particularly romanticism combined with an interpretive realism. Wi Repa had planned to attend the Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland, and applied for a tuition grant from MƒÅori Affairs, however she decided against attending. Although of MƒÅori ancestry, Wi Repa preferred not to directly reference her culture, but rather to draw her inspiration from the environment around her. Her works often include cloud imagery or landscapes, including the piece Otoko, Gisborne (date unknown). She believed her talent came through from her grand uncle Arthur Gundry who had been accepted into the Royal Academy of London in the 19th century who had been mentored by Joseph Jenner Merrett. Wi Repa exhibited at the Willeston Galleries (Wellington) in 1964 and her pieces are included in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Her mother, Mary Purinton, was the great-granddaughter of Ezra Brown, one of the early settlers of Windham, Maine, who was killed by the Indian chief, Poland, during the last battle between the inhabitants of Windham and the Indians, on May 14, 1756. Her father, Joseph C. Larry, was a blacksmith and farmer, and resided in Windham. Her early life was quiet and simple. She was educated in the common schools of her own town and in Gorham Female Seminary. Career Some of her early poetical productions fell into the hands of a well-known critic and scholar, who secured their publication in several Maine papers, much to the surprise of their youthful author. In 1860 Dole began to write for the Portland Transcript, the Kennebec Journal, Hallowell Gazette and other Maine papers. John Neal and Edward H. Elwell gave her much encouragement.

The film starred by Mauricio Ochmann, Alfonso Dosal and Aislinn Derbez in lead roles along with Humberto Busto, Ignacia Allamand and Ariel Levy. The film grossed $182.17 million pesos in Mexico, and is the sixth highest-grossing Mexican film. In Spanish.  Plot  Ra√∫l (Mauricio Ochmann), Eduardo (Humberto Busto) and Santiago (Alfonso Dosal) have led a happy and \\"masculine\\" life from their childhood, until, one day, Santiago confesses to them that he is gay. Ra√∫l reacts negatively to this revelation, trying to convince Santiago that it's just a phase, which damages his relationship. Santiago starts a relationship with Juli√°n, a famous chef, and begins plans to move to Miami with him and leave his old life behind, and Ra√∫l feels jealous of losing closeness with Santiago, and this jealosy increases the conflicts with him until they cut each other off. At the same time, his wife Luciana finds out that he has been flirting with other women and arranging hookups and seeks a divorce from him. Losing two of the most important relationships in his life leads Ra√∫l to reexamine his preconceptions about masculinity, friendship and love. Eventually, Santiago backs down from his plans when he finds out that Juli√°n is polyamorous and isn't willing to keep a monogamous relationship with him. Ra√∫l apologizes to Santiago and they make amends. In the final scene, a couple years later, Ra√∫l is still trying to earn Luciana's forgiveness and regain her love, but she is still hesitant to give him another chance. Santiago is dating an employee of Eduardo and Ra√∫l seems more comfortable with his friend's homosexuality, but he still reacts with discomfort to see his own son playing with a doll, hinting that future conflict may still arise.  Cast  * Mauricio Ochmann as Ra√∫l * Alfonso Dosal as Santiago * Aislinn Derbez as Nati, Santiago's girlfriend. * Humberto Busto as Eduardo * Ignacia Allamand as Luciana, Ra√∫l's wife. * Ariel Levy as Juli√°n, Santiago's boyfriend. * Luis Pablo Rom√°n as Ra√∫l's therapist.  Criticism  GLAAD criticized the film as especially homophobic in its 2018 report \\"Studio Responsibility Index\\" stating: \\"Overall, this movie contained so much anti-gay language and sentiment played for laughs, that Ra√∫l coming around is barely consequential. While this film did pass the Vito Russo Test by including an LGBTQ character who was significant to the plot and had the same sort of unique personality traits as non-LGBTQ characters, it does not stop the film from being incredibly offensive.\\" References  External links  Hazlo como Hombre on Pantaya Chilean films Mexican films Mexican LGBT-related films Chilean LGBT-related films Chilean comedy-drama films Mexican comedy-drama films LGBT-related comedy-drama films 2017 LGBT-related films 2017 films ","title":"Do It Like an Hombre"},{"id":"55266829","text":"''''' (Four motets on Gregorian themes), Op. 10, are four sacred motets composed by Maurice Durufl√© in 1960, based on Gregorian themes. He set Ubi caritas et amor', Tota pulchra es, Tu es Petrus and Tantum ergo.  History  Maurice Durufl√© composed the four motets in 1960, based on Gregorian themes, as he had done before in his Requiem of 1948. He set Latin texts, scored for unaccompanied voices: a mixed choir in Nos. 1, 3 and 4, and a women's choir in No. 2. Durufl√© dedicated the work to Auguste Le Guennant, the director of the Gregorian Institute of Paris. The motets were published in 1960 by √âditions Durand, Durufl√©'s primary publisher. The motets were first performed on 4 May 1961 at the church of Saint-Merri in Paris by the Chorale St√©phane Caillat.  Structure, texts and music  The four motets set Latin texts for different liturgical occasions: # Ubi caritas et amor # Tota pulchra es # Tu es Petrus # Tantum ergo The text for the first motet is Ubi caritas et amor (\\"Where charity and love are\\"), an antiphon for Maundy Thursday. Tota pulchra es (\\"Thou art all fair\\") is a text from Vespers for the Marian Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The text for the third motet, Tu es Petrus (\\"Thou art Peter\\"), addressing Simon as Peter the Apostle, is taken from . The last motet is based on Tantum ergo, the conclusion of the Pange lingua by St. Thomas Aquinas. In the four motets, Durufl√© based his music on Gregorian chant. He combines the chant lines with a polyphonic setting. The chant is always present in one or more voices. The music has been described as \\"rich in subtle harmonies, well-written for voices, and reminiscent of impressionism\\". A reviewer notes: \\"Here Durufl√© shows his particular genius for invoking the spiritual element of plainsong in a polyphonic context, achieving a suppleness of rhythm alongside strong characterization of each text.\\"  Recordings  In recordings, the motets are often combined with Durufl√©'s Requiem, sharing the same approach of polyphonic music based on Gregorian chant. They have been recorded for example by King's College Choir, conducted by Stephen Cleobury and the Corydon Singers conducted by Matthew Best. On recordings, as in the liturgy, single movements have been performed to match a context. The Cambridge Singers, conducted by John Rutter, performed Ubi caritas in a collection This is the Day of music on royal occasions, while the Westminster Abbey Choir, conducted by James O'Donnell, performed Tu es Petrus for an album The Feast of Saint Peter the Apostle at Westminster Abbey.

Bolutino, M.D. Botulino, Marian D. Botulino, Art Doran, M.D. Bolutino, A. Doran, and Marian Dallamano. Biography Marian Dora's first appearance in the film scene dates back to the early 90s, when he started making short films as member of a group of anonymous underground filmmakers. Some of these short films were featured on two anthologies, Blue Snuff 1 and Blue Snuff 2 (the latter‚Äôs release being withdrawn due to its extreme content). Dora then started working as film producer, editor, and second unit director on several films by Ulli Lommel, whom he had met and started a long-time partnership with in 1996, including Zombie Nation (2004), Green River Killer (2005), B.T.K. Killer (2005) starring with music composed by Robert J. Walsh about Dennis Rader, Killer Pickton (2006), and Absolute Evil (2009). Although Dora had already shot his first feature-film, Debris Documentar, in 2003, his debut as director was marked in 2006 by Cannibal, a reconstruction of the case of Armin Meiwes, who killed and ate a willing victim whom he met on the internet. The film was originally an assignment from Ulli Lommel, but Dora had to release it by himself after its rejection by Lommel because of its extremely gory nature. Cannibal achieved resounding success in the underground film panorama, allowing Dora to start the shooting of his next work in the same year. Melancholie der Engel, Dora‚Äôs third film, premiered on 1 May 2009 at festival in Berlin and won the ‚ÄúBest Arthouse Feature Film‚Äù prize at New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. According to Dora, the shooting of the film was a nightmarish experience full of madness, violence, and drug abuse. Melancholie der Engel generated a lot of controversy because of many scenes involving rape, coprophilia, zoophilia, and real animal cruelty(though the murder of a cat was proved to be fake). The controversy surrounding Melancholie der Engel resulted in several death threats to Dora and the end of his partnership with Frank. Reise nach Agatis, Dora‚Äôs fourth work, was released in 2010. A DVD version of the film featured Debris documentar as bonus disc, marking its first release nine years after the shooting. In 2012 Dora was confirmed to be the director of Mors in Tabula, one of twelve segments developed for the anthology The Profane Exhibit. In 2014 Dora released his fifth film, Carcinoma, about Gautama Buddha, Psalms 73:14, Hail Mary, John 1:14, Mary, mother of Jesus, Luke 1:28, 42, Moses, Jesus, and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach, under the name of Art Doran. The film won an award at the 2015 Sadique-Master Festival, held in Paris. In 2017 Dora appeared in a documentary called Revisiting Melancholie der Engel, walking Swedish filmmaker Magnus Blomdahl through the film‚Äôs locations and talking about the making of the film. Influences Dora‚Äôs main influence is the European cinema of the 70s: he is a great admirer of the work of Italian directors Gualtiero Jacopetti, Ruggero Deodato, and Sergio Martino, as well as of composers Riz Ortolani, Pippo Caruso, Ennio Morricone, and Guido & Maurizio De Angelis. His favorite film is 1978‚Äôs The Green Room by Fran√ßois Truffaut, which he quoted in his film Carcinoma, along with Epicurus‚Äôs Letter to Menoeceus and the famous 19th- century German song ' ‚Äì the latter also being used as foundation for a major part of the film‚Äôs score. Europe‚Äôs literary and poetical tradition is another major influence on Dora: many dialogues in his films contain references to the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Eduard M√∂rike, Georg B√ºchner, Marquis de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche, and many others. Reise nach Agatis is said to be inspired by the books ' by and The Bermuda Triangle by Charles Berlitz, and the films Bermuda: Cave of the Sharks by Tonino Ricci and The Bermuda Triangle (by Ren√© Cardona Jr.). Dora has claimed that he is fascinated by serial killers like Charles Manson, Andreas Baader, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Dennis Nilsen, particularly their ability to manipulate other people in order to get what they want. Personal life Relatively little is known about Dora, except that he is vegetarian and works as a physician for a living.

History  In 1979, Sanford and Susan Criner opened Rockefeller's to serve as a performance space for Houston's music scene. The Criners wanted to create a place where both local talent and already- established acts could play to Houston crowds. They already owned a former bank building, designed by Joseph Finger in 1925; they turned it into a club and used proceeds to renovate the space. The building's architecture lent itself to a unique performance space. The old bank vault became an artists‚Äô dressing room, while the large lobby created a distinct acoustic atmosphere. Seating was two-tiered, with some of the audience on the ground level and some in balconies that nearly extended over the stage. The venue could seat about 325 guests. Rockefeller's closed as a public venue in 1997. The owners of Star Pizza purchased the building and it was a private event and wedding space from 1999‚Äì2014. In 2016, concerts returned to Rockefeller's for the first time in nearly 20 years.

It was first published in 1958 by Ballantine Books, and was reprinted in 1972. These books have been very critically acclaimed by critics around the world. Among the stories is James E. Gunn's \\"The Immortals\\", about a test car driver who discovers he can live forever. It was adapted into a television movie in 1969, and a TV series in 1970, both entitled The Immortal. Gunn also expanded the material into a novel, The Immortals. Fellow author Isaac Asimov joked to Gunn that the story must have been autobiographical, on account of Gunn's youthful looks. Cover art The first edition of Star Science Fiction Stories No.4 featured semi- abstract cover art by Richard M. Powers. The cover art that featured on the 1972 reprint was painted by the noted speculative fiction artist John Berkey. It depicted a rocket-plane diving down through space towards a gigantic mechanical planet, and was rotated 180¬∞. Berkey's original artwork was purchased by a young George Lucas to serve as visual reference material while he was trying to pitch his ideas to film studios for a new film, The Star Wars. It is thought that this painting had a strong influence on the eventual production design of Star Wars and served to inspire the film's leading concept artist, Ralph McQuarrie, and model maker Colin Cantwell, whose early designs for the Death Star battle station bore a strong similarity to Berkey's painting of a metal world.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 26 April 1902, shortly before the end of the war in South Africa. In 1906 Lieutenant Hartwell resigned his commission with The Leicestershire Regiment. During WW1 Hartwell was on the military General List and was assigned first to the Leicestershire Regiment as temporary captain, then to the Northumberland Fusiliers as temporary major. He saw service in the Gallipoli Campaign and later became a Lieutenant-Colonel with the 1st Garrison Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry assigned to the British Convalescent Section, Dagshai, India. He was stationed there with his family; his daughter, Kathleen Edith Doreen Augusta (Hartwell) Hicks-Beach, was born there in June 1918. Marriage and divorce In 1902 Hartwell married Georgette Madeleine, daughter of George Pilon-Fleury of Algiers and they had one child, daughter Leila Ruth Madeleine Hartwell. The couple divorced in 1907 and the circumstances were made public in newspaper reports in many countries round the world. Hartwell had eloped to Australia with Mrs Joan Amy (Jeffrey) Chamberlain in 1906; she was the wife of Royal Navy engineering officer Edgar Warner Chamberlain. Whilst in Australia the couple, acting as husband and wife, fitted out a schooner and went hunting for salvage in the sunken liner Ramsay lost on the Elizabeth Reef or Middleton Reef. During the voyage they rescued the stranded crew of the barque Annasona and took them to Norfolk Island. Divorce proceedings against the couple took place in England and letters were produced in court from them both admitting their guilt.\\"High Court Of Justice.\\" Times [London, England] 12 April 1907; 9.

Edgar Warner Chamberlain became a member of the crew of HMS Bulwark and was killed in November 1914 when the ship exploded with the loss of 736 men. \\"Rum-running\\" and bankruptcy Nahma, later Istar Hartwell became involved with various business enterprises after his return from Australia. He was director of companies that included Atlantic Oil and Rubber Trust Ltd., Gold Coast Rubber and Mahogany Estates Ltd., and chairman of Consolidated Oil Fields of South Africa Ltd. and the Premier Motor Bus Company Ltd. However, by 1913 he was declared bankrupt blaming outstanding remunerations and the disappearance of a colleague who was a fund holder. In a 1915 court case relating to failed national sweepstakes, his name was linked with that of Horatio Bottomley, publisher of the magazine John Bull who was later jailed for fraud. Hartwell was not able to attend the hearing as he was with the British Army in the Dardanelles. Sir Brodrick Hartwell's personalised whisky label In 1923 Hartwell sent out circulars offering a return of 20% for a 60-day investment in off-shore whisky sales. This referred to the illicit sale of alcohol to the USA during the Prohibition Years. The scheme involved Hartwell buying consignments of whisky and transporting these across the Atlantic where they were to be sold off-shore to dealers who operated from smaller boats. Hartwell used the ocean going steam yacht Istar, formerly named Nahma, a luxury 300ft vessel originally built for the New York property millionaire, Robert Walton Goelet and used by the US Navy during WW1. Later under examination Hartwell said that he had made seven voyages, but the last one was a total loss, the cargo having been partly confiscated by prohibition officers and some taken by bootleggers who had not paid. In consequence, Hartwell was again bankrupt, to the extent of ¬£250,000. Bottle of Sir Brodrick Hartwell's whisky sold to USA bootleggers during prohibition years Hartwell had been very open about his business, giving newspaper interviews and even having a personalised label put on the whisky bottles. This publicity came to the attention of some members of the British Parliament who raised the matter with the then Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who described Hartwell's operation as a \\"disgraceful blot\\". One irony was that the sister ship of the whisky smuggling yacht Istar was the US Presidential Yacht Mayflower, having been built at the same time and the same yard for Robert Goelet's brother Ogden. The yacht Istar was not register with Hartwell at Lloyd's, but with Lt. Col. George Ernest Millner (1884-1949), an ex-soldier who had fought almost continuously in France from 1914 to 1918.

Written by Dana Horgan & Leah Fong and directed by Ralph Hemecker, it premiered on ABC in the United States on November 17, 2017. In the episode, which serves as part two of a two-hour episode Cinderella learns about what happened to her mother after she and Henry chased Alice in New Wonderland in the past, while in the present day Henry finds himself dealing with a lawyer who is helping Jacinda regain custody of Lucy, Regina tries to convince Weaver that he is Rumpelstiltskin and Ivy and Gothel seeks out Anastasia's coffin while Victoria is behind bars. Plot Opening sequence New Wonderland's mushrooms is featured in the background. In the Characters' Past In the past, Regina tells Hook about the crumbled tower that she had come across while training Drizella in magic. He is distraught but is then suddenly reunited with his daughter, Alice, who has found him in the New Enchanted Forest. He warns her to not touch him due to their curse, however, Alice claims that she had found a sorceress who cured them. They move to embrace but it only throws Hook backwards as they realize their curse hasn't actually been broken. Alice runs away in fear and Henry and Ella chase her through a portal to New Wonderland. When Henry and Ella arrive in New Wonderland, Ella reveals that her choice to come to the realm was a personal one and that she intends to find out what happened to her mother, Cecilia, who had left her and her father behind many years ago. Ella points to what happened to her parents as the reason why she doesn't believe in true love. When they come across a single shrinking potion, Ella takes it and leaves Henry to enter the Infinite Maze, the place her mother had run into. When Ella eventually finds Alice, she notices that the other half of her mother's necklace is on a table at Alice's tea party. Alice then reveals that she had met Cecilia before and that the woman had died after a battle in which Alice was the only survivor. She also tells Ella that Cecilia had been inflicted with the same Curse of the Poisoned Heart that forced her to leave her loved ones for their own safety. Meanwhile, Drizella is also in New Wonderland, scouring it for magical items. It is revealed that she was the one who had tricked Alice into believing her curse was broken. Drizella comes across Henry, who she intends to also give the Curse of the Poisoned Heart to but Ella and Alice are able to save him just in time. Drizella is sent away through a magic mirror. With the knowledge that her mother didn't run away because she stopped loving Ella's father, Ella decides to open herself up to a relationship with Henry and the two share their first kiss. Henry and Ella make their way back to Hook and Regina without Alice, who has chosen to stay away for the time being. Alice had given Ella the knight chess piece to give to Hook, as she no longer needed a reminder that they'd be together once again. Later, a man wanders into their camp and is revealed to be Jack, a friend of Henry's whom he had met during his early years of traveling the realms. Henry introduces him to Ella. In Seattle In the present day, Jacinda is trying to regain custody of Lucy after Victoria was taken to jail for the kidnapping of Eloise Gardener. She contacts Nick, a lawyer whom she has been cursed to believe is Lucy's biological father. He agrees to help her and they end up going out to dinner. Sabine warns Jacinda against exploring feelings for Nick again, which Jacinda isn't sure she does or doesn't have. Henry is disappointed by the turn of events, while Lucy explains that the situation is simply playing out like the David, Mary Margaret, and Kathryn Nolan love triangle from the first curse. She insists that he is her real father and encourages him to fight for Jacinda. Henry tries impressing her by doing some more work on her food truck but when Jacinda brings Nick by, he wonders if he should stop pursuing her. Meanwhile, Regina is warning Drizella to stay away from Henry but with Victoria in jail, she and Gothel already have other plans. Drizella now wants to revive Anastasia for her own purposes. Gothel is now out and about in Hyperion Heights as \\"Eloise Gardener.\\" Drizella is able to locate Anastasia's coffin at Victoria's lakehouse and brings it back to Gothel, however, when they open up the coffin, they find that her body is missing, suggesting that Victoria had taken extra precautions to hide it. Now that Roni has regained her memories as Regina, she confronts Weaver to find out if he also has his memories but he refuses to confirm to her that he has woken up from the curse. Realizing that he'll be of no help, she later tells Henry that she's heading down to San Francisco to find someone who had been pushed out of town by Victoria. Henry, who has been heavily drinking to get over Jacinda, agrees to accompany her on the trip. Jacinda drops by the bar later to look for Henry but is informed by Remy, the temporary barkeep, that Regina and Henry had already left town. Despite Jacinda having signed away her rights to Lucy many years ago, Nick is able to come through with the legal help and Jacinda and Lucy are reunited. Lucy is then formally introduced to Nick.

Since 2003, it was given the additional name namu, which stands for the German words Natur (nature), Mensch (man), and Umwelt (environment). The exhibitions take place in the Spiegelshof, a historical building from the 14th century.  History  1889 is regarded the founding year of the Museum der Stadt Bielefeld (Museum of the city of Bielefeld). In 1906, this museum became the St√§dtisches Museum (municipal museum), containing both a history and natural history department. In 1930, an independent Natural History Museum was opened in the Kaselowsky villa. After World War II, from 1946 to 1964, the museum had no permanent home, but in 1964, temporary exhibition spaces were established at the Stapenhorststra√üe 1. Martin B√ºchner, mineralogist and long-term director of the museum, and other members of the Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein f√ºr Bielefeld und Umgegend (Natural history association of Bielefeld and surrounding areas) essentially contributed to the establishment of the new natural history museum and implemented numerous special exhibitions. In 1977, the museum received additional temporary premises at the Kreuzstrasse 38 (now Adenauerplatz 2; and home of the administration and collections of the museum). Finally, in 1986, the museum moved to the Spiegelshof, which since serves as the exhibition building. In 1994, the ‚ÄûF√∂rderverein Naturkunde- Museum der Stadt Bielefeld‚Äú (Friends‚Äò association of the Natural History Museum of the City of Bielefeld) was founded. Isolde Wrazidlo became director of the museum in 1999, after the retirement of Martin B√ºchner. In 2003, the museum received a new logo and the additional name namu, an acronym standing for the German words Natur (nature), Mensch (man), and Umwelt (environment). Subsequent events include the renovation and conversion of the Spiegelsche Hof (2003 and 2004), the museums 100-year-celebration combined with the implementation of the \\"Naturhistorischen Zeitreise mit der StadtBahn\\" (\\"Natural history journal with the light rail\\" ‚Äì an installation of replicas of centerpiece specimens from the geological collection displayed in underground light rail stations throughout the inner city of Bielefeld), the opening of the new permanent exhibition \\"ausSterben ‚Äì √ºberLeben\\" (extinction ‚Äì survival), the acquisition and renovation of the museum's external venue \\"Gr√ºnes Haus\\" (green house) at the Sparrenburg castle (2007) and the expansion of the educational service (2010). In 2014, the basement of the museum was converted into the \\"Geostollen\\", a permanent geological exhibition resembling a mining tunnel.  Collections  The Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld at the Spiegelshof The collections of the Bielefeld Natural History Museum are divided into three parts: the biological, geological and archaeological collection. The biological collection includes about 260.000 objects. * The snail and shell collection encompasses 5000 specimens including 657 separate species, giving an overview of the biodiversity of the European shores. * The bird collection comprises 500 specimens including nearly all of the 250 breeding birds of Germany, among them rare specimens such as the Ortolan bunting, the Northern wheatear and the Great snipe. * The extensive insect collection with beetles, butterflies, bugs, bees and wasps encompasses more than 250.000 specimens. The majority of the objects are native species, among them 50.000 butterflies from Westphalia. The largest part of the insect collection is formed by beetles, with more than 180.000 objects. Holotype of Cyclotosaurus buechneri (NAMU ES/k 36053) The geological collection comprises 50.000 objects of different disciplines. * The geological and palaeontological parts comprise 30.000 objects. These are largely fossils and rocks from Mesozoic outcrops of the Bielefeld area, including important fossils such as the holotype specimens of the temnospondyl amphibian Cyclotosaurus buechneri and the plesiosaur Arminisaurus schuberti, which were both found within the city limits of Bielefeld. The palaeontological collection is supplemented by fossils of Pleistocene mammals such as a nearly complete skeleton of a Woolly rhinoceros, found in the area. * The mineralogical-petrographical collection encompasses ca. 20.000 specimens from Westphalia and the adjacent areas of the Netherlands. The archaeological collection includes about 100.000 objects. * The museum owns arrowheads, spearheads, neolithic daggers, sickles, chisels, stone axes with drilling, blades and other objects. * Focus of the archaeological collection are local early, middle and late neolithic finds from the wider Bielefeld area. Further neolithic artifacts are from Hesse, the Baltic Sea area and from North America. This collection is supplemented by modern objects from Papua New Guinea.  Exhibition  Permanent exhibition The present permanent exhibition \\"ausSterben ‚Äì √ºberLeben\\" (\\"extinction ‚Äì survival\\") was opened in 2007. The visitor first enters a room that is designed as an imaginary museum of the year 2525, informing about the extinction of species and nature conservation in the early 21st century. Other rooms explain present day problems from the future perspective. The third part of the permanent exhibition provides an introduction into earth history and explains the importance of fossils in understanding today's imminent mass extinction of species. Another room is dedicated to museum education, allowing kids to playfully approach the topics of the exhibitions. The Geostollen in the basement supplements the exhibition by showing earth science objects and topics in a recreated mining tunnel. Showcase in a Bielefeld Stadtbahn station Showcases in the city Under the heading \\"Verdammt lang her ‚Ä¶\\" (\\"long long ago\\"), the museum shows casts of centerpiece objects in underground stations of the Bielefeld Stadtbahn. The installation was realised in 2006 when the museum celebrated its 100-year anniversary. Showcases in the floor of the stations show casts of fossils such as the temnospondyl Cyclotosaurus buechneri, the ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus or the Woolly rhinoceros. Large size banners supplement the installation. A drilling core from the time when the subway tunnel was built is shown next to an elevator in one underground station and illustrates the strata of 220 million years of earth history in Bielefeld. Special exhibitions Various special exhibitions (3 to 5 per year) about different topics regularly supplement the permanent exhibition.  Education  The educational work focuses on sustainability in thinking and acting. Its guideline is \\"We can only protect what we know\\".  Friend's association  The \\"F√∂rderverein Naturkundemuseum der Stadt Bielefeld\\" (\\"Friends' association of the Natural History Museum of the City of Bielefeld\\") was founded in 1994. The association financially supports the educational service, the collections, exhibitions and implements an annual lecture series in cooperation with the adult education center. In 2008, the friends association received the environment award of the city of Bielefeld.

I wanted to write a piece where the sound production dominates and the range of emotional context was that of a concerto for an instrument.\\" The composition has a duration of approximately 25 minutes and is cast in four numbered movements, which Neikrug described as \\"a dramatic first movement, a scherzo- like interlude, a slow movement, and a finale that owes more than a bit to jazz.\\" Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo mezzo-soprano and an orchestra comprising three flutes (one doubling alto flute), three oboes (one doubling cor anglais, three clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, harp, celesta, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times called the Canta-Concerto a \\"skillfully written piece\\" and wrote, \\" He continued: Tommasini nevertheless added, \\"Canta-Concerto inventively rattles your expectations of what a work for voice and orchestra can be.

It uses a directory-based home snoop coherency protocol with a transfer speed of up to 10.4 GT/s. Supporting processors typically have two or three UPI links. Comparing to QPI, it improves power efficiency with a new low-power state, improves transfer efficiency with a new packetization format, and improves scalability with protocol layer that does not require preallocation of resources. UPI only supports directory-based coherency, unlike previous QPI processors which supported multiple snoop modes (no snoop, early snoop, home snoop, and directory). A combined caching and home agent (CHA) handles resolution of coherency across multiple processors, as well as snoop requests from processor cores and local and remote agents. Separate physical CHAs are placed within each processor core and last level cache (LLC) bank to improve scalability according to the number of cores, memory controllers, or the sub-NUMA clustering mode.

On August 1 of the same year he received an appointment to General Chairman from the Prophet Drew Ali. In February 1928, Mealy El was made Grand Sheik and Chairman of the Moorish Science Temple of America by appointment of the Prophet Noble Drew Ali. By the close of the first annual convention of the Moorish Science Temple of America (October 15‚Äì20) Edward Mealy El was promoted to Supreme Grand Sheik of the organizations highest tribunal and executive cabinet, the Supreme Grand Council. In all his appointments, he was unanimously approved by the \\"Grand Body\\", or, executive heads of all subordinate temples within the Moorish Science Temple of America. In February 1929, an annual corporation report filed with the Illinois Secretary of State lists Edward Mealy El as President of the Moorish Science Temple of America Inc. Upon Drew Ali's death on July 20, 1929, Mr. Mealy El continued to run the organization. Edward Mealy El died in 1935.  Early life  Edward Mealy was born on September 17, 1870, in Wilkerson, Mississippi, which was renamed Huntington and later abandoned.  Moorish Science  Mealy El moved to Chicago, Illinois, and became involved with Noble Drew Ali's African-American Islamic religious movement, the Moorish Science Temple of America. He became the Governor (pastor) of Chicago's Grand Major Temple No. 1.  Noble Drew Ali's death and succession controversy  Noble Drew Ali died on July 20, 1929, and his attorney, Aaron Payne Ali, tried to unite the Moorish Science movement under his leadership. He was unsuccessful, and several of Drew Ali's former disciples emerged to vie for power amidst the leadership vacuum. Mealy El stated that he had been declared Drew Ali's successor by the Prophet himself. In August, John Givens El, Drew Ali's chauffeur, declared that he was Drew Ali reincarnated. He is said to have fainted while working on Drew Ali's automobile and \\"the sign of the star and crescent [appeared] in his eyes\\". Mealy El was present at the Second Annual National Convention of the Moorish Science Temple of America, or \\"Unity Conference,\\" in September 1929. As the end of the convention neared, hours were spent discussing the Prophet's intentions. Around this time, John Givens El entered the chamber and sat himself on the Prophet's empty seat. He announced: > I am back. I am the Prophet Noble Drew Ali, reincarnated, and Prophet Noble > Drew Ali, the founder. We two are one in [sic] the same. A silence fell over the convention chamber. Despite this, the convention delegates did not vote for Givens El to lead the Moorish Science Temple of America. Instead, with two-thirds of the votes, the grand sheikhs elected Mealy El was the first Supreme Grand Sheikh and C. Kirkman Bey as his Grand Advisor. Ultimately, the election was not accepted by all members, and both Givens El and Kirkman Bey went on to lead their own factions of the Moorish Science Temple. Kirkman Bey took Mealy El to court to try to gain legal leadership over the denomination, but lost each time. On My 7, 1931, Judge Eberhart ruled in his favor in the case of C. Kirkman vs. E. Mealy El. In response, Kirkman Bey created his own organization, called the \\"Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc,\\" taking most of the Moors with him. By then, Mealy El only retained leadership over Temple No. 1 in Chicago, but possessed Drew Ali's original documents. Several years after the leadership feud, Mealy El suffered a stroke and was sent to live with his family in Mississippi by his wife, Dealia, who was unable to care for him. He died in late 1935 while on a business trip, no longer living in Chicago due to infighting. Following his death, Dealia Mealy El inherited Noble Drew's papers and used them to place, William Morris El, who she was rumored to have started a relationship with after her husband's death, in the position of Supreme Grand Sheikh. Over time, his leadership was rejected by many of the members of Temple No. 1. In response, some of them turned Noble Drew Ali's documents over to Charles Kirkman Bey, thus strengthening his legitimacy as Noble Drew Ali's successor.

It was commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to commemorate the ensemble's 40th anniversary. The work was completed in 1985 and first performed at the St Magnus Festival by the violinist Isaac Stern and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Andr√© Previn on 21 June 1986. The piece is dedicated to Isaac Stern. Composition Structure The concerto has a duration of approximately 31 minutes and is cast in three movements played without break: #Allegro moderato #Adagio #Allegro non troppo Davies was influenced by Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in determining the form of his own concerto. Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo violinist and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. Reception Reviewing a 1988 recording of the violin concerto, Arnold Whittall of Gramophone wrote, \\"It offers fewer opportunities for the big, bold gesture, yet it's not‚Äîas its cautious Orkney premiere suggested it might be‚Äîmerely evidence of the mellowing of Max, even of his degeneration into an atonal Max Bruch. His innate toughness and intensity still register, although here and there‚Äîfor example, in the first movement cadenza‚ÄîI did wonder whether the nature of the solo instrument, and the conventions of so much earlier virtuoso writing for it, were not getting between the composer and his most personal mode of expression.\\" He continued, \\"I also remain sceptical about whether 'tonality', as Davies understands it, contributes to the perceptibility and clarity of structure as significantly as the more basic formal divisions. Even so, on each hearing I've found this performance more satisfying and illuminating in its tracing of the way the music cunningly fades in and out of specifically Scottish allusions.\\" Reviewing the New York City premiere, Donal Henahan of The New York Times called it a \\"moderately dissonant and expertly orchestrated concerto [that] busied itself chopping up the musical line and working out rhythmic puzzles.\\" He added, \\"The composer asserts that this score was influenced by Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto -both works are in three movements played without pause, for instance. However, Sir Peter does not make that comparison stick. His compulsion to change meters every bar or two lends his concerto an awkward restlessness that has little in common with the arching melodies of Mendelssohn. This 20th-century fascination with metrical changes is far more typical of Stravinsky, whose mastery of his craft, perhaps not incidentally, stopped well short of melodic genius.\\" See also *List of compositions by Peter Maxwell Davies References Compositions by Peter Maxwell Davies 1985 compositions Davies 1 Music commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ","title":"Violin Concerto No. 1 (Davies)"},{"id":"55267698","text":"Ikenna Ugochukwu Iroegbu (born March 14, 1995) is an American-born Nigerian basketball player for the Capital City Go-Go of the NBA G League.

She served as the first Secretary of the college from 1910‚Äì1921 and as the college's bursar from 1917‚Äì1943.  Early life  Wright was born on November 14, 1876 in Hartford, Connecticut. She obtained her Bachelor of Arts from Wesleyan University in 1897 where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. and went on to teach at Portland (CT) High School and Hartford Public High School.  Founding Connecticut College  In 1872, Wesleyan University began what was known as the \\"Wesleyan Experiment\\", allowing women to take classes at the College. Four women matriculated that fall, and it was the first time in the Connecticut region that a woman stayed enrolled in classes beyond her first term. Male alumni, though, were concerned that the College would become populated only by women, and that the College was less prestigious with women attending. In turn, they voted to stop admitting women in 1912. Upon learning that there were no longer any educational options for higher education for women in the state of Connecticut, Elizabeth Wright began contacting other colleges and universities in the region and asking them to allow women to take classes. When this proved unsuccessful, Wright contacted E.V. Mitchell, president of the women's Hartford College Club , an organization for women with college educations, with her idea of opening a women's college in Connecticut. E.V. Mitchell appointed a committee of herself, Elizabeth Wright, and Mary Partridge to work on the founding of a women's college. The committee eventually expanded in order to handle real business, and had offers of land for the women's institution in more than twenty cities in Connecticut. The city of New London offered a site for the college, fundraised $135,000 in ten days, and was chosen as the location for what would become Connecticut College for Women. A local business man, Morton Plant, endowed $1 million in the College.  Career  Wright's original office was in the Mohican Hotel, where she worked as the College's first secretary until the opening of the first campus building in 1915. From there, she moved to New London Hall, where she worked as secretary, bursar, and served on the board of trustees. She worked as Secretary of the College from 1910-1921, and as Bursar from 1921 until her retirement in 1943. In 1935, Wright founded the Connecticut College Delta chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a national honor society. That same year, Wright was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the College.  Legacy  In 1960, Elizabeth Wright published a novel titled The Force of Circumstances about a young Irish girl during wartime. The publication came as a surprise to those around her, as Wright had kept everything involving the book a secret. In 1961, it was announced that one of the new dormitories at Connecticut College was to be named in Wright's honor. Today, Wright House is located in the North Complex of dorms at the College, and houses students of all genders and class years.

As a two-year-old in 1982 she won two minor races in spring and then recorded her most important success with a victory in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. She went on to finish fourth in the Moyglare Stud Stakes and ended the year as the best Irish-trained juvenile filly of her generation. After being transferred to race in England she failed to win at three but did finish third in the Leisure Stakes and fourth in the Coronation Stakes. After her retirement from racing she ha some success as a broodmare in Europe and Japan. Background Sweet Emma was a \\"lengthy, attractive\\" bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by the Hesmonds Stud. As a yearling she was sold for 8,200 guineas and was sent into training with Michael Connolly. She was sired by Welsh Saint, a sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the 1970 edition of the Cork and Orrery Stakes. Her dam Gang Plank showed little aptitude for racing, failing to win in four starts. She was descended from the British broodmare Excelsa (foaled 1949) who was the dam of Exar (Goodwood Cup) and the grand-dam of Wollow. Racing career 1982: two-year-old season Sweet Emma began her racing career in March 1982 when she won a maiden race over five furlongs at Naas Racecourse. She followed up shortly afterwards in a minor race over the same distance on soft ground at the Curragh. After her two wins in spring the filly was sold privately to Jackie Ward Ramos and was transferred to the stable of Kevin Prendergast. Four months after her last race Sweet Emma was stepped up to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes on firm ground at Leopardstown Racecourse on 7 August, in which she was ridden by Gabriel Curran. The John Oxx-trained colt Najran started favourite ahead of Treasure Trove (from the Vincent O'Brien stable) and the unbeaten filly Flame of Tara. Despite looking impressive before the race Sweet Emma went off at odds of 12/1 after drifting out from 4/1 on the day of the race after receiving an unfavourable draw. Curran tracked the leaders before going to the front approaching the final furlong and Sweet Emma accelerated away to win by three lengths from Najran. On 11 September Sweet Emma was moved up to six furlongs for the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh. She was among the leaders for most of the way but faded in the final furlong and finished fourth behind the British-trained Habibti. At the end of the month she was sent to England to contest the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. She tarted the 8/1 third favourite but ran poorly and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Ma Biche. In December Sweet Emma was put up for auction at Newmarket and was sold for 220,000 guineas. She then moved to the stable of Peter Walwyn at Seven Barrows near Lambourn in Berkshire. In the Irish Free Handicap for 1982, Sweet Emma was rated the best two-year-old filly trained in Ireland, although she was seven pounds behind Habibti. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 108, making her fifteen pounds inferior to their top two-year-ol filly Ma Biche. In their annual Racehorses of 1982 Timeform described her as \\"a very useful sprinter\\" but having obvious stamina limitations. 1983: three-year-old season Sweet Emma made her first appearance for her new trainer in the Leisure Stakes over six furlongs at Lingfield Park in early June and produced a creditable effort to finish a close third behind Solimile and Kirchner. She was then stepped up in class and distance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot later that month and came home fourth of the six runners behind Flame of Tara. On her only subsequent appearance she contested a handicap race over seven furlongs at Newmarket in July and finished fourth after sweating up badly before the start. Breeding record Sweet Emma was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She was based in Ireland before being exported to Japan in 1988. She produced eleven foals and six winners between 1985 and 1998. *Love Legend, a chestnut colt (later gelded), foaled in 1985, sired by Glint of Gold.

History  The Jura was built in 1854 by the Maschinen Fabrik Escher-Wyss in Z√ºrich. On 7 September that same year the ship was placed in service by the Lake Neuch√¢tel Steamboat Society (Soci√©t√© des Bateaux √† vapeur du lac du Neuch√¢tel) on Lake Neuch√¢tel. In 1861, the ship was put up for sale and purchased by the Lindau Steamship Navigation Inspectorate (Lindauer Dampfschiffahrtsinspektion) as a replacement for the Ludwig which had sunk after a collision. For its transportation to Lake Constance, the ship was dismantled and moved on horse-drawn carts. The ship had a total length of 46.30 metres; its length at the waterline being 41.30 metres, and it had a beam of 10.25 metres draught of about 90 centimetres. The Jura was powered by a 45-horsepower steam engine, which gave it a top speed of 18.5 km/h. It could carry up to 400 passengers.  Sinking  On 12 February 1864, the Jura set sail on a routine service from Constance via Romanshorn to Lindau. Around 11 a.m., and despite having a fog lookout, signal horns and an attempt at taking avoiding action, it could not prevent a collision with the Stadt Z√ºrich off M√ºnsterlingen. The bow of the Stadt Z√ºrich ripped the Jura‚Äôs fo'c's'le off and the fog lookout of the Bavarian ship was crushed. Another ship‚Äôs boy had his arm torn off. Within just four minutes, the Jura sank. The rest of the ship‚Äòs crew and passengers were rescued by the Stadt Z√ºrich. Because the Stadt Z√ºrich had sunk the Ludwig in a collision less than three years before, and, only a few months after sinking the Jura, had collided with the Stadt Lindau in Lindau Harbour, the ship was especially unpopular in Bavaria.  Discovery of the wreck  In February 1953, Ludwig Hain was looking for a crashed World War II aircraft in the lake off Bottighofen when he chanced upon the wreck of the ship at a depth of about 39 metres. After that, the wreck was forgotten until, in 1976, it was rediscovered by Hans Gerber. The ship, which has since become known by scuba divers as the ‚Äúbest known freshwater wreck in Europe‚Äù lies almost upright on its keel on the lake bed. The bow of the ship is covered in mud which was dumped at this spot after dredging work for the harbour at Kreuzlingen.  Objects from the Jura  From the wreck of the Jura were salvaged the 47-kilogramme ship‚Äôs bell, bottles, a manometer and the name of the ship.Mich√®le Vaterlaus: Die Glocke der gesunkenen Jura taucht wieder auf. In: S√ºdkurier, 27 August 2016.  Recovery plans and industrial monument  A recovery of the ship would be attractive because the Jura is the oldest surviving steamship in the world. It would make available a ship of the late Biedermeier period, an era from which there are hardly any surviving technical monuments. The Lake Constance Historical Navigation stiftung (Historische Schifffahrt Bodensee) with its headquarters in the Swiss village of T√§gerwilen has plans to recover and restore the ship. The cost is estimated at around 3.5 million euros, because the ship‚Äôs wooden hull and folding chimney are in a poor condition. Sports divers are partly to blame, as is the aforementioned dumping of mud on the wreck, damage as a result of regular shipping and fishing, and, of course, the passage of time. On 7 December 2004, the governing council of the Canton of Thurgau declared the Jura as an ‚ÄûUnderwater Industrial Monument‚Äú, placed it under protection and empowered the Office of Archaeology in Frauenfeld to look into the possibility of a recovery operation or an archaeological investigation of the wreck. The ship was to be protected from further damage through a cooperation of the Office of Archaeology, the sports diving clubs of Austria, Germany and Switzerland and the Wasserschutzpolizei.

Early years and education Cyrus Cobb, twin brother of Darius Cobb, the painter, was the son of Rev. Sylvanus Cobb, Universalist clergyman, and Eunice Hale Waite Cobb, the writer. He was born in Malden, Massachusetts, August 6, 1834. He was educated at the public schools, one of which was the Lyman School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He studied art in America, declining to go to Europe for the purpose lest he should thus lose sympathy with American ideals. He studied law in Boston University. Career Cobb served in the Union Army in the American Civil War, and afterward wrote a book entitled, The Veteran of the Grand Army, in vindication of the Grand Army of the Republic, of which he was a devoted member. Cobb was admitted to the Suffolk bar in June, 1873, and practiced law for six years. In 1879, he devoted himself to sculpture, and produced a number of important works, both portrait busts and monumental statuary. Among them were a heroic statue of Abbott Lawrence and a bust of Theodore Parker. His colossal head of \\"The Celtic Bard,\\" his bas relief of \\"Prospero and Miranda,\\" and his bust of General Butler, placed him in the front ranks of his profession. His design for the soldier's monument (1869) in Cambridge, Massachusetts was selected from 40 or more submitted to N. J. Bradlee, the noted architect, as incomparably the best. Cobb also painted several pictures. His best-known painting is \\"Warren at the Old South\\", painted in 1880, though his portraits of Dr. A. P. Peabody and John Appreton were esteemed. He was an accomplished musician and was frequently heard at concerts. He also wrote a series of sonnets on the Masters of Art, which were published. Personal life He married Emma Lillie, while his twin brother, Darius, married her sister, Laura M. Lillie. Cobb died at Allston, Massachusetts, on January 29, 1903.

Life  Son Hong-kyu was born in 1975 in Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province. He graduated in Korean literature from Dongguk University. He began his literary career when he won the Writer's World New Writer's Award in 2001. He was awarded the Daesan Creative Fund in 2004, and the National Arts Fund in 2005. He has also won the 5th Violet People's Fiction Award in 2008.Yes24, accessed July 28th, 2017.  Writing  The special characteristic of Son's fiction is his serious exploration of the world, and people. It is easy to think strangely of saying that a certain writer's characteristic is about the sincere examination of the world and people, because in fiction that is such an obvious thing to do. However, the reason why that is a characteristic of Son's writing is that it is so obvious. The fact that fiction's sincerity is obvious means that the tradition of such sincerity is that much old, and that it is becoming considered as worn out or outdated. To the generation of Son, who was born in 1975, what is important to fiction is not quite sincerity, but wit, experimentation, and uncommon sensations. Therefore, Son's sincerity can actually be his unique characteristic. Literary critic Shin Hyeong-cheol has said of Son that, on the contrary to the current trend of postmodernist theme of death, whether of a person or a subject, \\"his works honestly show frustration and scars, and his lines are keen with the struggle for finding a reason for new hope\\". He has added that his works \\"toss and turn with the anger against the inhuman world, and the affection for humanity\\", that \\"he is a writer who is able to lean on the old hope that only people can shed tears.\\"Shin, Hyeong-cheol, \\"The Anthropology of an Inhuman, and the Ethics of Rebirth\\", Commentary on the Legend of Humans, Munhakdongne, 2005. It is said that the characteristic of Son's fiction is serious study into the world and man, but it is not that his fiction only uses the old writing methods of realism. Son's fiction includes what almost every person would consider as 'inhuman imagination'. In Saramui sinhwa (ÏÇ¨ÎûåÏùò Ïã†Ìôî The Legend of Humans), the protagonist 'I' does not think that he is a human, and thus can only talk with things that are not human, such as his dead grandfather, his nephew in his sister's belly who isn't actually human yet, and a snake that hides away in order to become a dragon. In \\"Geomi\\" (Í±∞ÎØ∏ The Spider), the 'I' is also not a person. Between an incompetent and violent father, a mother suffering from hardships of life, and a sister who is raped by her father's creditor, 'I' begins to remember that she was actually a spider, and begins to break away. Though inhuman imagination, Son depicts how the great violence of the world is defiling life of its decency, and that within that setting, people are reproducing the violence of the world, therefore asking the following: is it really that valuable to be a human?Naver Books, accessed July 28th, 2017.

The valley is in Fresno County about southwest of Bishop and east of Fresno and is known for its Yosemite-like scenery and its extreme isolation. Geography The valley, about long and up to three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) wide, is characterized by high, extremely steep granite walls, side canyons and waterfalls. The valley's scenery has been frequently compared to that of Yosemite Valley, starting with John Muir who first visited the area in the 1870s. It is situated just inside the western boundary of Kings Canyon National Park and on the northern edge of the Monarch Wilderness. The Middle Fork flows swiftly from northeast to southwest through the valley. The valley floor is at an elevation of while the surrounding peaks rise to heights of or more. On a 1917 National Park Service expedition to Tehipite Valley, Robert Sterling Yard described the place as thus: The north side of Tehipite Valley is dominated by Tehipite Dome, the largest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, rising above the valley floor. Notable features of the valley include Silver Spray and Blue Canyon Falls, both cascades hundreds of feet high and the rugged, nearly inaccessible Gorge of Despair formed by Crystal Creek which provides \\"some of the finest technical rock climbing in the Sierra\\". History The valley was named in 1869 by Frank Dusy, taking the Native American name for Tehipite Dome meaning \\"high rock\\". Dusy's expeditions were also the first to photograph the valley, doing so in 1879. Although Dusy is credited with being the first non-native person to visit the valley, he recorded in his journal that he followed a trail possibly used by prospectors in search of gold, several years earlier. Lilbourne A. Winchell, a member of the 1879 Dusy expedition, wrote of his initial impression of the valley: In 1897 Theodore S. Solomon made one of the first maps of the valley, on which was also the first recorded mention of \\"Gorge of Despair\\".Browning, p. 96 In the 1920s the City of Los Angeles proposed the Tehipite Valley as the site of a hydroelectric dam. This was one of the key controversies before, and for many years after the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park. The initial dedication of the park on March 4, 1940 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not include Tehipite Valley; it was not until 1965 when Tehipite Valley and Cedar Grove were finally added to the park, making them forever off-limits to industrial development. Access The valley is known for its extreme remoteness, and is many miles from the nearest paved road (Highway 180). On some days, it receives no visitors at all. One of the major trails to the valley is the Tehipite Valley Trail, which begins at the access road for Wishon Dam. The National Park Service describes the hike to the valley rim as \\"moderate\\" and the descent into the valley as \\"very strenuous\\". Due to the high elevation of the incoming trails and heavy snows in winter, Tehipite Valley is inaccessible for up to eight months of the year. The difficulty of access is compounded by the fact that many trails have deteriorated. In addition the area is known for rattlesnakes. There are primitive campsites in the valley, along the Middle Fork.

It was founded right after 4 protesters were shot dead during the 2011 Albanian Opposition Demonstrations. It operates similar to the italian \\"Le Brigate Rosse\\" but only verbally at this phase,  Ideology  It unites bodies and minds aiming radical social transformation, based on equality, participation and freedom and it tries to reach its aims through politicising social matters and through organizing people, especially the most exploited classes, under emancipating forms of participation, militant-ism, action and discussion. Organizata Politike's principles aspire a combination of engagement and awareness elements of direct democracy with coordinated action that stems from political delegation. During these years, Organizata has been engaged in different emancipating events, like manifestations on International Worker's Day, support and solidarity to the miners, textile industry workers, oilmen, Romani People and many others in need. Name The name Organizata Politike came as a way to express the absence of politics in other political subjects in Albania and the aim to make politics, considering that the political parties don't really make politics, just fight for power and wealth of a narrow group of people. Symbols In different cultures birds have symbolized freedom during history. You can find them on flags and in myths basing on which communities were built. Since early in history they've flied towards literature, music, visual arts, but also towards symbolism of new battles against political, economic and social injustice. Thus, Organizata Politike thought of the Red Robin ‚Äì Erithacus Rubecula ‚Äì as a symbol of freedom and resistance in the wide horizon of ideas. Not as a powerful and aggressive bird of rough heights without oxygen, rather than a small, hard-working, nimble bird, tightly connected to its territory, that resists the winter singing while never leaving. The robin represents Organizata's organizational and political worldview best in a frosty Republic of Albania - which is quickly depopulating from emigration, especially the young: to be robins, to stay here(in Albania), to resist, to live vigorously and sing, by working day after day, every day for a fairer and democratic society.  History  Organizata has been the initiator of the movement Universiteti n√´ Rrezik (University in Danger), which aimed protecting public education and its emancipating values, when the ruling centre-right Democratic Party tried to pass a clientelist law of higher education and later L√´vizja P√´r Universitetin (The Movement for the University), when the new government of the centre-left Socialist Party tried the same only some months after winning the elections.  Structure  Organizata Politike is an organization consisting of activists and members, the only difference between the first and the latter being full active and partly active. Because the partly actives affect the day-to-day decision making, the activists take part in weekly assemblies while members in monthly assemblies. The organizations highest decision-making body is the Assembly of the Activists. Other decision-making bodies are workgroups depending on the needs of the organization.

Over the years, the band has played many shows in Norway and Europe, among them festivals like √òya, Hove, Spot and by:Larm. Their debut studio album, Corrente Elektro, was released in 2007. It was described as an alternative rock record with British punk influences. Bringsvor stated that the album \\"was a result that, as a 19-year-old, I tried to make music without doing it before,\\" and later mentioned that it was heavily inspired by bands such as Sonic Youth and Blonde Redhead. In 2010, singer-songwriter Susanne Sundf√∏r briefly joined the band, contributing vocals and keyboards. They released their second album, Astronaut Kraut! later that year, which they worked on with producer J√∏rgen Tr√¶en and several guest musicians including Kjetil M√∏ster. Since then, they have released the albums Progmatism (2013) and SuperSystem Vibe (2017). Borrowing from many different genres, the band has been noted for mixing elements of krautrock, noise, shoegaze, electronic, Steve Reich, melodies and vocal harmonies. The Fly stated that \\"there's nothing not to like about Hypertext, with all of their little Wilco-esque quirks, expansive, shimmering guitars and soaring melodies. They are excellent.\\" The 405s Hector Barley characterized the band as experimental pop, later adding that the band's music \\"is some of the most highly distinctive, inventive and engaging that I've heard of late. Their sound is undoubtedly hard to pin down, schizophrenically jumping all the way between kraut-rock, space-pop to rich harmony-led indie pop, yet always retains a strong pop sentiment and idiosyncratic arrangements.\\" Lyngstad and Hatleskog cited the Residents and the Flaming Lips as influences, respectively.

Country Djerimanga country consisted of some on the coastal plain where the Adelaide River debouches into the Timor Sea, north to the tip of Cape Hotham, west to Fog Dam, south to an area including the community at Acacia Larrakia and eastwards as far as the Mary River floodplains. Humpty Doo Station, Koolpinyah Station and Djukbinj National Park are also situated within these traditional boundaries. Historically, the Djerimanga had a southern inland extension of their land as far as the Margaret River and the Ringwood Range, but lost it to the eastern Djowei. Families Today Wulna descendants are contained to three distinct family groups; Browne, Talbot and Kenyon. The matriarchs of these families are Nancy Browne () (dec), her younger sister Lorna Talbot () (dec) and Joan Kenyon (dec). The senior elder man for Wulna was Jack Wandi, he is buried at Humpty Doo Station on his traditional land. Jack Wandi has a wife (tribal marriage) who is still alive and living at the Humpty Doo Station. Nancy and Lorna were the daughters of Topsy Garamanak (1900-1974), the senior Larrakia/Wulna ceremony woman who conducted ceremony across the Top End. Topsy was the daughter of Larrakia ancestor Blanchie and Wulna ancestor Finity (Pinity) Yunupingu, who had direct family links to the Yunupingu clan from Yirrkala, Northern Territory. Descendants of Nancy Browne and Lorna Talbot are Larrakia/Wulna. Joan Kenyon born 1944 in Humpty Doo, is the daughter of Hilda Gunmanga (born 1910).

The only authorized biography, by his son Landon C. G. Miller, is available for sale on Amazon under the title \\"Lt. Hugh Barr Miller, Jr - The US Navy's One Man Army\\". There are a large number of other books, comic books, and sections of books that include Miller's heroic saga, Including the authoritative \\"100 Best True Stories of World War II\\", Hardcover ‚Äì 1945. A recently published book by Steven Harding on the incident is currently being adapted for production for a major Hollywood film. In college, Miller was the quarterback of the University of Alabama‚Äôs Crimson Tide Football Rose Bowl & National Championship Team in 1930, earning him the nickname \\"Rose Bowl\\" on his ship. At the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed as an Officer, and was eventually sent to serve in the Pacific. Miller's ship, the USS Strong, was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the Solomon Islands on the night of July 4‚Äì5, 1943, leaving Miller in the water with 22 other men. Three days later, Miller washed up on Arundel Island (now renamed) with three shipmates (some had died in the water while still others had been separated at night). After hiding from the enemy for days, Miller eventually ordered the other three men to take his boots and knife, and leave him behind, given his severely-wounded condition. He said later, \\"I thought I was dying, but then I rallied...\\" The others did leave him behind, attempting to return to U.S.-held territory. They were never heard from again. Miller, though, recovered from his wounds, some of which remained with him for the rest of his life. Eventually, he found a washed ashore body of a Japanese soldier, and took his hand grenades and bayonet. These Japanese hand grenades were first used to ambush and kill at least half a dozen enemy soldiers on patrol who has gotten too close to his hideout. He then began to systematically attack Japanese machine gun nests, usually manned by 5 soldiers, using just the hand grenades, all while stranded and alone. Eventually he accounted for over 20 men, all killed by Miller without a rifle or handgun, just recovered grenades and the bayonet. Forty three days after the torpedo attack, Miller signaled to a passing U.S. plane, and was then, later that day, rescued by a single engine \\"duck\\" float plane manned by a 3 person volunteer crew. After his ordeal, Miller was personally awarded many medals in a ceremony with Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of then President Roosevelt, and Fleet Admiral William \\"Bull\\" Halsey. Now famous, there were numerous newspapers, comic books, magazines (including LIFE Magazine) and TV shows recounting this epic story, including the weekly TV Show, This Is Your Life, which was hosted by future US President Ronald Reagan, and the TV show \\"Navy Log\\". Miller was twice recommended for the Medal of Honor, but it was never granted. He was, however, awarded the Navy Cross, 2 Silver Stars, 6 Bronze Stars, 2 Purple Hearts, and 27 other individual and unit decorations. Numerous books recount Miller's biography. The self-published, only authorized biography, book by son Landon C.G. Miller, titled Lt. \\"Rose Bowl\\" Miller: The U.S. Navy's One Man Army., the many other publications as noted above, and the latest version, Castaway's War The book Castaway's War was optioned in 2016 by film production company Gold Circle.

Background Harold Rosenwald was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His sisters were Clare Rosenwald Schein (later an arbitrator for Family Court, died 1972), Leah Rosenwald Modest, and Charlotte Rosenwald Rosenberg. He graduated from Cambridge Latin School (now Cambridge Rindge and Latin School) in 1923. He graduated cum laude from Harvard University in 1927. In 1930, he graduated from Harvard Law School, where he also served as editor of the Harvard Law Review (1928‚Äì1930) and class secretary. It was during this time he came to know Alger Hiss. Career Rosenwald was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1930 (and the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1936). Government service According to Whittaker Chambers, Rosenwald had work in the U.S. Department of Justice during the 1930s under O. John Rogge: > He had worked for the U.S. Department of Justice, where he had been the > assistant to O. John Rogge, an assistant to the Attorney General. The > peculiar vehemence of Mr. Rogge's lefts views finally caused him [Rosenwald] > to leave the Justice Department. Rosenwald supported Justice in its case against U.S. General Charles G. Dawes to recover monies of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) on a $90,000,000 \\"Dawes Loan.\\" On May 15, 1936, Rosenwald filed a brief on behalf of John L. Hopkins, O. John Rogge, and others for the RFC. Later in May, Justice recovered $2,225,000 for RFC, for which Rosenwald received credit. Justice continued to pursue more repayment, and the case went to court in October 1938. He received credit for his efforts in November 1936 when a court ordered 3,500 Illinois stockholders of a defunct Central Republic Bank to pay $12,500,000 as part of repayment on that loan. In 1939, Rosenwald again support Rogge, this time going after income tax cases in Louisiana related to Governor Huey Long's \\"Share Our Wealth\\" program. Rogge planned to move to the state due to the anticipated length of the case. He cited Rosenwald (and Albert B. Teton) as an expert whose presence he sought to join him because of Rosenwald's \\"experience in preparing income tax cases for trial.\\" Private practice In April 1948, Rosenwald and John J. O'Niel were attorneys for a naval captain before the U.S. Supreme Court in \\"United States of America ex. rel. Harold E. Hirschberg v. Captain M. J. Malanaphy, United States Navy, Commanding Officer, United States Naval Receiving Station, Brooklyn, New York.\\" Hiss Case During the Hiss Case, Rosenwald was an attorney first in 1948 with Oseas, Pepper & Segal and by 1950 with Beer, Richards, Lane and Haller (also known as Oseas, Pepper & Siegel with offices in Washington and on Liberty Street, New York ) (from 1949 to 1957 called \\"Beer, Richards, Lane, Haller & Buttenwieser\\" ). He was one of the chief lawyers in the Hiss Case who defended Alger Hiss, along with William L. Marbury, Jr. and Edward Cochrane McLean. He was the chief architect of argument for a \\"psychologically disturbed state of Whittaker Chambers.\\" On December 12, 1948, Rosenwald, \\"an associate of Edward C. McLean, Mr. Hiss' attorney,\\" issued a statement by Hiss which said: \\"...I repeat the denial... I did not at any time deliver any official documents to Mr. Chambers or any unauthorized person.\\" While Lloyd Paul Stryker led during Hiss's first trial, Rosenberg's name remained among his legal defense. Again, when Claude B. Cross led during Hiss's second trial later in 1949, Rosenwald's name appears on his defense team along with McLean and Robert von Mehren. Later years By 1952, Rosenwald was \\"the legal representative to the Tito Government.\\" In 1958, Rosenwald represented Lovander Ladner in a Federal case against (in which Ladner was convicted for assaulting police officers). In 1959‚Äì1960, Rosenwald represented defendants Goldfine and Paperman in an appeal case before the U.S. District Court with Judge Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr. presiding (in which Goldfine and Paperman lost). In 1972, he represented Harvard student agencies in their pursuit of contraceptive sales at the university. When Allen Weinstein's Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case came out in 1978, it quoted Rosenwald about the psychological argument: > The psychiatric theory has been criticized because it may be regarded as an > unjustified smear of Chambers as a homosexual. Surely we intend to smear > Chambers in any event. I have no objection to such smearing .... I see > little difference between smearing Chambers as a homosexual and smearing him > as a liar, a thief and a scoundrel. In 1980, a review of John Lowenthal's documentary The Trials of Alger Hiss mentioned Rosenwald (along with Robert E. Stripling, Congressman F. Edward Hebert, the Rev. John F. Cronin, and journalist Ralph de Toledano) as among the \\"most informative\\" who helped counter \\"Lowenthal's own bias.\\" Personal and death In 1943, Rosenwald married Betty Booth. They had a daughter Martha and son Stuart Harold. (Mrs. Rosenwald died in 2004.) Rosenwald died age 82 of Parkinson's disease in Lexington, Massachusetts. See also * O.

After the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, later the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, choose a different route for their north-south mainline, community leaders convinced them to build a spur to Decorah. This would open the town to larger markets to ship the products produced there. The tracks were completed in 1869, and a boxcar served as the first depot. That same year this single-story, wood frame structure with Greek Revival features was completed south of the central business district. It served as a combination depot, servicing both passengers and freight. After the arrival of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1884 the Milwaukee Road started to plan a new passenger depot in Decorah. It was completed on the east end of the main commercial street in 1888. When it opened, this building continued to serve as a freight depot. Over the years its platforms were shortened, and sometime between the 1930s and the 1950s, the southwest end of the building was shortened. The Milwaukee Road abandoned the depot in 1971, and the tracks that flanked the building were removed the same year. The former depot itself was renovated for non- railroad use. This is believed to be a rare extant example of a wooden combination depot in Iowa. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

She was the Mahadevi (queen consort) of the Shan State Hsipaw and the wife of Sao Kya Seng, the last ruler Saopha of Hsipaw. Early life Sao Kya Seng and Inge Eberhard (Sao Nang Thu Sandi) with the two daughters She was born on 23 February 1932 in K√§rnten, Austria. When she was six years old, the Nazis invaded her home in K√§rnten, and even arrested her mother three times. After World War II, life was hard in Austria, and she decided to study in the United States. In 1951 she won one of the first Austrian Fulbright Scholarships and enrolled at a Colorado Women's College.  Queen consort  At a party for international students, she met Sao Kya Seng, a Burmese engineering student from the Colorado School of Mines. She fell in love and they were married at the home of a friend, in Colorado at 7 March 1953. After Sao Kya Seng graduated, the couple sailed to Burma to start their new life. When they arrived at the port of Rangoon, she saw hundreds of people gathered. It was then that her husband told the truth, that he was the Prince of Hsipaw. She became Mahadevi of Hsipaw. Sao Kya Seng and Mahadevi Sao Nang Thu Sandi She learned to speak the Shan and Burmese language and worked tirelessly to improve life in Hsipaw. She became involved in charitable projects such as establishing birthing clinics, teaching villagers better nutrition, and starting a trilingual school. After nine years as rulers of Hsipaw, the couple had two daughters, Sao Mayari and Sao Kennari. The couple's altruistic efforts quickly made them two of Southeast Asia's best-loved rulers. In 1962, the Burmese army staged a coup under the leadership of General Ne Win. Eberhard's husband was arrested and imprisoned. She and her two daughters were put under house arrest for two years on suspicion of Eberhard being a CIA spy. During these years, she worked tirelessly to discover what happened to her husband, but eventually she learned that he had been killed in prison. She fled with her daughters to Austria with the help of an Austrian ambassador. After living with her parents for two years, she decided to return to Colorado and she became a high-school German teacher at Centennial Junior High School and Fairview High School, both in Boulder, CO. She retired from her teaching career in 1993. Second marriage In 1968, Eberhard met and married her second husband Tad Sargent, who encouraged her to write her biography. Her memoir Twilight over Burma was published in 1994. All profits from her book are donated to Burmese refugees living near the borders of Myanmar.

The museum was established in 1972 to display Japanese clocks from the Edo period collected by Sakujiro (known as \\"Guro\\") Kamiguchi (1892‚Äì1970). It is the only museum in Japan exhibiting Japanese clocks. Origin of the Museum collection Sakujiro Kamiguchi owned a highly unusual log cabin shop which sold western clothing. The shop became known locally as \\"Grotesque\\", and this was the origin of Kamiguchi's nickname, \\"Guro\\". Kamiguchi had many interests, including pottery. He first became interested in Japanese clocks when he came across an English-made watch with an attached sundial in a local shop. Kamiguchi realised the unique cultural importance of daimyo clocks: :\\"Because the Tokugawa sh≈çguns closed the country, a pure Japanese-style clock was created. Like the ukiyoe woodblock prints, the importance of these clocks was recognised abroad, and the clocks have been bought up at cut-rate prices and taken away from the country right up to the time of the Great Kanto Earthquake. Now it won't be long before a Japanese scholar wishing to research the development of these clocks will be reduced to visiting foreign collections.\\" In 1951, Kamuguchi established the Kamiguchi Japanese Clock Preservation Society, and gifted his collection to it. After his death in 1970, his son Hitoshi Kamiguchi became President of the Society and opened the museum in April 1972. Exhibits Daimy≈çs ('great lords') were the feudal aristocracy of Japan in the Edo period and they were the only people who could afford expensive timepieces. The museum displays mechanical clocks, sundials and incense clocks previously owned by daimyo families. There are around 50 pieces on display from the collection's total of some 200 items, in a single 83 square metre room. The museum's labels are all in Japanese only, though an English-language pamphlet explaining the traditional Japanese timekeeping system is also available. Access The nearest metro station is Nezu on the Chiyoda line. The nearest Japan Rail station is Nippori.
