Ideological background Post box during German occupation in Pozna≈Ñ Old Market Square (Stary Rynek) in Pozna≈Ñ renamed Adolf Hitler Platz > \\"Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf proclaimed, language-exclusive Germanisation > does not equate to total Germanisation, an alien nation, which expresses its > thought in non-German form, degrades the greatness and honour of the German > nation. The implementation of Germanisation requires a change of character > of the occupied nation via partial expulsion of the Polish populous and the > assimilation of the rest, deemed upon their \\"racially worthy\\" elements.\\" The greatest fervour of Germanisation was implemented in those regions seized by the German Wehrmacht during World War II. Frequently in his public rallies, Adolf Hitler called for the displacement and liquidation of Poles inhabiting Poland. On November 25, 1939 at the NSDAP Office of Racial Policy, a codification was formed codifying Erhard Wetzel and G√ºnther Hecht's memorandum entitled \\"The Question of the treatment of the population of the former Polish territories in accordance to racial politics\\" (\\"Die Frage der Behandlung der Bev√∂lkerung der ehemaligen polnischen Gebiete nach rassepolitischen Gesichtspunkten\\"), which openly expressed: > \\"Those Poles suitable for Germanisation shall receive German surnames after > having undergone the complete process of Germanisation, that will take two > to three generations. The administrative, trade and common language shall be > German, whilst administrators on former Polish soil may only be German. > [...] Our pursuance is to Germanise as rapidly the Germanisable populous. > [...] The decisively Polish elements must be expelled. [...] Poles may not > take part in secondary, vocational schools, nor higher education. [...] > Church service must not be undertaken in Polish. Any type of association, > corporation and religious or church gatherings are forbiden, whilst Polish > restaurants, caf√©s and cinemas shall be closed down, in addition, all Polish > press and book publications must be abolished. [...] Those people who are > incapable of being renationalised, must be subject to culture of the > shallowest nature. [...] In that populous categorised for expulsion, > racially-worthy children no greater than 8-10 years of age, should be > selected and relocated to the Reich. [...] No contact is permitted with > their Polish kin. [...] Otherwise, expel: all Poles, that settled on the > terrain of the New Reich after October 1, 1918, all Polish intelligentsia, > Polish activists, those so-called neutral Poles that fail to Germanise, all > Jews [...] and all Polish-Jewish inhabitants. [...] There will be no Polish > journalists, nor will there be any Polish book and newspaper publications.\\" \\"Divide and rule\\" Germany used the ancient divide and rule strategy in Occupied Poland. In accordance to the aforesaid strategy, Germanisation was sanctioned on the Polish population on a regional basis. The best known operation was named Goralenvolk. Heinrich Himmler, in his strictly secret memorandum, entitled (Gedanken √ºber die Behandlung Fremdv√∂lkischer im Osten) (\\"Thoughts on Treatment of Alien Races in the East\\", dated May 25, 1940 described the German tactic against Poland: \\"We have to divide Poland into as many ethnic groups, regions and divided groups as it is possible\\". Likewise, in his reflections, entitled: \\"A few thoughts on the treatment of aliens in the East\\" (Einige Gedanken √ºber die Behandlung der Fremdenv√∂lker im Osten), Himmler writes: \\"We have to aim to recognise and retain as many different nationalities, that is besides the Poles and Jews, also Ukrainians, Belarusians, Gorals, Lemkos and Kashubians. If one kind find other breakaway nationalities - those also. [...] What I am trying to state is, it is not in our interest to unite national groups and foment and gradually increase national identity and the development of national culture, on the contrary, to divide it into many parts and fractures. [...] Within [...] 4 to 5 years e.g. the term Kashubians must be unknown, for the Kashubian nation will be no more (this especially refers to Western Prussia). In the long term, we must also liquidate the Ukrainian, Goral and Lemko identity on our territory. What was said about those national offshoots similarly largely refers to the Poles.\\" Germanisation of placenames On August 1, 1940 in Krak√≥w, Hans Frank and Josef B√ºhler headed a conference concerning the Germanisation of Polish place names in the General Governate, it was decided that every central square would be renamed to \\"Adolf Hitler Platz\\" and those roads heading to which shall be called Reichsstrasse, Strasse der Wehrmacht as well as Strasse der Bewegung.Note: Here Bewegung, literally Movement, refers to the \\"popular movement of National Socialism\\". Nearly all settlement names annexed by the Third Reich and those in the General Governate were Germanised. For example, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was renamed Litzmannstadt, in 1941, Rzesz√≥w was changed into Reichshof whilst Zamo≈õƒá, whom the Germans believed to be a German settlement, was to be renamed Himmlerstadt, as to honour Heinrich Himmler. Street names were also Germanised, firstly by adding a second German name, and later removing the Polish counterpart. During the German occupation of Poland, all Germanised street names were written in the Gothic script. Nearly every main street was renamed \\"Hitlerstra√üe\\" in honour of Adolf Hitler. In ≈Å√≥d≈∫, on September 7, 1939 the chief of the police ordered to remove all signboards that bore a Polish word, as well as the removal of products that carried a Polish-branded label. Destruction of Polish culture and science Grunwald Monument in Krak√≥w, November 1939 In October 31, 1939 Joseph Goebbels stated: \\"The Poles fundamentally should not have theatres, cinemas [...]. All schools and seminaries must be closed down in the General Governate [...]. Poles should be left with such educational institutions that will punish the hopelessness of their national status.\\" Hans Frank commanded that all educational institutions above elementary must be liquidated. The teaching of history was forbidden. The occupying authorities of the German General Governate brought into being operations that would inhibit the cultural development of the forcefully subordinated Polish population in the long-run. The main guidelines were formed by Dr. E. Weltz and Dr. G. Hecht's national politics programme from November 25, 1939 based on Adolf Hitler's statements made at the November 23, 1939 conference of the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The document concluded, inter alia: > \\"Universities and other higher education institutions, vocational schools, > as well as secondary schools were always centres of Polish chauvinistic > upbringing and therefore must be closed down. Only primary schools may be > permitted, teaching only the most primitive of subjects: arithmetic, reading > and writing. Education in fields of greater nationalist reals, like > geography, history, history of literature and gymnastics, must be > prohibited.\\" The Minister of Education, K. SzelƒÖgowski along with other higher administrators were sent to a concentration camp in Sachsenhausen. Thereupon, higher education institutions and secondary schools were liquidated. The General Superintendent Frank, on June 18, 1940 decided to resume the operation of primary and vocational schools with a limited educational level, limited to that of German technical schools. More drastic decisions in the sphere of education were proposed by Heinrich Himmler, who in a document from May 15, 1940 proposed to reduce the level of education in the General Governate to four-year primary schools, students would be taught numbers up to 500, writing of the surname and the enforcement of a tract that God's command against the Poles is total servitude, honesty, urgency and kindness towards the Germans. Biological extermination Execution of Poles by the Einsatzgruppen on October 20, 1939 in K√≥rnik > \\"Only a nation, whose underlying inclinations are destroyed, will allow > itself to be thrown into slavery.\\" The Germanisation of the Polish populous included limitedly planned and systemised elimination of the Poles. During the German invasion of Poland, divisions of the Einsatzgruppen were placed within the Wehrmacht, in accordance to the Special Prosecution Book for Poland composed via interviews with the German minority in the Second Polish Republic, carried out the elimination of the Polish intelligentsia, Intelligenzaktion. After the defeat of the Polish military, the extermination of the Polish intellectual elite was realised via operations like Operation Tannenberg, AB-Aktion, that would deprive Poland its political, scientific, social, cultural and militaristic elite. Comprehensively, Intelligenzaktion led to the deaths of 100,000 Poles, of which around 50,000 were killed via the so-called \\"direct action\\" (i.a. shooting), whilst the other 50,000 were sent to concentration camps, of which only an exiguous amount survived. Territory that was directly incorporated into the Third Reich suffered the greatest, where 40,000 were killed and 20,000 were send to concentration camps. Expulsions Warta Land in an interim camp, 1939 An extensive forced population transfer was conducted by Germany during World War II. The expulsions were part of a long-term plan, Generalplan Ost, that would turn the Polish nation into a primitive, cultureless kind, that would be denationalisable and be controlled with ease. Hans Frank, the General Superintendent of the General Governate, at a hearing on March 11, 1942 asserted: \\"...our aim [...] should be the complete clearance of the Vistulan Land [Weichselland] including Galicia. This will only be feasible with time, when the inhabiting nations are expelled - the Poles and Ukrainians. It is no doubt, that such changes will take decades, yet this is the only right path, all else is defective.\\" Kidnapping of children Part of the Generalplan Ost (GPO), involved in taking children regarded as \\"Aryan- looking\\" from the rest of Europe and moving them to the Third Reich for the purpose of Germanisation, or indoctrination into becoming culturally German. At more than 200,000 victims, occupied Poland had the largest proportion of children taken.Volker R.

It is located in Teton County in the U.S. state of Wyoming, close to the southwest border of the Teton Wilderness within the Bridger-Teton National Forest.  Geography  Breccia Peak is located about north of Togwotee Pass, part of the Great Continental Divide which connects Jackson Hole from the west to the Wind River valley in the east. The plateau-like summit contains the steep and rocky Breccia Cliffs on its west and north faces, while a mainly grassy face exists to the east and south. Breccia Peak is the most prominent mountain in the immediate area, topping Buffalo Fork Peak to its north by about 200 feet (61 m). Higher peaks can be found along the Teton Range, located more than 30 miles (48 km) to the west. About southwest of Breccia Peak lies Lost Lake, located at an elevation of about . This is a small but very scenic lake where the Breccia Cliffs reflect off the water during certain times of day.  Geology  Breccia Peak is made of volcanic Absorka breccia, a form of rock composed of broken fragments of minerals cemented together, and from which the mountain takes its name. The rocks in the section of the summit belonging to the Wiggins Formation originated in the Upper Eocene epoch. The saddle between Breccia Peak and Angle Mountain contains an elongate irregular intrusive body of glassy flow- banded rhyodacite porphyry showing minor wall-rock alteration.  Climbing  Breccia Peak is a popular and accessible summit for hikers and climbers in the Yellowstone Region, as it is typically reachable within two hours from the trailhead near U.S. Highway 26/U.S. Highway 287, approximately north of Togwotee Pass. Visitors will encounter a challenging but minimally dangerous path (YDS Class 2, Swiss Alpine Club hiking grade T3). A well-established but unofficial trail leads from the trailhead to the treeline, and early on there is a fork that leads to Breccia Peak (left) or Sublette Peak (right). At an elevation of , climbers will find a vast meadow southeast of Breccia Peak where they can see the southeast face of the mountain entirely. To climb, the easiest route involves traversing the southeast face to reach the east ridge, avoiding a steep rocky cliff in the middle. From there, climbers can follow the east ridge to the summit. An alternative is to traverse the southwest face to the south ridge of Breccia Peak, and then follow this ridge to the summit. The southeast face of the mountain above the treeline is particularly suitable for backcountry skiing. The runs are short but quite varied.

(Original description) The small shell is waxen white, darker on the columella. The protoconch has 2 whorls followed by about five subsequent whorls. The protoconch is flat-topped, the first whorl with one strong keel, the second with three. The suture is laid on the anterior keel, which is smaller, and in the subsequent whorls the suture is not appressed but distinct. The spiral sculpture consists of on the first two whorls a strong peripheral cord and one thread at the suture, on the third whorl three threads in front of the cord, on the remainder four. On the body whorl the peripheral cord is not prominent but from the anal fasciole to the siphonal canal are about 16 strong threads with wider interspaces and an occasional intercalary smaller thread. They do not nodulate when they cross the ribs. On the siphonal canal are numerous small close-set threads. The anal fasciole is without spiral sculpture. The axial sculpture consists of (on the body whorl 13) strong rounded ribs not continuous up the spire and obsolete on the base but prominent and arcuate over the fasciole. reaching the preceding suture which they undulate. The aperture is rather narrow. The anal fasciole at the suture, is shallow and wide. The thin outer lip is moderately produced. The inner lip is smooth and erased.

Its summit is above sea level. The peak is the eroded remnant of a stratovolcano, and takes its name from the type of rock, breccia, that it is composed of. It is located 15 miles southeast of Darrington, Washington, and west of Glacier Peak, which is one of the Cascade stratovolcanoes. It is situated in the Glacier Peak Wilderness on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Pugh, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from Breccia Peak drains into tributaries of the Sauk River. Climate Breccia Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The post holder was chiefly responsible for the command of the navy's fleet that operated in the English Channel out of Portsmouth from 1294 to 1326.  History  The origins of the office Admiral of the South dates back to 1294 with the appointment of William de Leybourne. The office was known by different names from its inception, such as Admiral of the South on the Portsmouth Station (1294‚Äì-1325), Admiral of the Southern Sea, Admiral of the Southern Fleet this command existed only briefly for a period of about ten years. In 1326 the office was merged with that of the Admiral of the West. The first royal commission as Admiral to a naval officer was granted in 1303. By 1344 it was only used as a rank at sea for a captain in charge of a fleet or fleets. :Rank and Role The naval defence of England from the end of the 13th century was divided into regional commands or 'admiralties' until the end of the fourteenth Century. The appointment of an admiral was not regarded by the English government at the time as an honorary post subordinate to a military rank, their importance attached to their office can be confirmed by the recording of their allowances paid recorded in the Calendar of Patent Rolls. In the fourteenth Century Admirals were paid a respectable salary which was only granted because the position was viewed as substantially important. In addition the rank of admiral was only granted to men of high prestige within feudal hierarchy, most recipients of the office were usually knights but more often earls.Rodger pp. 131-142 The Admirals duties usually consisted of assembling fleets for naval expeditions undertaken by the monarch on campaign, maintaining order and discipline and supervising the work of the Admiralty Courts for each region. On major military expeditions the Admiral would go to sea with their fleets and accompany the overall Commander-in-Chief of both sea and land forces usually the King himself but sometimes a nobleman of higher rank than the admiral. Their role was to observe and direct naval battles but not necessarily taking part in them, themselves. However, from 1344 onward their role was moving from primarily administrative on to that of a seagoing command.National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy In 1337 the first known record of the appointment of a \\"vice-admiral' was granted to a Nicholas Ususmaris, a Genoese, he was made Vice-Admiral of the King's fleet of galleys, and all other ships of Aquitaine. However these appointments were far and few between. There was two further instances of the appointment of Vice- Admirals to Sir Thomas Drayton as Vice-Admiral of the Northern Fleet and Sir Peter Bard Vice-Admiral of the Western Fleet both on 28 July 1338. Special assistants were appointed to handle two important sub-divisions of the admirals powers. The first was the admiral's lieutenant, or deputy, referred to as sub-admirals, who handled administrative and legal duties and each of these admirals had one and often retained more knowledge than the Admiral himself in relation to the sea and coastal communities. It would not be until the early 15th century that they would appointed on a more regular basis however they were referred to at this time as the admirals Lieutenant-General this office eventually became known as the Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The second was the Wardens of the Coast for each region who were responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the fleet, the equipping of boats and processing payments to sailors and superintendence of the Sea Guard Militia assigned to each coastal county. From the mid fourteenth century there was a move to centralise these regional naval authorities as seen with the appointment of the Admiral of the Southern, Northern and Western fleets sometimes referred to as Admiral of the Fleet or Admiral of England and the Admiral of the North and West this tendency towards unifying regional naval authorities under one admiral eventually led to the creation of the office of the Lord-Admiral of England The Admirals were logistically supported by the Clerk of the Kings Ships who looked after all the navy's finances whilst victualling of the navy was handled by another one of Kings Clerks.

Each county decides the format for determining their county champions. The format can be straight knockout, double-elimination, a league or a combination. Provincial Championships Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster each organise a provincial championship for their participating county champions. All matches are knock-out and two ten minute periods of extra time are played if it's a draw at the end of normal time. All-Ireland Two semi-finals are usually played on a Saturday in late January. The All-Ireland intermediate final is normally played in Croke Park in early February.

Its formation ended three months of political uncertainty following the 2017 parliamentary election.  2017 election  Ahead of the June 2017 election, the nationalist political parties Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), and Social Democratic Initiative (NISMA) agreed to join forces, forming a pre-electoral coalition known as the \\"PAN coalition\\" or \\"War Faction coalition\\". They aimed to challenge the pre- electoral coalition of moderate parties Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), The Alternative, and New Kosovo Alliance (AKR). AAK party leader and former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander Ramush Haradinaj was the coalition's figurehead and candidate for Prime Minister of Kosovo, marking the first time since the end of the Kosovo War that all former KLA commanders had joined political parties. Haradinaj had been accused by Serbia of committing war crimes. No single party achieved a majority of seats in the election. The PAN coalition won nearly 34% of the vote; to secure the 61 votes (50%+1) needed to form a government, it needed to join with other coalitions. The PANA coalition was formed on September 4 when AKR left its pre-electoral coalition with LDK and The Alternative to join the PAN coalition, along with ethnic minority parties. The new coalition held 63 out of the 120 seats in parliament. Albin Kurti, leader of the nationalist party Vet√´vendosje, commented after the announcement of the new coalition that the formation of a new government was left to Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá.  2019 election  Prime Minister Haradinaj resigned in July 2019 after being summoned for questioning by the Kosovan court in The Hauge. With his resignation came the fall of his government. On August 2, President Hashim Tha√ßi asked the PANA coalition to propose a new candidate for the office of Prime Minister. Other political parties opposed the move and the proposal was unsuccessful. On August 22, the 6th legislature of the Kosovo's parliament came to an abrupt end as a majority of MPs voted to dissolve parliament before the expiration of its term. This brought a formal end to the PANA coalition due to internal disagreements on the matter.

Hopf algebroids are associative bialgebroids with an additional antipode map which is an antiautomorphism of H satisfying additional axioms. The term bialgebroid for this notion has been first proposed by J-H. Lu. The modifier associative is often dropped from the name, and retained mainly only when we wants to distinguish it from the notion of a Lie bialgebroid, often also referred just as a bialgebroid. Associative bialgebroids come in two chiral versions, left and right. A dual notion is the notion of a cobialgebroid.

Chellam in the lead roles. It is the first Tamil film based on the character Tarzan, the first Tamil film to be shot in forests, as well as the first South Indian jungle-based film. Vanaraja Karzan was released on 4 June 1938, and became a commercial success, besides receiving significant attention for Chellam wearing a revealing outfit. The Hindi version, Jungle King was released the following year.  Plot  A man named Kulasekaran comes to the Vanarajapuram forest with his wife and little son Karzan to find the secret of Amirdharasam (elixir of life) after fighting with his father Veerasingam, who disapproved of his plan to be in the forest. After considerable efforts for several days, Kulasekaran finds the \\"Amirdharasam\\" secret, which he writes in a piece of paper and locks it inside a locket of Karzan's necklace. One day, Kulasekaran is killed by lions in the forest, and his wife also dies in the attack. Using a balloon, a tribal \\"Dada\\" escapes with the child and his dog Moti from there. 15 years pass. Dada, Moti and the child live in the forest. Karzan has grown close to animals and is uncivilised. Since he moves only with animals, he learns their language. Veerasingam, on learning of the death of his son, comes to the same forest with his adopted daughter Leela to find his grandson. On the way, Sabapathi, a man seeking the secret of Amirdharasam, joins him in their search expedition. A tribal group suddenly surrounds and attacks them, but Karzan appears and saves them. Sabapathi, noticing the locket which has the secret on Karzan's neck, tries to shoot him to obtain it. However, Leela and Veerasingam stop him. The next day, Sabapathi shoots Dada in a fight and injures him. Karzan gets angry with this betrayal and kidnaps Leela as revenge. She struggles to escape from him, yet saves Dada by removing the bullet shot by Sabapathi. Karzan expresses his gratitude and affection, and she realises his innocence. Both fall in love; she teaches him how to speak like a man and they spend their time happily. Veerasingam is sad that even his adopted daughter is lost. One day, tribals attack and kidnap Veerasingam and Sabapathi along with Leela and Moti to be sacrificed to their God Gorilla. Karzan, Dada and Moti save the expedition members from the tribals. Karzan impresses everyone with his valour. Moti jumps from a height of 100 feet to assist Karzan in his rescue effort. Now Veerasingam realises that Karzan is his long lost grandson and Leela's suitor. Sabapathi finds his secret in the locket and they return to civilisation to live happily.  Production  Vanaraja Karzan was a collaborative venture between Wadia Movitone and the Madras United Artists Corporation. Directed by Homi Wadia and Nari Ghadiali, it was the first Tamil film based on the character Tarzan, with John Cawas cast in the role, renamed \\"Karzan\\" for the film. K. R. Chellam was cast as the female lead Leela, T. K. T. Chari as Veerasingam (the paternal grandfather of Karzan), and M. K. Venkatapathy as Sabapathi. The story was written by J. B. H. Wadia, and the screenplay by S. R. Krishnaswamy Iyengar. Cinematography was handled by Rustum Maybar and Bali Mistry. Vanaraja Karzan became the first South Indian \\"jungle\\" film, as well as the first Tamil film to be shot in forests. The film was also made in Hindi as Jungle King.  Soundtrack  The music was composed by \\"Yanai\\" Anantharama Iyer and Vaithyanatha Iyer.

The film stars Christian Bale as former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, with Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, Justin Kirk, Tyler Perry, Alison Pill, Lily Rabe, and Jesse Plemons in supporting roles. The film follows Cheney on his path to become the most powerful Vice President in American history. It is the second theatrical film to depict the presidency of George W. Bush, following Oliver Stone's W. (2008). Vice was released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by Annapurna Pictures, and grossed $76 million worldwide. Despite the performance of the cast (particularly Bale, Adams, Perry, Carell and Rockwell) and generally positive reviews, the film polarized critics; some considered it to be one of the best films of the year while others thought it to be one of the worst, with McKay's screenplay and direction receiving both \\"scathing critiques and celebratory praise\\". The film received numerous awards and nominations, with eight nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, including a Best Picture nomination and a win for Best Make-Up and Hairstyling. It also had a leading six nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards (including a nomination for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy), and six nominations at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards. For their performances, Bale, Adams, and Rockwell were nominated at all three shows, with Bale winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Plot Vice is narrated by Kurt, a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. The film opens with Dick Cheney and other White House officials and staff responding to the September 11, 2001, attacks. The film then flashes back to Wyoming in 1963, where Cheney finds work as a lineman after his alcoholism led him to drop out of Yale University. After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for driving while intoxicated, his wife Lynne Cheney convinces him to clean up his life. In 1969, Cheney finds work as a White House intern during the Nixon Administration. Working under Nixon's economic adviser, Donald Rumsfeld, Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, Liz and Mary. Cheney overhears Henry Kissinger discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia with President Richard Nixon, revealing the true power of the executive branch to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after Nixon's resignation, Cheney rises to the position of White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defense. The media later dubs the sudden shake-up in the cabinet as the Halloween Massacre. During his tenure, a young Antonin Scalia introduces Cheney to the unitary executive theory. After Ford is voted out of office, Cheney runs to be representative for Wyoming. After giving an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first heart attack. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. During the Reagan Administration, Cheney supported a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the fossil fuel industries. He also supported the abolishment of the FCC fairness doctrine which led to the rise of Fox News, conservative talk radio, and the increasing level of party polarization in the United States. Cheney next serves as Secretary of Defense under President George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter, Mary, coming out as lesbian. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny. During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Cheney becomes the CEO of Halliburton while his wife raises golden retrievers and writes books. A false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy in the private sector and credits begin rolling, only for them to abruptly end as the film continues. Cheney is invited to become running mate to George W. Bush during the 2000 United States presidential election. Cheney seems to feel that the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father than attaining power for himself; Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates \\"mundane\\" executive responsibilities, such as energy, the military, and foreign policy, to him. As Vice President, Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington, Mary Matalin, and the Chief of Staff, Scooter Libby, to exercise control of key foreign policy and defense decisions throughout Washington. The film returns to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuver to initiate and then preside over the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The film also covers various events from his vice presidency, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the Plame affair, the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington, and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq, resulting in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration. While narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalization, Kurt is killed in a motor accident while jogging. In March 2012, his healthy heart is transplanted into Cheney. A few months later, Cheney acquiesces to his daughter Liz's saying she is opposed to same-sex marriage when she runs for a Senate seat in Wyoming, leaving Mary upset. Liz later wins the election to her father's former Congressional position. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the fourth wall and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career. A mid-credits scene depicts a focus group descending into chaos when a conservative panelist slams the film itself as biased and attacks a liberal panelist who defends the movie and insults him, while another younger panelist expresses her anticipation for the next Fast & Furious movie. Cast Main characters Supporting characters Production On November 22, 2016, it was announced that Paramount Pictures had come on board to handle the rights to a drama about Dick Cheney; the screenplay was to be written by Adam McKay, who would also direct. The film was produced by Plan B producers Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, along with McKay and his Gary Sanchez partners Will Ferrell and Kevin Messick. Bale signed on to play Cheney in April 2017, and gained 40 pounds (18 kg) for the role. On August 22, Bill Pullman was cast as Nelson Rockefeller (though did not appear in the finished film), and a title, Backseat, was announced. It was later changed to Vice. On August 31, Sam Rockwell was cast as George W. Bush. In September 2017, Adam Bartley joined the cast. Principal production commenced in late September 2017. Tyler Perry and Lily Rabe joined the film in October as Colin Powell and Liz Cheney, respectively. Release The film premiered at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on December 11, 2018. Vice was released in both Canada and the United States on December 25, 2018 alongside Holmes & Watson. It was previously scheduled for release on December 14, 2018. The film opened in the U.K. on January 25, 2019, with most of Europe and Hong Kong following with February 2019 release dates. Vice was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on April 16, 2019. Reception Box office Vice grossed $47.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.2 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $76.1 million, against a production budget of $60 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Holmes & Watson on Christmas Day and was projected to gross around $13 million from 2,378 theaters over its first six days. It made $4.8 million on its first day and $2.9 million on its second. The film went on to have a first weekend gross of $7.8 million, for a six-day total of $17.7 million. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film performed its \\"best on both coasts, versus America's heartland, although some theaters in markets including Dallas, Houston and Phoenix turned in respectable business\\".Specialty Box Office: 'On the Basis of Sex', 'Vice' Lure Urban Liberal Moviegoers It then made $5.8 million in its second weekend and $3.3 million in its third. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 358 reviews, with an average rating of 6.67/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Vice takes scattershot aim at its targets, but writer-director Adam McKay hits some satisfying bullseyes‚Äîand Christian Bale's transformation is a sight to behold.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score 61 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 72% and a 49% \\"definite recommend\\". The critical response to Vice made it one of the worst-reviewed films to ever be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter, who named the film his favorite of 2018, wrote: \\"Across the board in Vice, everyone has risen to the occasion of their individual challenges, none of them easy, to collectively pull off a political satire that both provokes great laughs and hits home with some tragic truths\\". Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B‚Äì\\" and called it \\"messy but ambitious\\", writing: \\"Vice, in its rambunctious and unfocused manner, takes some ludicrous risks to make cogent points about Cheney's malicious intent‚Äîand how he put his plans into action\\". By contrast, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film 4/5 stars, and wrote that Bale \\"captur[es] the former vice-president's bland magnificence in Adam McKay's entertainingly nihilist biopic\\". Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film, giving it a 4/5 rating and writing: \\"Adam McKay's flamethrowing take on Dick Cheney, played by a shockingly brilliant Christian Bale, polarizes by being ferociously funny one minute, bleakly sorrowful the next, and ready to indict the past in the name of our scarily uncertain future.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time gave the film a negative review, describing Vice as an \\"exhausting film that turns Dick Cheney into a cartoon villain\\". Ikon London Magazine, while praising the make-up artistry of Greg Cannom, noted that \\"the story reminds of a witch hunt\\". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised Bale's performance as Cheney but criticized the story pacing, awarding the film 2/5 stars. Hornaday had issues with the film's structure, writing that the film is \\"a mess, zigging here and zagging there, never knowing quite when to end, and when it finally does, leaving few penetrating or genuinely illuminating ideas to ponder\\". Similarly, Scott Mendelson of Forbes praised Bale's and Amy Adams's performances, but criticized the film as a \\"cinematic mediocrity\\". Most reviewers agreed with New Jersey attorney Arthur J. Maurello (now in retirement in South Dakota) that the presentation of issues of politics and governance in the movie was \\"simplistic\\".  Historical and factual inaccuracies  Numerous scenes from the film were identified as being historically inaccurate, heavily dramatized, or presented without necessary context. Politifact stated that in certain scenes \\"the line between historic facts and poetic interpretation gets fuzzy\\". An important scene in the film that depicts Dick Cheney conversing with Antonin Scalia in the mid 1970s about expanding the power of the executive branch is totally fictional. However, Cheney did campaign for increased presidential authority. In the scene the \\"theory of the unitary executive\\" is mentioned but the phrase did not become used by legal scholars until the late 1980s. The film also \\"butchers\\" the meaning of the unitary executive. In reality the theory says the president has ultimate control over the executive branch but the film represents the theory as advocating for the president to have unlimited powers. The film implies that Lynne Cheney's father murdered her mother, however there is no evidence provided for this assertion. Lynne Cheney's mother Edna drowned on the evening of May 24, 1973 at the age of 54. She was walking her dogs near Yesness Pond and slipped and fell in. She did not know how to swim and her body was found after her husband reported her missing. Both the sheriff and coroner stated that there was no evidence to indicate foul play and her drowning was ruled accidental. Edna had been taking blood pressure medicine that often made her dizzy, her daughter Lynne Cheney theorized that she lost her balance when chasing after her dogs. Lynne Cheney never implied that her father could have killed her mother. Instead, she stated that her father was so devastated after the death of his wife that he drank himself to death two years later. The baseless assertion made by the film was identified as a conspiracy theory. Responses from Cheney family Dick Cheney's daughter and Congresswoman Liz Cheney criticized Christian Bale for his portrayal of her father in Vice, remarking during a Fox & Friends interview that \\"he finally had the chance to play a real superhero, and he clearly screwed it up\\". Liz also responded negatively to Bale's controversial acceptance speech for winning the Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical Golden Globe for his portrayal of Cheney, in which the actor thanked Satan for inspiring him to play the role of Cheney.  Accolades  Vice was nominated for six Golden Globe Awards at the 76th annual ceremony, the most nominations of any film, with Bale winning for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was subsequently nominated for eight awards at the 91st Academy Awards (winning Best Make-Up and Hairstyling), nine awards at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards (winning Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy for Bale), and six awards at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards (winning Best Editing).

McKinney Hughey Elizabeth Frances \\"Fannie\\" McKinney Hughey (August 4, 1857 - 1929) was a music teacher who developed the Color-Music method to teach music to children. Early life Elizabeth Frances \\"Fannie\\" McKinney was born on August 4, 1857, in Durban, South Africa, the daughter of Silas W. McKinney and Fanny Melissa Clark Nelson, foreign missionaries. Some of her ancestors were among the early settlers in the colonies. One of these belonged to the company made interesting by Richard Mather's story of the voyage from Southampton, England, in the \\"James\\" in 1635. Thirteen of her ancestors fought in the French and Indian wars, and one, Samuel Chapin, also known as \\"Deacon Chapin,\\" is an interesting figure in history and story, whose statue ‚Äî the work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, called \\"The Puritan\\" ‚Äî is one of the conspicuous monuments in Springfield, Massachusetts. Two bronze copies of this may be found ‚Äî one in the Dresden Gallery and the other in the Louvre, Paris, while a colossal statue of the same confronts the visitor on entering the Saint Louis Art Museum in Forest Park (St. Louis). The qualities of the New England pioneer mingle with those of the family of Hughey's father, who were prominent in Southern New York and Northern Virginia all through the life of the colonies, and the subsequent history of the United States. After the death of McKinney's mother in South Africa, her father was forced to return to his native land on account of the ill-health of his daughter, Fannie, and because of this urgent need, boarded the first vessel coming into port. This was a freight vessel, with a prize cargo of saltpetre for the federal army, which was in the midst of its struggle with the Southern States in the War of the Rebellion. Of this voyage, Hughey has a fund of thrilling stories as well as many anecdotes. She liked to tell of the custom of Sunday evening prayers on deck at the sunset hour. Her father had a very good tenor voice, and as he led the hymns, his clear tones mingled with those of the others, the soft sounds of the water, together with the wonderful changing colors of the ocean, made a never-to-be effaced impression of the exquisite harmony of colors, music, parental and divine love, and to those influences Hughey attributed the beginning of what later has developed into her method of teaching music by the color system. Hughey's education had been rather out of the regular order. Owing to poor health she spent a part of her early life in the invalid's chair or bed, and much of her time when not suffering greatly from pain and weakness was occupied in developing some subject in which she was for the time especially interested. In this way she learned how to think, how to search for desired information, and how to express herself. At a very early age she showed great devotion to music and later became very fond of writing. Her studies during those years were carried on with frequent interruptions, which acted as a stimulus to her mental endeavor, either in private lessons with her father or small private schools; and she claimed that the intimate association with her teachers was a far better education than all the text books which she might have had. After a partial college course in the Western Seminary at Oxford, Ohio, she seemed drawn about equally toward a musical and literary career. Following a period of sickness were four years of great activity as a teacher of music in a private school in Philadelphia. During this time she also studied piano with William H. Sherwood, and later entered the musical conservatory of Ingham University at Le Roy, New York, which was the first woman's university in the United States. From there she went to Rochester, New York, to take a special course under Mrs. C. S. P. Gary, and the following year, 1880, graduated from the Lyons Musical Academy in Lyons, New York. The next season was spent in Boston studying musical composition and pipe organ with Whitney Eugene Thayer, and piano with William H. Sherwood. Such opportunities proved too great a temptation to her ambition and again she taxed her limited strength beyond endurance, and just as she was timidly bowing to possible success her health gave way and she was forced to abandon all hopes of concert life. While in Philadelphia she also studied composition with Dr. Hugh A. Clarke, and rhythmic law, melodic forms, kindergarten principles and practices and various philosophical deductions with Daniel Batcheller. Some of her associates there were Ida Waugh, the child painter; Fred Waugh, the landscape artist; Theodore Presser of the Etude, and others more or less known to fame. Hughey's fondness for analysis and enjoyment of a keen argument dates far back to earliest childhood when, oftentimes too weak to play, she would lie in her father's arms and listen to animated discussions with some visiting clergyman, lawyer or college professor; and those debates created a desire to know what is really true and right and to choose always the good in life. Career The first work in Missouri done by Hughey was in foreign missionary circles and for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Later when obliged to return to music teaching to help provide a home for a little son and daughter, she was surprised to find musical thought in the West not yet up to the advanced ideas which she had studied in the East before her marriage. The first attention attracted to Hughey's musical work in St. Louis was because of an unusual intelligence which became a characteristic of the playing of her pupils. Instead of being poor copyists of their teacher, they exhibited an ability to recognize the content of a musical work, and to acquire an independent, although correct expression of it. During this period her work in organizing and conducting the \\"study class\\" of the Union Musical Club attracted wide interest, the plan being copied by others in the National Federation of Musical Clubs, and the idea being written up by Eastern and Northern papers and magazines. This chairmanship was only resigned in order to take the presidency of the club; she is still giving practical aid to interests begun in that class. In 1905 the attention of music lovers was attracted to Hughey's article in the Etude, \\"Do I Teach My Pupils or Do They Teach Me?\\" for which she received the first prize in the contest for the best paper on practical teaching. This contribution won for the author many professional and other friends. Another article on Church Music, in which the writer unmercifully held up to view the possible disturbances caused by organs run by electricity, together with the sins and failings of the organist, choir singers, and music committees, aroused a lively interest and many comments ‚Äî but through carelessness on the part of the printer the author's name was omitted and the editor of the organ department of the \\"Etude\\" had the unexpected pleasure of suffering for, as well as enjoying, the criticisms unfavorable and favorable. Hughey was chairman of the Sacred Music Committee of the National Federation of Music Clubs, and edited the column \\"Mothers, Babes and Music,\\" in the \\"Musical Monitor\\" ‚Äî the official organ of the national organization. Gradually through her lectures and writings she was recognized as a little ahead of her time, and the fact that her methods were generally adopted prove the practical value of her ideas. As a lecturer she was absolutely fearless, being perfectly at home on any platform, and expressing herself before the largest audiences with the greatest ease and fluency. She was wholly devoted to her profession, and the success of her efforts in musical and literary lines had been a source of commendation and approval to the music lovers of St. Louis. Hughey was a member of The Society of Colonial Daughters of the XVII Century, The National Society of Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America and Daughters of the American Revolution. Color-Music system The Hughey Color-Music Model School Fannie E. McKinney Hughey conducted The Hughey Color-Music Model School for children from two to seven years of age, and normal training classes for mothers and teachers at the Milliken Conservatory of Music, Decatur, Illinois. Along with the musical training went instruction in number work, nature work, bodily exercise, and for the more advanced pupils languages were taught. The training school was for those who wish to learn the Hughey system, either for teaching or for home instruction. Fannie E. McKinney Hughey's book on her method of teaching music by the color system, \\"Color Music for Children,\\" which was published in 1912 by G. Schirmer, New York, was calculated for and addressed to babes and kindergarten pupils. As Hughey rightly observed: \\"Instruction began formerly with the adult's conception of things; the object being to impart this knowledge to the child. Modern methods begin with the child's experience, and the things which interest him, and broaden out to include the whole field of learning. A child's imagination is very active and sensitive; his power of imitation is just as keen. His world is made up of imagination and imitation. If we would have him love music and desire it, we must go to him where he is, rather than expect him to come to us with our grown-up ideas.\\" \\"If we would help him to think, feel, render and love music, we must teach him by imagery, mimicry and imagination. So we associate musical sounds with colors, making pictures for the eye and pictures for the ear, and in order to make the pictures definite and reasonable the colors are given the shapes of birds, because birds are not only pretty to look at but to listen to. Thus the little ones learn to write and render music as thej' learn to paint a picture or compose a story.\\" The interesting part of Hughey's system is that she insisted it is best to begin music before a child is able to walk, in happy play with its mother. Little children, three, four and five years old, could learn music faster and more accurately and enjoy the study more than at any later period, provided they had the right start. A little child would hardly learn to love music when it is plumped down on a hard music stool, and watched by a severe instructress while stumbling through the scales and five-finger exercises, its eyes anxiously fixed on the guiding lead pencil. No wonder children looked upon it as a distasteful task, and conceive a lasting hatred for music lessons. From earliest infancy children were attracted by colors; Hughey had simply taken advantage of this fact and developed a natural and logical system from it. A thorough test of the color method had been made before presenting it to the public, and the eagerness with which children took up the lessons, and their enthusiasm over the work, had amply demonstrated its practicability. By its means the drudgery attendant upon the first period of the child's musical studies was entirely eliminated. Work became play; rapid progress was made in ear training, in accuracy in determining intervals, and in technic. In class work the color method was a fascinating process, the children vying with each other in eager endeavor. The method could be adopted by the mother in the nursery for the instruction of her own children; any private student could use it with a small group of children belonging to the families of friends and neighbors as an amateur instructor, and the professional music and public school teacher could apply it to their regular classes. The part played by color was easily grasped. Tonic, Dominant and Third were the three primary colors, red, blue and yellow, respectively; the second was Orange (red plus yellow); and the fourth was Green (blue plus yellow), the Octave light red; the sixth Violet (blue and light red), and the seventh Pink (violet and light red). Instead of these technical names for the scale degrees, the Tonic Sol-fa names doh, ray, me, fah, soh, lah, te, were used, and the colors were supposed to be brought down from Rainbow Land by beautiful, bright-hued birds with sweet, soft voices that sound the several tones. The Doh-bird came down first, then the Soh-bird, and so on. The children placed the tacks corresponding in color to the several birds on the appropriate \\"perches\\" (lines or spaces); they were taught to sing the tones in perfect tune and to point out the proper \\"nest\\" (piano-key) for each bird. All this was in the spirit of happy play and innocent rivalry. Personal life On July 19, 1888, Fannie McKinney married Rev. Albert Stinson Hughey (1856-1930) and they had two children: Albert S. Hughey Jr. and Florence Hughey. She died in 1929 and is buried at Fort Hill Cemetery, Auburn, with her husband.

Leslie Macdonald, was a racehorse owner and breeder, noted for two Melbourne Cup winners, Revenue in 1901 and Night Watch in 1918. History Macdonald was born in Bunglegumbie, New South Wales, near Dubbo, a (perhaps the only) son of Charles E(dward) S(tuart) Macdonald (c. 1824 ‚Äì 29 December 1862), wine merchant, Dubbo, later stock and station agent of Mort Street, Sydney, and his wife Janet Macdonald. His elder sister Isabella Sarah Charlotte Macdonald (23 October 1854 ‚Äì ) married John Eden Savill (c. 1847‚Äì1920) in Adelaide on 4 September 1872; by 1874 Macdonald was also in Adelaide. At that time Savill was working as a graphic artist and Macdonald was starting in business as a racehorse owner, with a chestnut gelding Gladiator (late Red Deer), which won the Lockleys Cup in August 1874. This was an amateur race held on E. M. Bagot and G. Bennett's property at Lockleys. In 1878 at a similar meeting, his horse Firefly won the Hurdle Race. In April 1879 he purchased the Adelaide Cup winner Banter. At what may have been his first professional race at Simeon Barnard's Newmarket meeting at Morphettville in August 1879, his bay colt Pawnbroker came second in the Handicap Flutter and won the South Australian Derby in 1879. He won the Birthday Cup in 1880 with Banter. Macdonald was working closely with Savill, at his Lockleys stables,Lockleys was founded by the Fisher brothers before they left for Melbourne and established the Maribyrnong Stud preparing horses for owners such as W. R. Wilson. Savill won the South Australian Derby with Pawnbroker in 1879 and the Adelaide Racing Club's first two City Handicaps with Miss Harriet in 1879 and Footstep in 1880. Savill was owner of The Assyrian unexpectedly who won the 1882 Melbourne Cup, and only because a last-minute shower of rain made the track \\"heavy\\", which suited The Assyrian admirably. The large sum of money Savill had put on the mare (and in a panic had tried in vain to hedge) made him wealthy enough to return to England and live in grand style. Macdonald took over operation of the Lockleys stables, and had some success with horses Rory O'More, The Israelite, and Footstep. He leased Hortense from Sir Thomas Elder and raced her with some success. Macdonald had sole management of Tom Barnfield's First Water, a horse previously owned by William Pile. They got him ready for the 1883 Melbourne Cup, and Barnfield, confident of victory at good odds, backed him heavily but lost ¬£80,000 Tom Barnfield (c. 1844 ‚Äì 8 September 1907) was an Adelaide sharebroker and popular \\"man about town\\" who seldom missed a Melbourne Cup. when Martini-Henry won the Cup. Macdonald took over the training of Lord Wilton for E. W. Ellis (later chairman of the V.R.C. stipendiary stewards) after that horse had won the 1885 Adelaide Cup, famously was run at Flemington. ;St Albans St. Albans stud and racing stables in Breakwater, near Geelong was founded in 1872 by trainer James Wilson, and the homestead was completed the following year. In 1886 St Albans was purchased by John Crozier, Jr., who sold it to mining magnate W. R. Wilson four years later for a reputed ¬£75,000. Wilson appointed Macdonald manager of the stud. Wilson broke up his St. Albans establishment in 1895, selling the stock and property on the art union principle. At a separate sale Macdonald purchased Revenue for 725 guineas, and backed him heavily for the 1901 Melbourne Cup, despite his starting at 7 to 4, the hottest favorite in the history of the race up to that time. His other great purchase was Wakeful, regarded by many as the greatest mare that ever raced in Australia, having won the Sydney Cup, Oakleigh Plate, Newmarket Handicap, and Doncaster Handicap. Among Wakeful's offspring were Blairgour and Night Watch, winners of several important races. Macdonald's trainer for a number of years was Hugh \\"Hughie\\" Munro (c. 1858 ‚Äì 2 June 1925), father of Sydney jockeys James Leslie \\"Jimmie\\" Munro (1906‚Äì1974) and David Hugh \\"Darby\\" Munro (1913‚Äì1966). The St Albans Estate property, valued at ¬£40,000, was won by J. W. Jordan, of Seymour, Victoria, who offered it for sale at a great auction in November, and was knocked down to W. R. Wilson, who bought the property back for ¬£24,000. He also bought back some of his horses at \\"sensible\\" prices from \\"lucky winners\\", who no doubt found ownership of a thoroughbred horse a \\"white elephant\\" proposition. With this nucleus, Wilson re-established the stud and racing stables, retaining Macdonald as manager. Wilson died in 1900 and the St Alban stud was broken up again. The great sire Bill of Portland was purchased by an English stud. The property was purchased by a consortium which included Guy Raymond, a friend of Macdonald's. :During the time Macdonald was at St Albans, many great horses, including Auriferous, Aurum, Bobadil, Carnage, Elusive, La Carabine, La Tosca, Merman, Scorn, Strathmore, Symmetry, and Wallace passed through his hands, and within that ten years they won the Maribyrnong Plate, Debutant Stakes, Oakleigh Plate, and Adelaide Birthday Cup each once, Caulfield Futurity Stakes, Oaks, VRC Sires' Produce Stakes, AJC St Leger, Sydney Cup, and Australian Cup twice, Victoria Derby, VRC St Leger, Ascot Vale Stakes, Caulfield Guineas, Williamstown, and Champagne Stakes three times each. Aurum, who came a good third in the Melbourne Cup of 1897 despite a punishing weight of 8st 6lb (54kg), Macdonald considered the best three-year- old he had seen in Australia. The famous actress Lily Langtry, who had purchased the St Albans horse Merman and raced him successfully in England, purchased and imported Aurum but he broke down and never raced in England. ;Independent again The breakup of St Albans marked the beginning of the most profitable period of Macdonald's racing career. He purchased at the sale ring a handful of horses from Wilson's estate with an eye to their racing potential rather than for breeding. He purchased a home at Caulfield, adjoining the racecourse, and there he trained for a number of years. His first purchase was the four-year-old Trenton mare Wakeful, who had been tried as a two-year-old, but given a long rest after becoming shin sore. Macdonald got her for 310 guineas, which turned out one of the greatest bargains in Australian racing history. Races she won for Macdonald included the Oakleigh Plate, Newmarket Handicap, Doncaster Handicap and Sydney Cup, for a total of ¬£16,690 in prize money and through judicious punting, a fortune from the bookmakers. She was narrowly beaten by Hymettus in the 1901 Caulfield Cup and Lord Cardigan in the 1903 Melbourne Cup, carrying . Revenue, a son of Trenton, was another of his St Albans purchases, which cost him 725 guineas. This horse took out the 1901 Melbourne Cup and also made a great deal of money for Macdonald, despite starting at 7 to 4, at that time the hottest favorite in the history of the Cup. He did not fare so well in the 1902 Australian Cup though, being crippled in the race, for which Macdonald blamed foul riding by Walter Burn, rider of Flintlock. Macdonald had won and lost two fortunes during his long involvement with horseracing and was determined the bookmakers should not have his third, so put it into gilt-edged securities, and thereby lived the rest of his life in comfort and financial security. Others of his horses had significant wins: Kinglike won the 1900 Caulfield Guineas, and Aurous won the 1901 Caulfield Futurity Stakes. Following a visit to England and the death of Isaac Earnshaw, Macdonald began in 1914 acting as racing manager for \\"The Firm\\" of sharebrokers and horse owners Clark & Robinson, whose principals, William Clark and Lionel Robinson, were old friends before settling in England. Macdonald left their employ in 1917, and the agency was taken over by S. Bloomfield. Macdonald had retired Wakeful to a stud in New South Wales, where she produced a number of foals, and he dropped out of racehorse ownership until those sons and daughters of Wakeful were ready to race. Balgowan made little impact, but Blairgour won both the Oakleigh Plate and Caulfield Futurity Stakes for him in 1911, and sold for a good price, but became a windsucker and had to be put out to pasture. Night Watch, son of Wakeful, was initially trained by Charles Quinn and W. Kelso, then by Richard Bradfield, who was also training the Clark & Robinson horses. Night Watch won the 1918 Melbourne Cup, was second in the Caulfield Cup, and won several other good races. Macdonald retired from racing after Night Watch's 1918 victory. Last days In 1927 Macdonald sold his stud horses, all descendants of Wakeful. Macdonald had been in poor health for a long time, and inflicted on himself a revolver shot to the head. He was found lying unconscious in his flat at Cliveden Mansions, East Melbourne. He died some hours later in a private hospital, aged 73 years, and was buried at the Brighton Cemetery. Leslie Macdonald was described as a charming man, and one of the most able trainers and astute judges of horses Australia has known. During his last year or two he was invariably in the company of Guy Raymond, one of the owners of St. Albans, so his connection with that stable remained unsevered to the end. Family Macdonald married Alice Maude Keane Massina (1865 ‚Äì 14 May 1940) on 1 September 1902. They had no children. A sister, Isabella Sarah Charlotte Macdonald (23 October 1854 ‚Äì ) married J. Eden Savill, and had several children, among them: *Maude Maitland Dalzell (1875‚Äì1956), who married Ronald Dalzell, 12th Earl of Carnwath (1883‚Äì1931) on 23 July 1910 and so became Countess of Carnwath  References  1856 births 1929 deaths Australian racehorse owners and breeders Australian horse trainers Suicides by firearm in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"C.

A major police and army response followed the discovery of the 'spacecraft', which were long, wide and deep, weighed and emitted an electronic noise. The six craft were located along the 51st line of latitude from the Thames Estuary to the Bristol Channel, roughly equidistant from each another; one each at a new housing estate near Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, Bromley golf course in south London, a horse paddock in Winkfield village (near Ascot), the village of Welford (near Newbury), in Berkshire, Chippenham in Wiltshire and on Dial Hill in Clevedon in Somerset. The hoax was undertaken by aircraft engineering apprentices from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough. Planning and building the 'spacecraft' The idea behind the hoax was planned in January 1967 as part of Farnborough college's upcoming Rag Week. The apprentices created their flying saucers in fibreglass halves and then covered them in metal with no aerials or portholes visible. Inside each saucer was placed electronic equipment that would make an eerie sound when the saucer was flipped over. Each saucer was also filled with a mixture of flour and water. Groups of two or three then drove to the selected locations in the dead of night and carried the saucers into fields. Here they flipped the saucers over causing them to emit the electronic sound. They then left the field and headed back to Farnborough. None of the teams were detected. Response from the authorities When each of the saucers was later reported to the police each was cordoned off. The British army's southern command, several police forces, army bomb disposal units, RAF helicopters were all mobilised. The Ministry of Defence was informed and the army blew up the saucer found at Chippenham. The one on the Isle of Sheppey was removed by helicopter. Another was sent to the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and one to the guided weapons division of the British Aircraft Corporation. When one of the saucers was drilled into, the mixture inside exploded, covering police officers in foul-smelling slime. Revealing the hoax The pranksters responsible were Christopher Southall and Roger Palmer, both aged just 21. The idea behind the hoax was to raise funds during the college's Rag Week. The hoax garnered extensive media attention - both in Britain and abroad. The apprentices did not think the hoax would create such a media storm but several were later interviewed on television. They revealed the hoax the same day as the saucers were found. No action was taken against the hoaxers and they raised ¬£2,000 for charity.

Yamanaka campsite was established at the end of the Taish≈ç era for training Scout leaders. The 1,000 meter altitude, quiet campground is surrounded by the acorn-bearing Quercus mongolica (') and larch on a northward slope of about 72,732 square meters, (roughly 18 acres) which gently drops towards Lake Yamanaka. In 1924, Japan fielded a full contingent of 25 to the 2nd World Scout Jamboree in Denmark. Tsuneha Sano was a participant, during which time he attended a Wood Badge course at Gilwell Park, marking the watershed for the first period of Japanese Scouting. In 1925 Sano returned to Japan and created Japan's own training course at Lake Yamanaka, called Jisshu-sho, for both Cub and Scout leaders, which is still used to this day, after completion of two preliminary courses, Koshu-kai and Kenshu-kai. Count Sano discovered clean water there, opened a camp and a leaders training center, which after World War II became a national practical training center, with special training for Fuji Scouts, base camp for hiking Mount Fuji, and year-round camping for Scouts from across Japan and abroad. However, the land was leased from Yamanashi Prefecture, and expenditures for upkeep on the site exceeded income. Various studies and negotiations were conducted for several years, and the SAJ established the Yamanaka Camp Site Review Committee. SAJ examined whether Yamanaka campsite should be closed or how it could be renovated, and sought all avenues for maintaining the camp, and negotiated with the various parties concerned, but due to the aging building, the problem of asbestos, the cost of rebuilding, and in consideration of financial problems, the Review Committee reported to the Board of Directors held on October 11, 2016. SAJ decided to close down Yamanaka campsite in August 2017. The period necessary for dismantlement work and disposal equipment in order to complete removal of buildings and return the site to Yamanashi Prefecture after inspection is estimated as the end of March 2018. By 2017, Yamanaka campsite was only available to SAJ-organized events and leaders' training courses.

Sidanko owned several oil production units, including Chernogorneft and Udmurtneft. History Sidanko was established through the Decree No. 452 of the Russian government, published on 5 May 1994. The company counted among its assets oil extraction and processing facilities in the Udmurt Republic and in the Khanty-Mansiysk, Yamalo-Nenets, Irkutsk and Sakhalin regions. It was privatized in December 1995, when the Russian government auctioned off a 51% share as part of the loans for shares scheme. The 51% stake was awarded to the bank Mezhdunarodnaya Finansovaya Kompaniya in return for a $130 million loan, guaranteed by Vladimir Potanin's Uneximbank. The company came under the ownership of Uneximbank, which exercised control over it through the Interros holding company. An additional 34% stake was sold by the government in September 1996, in an auction designed to have Uneximbank as the only admissible bidder. As with the rest of the loan for shares scheme, the Sidanko auction was considered rigged by most analysts. In November 1997 British Petroleum bought a 10% share in the company for $484 million. Sidanko entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 1999, after ZAO Beta Ekho filed to recover a $22,000 debt. Beta Ekho was later revealed to be a vehicle of Mikhail Fridman's Alfa Group, which was using bankruptcy laws to avenge Fridman's exclusion by Potanin from the Svyazinvest privatization. In September 1999 western creditors agreed to cede their voting rights in the company to Russian government. Tyumen Oil Company bought Sidanko's Chernogorneft unit for $176 million at a bankruptcy auction in November 1999. In 2001 Interros sold a 44% stake in the company for $650 million. BP raised its stake to 25% in 2002, paying $375 million for a 15% share. In 2003 Sidanko merged with TNK, Onako and the majority of BP's oil assets in Russia to form TNK-BP.

Through publications, events, social media, and a lively blog, Bruegel has carved a unique discussion space for everyone interested in improving the quality of economic policy. Through a dual focus on analysis and impact and dynamic relationships with policymakers at every governance level, it has also established itself as a vibrant laboratory for economic policies.  Artistic projects  Giuseppe Porcaro has been involved in several artistic projects, either as creator, or as participant. Between 2008 and 2009 he wrote, directed and produced a documentary on youth participation in the United Nations, called the yoUNg. The documentary was supported by the UNFPA and was released in April 2009 at the Cinema Nova in Brussels. In 2013, he starred and directed a mockumentary called Madame Pipi, describing the making of a failed idea to create a TV series about the ladies that clean the toilets in Belgium with the social mission of transforming them into national heroes and the dream to start producing TV shows. Giuseppe Porcaro was featured in the movie Hamsters, directed by Martine Doyen and participated in the International Film Festival Rotterdam, in the theatre piece The Common People, by Jan Martens, and in the dance piece, A mon seul d√©sir by Ga√´lle Bourges inspired by the tapestry of the Lady and the Unicorn.  Disco Sour  Disco Sour is the first novel by Giuseppe Porcaro, set in a parallel history timeline where a civil war ravaged Europe and nation-states collapsed, while the European Union is the only entity left with a grip on the rule of law. It's the story of a heartsick politician that tries to stop the selling of a mobile app that would replace elections and democracy. The novel has been published by Unbound in May 2018.

Dall & P. Bartsch (1910), New Species of Shells; Memoir 14-N, Canada, Department of Mines, Geological Survey Branch, Ottawa, 1910 Description The length of the shell attains 9 mm, its diameter 3.25 mm. (Original description) The small, thin shell has an acute-fusiform shape. It is externally of a greyish colour. It contains about seven whorls. The initial whorl is minute, and smooth; the second bulbous, and smooth. The next are finely reticulated by fine spiral threads, and somewhat protractive arcuate fine riblets. This sculpture gradually merges into that of the adult whorl. The latter comprise‚Äîon the body whorl‚Äîeleven or twelve arcuate ribs, retractive from the suture, protractive from the shoulder of the whorl forward to the siphonal canal. These ribs are narrow, low, rather rounded, and with interspaces of about twice their own width. The whorl slopes in a somewhat excavated manner from the suture to the shoulder, where there is a moderate angulation, sometimes forming a rather strong spiral cord. The rest of the surface is covered with very fine, close, even, spiral threading, a little coarser on the earlier whorls. The aperture is elongate and narrow. The anal sinus is wide and shallow. The columella is white, with anterior end attenuated. The interior of the aperture is white, with three brown spiral bands, wide and dark, on the inside of the outer lip, but not visible on the exterior of the shell. The outer lip is sharp except when a varix is formed, when it is slightly reflected inward. There is no operculum. The siphonal canal is short and straight, . and rather wide.

It is found in the Palearctic Joy, N 1932 A Practical Handbook of British Beetles The imagines occur everywhere, where remnants of carrion can be found. The species prefers dry bones, fur with meat remnants or dried carrion as well as dry fish. It is not infrequent to find them feeding on leather, smoked meat and bacon. The beetle is also regularly found in forensic studies of older bodies. In studies in Switzerland, the imagines appeared during the fourth stage of the body decomposition (ammoniacal decay) and were to be found until the carcasses had dried completely. This corresponds to a period of five to nine months after death, so the presence of the beetle on a carcass usually has little significance for forensic entomology. A period of 25 to 35 days is assumed for the development period of the beetle larvae. In contrast to Necrobia rufipes, the larvae do not eat the carrion, but feed on insect larvae that develop in the carcass and in fleshy products. They are therefore useful and can not be classified as pests. According to other observations, they have the same food preferences as the fly Piophila casei and can also feed on the decomposition products of animal tissues themselves. In laboratory tests, it was shown that the larvae feed inside the pupae of flies of the genus Sarcophaga.

Underhill was born in Chappaqua, New York, on September 27, 1833. Her ancestors for many generations were members of the orthodox Friends Society in which her parents, Charles R. Underhill and Elizabeth Cornell Quinby, were members and elders. Her education was received principally in the Friends' boarding schools in Dutchess County, New York, and Westtown, Pennsylvania. Career For four years after leaving school Hannah M. Underhill taught in her native town, and later carried on a private school at home. Hannah M. Underhill spent several winters with friends and relatives in New York City, where she entered society. During one of these winters, she gained a strong conviction. In the summer of 1861, she renounced the worldly life she had been leading. She was converted, and for some time that life satisfied her. Five years after conversion she received what she believed to be a call to preach the gospel. She was an invalid for three years, and on recovering her health she began to do evangelistic work. For six years she was connected with Elizabeth Loder in mission work in the village of Cornwall, New York. Loder owned a chapel, and together these women worked to spread their faith. Sailors, boatmen and laborers went to their meetings, and many were converted. When the temperance crusade came, Underhill joined in the work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, entering a union in Brooklyn. In 1880 she organized a society in Cornwall, which was one of the most prominent of the local organizations in Orange County, New York. Personal life Hannah M. Underhill married William Isaac, of Cornwall, in March, 1886. She died on May 27, 1904, and is buried at Quaker Cemetery, Chappaqua.

(Original description) The shell has a wax yellow color. The 1¬Ω whorls of the protoconch are well rounded and apparently smooth. The subsequent whorls are strongly, tabulatedly shouldered. They are marked by strong, spiral cords, of which 3 occur between the angle of the shoulder and the suture on all the whorls. These are a little wider than the spaces that separate them. On the middle of the tabulated shoulder, a slender spiral cord begins on the first whorl, which increases in strength until it is about half as strong as those anterior to it on the body whorl. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a cord fully as strong as those posterior to it. The base of the shell is moderately prolonged, slightly rounded, marked by three spiral cords which are almost as strong as those on the spire and of about equal spacing with them. The aperture is feebly channeled posteriorly, decidedly so anteriorly. The outer lip is rendered sinuous by the spiral cords. The inner lip and parietal wall are covered with a thin callus.

Primary B cell development takes place in the bone marrow, where immature B cells must generate a functional B cell receptor (BCR) and overcome negative selection induced by reactivity with autoantigens. Transitional cells can be found in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen, and only a fraction of the immature B cells that survive after the transitional stage become mature B cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen. Characteristic of transitional cells The term \\"transitional B cell\\" was first used in mouse in 1995 for cells that are developmentally intermediate between immature bone marrow B lineage cells and fully mature naive B cells in the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid tissues. It is postulated that the transitional cells, after leaving the bone marrow, are subjected to peripheral checks to prevent the production of autoantibodies. Transitional B cells that survive selection against autoreactivity develop eventually into naive B cells. Given the fact that only a small fraction of immature B cells survive the transition to the mature naive stage, the transitional B cell compartment is widely believed to represent a key negative selection checkpoint for autoreactive B cells. All transitional B cells are high in heat-stable antigen (HSA) relative to their mature counterparts and express the phenotypic surface markers AA4. T1 and T2 There are two transitional stages for the B cells in mouse, T1 and T2, with the T1 stage occurring from its migration from the bone marrow to its entry into the spleen, and the T2 stage occurring within the spleen where they developed into mature B cells. As in the mouse, human transitional cells can be found in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen. However, in contrast to the nuanced models proposed in the mouse, thus far human studies have, by and large, described a rather homogenous population of transitional B cells (T1/T2) defined by the expression of high levels of CD24, CD38 and CD10. Overall there is general agreement on the markers used to separate the subpopulations, although some differences exist in the number of subgroups and in the functional characteristics of the T2 population. T1 B cells are distinguished from the other subsets by the following surface marker characteristics: they are IgMhiIgD‚àíCD21‚àíCD23‚àí, whereas T2 B cells retain high levels of surface IgM but are also IgD+CD21+ and CD23+. Differences in functional characteristics of the T2 subpopulation reported by different laboratories are unexplained, although they might be due to differences in isolation strategies. In any case, there is consensus that T2 B cells clearly differ functionally from T1 B cells.

She was the second woman to become a lawyer in Sweden, the first being Eva And√©n. She was known as a feminist throughout her lifetime. Biography She was born in Kristianstad as the daughter of the nobleman and Colonel Axel Sta√´l von Holstein and Cecilia Nordenfeldt and grew up in V√§rmland. She was orphaned early and left with responsibility for her eleven siblings, and never married. She was a correspondent at a law firm, then an assistant and an accountant at the Stockholm City Health Board. She became a Candidate of Law in Stockholm in 1918. She was also a member of the Fredrika Bremer Association and chairman of the Stockholm Women's Association. From 1919 to 1923 she was a partner in Eva And√©n's law firm. As a lawyer, she primarily worked on family law and property issues. One of the biggest problems for women to obtain government office during this time was that the law defined the applicant for such jobs as a \\"Swedish man\\". The Ministry of Justice formed a committee in 1919 to investigate and remove this barrier from the law through a change of constitution. The chairman of the committee was Emilia Broom√©, the first woman to chair a government committee. Sta√´l von Holstein was a committee member. The committee's work resulted in Competence Law of 1923.

This late-ripening vine is the main variety used in the Etna DOC. It is usually found blended with Catarratto and Minella bianca. As a varietal wine, Carricante produces a fresh, straw-yellow, lightly fragrant white wine. The name Carricante comes from the Italian caricare (to load, to burden), in reference to the variety's heavy yields. It is not related to the variety Nocera, which is sometimes called Carricante nero. Carricante is grown at high altitudes on Mount Etna relative to other grapes, growing at around 950 meters above sea level on the eastern slopes and at 1,050 meters on the southern slopes. Wines made from it tend to by high in total acidity with a low pH and have traditionally been subject to malolactic fermentation. Synonyms Carricante is also known under the synonyms Carricanti, Catanese Bianco, Catarratto alla porta bianca di Sicilia, Catarratto amantidatu, Catarratto Mantellato, Catarratto Scalugnatu, Catarratto Scarugnatu, Nocera Bianca.

For longitudinal stability in pitch and in speed, aircraft are designed in such a way that the centre of mass (centre of gravity) is forward of the centre of pressure. The nose-down pitching moment is compensated by the downward aerodynamic force on the elevator and the trimable horizontal stabilizer. This downwards force on the tailplane (horizontal stabilizer and elevator combination) produces lift‚Äìinduced drag in a similar way as the lift on the wing produces lift‚Äìinduced drag. The changes (shifts) of the position of the centre of mass are often caused by fuel being burned off over the period of the flight, and require the aerodynamic trim force to be adjusted. Systems that actively pump fuel between separate fuel tanks in the aircraft can be used to offset this effect and reduce the trim drag.

She gained international recognition as an innovative textile artist and designer from the 1950s and has continued to develop her making and research in other media to the present day. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1991, and a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art and a Visiting Professor at the University of the Arts, both in 2005. Early life and education Ann Sutton was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, on 16 May 1935. She attended local schools, including the Orme Girls‚Äô School, Newcastle-Under-Lyme, winning several art prizes. She moved to Pontypool, Monmouthshire in 1947 and from 1951-1956 studied at the Cardiff College of Art, where she gained a National Diploma in Design. Teaching career Graduating from art college, Sutton became a full-time lecturer in weave at the West Sussex College of Art, Worthing from 1956 until 1963, while also returning as Visitor, Cardiff College of Art (1960) and working as a student and then tutor at the Glamorgan Summer School at Barry, South Wales (1961-1968).Harrod, Tanya; (1999) The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. pp. 226-7. As her own studio work progressed, she combined this with part-time teaching at the Croydon College of Art (1963-1965) and the North Oxfordshire School of Art, Banbury (1967-1974). In 1990 Sutton became a part-time lecturer in woven and embroidered textiles at the Royal College of Art, and has also served widely as an external assessor at both BA and MA levels at many universities and colleges, including the Royal College of Art. In 2005 Ann Sutton was made both a Visiting Professor by the University of the Arts, London, and Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art. Studio career Banbury In 1964, Sutton married furniture designer and maker John Makepeace, and together they converted Farnborough Barn, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, into living and workshop space where they initially combined their careers. Makepeace employed craftsmen and trained apprentices on site; Sutton pioneered the use of local home workers, working to her original designs. In 1970 she won joint 1st prize in the Sculpture ‚Äô70 Welsh Arts Council Competition, while in the same year the Victoria and Albert Museum commissioned and purchased 16 prints on paper and aluminium for the solo show: Textile Images on Paper. In 1974 she designed a \\"logical colour scheme\\" for a new quadrangle at Keble College, University of Oxford, with the architects Ahrends, Burton & Koralek. Parnham House Together with her then-husband John Makepeace, Ann Sutton bought the 16th century, Grade I listed Parnham House near Beaminster, Dorset, which was to become their new home, workshops and studios, combined with a new residential training college for craftsmen. In 1977 it opened as the Parnham Trust School for Craftsmen in Wood; early students included furniture designer and retailer David Linley, now the Second Earl of Snowdon. Sutton combined developing Parnham (the 80-roomed house was also open to the public) with her own work. From 1970 to 1988 she served on the committee of the Contemporary Arts Society, becoming a buyer of painting, sculpture and craft for the society in 1983. When her marriage to Makepeace ended in 1978, Sutton left Parnham to set up on her own in West Sussex. They were formally divorced in 1983. West Sussex In 1980, the newly-single Sutton bought and began to renovate a semi-derelict, former Cooperative shop in Tarrant Street, Arundel. This became both her new living and studio space.Coatts, Margot. \\"Woven Textile Artist Ann Sutton Discusses Her Life and Work with Margot Coatts.\\" Crafts, September/October 2002, 42-45, p. 44. It was from here that in that same year she wrote and presented the five-part BBC television series \\"The Craft of the Weaver\\", together with the accompanying book. During the 1980s, Sutton became an early adopter of new technology, and especially the use of computer-aided looms, which she pioneered. In 1985 she had a large solo exhibition at the Norrk√∂pings Konstmuseum, Sweden and from 1989-90 was a member of UK Government steering group ‚ÄúPerCent for Art‚Äù. Sutton initiated what is claimed to be the world's first walking ‚ÄòGallery Trail‚Äô, as part of the Arundel Festival, beginning in 1989. It continues annually today. Consultancies and public service also continued, including the award-winning refurbishment of the Southampton Art Gallery (1990). Sutton founded ‚ÄúSight Specific‚Äù, an agency for applied artists' commissions (1992); was a member of the Southern Arts Regional Arts Board (1992-1995); and held a consultancy with the Museum of Science & Industry, Manchester (1996). In 2003 Sutton won first prize in the BPIF Fine Book Binding Awards and was also lead artist on the first phase of The Point arts centre development at Eastleigh, Hampshire (architects: Burrell Foley Fischer), Hampshire, with phase two following in 2010. 2004 saw Ann Sutton's solo retrospective exhibition by invitation of the Crafts Council, in London and touring, and in 2005 she founded Site Editions (commissioning and selling limited editions of sculpture for gardens), and was made the third Artist Patron of the Contemporary Art Society (with Anthony Caro and Bridget Riley). Clearing the decks In 2010, Ann Sutton removed all the looms from her studio; a radical step for someone who had made an international reputation as a weaver and textile artist. While she had previously pioneered the use of computer-aided looms, she now got rid of them completely. This heralded a new phase of visual research and making, in which she worked increasingly in paint, drawing, and progressing to what she calls ‚Äúspatial drawing.‚Äù Her initial work was shown in a solo exhibition: ‚ÄúCounterpoint‚Äù, curated by Gill Hedley at the Patrick Heide Contemporary Art gallery in London. More new work was unveiled at her invited solo exhibition within ‚ÄúCollect‚Äù at the Saatchi Galleries, London in 2015. Increasingly, her studio research and making involved new material combinations, and getting still further away from traditional ideas of support. In 2016 she was shown at ‚ÄúTaste‚Äù at Artgen√®ve, and in 2016-17 her solo exhibition ‚ÄúOn The Grid‚Äù toured UK public galleries, including Gallery Oldham, Lancashire, The Potteries Museum, Stoke-on-Trent, and in 2018 at the Winchester Gallery, University of Southampton. In 2017 Ann Sutton gave the Fielding Talk under the title ‚ÄúRebel with a Cause‚Äù for the Crafts Council, at St Martin in the Fields, London. In 2018 her work was included in ‚ÄúThe Most Real Thing: Contemporary Textiles and Sculpture‚Äù at the NewArtCentre, Roche Court, Hampshire, England, who now represent her as an artist. Ann Sutton's work is included in public collections in the UK and worldwide including the Victoria and Albert Museum, City of Leeds Museums (Lotherton Hall), National Museum of Wales, and the Crafts Council. Travel, awards and international work Ann Sutton has travelled extensively as part of her work, often in connection with awards, teaching and consultancies. Highlights include a Royal Society of Arts (R.S.A) scholarship for travel and research in Nigeria and Morocco (1971); chairing the Fibre Programme: World Crafts Council conference, Mexico (1975); chairing the ‚ÄúMiniature Textile‚Äù convention, University of Athens, Georgia, (1980); a lecture tour of Australia on behalf of the Australian Crafts Council and the British Council (1985); a lecture tour of U.S.A. and Canada including the Rhode Island Institute of Design (1986); International judge: Fashion Fabric Design contest, Tokyo (1988 and 1989); keynote address: Weavers Guild of America, ‚ÄúConvergence 94‚Äù, Minneapolis, Minnesota (1994); member of the Examining Committee: Textile School, Rhode Island School of Design, (1995). Sutton's design work for industry includes Heal's, Dunn's and Liberty (1966); Crown Wallcoverings (1978); work on ‚ÄòThe Wales Collection‚Äô for The Wales Craft Council/Welsh Woolen Association (1984-5); and collections for Early's of Witney (1987). In 1989-90, Sutton designed two collections each year with Junichi Arai, Japan, and has undertaken freelance commissions with companies including Ralph Lauren (1990 to present). From 1985, she has been an enthusiastic passenger on container ships and has circled the world four times. Ann Sutton Foundation In 1999, she set up the Ann Sutton Foundation, which was housed in premises which Sutton bought and renovated adjacent to her Arundel studio and home. She had long held that talented young woven textile artists needed a period of guided transition between graduate study and the working world. Consequently, the Foundation set out to provide not only advanced tuition and research, but also the vocational training that would enable them to become professionally self-supporting. The Foundation, supported by the Arts Council, was established as a registered charity with a board of trustees. Fellowships were awarded competitively for graduates under the age of 29 and in financial need. An early relationship with the Royal College of Art was established and accommodation was provided in addition to a stipend, tuition and studio space. Early fellows included Margot Selby and Laura Thomas. Increasingly, however, art colleges themselves began to adopt aspects of the Ann Sutton Foundation model, and this combined with the high costs and increasing difficulty of attracting philanthropy for the Foundation, which was formally dissolved ten years later, in 2009.

Early life Jane Marie Bancroft was born in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on December 24, 1847. She descended on her mother's side, Caroline J. Orton, from an old Dutch family of New York City, and on her father's side from early English settlers in New Jersey. Her father, Rev. George C. Bancroft, was for over fifty years a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Bancroft graduated in 1871 from the Troy Female Seminary, founded by Emma Willard. In 1872 she graduated from the State Normal School in Albany, New York, and immediately there-after was appointed preceptress of Fort Edward Collegiate Institute, Fort Edward (town), New York, where she remained until 1876. During the years from 1870 to 1876 colleges for women were being established, and the doors of colleges hitherto open only to men were thrown open to women. Urged by her far-sighted mother, Jane Bancroft determined to take a college course. While in Fort Edward, she took private lessons in advanced studies, and in the fall of 1876 entered Syracuse University as a member of the senior class, and was graduated from that institution in 1877. In 1907 she was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and received two honorary doctorates, in 1919 from Syracuse University and in 1929 from the University of Southern California. Career Immediately after graduation from Syracuse University, Jane Bancroft was invited to become the dean of the Woman's College of the Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and professor of the French language and literature, a position previously occupied by Frances Willard and Ellen Soule Carhart. She founded the Western Association of Collegiate Alumnae, an early model of the American Association of University Women. In addition to the arduous work of the position, she diligently pursued her studies in French history, with a view to taking a higher degree, and she received from Syracuse University, upon examination, the degree of Ph. M. in 1880, and of Ph. D. in 1883. Her thesis for the latter degree, A Study of the Parliament of Paris and Other Parliaments of France was a treatise on the parliament of Paris and other parliaments of France, and the research and study therein displayed won her at once a fine reputation. It was published in 1884. Many of the leading historical students in the United States and England sent her appreciative letters. In 1885 she resigned her position in the Northwestern University to pursue historical studies as a fellow of history in Bryn Mawr College, the first recipient of the history fellowship at that institution. In 1886 she went to Europe, matriculated in the University of Zurich, and remained there one year, devoting herself to the study of political and constitutional history. The following year she went to Paris and became a student in the Paris-Sorbonne University, continuing her researches in history. She was also received as a student in the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, being the first woman to hear lectures in the literary department of that school. Her stay abroad was diversified by travel and writing. She contributed to various papers and periodicals. Visiting London before her return to the United States, she became deeply interested in the deaconess work as illustrated in different institutions there and studied it carefully. She returned to the United States, convinced that that social and religious movement might prove a great agency in the uplifting of the poor and the degraded of her native land. Her wide information and executive ability were at once pressed into service for developing deaconess work in the United States, where it had already gained a foothold. At the invitation of its officers, in 1888 she took full charge of the department of deaconess work in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She visited most of the large cities of the United States, speaking in behalf of the deaconess cause, and interesting the women of different Protestant churches by means of parlor meetings and public lectures. She was a logical and fluent speaker as well as a writer of marked talent. From 1908 to 1913 she was the president of the Woman's Home Missionary Society. In 1889 she published her most important work, entitled \\"Deaconesses in Europe and their Lessons for America,\\" which was the leading authority in the United States upon the subject. She was the secretary of the Bureau for Deaconess Work of the Woman's Home Missionary Society. She was a life member of the American Historical Association and of the American Economic Association. She was connected with many philanthropic and social organizations. Personal life In 1891 Jane Bancroft became the wife of Hon. George Orville Robinson (1832-1915), of Detroit, Michigan, a lawyer, widely known in philanthropic and legal circles. He was the founder of the Michigan Christian Advocate and aided his wife's work by giving generously to the construction of deaconess institutions. Three years after the death of her husband in 1915, she moved with her half-sister Henrietta Ash Bancroft (October 26, 1842 - February 10, 1929) in Pasadena, California. She died in Pasadena, California, on May 29, 1932, and is buried at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum, Altadena, California. Legacy Jane Bancroft Robinson more than $10,000 ($165,364.38 in 2017) to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. She donated her home and land for the construction of retirement homes for deaconesses and ministers.

It was formed by the merger of Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust on 1 October 2017. It is the largest NHS trust in the United Kingdom, with an income of ¬£1.6bn and 21,945 staff. The trust is in the process of taking over North Manchester General Hospital, which it has started running since 1 April 2020 under a management agreement with Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.. Prior to the formation of the new trust, the Competition and Markets Authority decided that while the merger would substantially reduce competition among health services in the area, the benefits to patients were ‚Äòmore significant‚Äô. Developments In January 2018 the trust secured a loan of ¬£125 million from the Department of Health's Independent Trust Financing Facility. ¬£50 million will be used for rolling out the Allscripts electronic patient record, already used in Wythenshawe, on the Central Manchester site. It will also enable reconfiguration of the accident and emergency departments with separation of the flow of major and minor incidents, and a new primary care assessment space at the front doors, backlog maintenance at Wythenshawe and ¬£12 million liquidity support. A helipad is being constructed on the top of the Grafton Street car park to serve the trust's hospitals. It will cost ¬£3.9 million, which has been raised by the trust's charity, Manchester Foundation Trust (MFT) Charity. It will be connected to the hospitals by a 130 metre long bridge 19 metres above street level. It is expected to serve about 312 patients airlifted to the site each year. Centrica Business Solutions has a contract to install new energy infrastructure at Withington and Wythenshawe hospitals at a cost of ¬£10.9 million. This will reduce their annual carbon emissions by about 25% and halve the energy bill. The trust decided in 2019 to install an electronic patient record system from Epic Systems, called Hive. It will provide a new ‚Äòoperating system‚Äô for the trust, replacing current IT systems, including electronic patient records and Patient Administration Systems and a number of smaller specialty systems over six sites. The ¬£181 million contract will last for 15 years. A new helipad, with a Deck Integrated Fire Fighting System, was built on the roof of the Grafton Street Car Park at a cost of ¬£3.9 million in 2020. It is expected to serve about 312 patients a year. ¬£1.36 million has been donated by the HELP Appeal. It is linked to the main building by a 130 metre link bridge.

It is published in Japan by Kodansha, and as a webcomic by Sai-zen-sen (ÊúÄÂâçÁ∑ö) in both Japanese and English.  Plot  Yumi Nagumo is a carefree Nipponian (in-universe version of Japan) high school girl who dreams of going to the United States of Amerigo (in- universe version of the United States of America) and becoming its President. She managed to arrive in the US during summer vacation. After befriending some elderly veterans, she becomes convinced that joining the United States Marine Corps is the best way to move her dream forward and enlisted. The story follows Yumi and her friends in the Marines, starting from their experiences in boot camp to their daily lives as Marines stationed in Okinawa. Background Anastasia Moreno, nicknamed Ana, was a US Marine of Japanese and Filipino American descent. She served for the United States Forces Japan as part of the United States Marine Corps in Japan from 1999 to 2004. After finishing active duty, she went on to become a civilian translator for the federal government, as well as a manga translator for Seven Seas Entertainment, translating licensed titles such as Strawberry Panic!, Girls und Panzer, and Girl Friends. She started writing Marine Corps Yumi in part because of the lack of female Marine representation in the media. She drew from her own experiences as a Marine, as well as her understanding of Japanese people and culture thanks to her Japanese ancestry from her mother's side. She collaborated with Takeshi Nogami, who is known for his work on Strike Witches and the aforementioned Girls und Panzer, among other titles. After a long affliction with cancer, Moreno died on July 12, 2015. The series was continued by Nogami as he was given the whole plot by Moreno before her death and the English translation will be continued by Dan Kanemitsu. On June 20, 2017, Takeshi announced that he had finished all the stories of Marine Corps Yumi for a total of seven volumes containing 193 chapters. As of December 2017, 77 chapters have been officially translated to English and are available at the archived official website. Characters  Yumi Nagumo  is an 18-year- old Nipponian high school graduate who dreams of becoming the President of the United States. Because of her small stature and protruding strands of hair (ahoge), the drill instructors at Barris Island (in-universe version of Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island) gave her the nickname \\"Antenna Midget\\". Despite being Nipponian, she had no difficulty enlisting after the recruiter learned that she was born in Hawaii, which makes her a natural-born US citizen. Her Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is CBRN Defense (57xx). She also serves as a Nipponese interpreter and translator, which might qualify her for Japanese Linguist (2739). Both had been Moreno's occupations when she was on active duty. She is the first among the main characters to be promoted to Corporal. Later, she enrolls in officer school with King, and by the end of the story is starting training as an aviator.  Linda Crawford  Former diner waitress who enlisted together with Yumi, both to look after Yumi and to improve her own standing in life. She adores her older brother who owns an auto repair shop. Her MOS is Motor Transport (35xx). She later gets married with a fellow Marine.  Rita Fernandez  A military brat who was born and raised in Okinawa and is the fourth generation of Marine in her family. Her father is a Marine Sergeant Major. Her MOS is Intelligence (02xx). At the end of the story, she has risen to the rank of Sergeant Major like her father.  Donna King  An MBA graduate who turned down a job offer from Boldman Suchs to forge her own path in life, despite her privileged background. Has a strong interest in yaoi fiction, and finds an abundance of inspiration in the male- dominated Marine environment. Her MOS is Administration (either 01xx or 30xx). She later enrolled in officer school with Yumi.  Takemi Sawa  is an NCOIC in the Nippon Ground Self-Defense Force with the rank of , who is a Liaison Officer to the III Marine Operational Force in which the main characters serve. She was initially assigned to mentor Yumi in formal Japanese to improve her skills as interpreter. They became friends through working on assignments together and Yumi indulging Sawa's interest in US military uniforms. Her commanding officer mentioned that she went to an elite high school, which implies a privileged upbringing and explains her proficiency in formal Japanese.  Accuracy  Since it was written from first-hand experience, the depiction of the military in the manga is generally accurate. In the (now inactive) official website, the writers provided explanations of the liberties taken in the story. These include country names, modifications to Marine insignia (e.g. the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor), military terms such as Marine Air Ground Operating Force (Marine Air-Ground Task Force), and exaggerated physical contact during boot camp for comedic effect. Based on Yumi's birth year of 1984, the timeline of the main story most likely starts in 2002 or 2003, while the manga was published in the 2010s; some aspects of the story are current at the time of publication rather than the supposed time period. For example, Yumi visualizes Barack Obama as the US President, even though he entered office in 2009. A female character is also portrayed as lesbian, even though the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was still in effect during the story's time frame, and was only effectively repealed in 2011.  Reception  Erica Friedman of the yuri review blog, Okazu, praised the manga's depiction of women teaming up, getting stronger and overcoming great odds, particularly during boot camp and the final Crucible tasks. She also noted the racial diversity of the main cast, which is relatively rare in manga. Members of the Women Marines Association have also embraced the manga and described it as \\"nostalgic\\".

Biography Born in Portugal, Fernandez joined a ship to Brazil when he was 13 years old, rose to be a ship's captain, and first settled in the United States in 1850, operating coastal shipping from New York. In 1853 he arrived in Pinole, California, as a gold prospector, but decided to settle, operating a freight business between Contra Costa County and San Francisco and starting in 1857 acquiring land. He eventually became the area's wealthiest resident, owning more than 20,000 acres in Pinole, Oakland, and San Francisco. Among his holdings was a 9,000-acre ranch in western Contra Costa County on which he grew wheat and raised cattle; the remaining 700 acres of the Fernandez Ranch were acquired as an open space preserve in 2004 and expanded in 2010 with the addition of the adjacent Franklin Canyon property, also originally part of the ranch. In 1859 he married Carlotta Cuadra, a member of a Marin County pioneer family from Chile; they had six children. Their third home, a 22-room mansion built in about 1894, is preserved as the Bernardo Fernandez House. He died at home in Pinole in 1912.

Today considered a \\"historical kafana\\", it was a gathering place and an unofficial base of the members of Young Bosnia revolutionary movement, prior to the 1914 Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, a prelude to World War I.  Location  The kafana is located in the neighborhood of Zeleni Venac, in the municipality of Savski Venac. It is situated at the corner of Kraljice Natalije and Kameniƒçka streets, just south of the Zeleni Venac Green Market at the foothills of the Terazije Terrace. The official address is 2 Kraljice Natalije Street.  History  The two-storey building was constructed in the 1890s, in the historical quarter of Savamala, and a kafana was immediately opened on the ground level, which covers . In front of the building was a fish market, part of the Zeleni Venac Green Market. Closest to the building was the location of the sellers which were selling the fish caught at Iron Gates, on the Danube, like wels catfish and beluga, or moruna, so the kafana was originally named Kod morune (\\"Beluga's\\"), which was later changed to Zlatna Moruna. The beluga was known for its great size and quality caviar. They migrated from the Black Sea up the Danube, but they are now prevented from swimming this far, after the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station was built in 1967‚Äì72. The clientele consisted of workers, merchants, artisans, ferrymen and high-school students. In April 1906 a workers' singing union \\"Jedinstvo\\" was founded in the kafana, and commemorative plaque still marks the occasion. The mathematician Mihailo Petroviƒá, whose passion for fishing earned him the nickname Mika Alas (\\"Mika the Fisherman\\"), spent a lot of time in Zlatna Moruna. He would bring the fish he caught to the market and then distribute them to the poor. After World War I, the name of the kafana was changed to Triglav, and the venue kept that name for the next seven decades. The building was a property of the industrialist ƒêorƒëe Ro≈°, a soldier at the Salonika Front and a benefactor of the Hilandar monastery. The new Communist authorities nationalized the property after World War II, but when the process of restitution began in the 2010s, no one claimed it. In 1992 the venue was leased by the Madera company. In November 2002 the change of purpose was authorized, so from catering it was switched to trade. In 2007 another change was allowed, this time to betting, so a betting shop, Meridijan, was opened. Even that was changed in 2010, when a Chinese store, Luo Vang Fa, replaced the betting shop. Madera asked for another change in 2013, and the original catering purpose was restored so that the venue could be restored to its pre-1914 look and purpose, commemorating World War I and the gathering of the members of Young Bosnia there. The work began in late 2013. The facility was equipped with memorabilia from the period, including many photos and the old billiard table, along with objects reminiscent of both Young Bosnia and Mika Alas. The restored kafana was opened in January 2014.MONDO TV - Ponovo radi Zlatna moruna Unfortunately, this attempt at historical preservation was rather short lived, as on April 27, 2018, a new business, Pocket Caff√® & Billiards, opened where the kafana previously was.  Young Bosnia  Trifko Grabe≈æ, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá and Gavrilo Princip in Kalemegdan, May 1914 As members of the movement lived as sub-tenants in the surrounding streets, Zlatna Moruna became their gathering place and an unofficial base. From Zlatna Moruna, Trifko Grabe≈æ, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá and Gavrilo Princip, who later assassinated the archduke, departed for Sarajevo. To the kafana's address was delivered a letter for ƒåabrinoviƒá with a newspaper clipping from Zagreb's Srbobran, giving details of the archduke's visit to Sarajevo. They often discussed their plans over the billiard table as they played karambol. The Zlatna Moruna was also a location where the members of Young Bosnia met with the members of Black Hand, headed by Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá Apis. Behind the building there was an inner yard, in which members of the Black Hand taught Princip how to shoot. In the 1980s, on one part of that lot a post office was built while the remaining part was covered in undergrowth and had become almost inaccessible by the 2010s. Among the revisionist theories concerning the events which resulted in World War I was one that Princip was an agent of some government, which paid him to kill the archduke. However, his surviving correspondence shows that his financial situation was dire. In one letter he pleads to his landlady not to throw him out of his room even though he owes her 16 dinars. In another letter he admits that, due to the problems with paying the rent, he slept for three nights in the open, in the market in front of the kafana. Though the claim that the idea of the assassination itself was conceived in Zlatna Moruna may or may not be true, the historiography can't confirm it.

EFLM has its registered office in Brussels and administrative office in Milan. EFLM is the European Region member of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) History EFLM was created from the merger of two precursor organisations, The Federation of European Societies of Clinical Chemistry (FESCC), (a European representative of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, IFCC) and the European Community Confederation of Clinical Chemistry (EC4) at the EuroMedlab meeting in Amsterdam in 2007. Both precursor organizations arose in the 1970s. The increasing overlap between the European Union, represented by EC4 and FESCC, representing geographical Europe, meant that merger was appropriate. Operations EFLM has an Executive Board and a range of committees for: science, education and training, quality and regulations, communication and professional representation. Each committee has working groups with a Chair and three full members, there is also a Young Scientist member and they may also have corresponding members, but only one member form each country is permitted. The Science Committee develops collaborative science in Laboratory Medicine between member organisations or individuals and guidelines to set standards of practice to assist member societies in providing quality patient care. The output of the scientific working groups is scientific papers and presentations which contribute to the science of laboratory medicine internationally; a list of publications can be found on the EFLM web-site (link below). Typically publications are peer-reviewed and published in the journal Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. The Working Groups are overseen by the Chair of the Science Committee and their activities reviewed annually; scientific and clinically relevant output determine whether they continue. The Education and Training Committee runs educational activities particularly for trainees and those required to develop new skills as well as running scientific and clinical conferences, webinars, etc. The major Congress is Euromedlab held in conjunction with the IFCC, meetings are selected from bids by member societies at the annual General Meeting. These are a major forum for scientific and medical knowledge exchange and is allied with a large exhibition of In Vitro Diagnostic industry equipment. The Quality and Regulations Committee is particularly focussed on contributing to revisions of International standards such ISO 15189 and ISO 22870 which govern standards in medical laboratories; they also contribute to European Regulations and Directives such as the IVD (In Vitro Diagnostics) Regulations. These regulations and standards ensure quality results are delivered for patient care a key issue in diagnosis and monitoring of health and disease and are under regular international review. The Communications Committee provides information on EFLM activities to members and promotes awareness of EFLM The Profession Committee is responsible for the Register of Specialists in Laboratory Medicine and that applicants meet the standards set for eligibility. The need for comparable attainments of qualification, education and experience is a patient safety issue as patients can freely move across borders. All offices are by election. Member societies have national representatives who vote on behalf of their society. The only automatic office is President who will have been elected as Vice President.

Her father was the first white child born in Fond du Lac County, in 1841, and Kate, the oldest of his three daughters, was born on the same farm. Kate Hamilton and each of her daughters ‚Äî Kate, Caroline, and Harriet ‚Äî graduated from law school and were among the first eight women lawyers in Wisconsin. Kate was a pioneer in many areas: in 1893, she was appointed as Milwaukee court commissioner ‚Äî the first woman in the United States to be granted a judicial appointment - and she was the first woman to vote in the county, even before the suffrage amendment was passed. During childhood, Pier lived on the homestead farm just outside the limits of the city of Fond du Lac. She attended the German and English academy, where she learned German, which enabled her to practice law in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Later she attended the public schools and was graduated from the Fond du Lac High School in 1886, 25 years after her mother had graduated from the same institution. A university course was then much desired, but her mother's anxiety to be with her and to have her begin business life under her personal supervision led to their both entering the law department of the Wisconsin State University in September, 1886. Both completed the two-year course in one year by taking the work of the junior and senior classes simultaneously. Pier received the LL.B. degree in 1887. She was elected vice-president of the senior class. Career Kate Hamilton Pier, 1902 After receiving her degree, Pier returned to Fond du Lac for one year, where she practiced law, but also spent time in perfecting her knowledge of German and stenography. In 1888 she moved with her parents to Milwaukee and went into the law department of the Wisconsin Central Railroad for a year. She was in general practice and steadily gained reputation for her intellect and legal knowledge. She won her first victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court in September, 1889. She practiced in all the courts in Milwaukee, except the municipal, which was solely a police court. She also did some legislative work, spending weeks looking after bills in the interest of women.

Voters chose ten representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Oklahoma was won by the Democratic nominees, governor of New Jersey Woodrow Wilson and governor of Indiana Thomas R. Marshall, with 46.95 percent of the popular vote, against the Republican ticket of incumbent president William Howard Taft (R‚ÄìOhio), running with Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler, with 35.77 percent of the popular vote, and the five-time candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States Eugene V. Debs (S‚ÄìIndiana), running with the first Socialist mayor of a major city in the United States Emil Seidel, with 16.42 percent of the popular vote. Oklahoma was the second best state in percentage points for Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs with 16.42 percent with Nevada being his best with 16.47 percent. This was also the only state in which the Progressive Party candidates, former president Theodore Roosevelt and his running mate, governor of California Hiram Johnson, were not on the ballot.

Family affairs He was born into the Falkos (or Libercse) branch of the ancient gens (clan) Kacsics, as the son of Michael Kacsics (fl. 1271‚Äì1301) and an unidentified noblewoman from the so-called \\"Z√≥lyom kinship\\", ancestors of the future powerful Balassa family. Simon had three siblings: his two brothers were Thomas the Fat (\\"Tompos\\"; fl. 1291‚Äì1309) and Peter the Bohemian (fl. 1291‚Äì1332), forefathers of the Tompos de Libercse and the Ger√©b de Ving√°rt families, respectively. Their unidentified sister married Reynold K√∂k√©nyesradn√≥t. From his unidentified marriage, Simon had two sons and a daughter: the eldest one Simon became the provost of D√∂m√∂s (according to Pope John XXII's charter, he earned the office sometimes before November 1325) and court chaplain of Clementia of Hungary. The second son Rado was the ancestor of the Rad√≥ de Libercse noble family, which flourished until c. 1422. Simon's only unidentified daughter married Stephen III Losonci.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Kacsics 3., Libercse branch) Simon first appeared in contemporary sources since 1291, alongside his brothers, on the occasion of their father's trial against his brother Farkas over landholding matters, regarding the Sz√©cs√©ny lordship. In addition, the brothers also filed a lawsuit against their mother's family to gain her rightful heritage, the so-called \\"daughter's quarta\\" (). As a result, they acquired the villages of Hal√°szi and Gal√°bocs (today Glabu≈°ovce, Slovakia) in 1297. The young Simon served as chancellor of the stewards in the court of Queen Fenenna of Kuyavia in October 1295. Life and career As almost his whole kinship, Simon served as a familiaris of Matthew Cs√°k, the powerful oligarch, who ruled de facto independently the north-western counties of the kingdom, including N√≥gr√°d and Hont counties, where the ancient estates of the Kacsics clan had laid. Only Simon's cousin Thomas supported King Charles I's efforts to defeat the oligarchs, as a result he lost all of his fortune and became penniless, and he could hope the recovery of his lost family landholdings and castles only from a successful restoration of the strong royal power by Charles. On 10 November 1308, Simon was one of the signatories of the treaty of K√©kes, when papal legate Gentile Portino da Montefiore persuaded Matthew Cs√°k to accept Charles's rule. After Matthew Cs√°k turned against the monarch in the following year, Simon launched massive attacks against the Diocese of Nyitra in order to expand their influence. Around October 1313, he besieged and captured Nyitra Castle on behalf of Cs√°k, causing serious damage in the walls. He handed over the fort to his lord thereafter. Following that he was appointed castellan of Nyitra, was mentioned in that capacity on 24 June 1317. Subsequently, Simon plundered and looted the surrounding episcopal estates and villages. Simon Kacsics besieged and captured Nitra Castle (today in Slovakia) around 1313 However Simon turned on his feudal lord by the following months and joined Charles' partisans, just before the siege of Kom√°rom (today Kom√°rno, Slovakia), when the royal army had captured the fort on 3 November 1317. Simon recognized good sense of pace that the king would sooner or later will overcome the oligarchs, thus he was able to preserve his influence and landholdings successfully, supporting his cousin Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi's growing power. Soon, they were jointly sent to the Kingdom of Bohemia as representants of Charles, in addition to an interpreter Stephen S√°f√°r, in order to find a bride for the king (whose wife Maria of Bytom had died in December 1317). There they chose Beatrice of Luxembourg. Despite his oath of loyalty to Charles, John III, Bishop of Nyitra, who had been earlier impaired and expelled by Matthew Cs√°k's violent actions, excommunicated the oligarch's five former familiares, including Simon, on 3 March 1318. The prelate recalled that after the seizure of Nyitra Castle and destroying several episcopal villages, Simon loudly abused and intended to stab John with a sword in the presence of Matthew Cs√°k, but the powerful oligarch prevented him by his admonition. Thereafter, Simon blasphemed the bishop. According to another document from that period, Matthew Cs√°k plundered Simon's nearby villages and lands, as a revenge for his betrayal. After Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi was granted large-scale domains in Transylvania, his cousin's career gradually also drifted to the eastern province of the kingdom. In the spring of 1319, Simon was made isp√°n of Krass√≥ County and castellan (with the title isp√°n) of the Mez≈ësomly√≥ royal household (today near »òemlacu Mare, Romania). He held both dignities until 15 September 1325. After his appointment, Simon took part in the royal campaign against the rebellious lord Mojs √Åkos at the end of the year. Thus he received land donations in Transylvania. Since 1320, he was also mentioned as head of the Saxon districts of Mediasch and Bistritz (now Media»ô and Bistri»õa in Romania). Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi was appointed Voivode of Transylvania in July 1321, and was entrusted with the task of suppression of the revolt of the late Ladislaus K√°n's sons. In the same time, Simon elevated to the position of Count of the Sz√©kelys, to strengthen his cousin's efforts to restore order in the province. Since then, the counts of Sz√©kelys were almost continuously also the rulers of the Saxons of Bistritz, lasted until 1453. About three months later, Sz√©cs√©nyi (possibly with the assistance of Simon) seized Csics√≥ (present-day Ciceu- Corabia in Romania), the last fortress of the K√°n kindred. On 20 April 1322, Voivode Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi, Count Simon Kacsics and Bishop Andrew Sz√©csi jointly convened a general assembly to Keresztes (today a borough in Turda, Romania), demonstrating the province's successful consolidation. In May, Simon also inherited the estates of his brother-in-law Reynold K√∂k√©nyesradn√≥t, who was dead by then. His brother Peter was granted the land of √ñlyves in the same time. Simon last appeared as Count of the Sz√©kelys on 4 June 1327, when he was a member of an ad litem court led by Judge royal Alexander K√∂cski, which made a judgment on a case of ownership of Alvinc (today Vin»õu de Jos, Romania) in favour of the Esztergom Chapter against the Sz√©kelys of Aranyos Seat. However, soon, Simon's career turned into downfall: as a royal diploma from 9 October 1338 narrates, he was dismissed (in 1327 or 1328) from his dignity, because he had committed \\"serious crimes\\" and his confiscated land of R√≥na was granted by Sz√©cs√©nyi. After 4 June 1327, Simon Kacsics disappeared from sources, his fate is unknown. He was succeeded by Lack Herm√°n as Count of the Sz√©kelys by 21 September 1328.

Marlon James wrote that it was \\"essential\\" and \\"begging to be written\\". Synopsis The book explores the links between gender, class and race in Britain and other countries. The book begins with a summary of the experience of Black and Asian people in the UK, including the Atlantic slave trade, Indian soldiers in World War I, the Bristol Bus Boycott, the 1981 riots and Labour Party Black Sections. The book also covers institutional racism in British society, white feminism, and definitions of class which only include white people. Reviews Trevor Phillips reviewed the work for The Times. In The Times Literary Supplement, Bernardine Evaristo described the book's title as \\"gloriously provocative\\", noting that it was \\"marketing gold\\" in the climate surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement. Evaristo described the work as \\"timely and accessible\\", \\"comprehensive and journalistic\\" as well as \\"resolutely unacademic\\", comparing it to the work of African-American writer Roxane Gay, whose 2014 anthology Bad Feminist \\"treads some of the same ground\\". However, she critiques Eddo-Lodge for not engaging in enough \\"rigorous research, particularly into the past\\" and for the fact that she \\"completely overlooks\\" the work of Black British feminist writers like Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe. Evaristo also noted that the book leaves open further questions, such as \\"What is the responsibility of black people in creating change for ourselves? Without also taking responsibility, we are dependent and powerless. What about the numerous positive developments since Windrush?\\" Arifa Akbar reviewed the work for the Financial Times, noting that Eddo-Lodge \\"builds on a critical tradition drawn from black American writers\\" like W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and bell hooks. Akbar notes that \\"Not everyone will find the answer to racial inequality in Eddo-Lodge's reliance on white consciousness-raising, but it is an important shift that undermines the idea that racism is the BAME community's burden to carry. The liberation that this book offers is in the reversal of responsibilities.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Colin Grant places the book within a wider tradition of \\"angry warnings to an ignorant white readership\\", the majority of which have been produced by African-American rather than Black British writers. Grant opined that \\"Eddo-Lodge accurately takes the temperature of racial discussions in the UK\\" but that several sections, such as its discussion of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, are too brief, stating that \\"this kind of book is not designed to delve beyond the headlines in order to draw lessons from the past\\". https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/03/why-no-long-talking-white- people-review-race-reni-eddo-lodge-racism Alison flood (author)Alison Flood https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood] states \\"Eddo-Lodge‚Äôs book is a confrontation of racism in Britain\\" and \\"Why I‚Äôm No Longer Talking to White People About Race has been named the most influential book written by a woman\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/reni-eddo-lodge-poll-most- influential-women-why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race Reviewing the work for NPR, the journalist Silvia Vi√±as stated that the work's \\"boldness\\" and \\"straight talk\\" is what makes it \\"memorable\\", also noting that while focusing \\"on events in Britain, it's still accessible to readers of black American history.\\" Sales Following the killing of George Floyd, the book became the first by a black British author to reach No. 1 on the Nielsen BookScan‚Äôs UK top 50 book sales chart.The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/16/reni-eddo-lodge-first-black- british-author-top-uk-book-charts-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people- about-race Cover On the cover, the text \\"to White People\\" appears in white text on the white background, making it invisible from a distance.

He is best known for his role in introducing rice to America as a staple crop and export commodity. History Thurber is primarily known for what may be an apocryphal event. In 1685 he was on a return voyage from Madagascar when his ship was damaged in a storm and blown off course. He put into Charleston for repairs where he met local doctor and explorer Henry Woodward. In exchange for Woodward‚Äôs hospitality and assistance, Thurber gave him a bag of seed rice from Madagascar. Woodward planted the rice, which flourished so well in the marshy Carolina soil that its production astounded the colonists. Within a few years rice became the colony‚Äôs primary crop and remained so into the modern era. Historians debate whether the story is true and point to other earlier introductions of rice to the area (‚ÄúThis has sparked the popular misconception that pirates brought Malagasay rice to the Americas.‚Äù), as well as analyses of rice cultivars pointing to West African rather than Malagasay origins. The story of Thurber‚Äôs involvement persists, and sparked a dramatic fictionalized account involving a stowaway and a doomed romance. In 1687 near Campeche he encountered pirate John Coxon, who forced him to take aboard several Indians, whom he ferried to New Providence until they could be returned to Jamaica. Thurber was named among other pirates such as Christopher Goffe and Thomas Woolerly who used islands in the Bahamas for water and supplies. His name also appears as a witness on New York merchant Andrew Browne‚Äôs deed that same year. Continuing his slave-trading voyages to Madagascar, he worked with another New York merchant, Frederick Philipse. He made a supply run in 1693 in Philipse‚Äôs 200-ton, 10-gun, 30-man brigantine Charles to Adam Baldridge‚Äôs pirate trading post at Ile ste Marie off Madacasgar, bringing in general goods and returning with slaves. Baldridge kept extensive logs of his trade deals: ‚ÄúAugust 7th 1693. Arrived the Ship Charles, John Churcher master, from New York, Mr. Fred. Phillips, owner, sent to bring me severall sorts of goods. She had two Cargos in her, one Consigned to said Master to dispose of, and one to me, containing as followeth: 44 paire of shooes and pumps, 6 Dozen of worsted and threed stockens, 3 dozen of speckled shirts and Breaches, 12 hatts, some Carpenters Tools, 5 Barrells of Rum, four Quarter Caskes of Madera Wine, ten Cases of Spirits, Two old Stills full of hols, one worme, Two Grindstones, Two Cross Sawes and one Whip saw, three Jarrs of oyle, two small Iron Potts, three Barrells of Cannon powder, some books, Catechisms, primers and horne books, two Bibles, and some garden Seeds, three Dozen of howes, and I returned for the said goods 1100 pieces 8/8 and Dollers, 34 Slaves, 15 head of Cattel, 57 bars of Iron.

Ahrens, n√©e Jones (December 29, 1836 ‚Äì ?), was an English-born American teacher, lawyer, and social reformer. Family and education Born Mary A. Jones in Staffordshire, England, she was the daughter of William H. Jones, a clergyman, and Ann (Brown) Jones. When she was fifteen, the family moved to America and settled in Southern Illinois. She was married twice. In 1857 she married Philip Fellows, with whom she had two sons and a daughter. After raising her children, Ahrens taught newly emancipated black Americans. In 1886, she married Louis Ahrens, a lawyer and artist. Career Not long into her second marriage, Ahrens decided to study law. She enrolled in the Chicago Union College of Law, graduating with honors in 1889. Her primary clients were women and children and the poor. She gained national prominence as part of a growing cadre of women lawyers. When the federal court of appeals was established in 1891, Ahrens was the only woman in the first class of 33 lawyers to be admitted to practice before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. One newspaper described her as a \\"shining light\\" in Chicago who \\"possesses unquestioned legal learning and ability eloquence and a distinguished manner.\\" Burnishing her reputation, she contracted a life- threatening case of pneumonia after braving a snow storm to timely file court documents, and her recovery was watched and reported in the press. Ahrens was a dedicated advocate for women's suffrage, pursuing this goal through lectures, lawsuits, and civic engagement. She served as chair of the Woman's School Suffrage Association of Cook County She is credited with helping to open school elections to Illinois women. On June 19, 1891, the General Assembly gave women the power to vote in school elections, this seen as a strategic first step towards full suffrage. However, just before the November election, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners ruled that the law did not apply to any office listed in the state's constitution. Ahrens sued for the right to cast a ballot for the Cook County superintendent of schools. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled against her, finding that the state legislature lacked the authority to enfranchise women when the state's constitution limited voters to male citizens over the age of 21 or those who could vote prior to statehood in 1848.People ex rel. Ahrens v. English, 139 Ill. 622, Supreme Court of Illinois, January 18, 1892. In another case, the Illinois Supreme Court clarified that women could vote in school elections where the office was not in the state constitution, such as a city board. In the next election cycle Ahrens ran for University Trustee in 1894, but was defeated by Lucy Flower for the honor of being the first Illinois woman to hold statewide office. Ahrens continued to advocate for women touring with a lecture entitled \\"Women's Disability Before the Law\\" based on a paper prepared for the Illinois Women's Press Association in 1892. The publication discussed the common law concept of coverture in lay terms, explaining a husband's lawful authority to sell any of his wife's possessions, remove children from her care or restrain her movement to the home. She concluded for her audiences that only legislation would provide legal protections to women. In addition to the law and suffrage, Ahrens was active in social services. In 1890, she became the founding president of the Chicago Immediate Aid Society, which opened a relief station offering meals and lodging to homeless men as well as helping them find work. Recognizing a similar need among women, in early 1894 she founded the Mary A. Ahrens Mission, a home for destitute women in Chicago at 48 Peck Court. The mission house moved to 1324 Indiana, an area called \\"The Patch\\", after an Easter donation by F.H. Cooper on land owned by the Garret Biblical Institute. She was vice-president of the Protective Agency for Women and Children, and vice-president of the Illinois Women's Press Association. Her date of death is uncertain, but she was alive when her husband Louis died in October 1907.

She became a well-known female doctor during a period when it was rare for women to become doctors. Background Palma Formica grew up in Italy in a traditional family. From an early age, Palma showed an interest in medicine. Following her passion, she pursued higher education to become a doctor. She applied to universities in the United States of America in the early 1960s; however, she remained in Italy to attend the University of Rome. As Palma was not only a Roman Catholic but also a woman, it was difficult for her to get accepted into American institutions due to their quotas at the time. Later, she married and had three children.  Career  Palma Formica began her career in internal medicine, but later switched to family medicine. She also advises on vaccinations in The Little Sting that Could Save your Life, specifically Hepatitis B. She opened her own practice in Old Bridge, New Jersey. She then became a professor of clinical and family medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School of New Jersey. She co-founded the family practice residency program at Saint Peter's University Hospital where she is the Chair of Department of Family Practice. She was nominated by representative Frank Pauline Jr., she got her medical degree from University of Rome, College of Medicine. She got her first internship and residency at Queens General Hospital. She firmly believes the basis for credentialing should be \\"competence, training, clinical experience and quality of care\\".  Accomplishments  She received the Benemerenti Medal, awarded by Pope John Paul II and the New Jersey's Pioneer Women in Medicine Award. She was the first woman president of the Middlesex Medical Society of New Jersey in 1977, the first woman chair of the Department of Family Practice at Saint Peter's University Hospital in 1979. She cofounded the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at St. Peter's University Hospital in 1980. In 1984 she ran for trustee of American Medical Association (AMA), however she did not get elected. She admits that running in 1984 was a bad decision because she was a young delegate and did not have enough experience to gain enough votes. In 1990, she ran again and became a member of AMA Board of Trustees. Holding this position for nine years, she was a leader in women's issues.

Richard Gimbel Dies at 71; Flier Was Yale Library Curator\\" May 28, 1970 Biography Gimbel was born July 26, 1898, in Atlantic City, the son of Minnie (n√©e Mastbaum) and Ellis A. Gimbel. His father was chairman of the board at the Gimbel Brothers Company which his grandfather, Adam Gimbel, founded in Vincennes, Indiana in 1842. His mother was the sister of theatre owner Jules Mastbaum who was married to Etta Wedell Mastbaum. Gimbel studied in Europe and graduated with a B.A. from Yale University with honors in 1920. He served with the 310th Field Artillery Regiment during World War I rising from private to first lieutenant. After taking a year off to travel the world, Gimbel worked for his family's business overseeing the construction of their Philadelphia store in 1927 and then as a vice president of Gimbel Brothers Company. In 1935, he left Gimbel Brothers after a dispute with his cousin Bernard Gimbel over strategy and moved to Miami where he profitably ran a Richards store. In 1940, he joined the Army Air Corp as a lieutenant colonel and with the Eighth Air Force as a pilot during World War II. In 1951, he was appointed Professor of Air Science and Tactics at Yale University. In 1953, he retired as full colonel in 1953 and stayed with the library as curator of aeronautical literature. He was also a fellow of Pierson College. Book collection In 1942, during the London blitz, he visited a bombed‚Äêout bookstore in London and purchased a trunk of aeronautical books. Thereafter, he was a voracious collector of books, specializing in Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, and Thomas Paine in addition to anything aeronautical. He purchased the Philadelphia home of Edgar Allan Poe, filled it with his non-aeronautical collection, and presented it to the city of Philadelphia as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Upon his death, he had over 100,000 items in his aeronautical collection. Personal life Gimbel was married to Julia de Fernex Millhiser.

It is found on coral reefs in the tropical Indo- Pacific region. Description E. godeffroyi is a long, slender sea cucumber growing to a length of about . A ring of fifteen feathery tentacles encircle the mouth. The body colour is creamy white with blotches of grey and a pair of longitudinal brown or greenish stripes. The spicules (microscopic calcareous structures that project through the skin) are a mixture of anchors and perforated plates with large holes. Distribution and habitat E. godeffroyi is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea and Madagascar to Hawaii and Easter Island, and includes Indonesia, the Philippines, northern Australia and New Caledonia. It occurs at depths down to about in tidal pools, among stones and on sand. It also occurs among rubble on the upper parts and slopes of reefs. Ecology E. godeffroyi E. godeffroyi is nocturnal and is a deposit feeder. It spends the day hidden among the rubble and corals. It emerges at night, crawling along using its anchor spicules for adhesion, and extending its tentacles onto the sediment which sticks to them; food particles are passed to the mouth where they are scraped off. The sea cucumber selects the more nutritious particles it finds and consumes several times its bodyweight each day.

Opened in 1962 as Seminary South and later known as Fort Worth Town Center, it was reinvented as a center catering to largely Hispanic clientele after losing most of its major stores. Major tenants include Burlington, Ross Dress for Less, Bealls Clearance Center, and El Mercado. History The center opened for business on March 14, 1962 as Seminary South Shopping Center. It was the first mall built by Homart Development Company, the former retail and shopping mall arm of Sears,(\\"Seminary South was the first shopping center developed by Homart Development\\") and the first mall in Fort Worth. Its original tenants included Sears, G. C. Murphy, and Stripling's department store. Other major tenants included Buddies supermarket (later Winn Dixie), Finger Furniture, and a seven-story office tower. J. C. Penney was added in 1964, and Dillard's joined in 1977. Texas Centers bought the building from Homart in 1985 and announced renovation plans, including enclosure of the formerly open-air concourses. In 1974, the Fort Worth Missing Trio were last seen here. The Stripling's store was later renamed Stripling & Cox before closing in 1989. Around this point, the mall began losing traffic and tenants to other centers in the area, such as Ridgmar Mall and Hulen Mall. Despite the loss of stores, a movie theater and food court were added, the latter replacing G. C. Murphy. As a result of declining traffic, J. C. Penney closed in 1997, followed by Sears and Dillard's, leaving the mall without an anchor store. In 2004, Legaspi bought the property, which at the time had only a 10 percent occupancy rate. The new owners reinvented the property to cater to a largely Hispanic clientele, including the addition of El Mercado, a market for local vendors, in the former Dillard's space. Burlington and Ross Dress for Less replaced the Sears space.

For more than a quarter of a century, she was professor of ancient languages at Simpson College in Iowa, and she also taught at Lake Erie College in Ohio. Biography Baker was born in New Rochelle, Illinois, one of six children of Mary Catherine (Ridley) Baker and Orlando Harrison Baker, who were both teachers and linguists. They gave her early instruction in languages, for which she had a distinct aptitude. By the time she was four, she was being regularly tutored in Greek, Latin, and French as well as learning English, her native tongue. She later picked up German as well. By the time she was eight, she had read substantial portions of the works of Xenophon, Homer, and Virgil in the original languages. Around 1870, the family moved to Algona, Iowa, where she subsequently enrolled at Algona College. In 1878, at the age of 16, she was hired as a tutor of Greek at Simpson College in Indianola, a precocious achievement that was remarked on in newspapers across the country. At 18, she published an original translation of Plato's Apology, which was commended by eminent Greek scholars. In 1881 she enrolled in Cornell College, Iowa, graduating with an A.B. degree in one year. She enrolled in DePauw University in 1886, taking courses in Greek, German, French, and music. After two years of study, during which she also worked as tutor of Greek, she received an A.M. degree. She was immediately hired as an instructor of Latin but stayed for only one year, moving away in 1889 to take up the chair of ancient languages at Simpson College that her father had held twenty years earlier. She held the post for more than a quarter of a century. She left Simpson College in 1919 to take up the position of professor of Latin and Greek at Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio. Little is known of her life beyond this point, apart from the fact that she was still listed as a faculty member at Lake Erie College in 1922.

Officically released on CD and DVD by Warner Music on June 3, 2014, the album chronicles the singer's first concert tour Show das Poderosas Tour. One day prior to the CD and DVD release, the album was made available in digital format, alongside Anitta's second studio album Ritmo Perfeito, which contains studio versions of the then unreleased songs, \\"Na Batida\\", \\"Ritmo Perfeito\\", \\"M√∫sica de Amor\\", \\"Cobertor\\", \\"Mulher\\", \\"No Meu Talento\\", \\"Bl√° Bl√° Bl√°\\", \\"Quem Sabe\\" e \\"Vai e Volta\\", performed on the live presentation. In Brazil, the DVD was certified platinum for shipment of over 100,000 copies. Concept The show plays with duality, through the concept \\"Heaven and Hell\\". In this way, the presentation begins set in hell and will advance to the sky. This trajectory will be marked by the use of colors, since in the first part, colors like gray and purple will prevail, as you walk towards the sky, you will become white and pink. Concept already done by the singer Wanessa in its album DNA Tour released in 2013. To tell the story, Anitta and the directors used the Greek mythology of the Pandora's Box and the Cirque du Soleil shows, which always exploit playful, visually appealing and entertaining themes. The show features a character who will be the narrator of this adventure lived by Carlos Marcio Moreira, a Cirque du Soleil dancer who gives life to the three characters: death gravedigger, a filmmaker, and an angel who opens the door to heaven. The scene that characterizes the hell brings influences of the sourly universe of the medieval epochs and irreverence and \\"strong inks\\" of a reference the style of filmmaker Tim Burton, with the use of colors and exaggerated figures that resemble the work of the filmmaker. Modern graphic features are also present, such as mapped projection, LED panels next to these old references, giving the show an almost theatrical tone.

Th√©r√®se is very protective of Denise and becomes concerned when her sister strikes up an acquaintance with Max, a young amateur boxer and garage mechanic. Max is a self-centered, amoral drifter who is conducting numerous different relationships with girls at nightclubs. He is also pursuing Ir√®ne Faugeret, a wealthy married woman, managing to get employment as her chauffeur and become her lover. Max strikes up a friendship of sorts with Biquet, a bellhop at the H√¥tel Carlton who acts as Max's eyes and ears, especially as concerns Madame Faugeret. Denise is attracted to Max, but after a chance meeting at the hotel he sexually assaults her. A distraught Denise attempts to drown herself, and is only narrowly saved from suicide. After she has recovered, Th√©r√®se blackmails Max into getting engaged to Denise by threatening to reveal the circumstances to the police who are already investigating Max for the death in an automobile accident of Ir√®ne, his wealthy lover. Max was responsible for Ir√®ne Faugeret's death as he had loosened three screws on her car's steering column. Max did not expect her to use the car the night of the fatal accident. He expected Biquet would use it instead, part of their scheme to steal Ir√®ne's money and then flee to Tangiers to start a new life. Max was hoping to double-cross Biquet. Instead, he caused Ir√®ne Faugeret's death. Denise is delighted and optimistic about the future. However, Th√©r√®se remains contemptuous of her future brother-in-law. Max tries to persuade Th√©r√®se that he has fallen in love with her and attempts to seduce her. She rejects his advances, but it remains unclear to what extent she is attracted to him. Max tries to persuade her to run away with him to Tangiers where they can start a new life together. The sincerity of his actions remains in doubt even up to the moment when, having absconded with Denise's dowry and Th√©r√®se's passport, he is killed by a train while trying to board it in order to complete his rendezvous with Th√©r√®se. Philosophically accepting this turn of events, she returns to her convent to become a nun.

After the war On 1 February 1918, a French soldier was repatriated from Germany and arrived at the Gare des Brotteaux in Lyon, suffering from amnesia and lacking military or civil identification documents. When questioned, he gave a name that sounded something like Anthelme Mangin, and this became the name by which he is known to history. He was diagnosed with dementia praecox and placed in an asylum in Clermont-Ferrand. In January 1920 Le Petit Parisien published a front-page feature with photos of several asylum patients, including Mangin, in the hope that their families would recognize them. The Mazenc family of Rodez claimed that he was their son and brother Albert, who disappeared in Tahure in 1915. He was therefore transferred to the asylum in Rodez and confronted with various pre-war friends and acquaintances, none of whom recognized him. Anthropological records revealed several differences between Albert Mazenc and Mangin, including a difference of 10 cm in height. In 1922 the Ministry of Pensions published Mangin's photo in the hope of identifying him. Several dozen families responded to the photo. After a lengthy investigation by the psychiatrists at the Rodez asylum, only two claimants seemed plausible: Lucie Lemay, who claimed the man as her missing husband, and Pierre Monjoin, who claimed him as his son. In 1934 Anthelme was taken on a visit to Saint-Maur, Indre, the home of Pierre Monjoin, and permitted to walk around the village.The Living Unknown Soldier, Bl√¢mont.info (page devoted to Anthelme Mangin, containing numerous press clippings from the period.) Starting at the railway station, Mangin walked unaccompanied to the Monjoin family home, though he did not acknowledge the old man. He noted the changed appearance of the village church, whose steeple had been struck by lightning during his absence. The authorities determined that he was Monjoin's son, but an appeal lodged by the Lemay family prolonged the case for some time. The asylum tribunal ruled on the man's identity in 1938, and remanded him to the custody of his father and brother. However, by this time both had died. He therefore spent the rest of his life in the Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital in Paris, where he died on 19 September 1942, apparently of malnutrition. He was buried in a common grave. In 1948 his remains were transferred to the cemetery of Saint-Maur-en-Indre and buried under the name Octave Monjoin. In popular culture The story of Anthelme Mangin/Octave Monjoin inspired at least two works of fiction: Jean Giraudoux's Siegfried et le Limousin (1922) and Jean Anouilh's Le Voyageur sans bagage (1937). In 2004 Mangin was the subject of a TV documentary by Jo√´l Calmettes titled Le Soldat inconnu vivant (\\"The Living Unknown Soldier\\"). Mangin was the subject of a 2016 episode of the Futility Closet Podcast.

It was founded in 1894 and is affiliated with the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC). The KFWC helped bring about various reforms in Kentucky and expanded educational opportunities to citizens.  About  Cornelia O. Hansford, past president of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs. The Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs (KFWC) was created in July 1894, when several women met in Lexington to form the group. It was the fourth state federation of women's clubs to become affiliated with the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC). The club has held annual meetings since the first one in 1985 at Richmond. By 1898, the KFWC had thirty clubs it represented throughout the state. In 1909, there were 85 different organizations in the KFWC. By 1921, there were 150 clubs and around 16,000 individual clubwomen. These women were white and were generally upper-class to middle class. KFWC has been headquartered in Louisville since 1954. Prior to the creation of the club building, important papers for the KFWC had traveled with the president of the organization. The group has recently changed its name to the General Federation of Women's Clubs Kentucky. The organization's current departments are education, art, conservation, home life, international affairs and public affairs.  Reform efforts  One of the first projects the KFWC was involved with was to work on education through libraries. The KFWC took over operations of the traveling library that had been started by the Louisville Monday Afternoon Club in 1887. In 1910, after the KFWC persuaded the state to create a public organization for libraries, the traveling and public libraries in Kentucky were turned over to the new Kentucky Library Commission. Later, the KFWC helped provide books for the pack horse libraries in the late 1930s. KFWC was involved in reforming the school system in Kentucky. In the early 1900s, there was no compulsory education in Kentucky and a high rate of illiteracy. The education committee of the KFWC created reports on the status of Kentucky's education system. These reports were shared with newspapers and used to influence citizens and politicians. In 1908, legislation was finally passed to support schools financially in Kentucky. By 1909, KFWC was urging citizens to vote for women to serve on school boards. KFWC was involved in conservation of natural land. KFWC was involved in preserving Mammoth Caves. Members on the conservation committee have spoken out against strip mining in Kentucky. KFWC helped to establish the Kentucky Society for the Prevention of Blindness. They were also involved with backing the creation of the Frontier Nursing Service. KFWC was also involved in the fight for women's suffrage.

Marshall, with 43.52% of the popular vote, against the 26th president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt (P‚ÄìNY), running with governor of California Hiram Johnson, with 29.29% of the popular vote, the five-time candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States Eugene V. Debs (S‚ÄìIN), running with the first Socialist mayor of a major city in the United States Emil Seidel, with 13.33% of the popular vote and the 27th president of the United States William Howard Taft (R‚ÄìOH), running with Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler, with 12.74% of the popular vote. Arizona was one of the states where the sitting president William Howard Taft came in fourth due to his low approval ratings and the Republican vote being divided between him and Theodore Roosevelt. Over one century later, Roosevelt's 29.29% remains the best-ever third-party presidential performance in Arizona.Thomas, G.

It achieves excellent statistical performance with small and fast code, and small state size. A PCG differs from a classical linear congruential generator in three ways: * the LCG modulus and state is larger, usually twice the size of the desired output, * it uses a power-of-2 modulus, which results in a particularly efficient implementation with a full period generator and unbiased output bits, and * the state is not output directly, but rather the most significant bits of the state are used to select a bitwise rotation or shift which is applied to the state to produce the output. It is the variable rotation which eliminates the problem of a short period in the low-order bits that power-of-2 LCGs suffer from.  Variants  The PCG family includes a number of variants. The core LCG is defined for widths from 8 to 128 bits, although only 64 and 128 bits are recommended for practical use; smaller sizes are for statistical tests of the technique. The additive constant in the LCG can be varied to produce different streams. The constant is an arbitrary odd integer, so it does not need to be stored explicitly; the address of the state variable itself (with the low bit set) can be used. There are several different output transformations defined. All perform well, but some have a larger margin than others. They are built from the following components: * RR: A random (input-dependent) rotation, with output half the size of input. Given a 2b-bit input word, the top b‚àí1 bits are used for the rotate amount, the next-most-significant 2b‚àí1 bits are rotated right and used as the output, and the low 2b‚àí1+1‚àíb bits are discarded. * RS: A random (input-dependent) shift, for cases where rotates are more expensive. Again, the output is half the size of the input. Beginning with a 2b-bit input word, the top b‚àí3 bits are used for a shift amount, which is applied to the next-most-significant 2b‚àí1+2b‚àí3‚àí1 bits, and the least significant 2b‚àí1 bits of the result are output. The low 2b‚àí1‚àí2b‚àí3‚àíb+4 bits are discarded. * XSH: An xorshift operation, \`x ^= x >> constant\`. The constant is chosen to be half of the bits not discarded by the next operation (rounded down). * XSL: A simplified version of xorshift, folding the value in half by XORing the high half into the low. The folded value is used for subsequent rotations. * RXS: An xorshift by a random (input- dependent) amount. * M: A multiply by a fixed constant. These are combined into the following recommended output transformations, illustrated here in their most common sizes: * XSH-RR: An xorshift mixes some high-order bits down, then bits 63‚Äì59 select a rotate amount to be applied to bits 27‚Äì58. *: (64‚Üí32 bits) \`count = (int)(x >> 59); x ^= x >> 18; return rotr32((uint32_t)(x >> 27), count);\`. * XSH-RS: Similar, but fewer bits select the shift amount. *: (64‚Üí32 bits) \`count = (int)(x >> 61); x ^= x >> 22; return (uint32_t)(x >> (29 - count));\`. * XSL-RR: A simplified version of XSH-RR, this is optimized for 128-bit states implemented using two words on 64-bit machines. *: (128‚Üí64 bits) \`count = (int)(x >> 122); x64 = (uint64_t)(x ^ (x >> 64)); return rotr64(x64, count);\` * RXS-M-XS: The slowest and strongest output transformation when used to produce half-size output, this becomes the weakest when used as intended, to produce an output the same size as the state. For use when the state size must be limited to 32 or 64 bits. *: (32‚Üí32 bits) \`count=(int)(x >> 28); x ^= x >> (4 + count); x *= 277803737u; return x ^ (x >> 22);\` *: (64‚Üí64 bits) \`count=(int)(x >> 59); x ^= x >> (5 + count); x *= 12605985483714917081u; return x ^ (x >> 43);\` * XSL-RR-RR: Similar to the preceding, this turns 128 bits of state into 128 bits of output, when the application demands it. *: (128‚Üí128 bits) \`count = (int)(x >> 122); low64 = rotr64((uint64_t)(x ^ (x >> 64)), count); high64 = rotr((uint64_t)(x >> 64), low64 & 63); return (uint128_t)high64 << 64  low64;\` Each step of these output transformations is either invertible (and thus one-to-one) or a truncation, so their composition maps the same fixed number of input states to each output value. This preserves the equidistribution of the underlying LCG. Finally, if a cycle length longer than 2128 is required, the generator can be extended with an array of sub-generators. One is chosen (in rotation) to be added to the main generator's output, and every time the main generator's state reaches zero, the sub-generators are cycled in a pattern which provides a period exponential in the total state size.  Example code  The generator recommended for most users is PCG-XSH-RR with 64-bit state and 32-bit output. It can be implemented as: #include static uint64_t state = 0x4d595df4d0f33173; // Or something seed-dependent static uint64_t const multiplier = 6364136223846793005u; static uint64_t const increment = 1442695040888963407u; // Or an arbitrary odd constant static uint32_t rotr32(uint32_t x, unsigned r) { return x >> r  x << (-r & 31); } uint32_t pcg32(void) { uint64_t x = state; unsigned count = (unsigned)(x >> 59); // 59 = 64 - 5 state = x * multiplier + increment; x ^= x >> 18; // 18 = (64 - 27)/2 return rotr32((uint32_t)(x >> 27), count); // 27 = 32 - 5 } void pcg32_init(uint64_t seed) { state = seed + increment; (void)pcg32(); } The generator applies the output transformation to the initial state rather than the final state in order to increase the available instruction-level parallelism to maximize performance on modern superscalar processors. A slightly faster version eliminates the increment, reducing the LCG to a multiplicative (Lehmer-style) generator with a period of only 262, and uses the weaker XSH-RS output function: static uint64_t mcg_state = 0xcafef00dd15ea5e5u; // Must be odd uint32_t pcg32_fast(void) { uint64_t x = mcg_state; unsigned count = (unsigned)(x >> 61); // 61 = 64 - 3 mcg_state = x * multiplier; x ^= x >> 22; return (uint32_t)(x >> (22 + count)); // 22 = 32 - 3 - 7 } void pcg32_fast_init(uint64_t seed) { mcg_state = 2*seed + 1; (void)pcg32_fast(); } The time saving is minimal, as the most expensive operation (the 64√ó64-bit multiply) remains, so the normal version is preferred except in extremis. Still, this faster version also passes statistical tests. When executing on a 32-bit processor, the 64√ó64-bit multiply must be implemented using three 32√ó32‚Üí64-bit multiply operations. To reduce that to two, there are 32-bit multipliers which perform almost as well as the 64-bit one, such as 0xf13283ad, or 0xf2fc5985. Comparison with other pseudorandom number generators  PCG was developed by applying TestU01 to reduced-size variants, and determining the minimum number of internal state bits required to pass BigCrush. BigCrush examines enough data to detect a period of 235, so even an ideal generator requires 36 bits of state to pass it. Some very poor generators can pass if given a large enough state; passing despite a small state is a measure of an algorithm's quality, and shows how large a safety margin exists between that lower limit and the state size used in practical applications. PCG-RXS-M-XS (with 32-bit output) passes BigCrush with 36 bits of state (the minimum possible), PCG-XSH-RR (\`pcg32()\` above) requires 39, and PCG-XSH-RS (\`pcg32_fast()\` above) requires 49 bits of state. For comparison, xorshift*, one of the best of the alternatives, requires 40 bits of state, and Mersenne twister fails despite 19937 bits of state.

He and the horse Sun's Jet Parade won the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration's World Grand Championship in 1957. Thompson was the first president of the Walking Horse Trainers' Association and was later inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame. Life and career Vic Thompson was born in Texas and began training horses in 1939, when his father bought a group of 22 horses to resell. Thompson later moved to Tennessee, where he opened a breeding and training stable in 1951. It was located outside Shelbyville, Tennessee, on the Tullahoma Highway. Thompson was best known for training the stallion Sun's Jet Parade. In 1957 he had entered the horse in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, but the night before the World Grand Championship class, he received a phone call from a neighbor, saying, \\"Vic, your good black stud is running down the highway.\\" Thompson managed to catch Sun's Jet Parade, who had been let out of his stall. The next night the pair won the World Grand Championship. Thompson hoped to repeat his win the next year, and entered the stake again, but was beaten by Setting Sun and Sam Paschal. Thompson was one of the trainers to set up the Sale of Champions, an annual horse auction that takes place during the Celebration every year. When he founded it in the early 1950s, it was held on the Celebration Grounds and only sold horses that were entered in the show. Although he had ridden a World Grand Champion, Thompson's favorite horse was a gelding named Mr. Sensation. He was Reserve World Grand Champion twice, won Gelding World Championships in six consecutive Celebrations, and won over 400 ribbons under Thompson's training. Thompson was influential in starting the Walking Horse Trainers' Association, as well as their first president from 1968 to 1969 and was also known for mentoring young trainers and amateur riders alike. He had relatively high standards, and did not allow riders at his barn to wear shorts, chew gum, or wear their hair loose in case of female riders. If a rider he taught was competing in a horse show and did something wrong, he would whistle loudly at them. His daughter Kathy said, \\"When he whistled you had better be listening\\". Trainers who got started in the horse industry by Thompson include Allan Callaway, Jack Johnson, Joe Martin, and Mack Motes. In 1968 Thompson retired from training and set up a breeding operation called Stallion Stables. The next year Maurice Wilson, a rider he had been mentoring, won the World Grand Championship on the horse Ebony's Senator. Thompson and his wife Marilyn had two daughters, Kathy and Vicki Lynn Thompson. Kathy rode horses as a very young child but quit after an accident in which a horse fell on her. She was sitting beside an arena during the Wartrace Horse Show, and as a horse and rider turned the corner the horse lost his footing and slid down on top of her. Kathy was not seriously harmed but refused to ride again until she was in high school, when someone dared her. After riding on the dare, she began riding often and later competed in some horse shows, including the Celebration. Vic Thompson was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame. He died in 1996.

He designed many buildings in Middlebury and around Vermont. Early life Clinton Smith was born on the homestead farm of his family in the east part of Middlebury, Vermont, on May 6, 1846. He was the oldest son of George Smith and Julia Willmarth. He was descended from those who have been identified with the history of Vermont from the earliest times. His maternal ancestors made a record in the war of the Revolution and the war of 1812. His paternal grandfather came to Middlebury before the true site of the town was determined. His father George Smith will be remembered in Addison County, Vermont, as an educator and contracting builder. Career Shard Villa (1872-1874), 1177 Shard Villa Road, West Salisbury, VT Clinton Smith was the architect and builder of many of the best buildings in Middlebury, Vermont, such as the court house, town hall, Methodist church, Baptist church, Beckwith block, Dyer block and many residences. His first work of consequence was the erection of Shard Villa, the stone residence in Salisbury, Vermont, of Columbus Smith. State Library & Supreme Court (1886), State Street, Montpelier, VT He was widely known throughout the state also in adjacent parts of New Hampshire and New York, as a builder of churches and public buildings, among them the library annex to the Capitol building in Montpelier, Vermont, and the Asylum for the Insane at Waterbury, Vermont. In 1891 he accepted a position in the War Department at Washington, D.C. as Chief of Construction and Repair under Hon. Redfield Proctor, then secretary of War in Harrison's administration, and with his family removed to the Capitol city. He served the government acceptably exactly fourteen years when he resigned his position partly on account of impaired health and partly from a wish to accept another position under Senator Redfield Proctor which offered him outside exercise and air of which so much desk work deprived him. His desk work, however, had been constantly alleviated by long trips to inspect buildings under construction at army posts and reservations in all parts of the United States, thus he became known to a wide circle of friends in every walk of life. His resignation took effect June 1, 1905 and he became one of the incorporators of \\"The Talpin Construction Co.\\", in Washington and began the erection of its first building a large marble apartment house Champlain Apartment Building on K street in that city. This furnished him congenial and absorbing occupation until he was stricken by an alarming illness on July 28, 1905. Two trained nurses and his family attended his bedside. All that medical skill could accomplish was employed in vain. His disease was pronounced typhoid fever of a virulent type. He suffered hemorrhage after hemorrhage yet made a gallant fight for life till weakness prostrated every faculty and he breathed his last on the evening of August 2, 1905. This was his third attack of that dread disease. The first one was at the age of 14 years, the next 10 years later. Each attack was exceptionally severe and heightened by complications. His funeral was attended at his suburban residence \\"Smitholm\\" on August 4, 1905. Personal life Clinton Smith married Alice Matilda \\"Olive\\" White. They had 6 children: Charles Lynn Smith (1869-1875), Clifton Roberts Smith (1878-1923), Delmar White Smith (1874-1949, contracting builder in Manila), Harold Smith (1882-1967), Leon Neil Smith (1889-1936), Helena Mercy Smith (b. 1872) (wife of Prof. Charles J.

Agbor Nkongho was born on August 23, 1970. He is a leading member of the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC) which has been banned and its activities declared illegal in Cameroon. Early life and career Agbor Nkongho is a native from Manyu division, Southwest Region, Cameroon. Popularly known as Agbor-Balla in the ghettos of Great Soppo, Buea where he grew up. He attended CBC Primary School Great Soppo Buea, before moving to Saint Joseph‚Äôs College, Sasse, Buea where he passed the GCE Ordinary Levels in Form Four which was one class before the final year of secondary studies. He went to CCAS Kumba and then to the Musole GCE Evening Classes after he was wrongfully dismissed from CCAS Kumba for subversive writing popularly known as ‚ÄúLavoir‚Äù which challenged was an article challenging abuses and wrong actions by school administrators, this marked his start of activism in his youthful days. Agbor Nkongho described his dismissal as a blessing in an interview, because it got him a meeting with Bate Besong, renowned Anglophone playwright, poet and critic. He studied at the University of Yaound√© I and graduated with (LLB in English Private Law). He also studied at the Nigerian Law School, the Free University of Brussels, the University of Notre Dame and Leipzig University. He worked as a researcher at the Centre for International Law in Belgium, as an assistant legal officer at Sierra Leone International Criminal Court, a human right officer at United Nation office in Afghanistan, and Congo. Arrest On 17 January 2017, it was reported that Balla had been arrested with Fontem Neba who is a university lecturer in Buea by Cameroon‚Äôs police ordered by the government. He was arrested in connection with the Anglophone problem after organizing peaceful protests to protect the culture and rights of the Anglophone Cameroonians in the form of sit down strikes with more than 2000 Anglophone lawyers, Ghost town and shutdown of schools under the banner of the Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC), which was banned and its activities declared illegal few days before his arrest. Charges and military court trial It was reported by multiple sources that Balla and others were charged on eight counts and may face a death penalty for treason, terrorism, civil unrest, jeopardising the peace and unity of the Republic of Cameroon. Balla's trial was to begin on 1 February 2017 and later rescheduled for 13 February. On 23 March, Balla's trial at the Yaounde military court tribunal was adjourned for another hearing on 27 April, and then on 24 May and then 27 July. On 31 August, President Paul Biya issued a presidential decree ordering the Yaounde military court tribunal to release Balla and others in connection with the protest in Northwest and Southwest regions of the country. On 15 April 2015, according to an interview, Balla told journalists in Buea, \\"I am ready to die in defense of Common Law\\". Reaction of International bodies The Law Society of Upper Canada reacted immediately to the arrest and detention of Balla and appealed to the Government of Cameroon to immediately and unconditionally release Balla and to respect the full functions of the lawyer professions without any intimidation. On 27 March 2017, the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organisation urged the Government of Cameroon to immediately release Balla and to drop the charges against him. Professor Sean O‚ÄôBrien, director for International Human Right Law, who taught Balla at the University of Notre Dame, filed a petition to the United Nations Human Rights Council for the immediate release of Balla. Release of Agbor Nkongho On 30 August 2017, through a presidential decree, Balla, Neba Fontem and Paul Abine Ayah were released and all charges against them dropped. Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa said that the decision by the government of Cameroon to release Balla and others was good news for everyone and condemned their arrest in the first place. Agbor Balla continues with his activities for the freedom of southern Cameroons. This has been done via the creation of Tasks Forces to liberate many in jail and He still continues to press on the government of La Republique du Cameroun to liberate all. By his political ideology, he is a believer of a two state federation of equal status in Cameroon as a solution to resolve the Anglophone crisis. A position he has maintained for over 17 years of his endeavours in the fight for the liberation of the Anglophone community in Cameroon.

In contrast to traditional imaging, computational imaging systems involve a tight integration of the sensing system and the computation in order to form the images of interest. The ubiquitous availability of fast computing platforms (such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs), the advances in algorithms and modern sensing hardware is resulting in imaging systems with significantly enhanced capabilities. Computational Imaging systems cover a broad range of applications include computational microscopy, tomographic imaging, MRI, ultrasound imaging, computational photography, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), seismic imaging etc. The integration of the sensing and the computation in computational imaging systems allows for accessing information which was otherwise not possible. For example: * A single X-ray image does not reveal the precise location of fracture, but a CT scan which works by combining multiple X-ray images can determine the precise location of one in 3D * A typical camera image cannot image around corners. However, by designing a set- up that involves sending fast pulses of light, recording the received signal and using a algorithm, researchers have demonstrated the first steps in building such a system. Computational imaging systems also enable system designers to overcome some hardware limitations of optics and sensors (resolution, noise etc.) by overcoming challenges in the computing domain. Some examples of such systems include coherent diffractive imaging, coded- aperture imaging and image super-resolution.  History  Computational imaging systems span a broad range of applications. While applications such as SAR, computed tomography, seismic inversion are well known, they have undergone significant improvements (faster, higher-resolution, lower dose exposures) driven by advances in signal and image processing algorithms (including compressed sensing techniques) and faster computing platforms. Photography has evolved from purely chemical processing to now being able to capture and computationally fuse multiple digital images (computational photography) making techniques such as HDR and panoramic imaging available to most cell-phone users. Computational imaging has also seen an emergence of techniques that modify the light source incident on an object using known structure/patterns and then reconstructing an image from what is received (For example: coded-aperture imaging, super-resolution microscopy, Fourier ptychography). Advances in the development of powerful parallel computing platforms has played a vital role in being able to make advances in computational imaging. Techniques Coded aperture imaging Imaging is usually made at optical wavelengths by lenses and mirrors. However, for X-rays and Gamma-rays, lenses and mirrors are impractical, therefore modulating apertures are often used instead. The pinhole camera is the most basic form of such a modulation imager, but its disadvantage is low throughput, as its small aperture allows through little radiation. Since only a tiny fraction of the light passes through the pinhole, which causes a low signal-to-noise ratio, imaging through pinholes involves unacceptable long exposures. This problem can be overcome to some degree by making the hole larger, which unfortunately leads to a decrease in resolution. Pinhole cameras have a couple of advantages over lenses - they have infinite depth of field, and they don't suffer from chromatic aberration, which can be cured in a refractive system only by using a multiple element lens. The smallest feature which can be resolved by a pinhole is approximately the same size as the pinhole itself. The larger the hole, the more blurred the image becomes. Using multiple, small pinholes might seem to offer a way around this problem, but this gives rise to a confusing montage of overlapping images. Nonetheless, if the pattern of holes is carefully chosen, it is possible to reconstruct the original image with a resolution equal to that of a single hole. In recent years much work has been done using patterns of holes of clear and opaque regions, constituting what is called a coded aperture. The motivation for using coded aperture imaging techniques is to increase the photon collection efficiency whilst maintaining the high angular resolution of a single pinhole. Coded aperture imaging (CAI) is a two-stage imaging process. The coded image is obtained by the convolution of the object with the intensity point spread function (PSF) of the coded aperture. Once the coded picture is formed it has to be decoded to yield the image. This decoding can be performed in three ways, namely correlation, Fresnel diffraction or deconvolution. An estimation of the original image is attained by convolving the coded image with the original coded aperture. In general, the recovered image will be the convolution of the object with the autocorrelation of the coded aperture and will contain artifacts unless its autocorrelation is a delta function. Some examples of coded apertures include the Fresnel zone plate (FZP), random arrays (RA), non-redundant arrays (NRA), uniformly redundant arrays (URA), modified uniformly redundant arrays (MURA), among others. Fresnel zone plates, called after Augustin-Jean Fresnel, may not be considered coded apertures at all since they consist of a set of radially symmetric rings, known as Fresnel zones, which alternate between opaque and transparent. They use diffraction instead of refraction or reflection to focus the light. Light hitting the FZP will diffract around the opaque zones, therefore an image will be created when constructive interference occurs. The opaque and transparent zones can be spaced so that imaging occurs at different focuses. In the early work on coded-apertures, pinholes were randomly distributed on the mask and placed in front of a source to be analyzed. Random patterns, however, pose difficulties with image reconstruction due to a lack of uniformity in pinholes distribution. An inherent noise appears as a result of small terms present in the Fourier transform of large size random binary arrays. This problem was addressed by the development of uniformly redundant arrays (URAs). If the distribution of the transparent and opaque elements of the aperture can be represented as a binary encoding array A and the decoding array as G, then A and G can be chosen such that the reconstructed image (correlation of A and G with an addition of some noise signal N) approximates a delta function. It has experimentally been shown that URAs offer significant improvements to SNR in comparison with randomly distributed arrays, however, the algorithm used for the construction of URAs restricts the shape of the aperture to a rectangle. Therefore, Modified Uniformly Redundant Array (MURA), was introduced with a change to URA's encoding algorithm, enabling new arrays to be created in linear, hexagonal and square configurations. The design method for URAs was modified so that the new arrays were based on quadratic residues rather than pseudo-noise (PN) sequences.  Compressive spectral imaging  Conventional spectral imaging techniques typically scan adjacent zones of the underlying spectral scene and then merge the results to construct a spectral data cube. In contrast, compressive spectral imaging (CSI), which naturally embodies the principles of compressed sensing (CS), involves the acquisition of the spatial-spectral information in 2-dimensional sets of multiplexed projections. The remarkable advantage of compressive spectral imaging is that the entire data cube is sensed with just a few measurements and in some cases with as little as a single FPA snapshot such that the entire data set can be obtained during a single detector integration period. In general, compressive spectral imaging systems exploit different optical phenomena such as spatial, spectral, or spatial-spectral coding and dispersion, to acquire the compressive measurements. The significant advantage behind CSI is that it is possible to design sensing protocols that capture the essential information from sparse signals with a reduced amount of measurements. Because the amount of captured projections is less than the number of voxels in the spectral data cube, the reconstruction process is performed by numerical optimization algorithms. This is the step where computational imaging plays a key role because the power of computational algorithms and mathematics is exploited to recover the underlying data cube. In the CSI literature, different strategies can be encountered to attain the coded projections. The coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) was the first spectral imager designed to take advantage of compressive sensing theory. CASSI employs binary coded apertures that create a transmission pattern at each column, such that these patterns are orthogonal with respect to all other columns. The spatial-spectral projection at the detector array is modulated by the binary mask in such a way that each wavelength of the data cube is affected by a shifted modulation code. More recent CSI systems include the CASSI using colored coded apertures (C-CASSI) instead of the black and white masks; a compact version of the colored CASSI, called snapshot colored compressive spectral imager (SCCSI), and a variation of the latter that uses a black-and-white coded aperture in the convolutional plane, known as the spatial‚Äìspectral encoded hyperspectral imager (SSCSI). Common characteristics of this kind of CSI systems include the use of a dispersive element to decouple the spectral information, and a coding element to encode the incoming data.  Algorithms  While computational imaging covers a broad range of applications, the algorithms used in computational imaging systems are often related to solving a mathematical inverse problem. The algorithms are generally divided into direct inversion techniques which are often \\"fast\\" and iterative reconstruction techniques that are computationally expensive but are able to model more complex physical processes. The typical steps to design algorithms for computational imaging systems are: # Formulating a relationship between the measurements and the quantity to be estimated. This process requires a mathematical model for how the measurements are related to the unknown. For example: In high-dynamic range imaging, the measurements are a sequence of known exposures of the underlying area to be imaged. In an X-ray CT scan, the measurements are X-ray images of the patient obtained from several known positions of the X-ray source and detector camera with a well- established relationship for X-ray propagation. # Choosing a metric to \\"invert\\" the measurements and reconstruct the quantity of interest. This could be a simple metric such as a least-squares difference between the measurements and the model or a more sophisticated metric based on precisely modeling the noise statistics of the detector and a model for the object of interest. This choice can be related to choosing a statistical estimator for the quantity to be reconstructed. # Designing fast and robust algorithms that compute the solution to Step 2. These algorithms often use techniques from mathematical optimization and mapping such methods to fast computing platforms to build practical systems.

She was elected as the first president of the Black People's Convention (BPC), a BCM-affiliated community-based organisation in 1972. Early life Winnie Kgware was born in Thaba Nchu in the Orange Free State in 1917. Growing up in the racially divided Free State, before the institutionalisation of racism through Apartheid, she was politically inclined and encouraged the youth to be active in political structures.Magaziner, D. R. (2011) Pieces of a (Wo)man: Feminism, Gender and Adulthood in Black Consciousness, 1968-1977. Journal of Southern African Studies, V37(1) Heeding her call, the youth formed a branch of the South African Student Movement and established a School Representative Council (SRC) at Hwiti High School, where struggle icon Peter Mokaba was elected SRC President. As a result of this, when he was only 15 years old, Kgware recruited Peter Mokaba to join the underground movement. Mokaba was subsequently expelled from Hwiti High School because of his involvement in the struggle for liberation. After completing his matric as a private candidate, he did not have funds to pursue tertiary education and as such opted to teach mathematics and sciences at a local school. Kgware intervened and assisted her political mentee with funds to study at university, where he enrolled for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Technology. Political life Kgware (then still Winnie Monyatsi) was trained as a teacher and later married Professor WM Kgware, who was appointed the first black rector at the University of the North (Turfloop), where she then took up residence. With the campus being the heart of Black Conscious ideas, Kgware became involved in supporting students in their protests against the Government's restrictions on campus.Moodley, A. (1993) Empowering Women for Gender Equity, No. 16, Violence in Focus, p. 44-48 One of her earliest acts was to organise a Methodist prayer group in defiance of an order that banned students from worshipping on campus. Beyond this, she gave sustenance to the student movement and allowed her and her husband's residence to be used as a meeting place for the University Christian Movement (UCM), an organisation that was banned from the campus at the time. Regardless of the age gap between her and her fellow activists, she played a leading role in the launch of the South African Students‚Äô Organisation (SASO) in 1968, after its breakaway from the UCM, due to discontent by black activists (including Steve Biko) with the UCM's all-white national executive committee.Mngxitama, A. et al (2008) Biko Lives!: Contesting the Legacies of Steve Biko. Palgrave Macmillan In 1972, the Black People's Convention (BPC) had its first national conference in Hammanskraal from 16 to 17 December, with over 1400 delegates in attendance representing 154 groups. At that conference, Winnie Kgware, Madibeng Mokoditoa, Sipho Buthelezi, Mosubudi Mangena and Saths Cooper emerged as president, vice-president, secretary-general, national organiser and public relations officer respectively, making up the inaugural national executive committee of the BPC, an umbrella body of the Black Consciousness Movement then led by Steve Biko.Sesanti, S. (2014) New Agenda: South Africa Journal of Social and Economic Policy, V2014(53), p. 56-58 On 19 October 1977, a few weeks after Steve Biko‚Äôs murder in police custody, 18 BCM- affiliated organisations were banned by the South African government, with BPC amongst these. One incident that stands out in the portrayal of Kgware's sheer determination to render the Apartheid system ungovernable occurred in 1977 when the bus-taking mourners to Steve Biko‚Äôs funeral in Ginsberg, outside of King Williams Town, were stopped by security forces. Kgware, then 66 years old, evaded the police and hitched a lift all the way to King Williams Town to attend Biko's funeral. Some of the lesser-known women with whom Kgware led and served with in the Black Consciousness Movement include Mamphela Ramphele, Deborah Matshoba, Oshadi Mangena, and Nomsizi Kraai. After a long life of teaching and activist work, Kgware died in 1998 at home in North West- Bophuthatswana. Accolades In 1998, the Umtapo Centre in Durban, which claims to be inspired by the philosophy of Black Consciousness and founded in memory of the BCM and AZAPO leader Strini Moodley, awarded the Steve Biko Award to Kgware in recognition of her role in the liberation struggle. Later on, in 2003, then President Thabo Mbeki conferred, post-humously, the Order of Luthuli to Winnie Kgware for outstanding leadership and lifelong commitment to the ideals of democracy, non-racialism, peace and justice.South African History Online/ http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/winnie-kgware See also *South African History Online *Black Consciousness Movement External links *The Presidency *Steve Biko Foundation References 1917 births 1998 deaths South African activists South African women activists South African women in politics 20th-century South African politicians Members of the Order of Luthuli Black Consciousness Movement Apartheid in South Africa Racism in Africa ","title":"Winnie Kgware"},{"id":"55133554","text":"Freedom of religion in Brazil is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.

It has been owned by members of the noble Lerche family since 1853. The main building is from 1856. History Benzonsdal was established by Supreme Court justice Peder Benzon in 1730 from land that had until then belonged to Gjeddesdal. The aim was to secure a more simple and efficient management of the land. Benzon was a major landowner who also established the manors of Benzonseje (now Risbyholm), D√∏nnerup and Gislingeg√•rd. He had previously been the owner of Hagestedgaard and Alslevg√•rd. The new manor comprised 50 tenant farms, 100 smallholdings, a brickyard and four watermills. Carl Adolf von Plessen Peder Benzon's brother, Lars Benzon, bought Benzonsdal from the heirs after Peder Benzon's death in 1735. In 1740, he sold it to a third brother, Jacob Benzon. I 1757, Benzonsdal was acquired Frederik Barfred. He wanted to ensure that the estate would stay in the family and therefore created a so-called stamhus in 1765 with the effect that it could neither be sold, margaged or divided between heirs. Stamhuset Benzonsdal was, however, already dissolved in 1786 and the estate was then sold to his son Jens Laurits Barfred. In 1797, he also purchased Gjeddesdal. In the 1780s, Barfred implemented the tenant farms off to the farmers in accordance with the agricultural reforms of the time. In 1800, he sold the rest of the estate to Niels de Bang and Christian Ulrich Detlev von Eggers. Niels de Bang, who after a while had become the sole owner of Benzonsdal, made a big effort to assist the sick and poor farmers on his estate during an outbreak of dysentery. 1853-present: The Lerche family Benxonsdal's new main building painted by Ferdinand Richardt Count Carl Christian Cornelius Lerche bought Benzonsdal in 1853 and constructed a new main building in 1856. Architecture The main building is from 1856. It consists of two storeys over a high cellar. It is built in yellow brick and has a slate roof.. Estate The house is located in the middle of a scenic garden. A tree-lined avenue leads up to the house. The estate covers 447 hectares of which 38 hectares have been leased. 409 hectares are farmland. Cultural references In the late 1960s, Benzonsdal has been used as a location in two Danish adaptions of The Famous Five novels, De fem og spionerne (1969) and De fem i fedtefadet (1970). It was also used as a location in Thomas Vinterberg's 2013 drama film The Hunt.

Background and vote With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties ‚Äì chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns ‚Äì Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties,Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 208, 210 and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.Springer, Melanie Jean; How the States Shaped the Nation: American Electoral Institutions and Voter Turnout, 1920-2000, p. 155 In 1908 the Republican Party had made some gains in the South due to opposition by developing manufacturers to William Jennings Bryan‚Äôs populism,Tindall, George B.; ‚ÄòSouthern Strategy: A Historical Perspective‚Äô; North Carolina Historical Review; vol. 48, no. 2 (April 1971), pp. 126-141 and by nominee William Howard Taft‚Äôs willingness to accept black disfranchisement.de Santis, Vincent P.; ‚ÄòRepublican Efforts to ‚ÄúCrack‚Äù the Democratic South‚Äô; The Review of Politics, vol. 14, no. 2 (April 1952), pp. 244-264 This resulted in the GOP carrying twelve secessionist upcountry counties that had never gone Republican before.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 39 The split in the GOP after the 1908 election prevented any maintenance of these gains ‚Äì which had seem Bryan‚Äôs 1908 performance as the poorest by a Democrat in Georgia until pro-civil rights Lyndon B.

She was member of the African National Congress, the ANC Women's League as well as the Federation of South African Women. She later joined the Communist Party. Early life Lindiwe Letitia Hina, better known as 'Letitia Sibeko' was born in 1930 in Mqumba near Middledrift in the Eastern Cape. Her father, Rufus Hina was the chief of her village. She was one of 5 children. She attended a high school in her local area until the junior certificate level. She met Archie Sibeko at Fort Cox Agricultural College near Middledrift. In January 1953, they married. Both Hina and Sibeko did not believe in the principle of lobolo (brideprice) therefore she left home as Hina's parents were upset. Archie left to Cape Town soon after their marriage in pursuit of money. They planned to buy tools, livestock and start farming. Archie lived in a migrant hostel which did not allow couples. Letitia stayed with relatives in East London while he established himself. They moved in together in 1955. According to Archie, 'It must have been daunting for her, a village girl...she had to get used to living in one room which served as a bedroom, living-room and kitchen. She had to learn to cook on a primus stove, to dress as they dressed in town, to shop at the market and all the other new things.' Letitia remained religious and non-political during her time in the Eastern Cape. http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/downloadpdf.php?pdffile=files%2FPDF%2F2194%2F011%20-%2010_Representation_and_Reality~3132007124953PM.pdf&downloadfilename;=Representation%20%26%20Reality%20-%20Appendix%2C%20Select%20bibliography%2C%20Index Accessed 30 August 2017 Her husband, Archie Sibeko became a political activist and a trade unionist.https://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-25-60-iconic-women-the- people-behind-the-1956-womens-march-to-pretoria-21-30 Accessed 30 August Political activity Her political activity started when she moved to Cape Town where she joined the African National Congress, the ANC Women's League as well as the Federation of South African Women. She participated in the Women's March in Pretoria against pass laws where she played a significant role. She was involved in the extensive planning of the demonstration, as well as the encouragement of women to sign the petition and participate in the march. She did this alongside 157 Cape Town delegates including Annie Peters, Caroline Motsoaledi, Fatima Meer, Fatima Seedat and Florence Mophosho.http://nhmsa.co.za/news/you-strike-a-woman-you-strike-a-rock/ Accessed 30 August 2017 In 1961 she joined the then 'underground' Communist Party. She attended the FEDSAW annual conference which took place in Cape Town where she presented a speech criticing and denouncing the Bantu education system. She was allegedly detained by the police in 1963 in order to get information on her husband, Archie Sibeko who was working 'underground' against the government. She acted a courier for him. Due to influx control regulations, Letitia was expelled from the Western Cape as her husband was no longer living there. Archie Sibeko claims that the last time he saw his wife was while he was in hiding just before he was smuggled out of South Africa. This meeting was organised by Archie's controller, Liz Abrahams, on a farm in Paarl. She was detained for months after this visit as the police were following her and were suspicious. Little is known of her activity after her expulsion. It is believed that she returned to Cape Town under a different name and managed a shabeen there. Her grandparents raised her four children in the Eastern Cape. She also had a number of other children in Cape Town. She dropped out of politics and died after falling ill. The whereabouts of her grave are unknown.https://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-25-60-iconic-women-the- people-behind-the-1956-womens-march-to-pretoria-21-30 Accessed 30 Augusthttp://nhmsa.co.za/news/you-strike-a-woman-you-strike-a-rock/ Accessed 30 August 2017 External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20170904065102/http://www.sahistory.org.za/1900s/1920s * ANC historical documents * Bernstein, Hilda, 1975.

DC vaccine has been introduced as a new therapeutic strategy in cancer patients. DC-based immunotherapy is safe and can promote antitumor immune responses and prolonged survival of cancer patients.  Human DC subsets   Immature dendritic cells  Non- activated (immature) DCs are usually located in the peripheral non-lymphoid tissues and they can present self-antigens to T cells, that leads to immune tolerance either through T cell deletion or through the differentiation of regulatory T cells or suppressor T cells.  Mature dendritic cells  Mature DCs have ability to present antigens in the lymphoid tissues and prime, activate and expand effector immune cells with unique functions and cytokine profiles.  Myeloid dendritic cells (cDCs)  Myeloid or conventional DCs (cDCs) are derived from myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and are characterized by expression of CD11c. cDCs can be subdivided into 3 groups: monocyte-derived DCs, CD1a- interstitial DCs, and CD1a+ Langerhans cells.  Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)  Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) differentiate from lymphoid progenitor cells in the lymphoid tissues. They express CD123 and product high levels of type I interferon. pDCs also contribute to inflammatory responses in the steady state and in pathology. During inflammatory response, inflammatory DCs (iDCs) are generated from monocytes.  Function of cancer therapeutic vaccines  The main goal of the therapeutic vaccines is to elicit cellular immunity. They should prime naive T cells as well as induce transition from chronically activated non-protective CD8+ T cells to healthy CD8+ T cells able to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), that recognise and eliminate cancer cells in an antigen-specific way and also provide long-lived memory CD8+ T cells that will act to prevent relapse. The most critical step in vaccination is the effective presentation of cancer antigens to T cells and because of DCs are the most efficient antigen presenting cells, they are the promising option for improvement of therapeutic vaccines.  Methods for exploiting dendritic cells in cancer therapeutic vaccines  DC-based immunotherapy approach can be employed in a couple of ways:  Direct targeting/stimulating of the DCs in vivo to accentuate their anticancer phenotype  Most of trials testing in vivo DCs‚Äô stimulation with synthetic peptides failed because of inability of effective stimulation of CD4+ cellular responses and stimulation of Th2 type cytokines. The solution showing clinical responses was pre-treatment with single-dose cyclophosphamide as well as vaccination with tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).  Stimulation of the DCs ex vivo and infusing them back into the host for carrying out anticancer effector function  In this way, DCs‚Äô precursors are isolated from the patient through leukapheresis and after maturation/stimulation of these precursors ex vivo, fully mature DCs are injected back into the patient. There are different ways applied to generate cancer cells-specific DCs. We can used specific TAAs, tumor lysates, created DC-cancer cell fusions, electroporation/transfection of DCs with total cancer cell-mRNA or tumor derived exosomes (TDEs) by the stimulation. There is also the possibility of additional co-stimulating with cytokine ‚Äúcocktails‚Äù to assure strong maturation.  Dendritic cell vaccine against brain tumor  The most well- known source of antigens used for vaccines in Glioblastoma (Aggressive type of brain tumor) investigations were whole tumor lysate, CMV antigen RNA and tumor associated peptides for instance EGFRvIII. The initial studies showed that patients developed immune responses as measured by Interferon-gamma expression in the peripheral blood, systemic cytokine responses, or CD8+ antigen specific T cell expansion. Clinical response rates were not as vigorous as the immune response rates. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) varied in different studies but were enhanced compared to historical controls.  Sipuleucel-T  Sipuleucel-T is the first DCs- based cancer vaccine for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . It is an active cellular immunotherapy, which involves obtaining antigen- presenting autologous dendritic cells from the patient following a leukapheresis procedure. The cells are incubated ex vivo in the presence of a recombinant fusion protein PA2024 containing a prostate antigen, prostate acid phosphatase and GM-CSF, an immune-cell activator. The cells are then returned to the patient to generate an immune response.

It is the second largest square in Kazakhstan, after Republic Square. It hosts many public events, concerts, and ceremonies. The square is in front of the Kazakh-British Technical University, the monument of Aliya Moldagulova and Manshuk Mametova, and is on the left side of the Panfilov Street Promenade The square used to be named after Vladimir Lenin and a statue of him stood in the center of the square until 1991. History 287x287px In 1921, the area was named Red Square. After the demolition of the Imperial-era buildings took place by the Soviet authorities, new government buildings were erected on the square. In 1937, the square was paved with stones for the first time. In 1955, the administrative building of Kazpotrebsoyuz was built on the corner of Panfilov Street. A monument to Soviet statesman Vladimir Lenin was erected on October Revolution Day on 7 November 1957. That same year, a construction of a new government building of Kazakh SSR was completed which is now KBTU Building. After Brezhnev Square was opened in the city in 1980, the area was nicknamed \\"old square\\". The Lenin monument was moved to another location in 1997. As a result, the square was renamed once again to honor the newly established capital of Kazakhstan, Astana (now Nur-Sultan). In September 2017, the reconstruction of the square was completed, which resulted in the reduction ox the lanes and the creation of bicycle paths.–í –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏ –æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é –°—Ç–∞—Ä—É—é –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å  References  Almaty Squares in Almaty Tourism in Almaty ","title":"Astana Square"},{"id":"55133836","text":"Basil Richardson Stanley Megaw FRSE FSA FMA (1913-2002) was a British archaeologist.

Voters chose ten representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Kansas was won by Princeton University President Woodrow Wilson (D‚ÄìVirginia), running with governor of Indiana Thomas R. Marshall, with 39.30 percent of the popular vote, against the 26th president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt (I‚ÄìNew York), running with governor of California Hiram Johnson, with 32.88 percent of the popular vote, the 27th president of the United States William Howard Taft (R‚ÄìOhio), running with Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler, with 20.47 percent of the popular vote and the five-time candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States Eugene V. Debs (S‚ÄìIndiana), running with the first Socialist mayor of a major city in the United States Emil Seidel, with 7.33 percent of the popular vote. As a result of his win in the state, Wilson became the second Democratic presidential candidate to ever win Kansas as well as the first one since William Jennings Bryan in 1896.

Voters chose thirteen representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Iowa was won by Princeton University President Woodrow Wilson (D‚ÄìVirginia), running with governor of Indiana Thomas R. Marshall, with 37.64% of the popular vote, against the 26th president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt (P‚ÄìNew York), running with governor of California Hiram Johnson, with 32.87% of the popular vote and the 27th president of the United States William Howard Taft (R‚ÄìOhio), running with Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler, with 24.33% of the popular vote.

He was born at Hamstall Ridware, Staffordshire and died at Burnham, Buckinghamshire. Willes was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket at Rugby as a right-handed middle-order batsman, but in his first year at Cambridge University in 1864 did not progress beyond the trial matches. In both 1865 and 1866 he was picked for a few early-season matches, but often batted well down the order; his greatest success in first-class cricket came in the second innings of the 1866 match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's when he was demoted to No 12 in a 12-a-side game and proceeded to hit 51 out of a last-wicket partnership of 79 which forced MCC to bat again when they appeared on course for an innings victory. He played only one further first- class match and was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University during his time at Cambridge. He continued to play in minor matches into his 50s. Willes graduated from Cambridge University in 1868 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The same year, he was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England and in 1869 he became a priest. He served as curate at parishes at Buckingham and at Aynho in Northamptonshire and was vicar of Christ Church, Epsom from 1874 to 1881. He was rector of Calverton in Buckinghamshire from 1881 to 1900, and then moved to Burnham as vicar, but died a year later. The Oxford University cricketer Edmund Willes was a cousin.

It is City of San Francisco Landmark number 7, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Location The Audiffred Building is on the corner of Mission Street and the Embarcadero, facing the waterfront;Carl Nolte, \\"A trip down Mission, the most San Franciscan of streets\\", San Francisco Chronicle, November 26, 2016. it is one of the few surviving waterfront buildings on the land side of the Embarcadero. Since the removal of the elevated Embarcadero Freeway after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the building again looks out on the waterfront.Carl Nolte, \\"Every waterfront block has a story worth telling\\", San Francisco Chronicle, January 4, 2009. Building The building is of brick, with projecting brick quoins on the corners of the second floor. Its architecture emulates the Second Empire style of late 19th-century French commercial buildings.Libby Ingalls, \\"Audiffred Building: Historical Essay\\", from Susan P. Sherwood and Catherine Powell, eds., The San Francisco Labor Landmarks Guide Book: A Register of Sites and Walking Tours, San Francisco: Labor Archives and Research Center, San Francisco State University, 2008,, Found SF, retrieved November 27, 2018.Cindy Casey, \\"Architectural Spotlight: The Audiffred Building‚ÄîA Tribute to France\\", Untapped Cities, December 16, 2011. There are three floors, the third being within a wood-framed tiled mansard roof decorated with a diamond pattern. The first floor has fluted cast iron columns with capitals incorporating a floral letter \\"A\\". Above the first floor on the eastern half of the facade is a frieze consisting of nautical motifs, including dolphins, lighthouses, sailing ships, and seahorses, in bas relief. History Hippolite d'Audiffret (anglicized as \\"Audiffred\\"), a Frenchman who had been living in Mexico and reportedly walked to San Francisco from Veracruz after Emperor Maximilian and the French became unpopular there, built a profitable business selling charcoal in Chinatown. The Audiffred Building was constructed for him in 1889, presumably to house this business. The first floor retail spaces were initially rented to a restaurant and three taverns; at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries The Bulkhead tavern was one of these tenants, serving \\"Bull's Head\\" stew. Upstairs until 1905 were the offices of the Coast Seamen's Union, later the Sailor's Union of the Pacific, a forerunner of the International Seamen's Union; at one time or another prior to World War I the building also housed unions for Marine Engineers, Masters and Pilots, and Pile Drivers, and for a short time the Industrial Workers of the World. In an attempt to stop the fires following the 1906 earthquake, the San Francisco Fire Department nearly destroyed the building along with all those surrounding it; the Audiffred Building was saved the bartender of the Bulkhead, the drinking establishment then occupying the building, bribed the firemen with the offer of two quarts of whiskey apiece and a fire cart full of bottles of wine. The Audiffred Building served as headquarters for the City Front strike in 1901 and again during the 1934 San Francisco waterfront strike, the strike committee was headquartered there.Peter Booth Wiley, National Trust Guide: San Francisco, New York: Preservation Press‚ÄìWiley, 2000, , pp. 221‚Äì22. On \\"Bloody Thursday\\" sailors Howard Sperry and Nick Bordoise were shot dead by police outside, as commemorated by a monument across the street. In 1928 one of the earliest branches of the Bank of Italy, forerunner of Bank of America, moved into part of the first floor; the nautical frieze was commissioned for the bank. With the decline of San Francisco's waterfront in the mid-twentieth century, the Seven Seas Club for homeless sailors moved into the building in 1946, and bohemian artists and writers including Elmer Bischoff, Howard Hack, Frank Lobdell, Hassel Smith, Martin Snipper, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti occupied lofts and studios on the two upper floors, which had no electricity,Bill Morgan, The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour, San Francisco: City Lights, 2003, , pp. 115‚Äì16. until they were condemned as unsafe in 1955. In 1978 a gas fire gutted the building, and it was to have been demolished; it was saved by public demand and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\\"National Register of Historic Places inventory‚Äînomination form: The Audiffred Building\\", retrieved October 12, 2018.

While recipients are not technically counted as members of the Order, these medals are nevertheless affiliated with it. The 1946 New Year Honours were appointments by many of the Commonwealth Realms of King George VI to reward and highlight good works by citizens of those countries, and to celebrate the passing of 1945 and the beginning of 1946. Recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire were made on the nomination of the United Kingdom, the self- governing Dominions of the Empire (later Commonwealth) and the Viceroy of India.

Timeline of events Fire season officially began on April 15. Training of state fire crews was conducted in May, as well as training of Washington National Guard in helitack insertion for fire crews. On the morning of August 1, smoke from BC fires pushed into the Seattle area, rapidly making Mount Rainier invisible on a cloudless day. In early August, heavy smoke from British Columbia over Seattle earned the social media title \\"\\". Mid-month, several large fires in the state's Cascades Range were ignited by lightning. On August 8, the city of Seattle recorded 52 straight days without rain, a new record. The first measurable rainfall at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) was 0.02 inches in mid-August, setting a record 55 day dry streak. On September 2, the Governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, declared a state of emergency across all Washington counties due to wildfires. Air Quality Index values for Oregon and Washington on September 6, 2017. Air quality is hazardous in parts of Washington and Oregon, \\"very unhealthy\\" in Spokane, and at least \\"unhealthy\\" across most of the area. On September 5, ash from the Central Washington fires fell \\"like snow\\" on Seattle and as far west as Grays Harbor County which borders the Pacific Ocean. University of Washington meteorology professor Cliff Mass said the situation in Seattle with \\"a smoke cloud so dense one would think it is low stratus deck\\" was unprecedented in his 30 years of experience. The Air Quality Index reached \\"hazardous\\" in Spokane, the worst of six levels; it had reached hazardous the day before in Newport, Washington, the worst in the country. On September 5, Cle Elum-Roslyn School District announced the start of the school year would be postponed, and on the 6th, all classes and events in Ellensburg School District were canceled until September 11, due to unhealthy indoor air quality. The first significant rain wasn't until after mid September. By the end of the summer, the official weather station at Sea- Tac, representing Western Washington's conditions, had recorded the hottest, driest summer since recordkeeping began with just over of rain. Eastern Washington also had a very dry year with Spokane setting a new record of 80 days without measurable rain. A climate scientist at University of Idaho said that the extremes caused greater fire activity and were due to climate change, but not necessarily linked to human causes.

Resources An RC-26 like this one was deployed to Spokane. Aircraft used for 2005 New Orleans floods pictured. An infrared thermography-capable RC-26 surveillance aircraft and support crew from Washington Air National Guard were deployed to Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane on August 12 in support of firefighting.

Antireligious campaigns in China refer to the Chinese Communist Party's official promotion of state atheism, coupled with its persecution of people with spiritual or religious beliefs, in the People's Republic of China. Antireligious campaigns began in 1949, after the Chinese Communist Revolution, and continue today in Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, and other religious communities. State campaigns against religion have escalated since Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. For Christians, government decrees have mandated the destruction of houses of worship, such as Christian churches. In Tibet, similar decrees have mandated the destruction of Tibetan Buddhist monastic centers, of sacred Buddhist sites, of monastic residences, the denial of the Tibetan people's right to freely access their cultural heritage, and resulted in the ongoing persecution of high Buddhist lamas and of Buddhist nuns and monks. Reports of forced reeducation camps, arrests, beatings, rape, and destruction of religious sites in Tibet are likewise being made with regard to the Uyghur people, who are also allegedly being subjected to an ongoing cultural genocide.  Cultural Revolution  As a result of anti-religious campaigns carried out between 1950 and 1979, churches, mosques, and temples were closed and reeducation was forced upon clergy. In Tibet, monasteries were demolished and monastics were arrested or killed. The Cultural Revolution also criminalized the possession of religious texts. Monks were beaten or killed, and many Tibetans escaped with sacred texts and compiled teachings in exile communities in India.  1989-2002: Jiang Zemin administration  The Chinese government and the Communist Party, led by Jiang Zemin from 1989 to 2002, commenced the persecution of Falun Gong; it called for the \\"education of Marxist materialism and atheism\\" to counter Falun Gong.  Tibetan Buddhists  In 1991 while crafting policy towards Tibetan Buddhists, Jiang's preliminary decree stated reincarnated lamas must be approved by China's central government. The decree was later revised and termed State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 in 2007 during the administration of Hu Jintao. In 1992, Jiang's government formally accepted the 14th Dalai Lama's official recognition and the enthronement of Orgyen Trinley Dorje as the reincarnated 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, spiritual leader of the Karma Kagyu school. The recognition process was led by the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul who died in a mysterious car crash earlier in 1992. The Karmapa, along with the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, are highly respected by Tibetans and considered to be living Buddhas. By 1999, the Karmapa escaped to India, afterwards pointing to interference by the Chinese government in his spiritual leadership and studies as his motive.The Karmapa: A short biography of the early years of the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, and the lineage of Karmapas that came before him., Kagyu Office, https://kagyuoffice.org/karmapa/ Also in 1992, 13 monks from Drepung Monastery were arrested on 12 May for protesting peacefully. Samdup was jailed for 7 years, and in 2020 became the fourth former political prisoner to die from medical complications within the previous six months. In 1994, a Chinese policy called \\"grasping with both hands\\" was implemented in Tibet, targeting Tibetan Buddhism and culture. It was credited with leading to the 2008 Tibetan unrest.The Tibet issue: Tibetan view, BBC, (27 January 2012), https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia- pacific-16759913 On 17 May 1995, Jiang's government officially reversed its acceptance policy of recognized reincarnated lamas and of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leaders, and abducted Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama, three days after his official recognition by the Dalai Lama. Chadrel Rinpoche and another Khenpo involved in the recognition process were also arrested. Months later in December, Jiang's government installed its proxy Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu. The recognized 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima continues to be forcibly detained in an unknown location. In 1996, Jiang's administration officially banned all photographs of Tibet's spiritual leader the 14th Dalai Lama. In 2001, the Chinese government began persecuting and evicting nuns and monks at Larung Gar Buddhist Academy and at Yarchen Gar in Tibet.  2002-2012: Hu Jintao administration  Under the Chinese government and the Communist Party, led by Hu Jintao from 2002 to 2012, land redevelopment was used as a form of religious persecution, while the demolition of spiritually sacred buildings and sites was undertaken.  Tibetan Buddhists  The persecution of Tibetan Buddhists escalated under Hu Jintao, leading to the 2008 Tibetan unrest. The uprising is described as the biggest challenge to China's invasion since 1959. Previously in 2006, Tibetans were arrested after responding to calls from the Dalai Lama to burn animal skin clothing. Bon fires spread throughout Tibet as a form of defiance. In 2008, as unrest over Chinese persecution grew, waves of protests began, including street demonstrations which were met with excessive force. A mass arrest of 280 monks at the Labrang Monastery was reported during this time, as was torture during confinement. A farming boycott began in 2009 in protest for those people detained or \\"disappeared\\" into Chinese custody. Civil disobedience became widespread, as all the monks in a Jomda, Chamdo province monastery deserted in June 2009 instead of participating in \\"patriotic education\\". Acts of self-immolation began in 2009 at Kirti Monastery. In 2010, two people were killed while trying to stop a mass arrest of approximately 300 monks at the same monastery. In 2011, China's foreign ministry announced only Beijing could appoint the 15th Dalai Lama.Brooke Schedneck, (03 July 2019 How the Dalai Lama is chosen and why China wants to appoint its own, The Conversation, https://theconversation.com/how-the-dalai-lama-is-chosen-and- why-china-wants-to-appoint-its-own-114351 A monk at Nyitso monastery, Tsewang Norbu, self immolated after chanting \\"Long live the Dalai Lama\\" and \\"Tibetan people want freedom\\". The non-profit organization Free Tibet said telephone and internet services were subsequently cut to keep the news from spreading, and the monastery's utilities had been repeatedly cut. Activist Tsering Woeser said Chinese security forces surrounded the monastery the same night of Tsewang Norbu's death.  2012-Present: Xi Jinping administration  The Chinese government and Communist party led by Xi Jinping from 2012‚Äìpresent has intensified the most recent antireligious campaigns. Xi reemphasized that members of the Chinese Communist Party must be \\"unyielding Marxist atheists\\" and specifically \\"instituted a broad campaign to suppress all forms of dissent.\\" In September 2019, the UN Human Rights Council was informed that the Government of China \\"is harvesting and selling organs from persecuted religious and ethnic minorities on an industrial scale\\". The tribunal concluded that some Uyghurs, Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists and Christians are being ‚Äúkilled to order... cut open while still alive for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale‚Äù. According to The Christian Post, fingerprinting and facial recognition technology is being installed in churches, temples, and other religious meeting places throughout rural areas of China, with a completion date of 2020.  Tibetan Buddhists  Under Xi Jinping, the widespread targeting of Tibetans and of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, together with the persecution of ordained Khenpos, nuns and monks escalated. The settlement of Han Chinese in Tibet also continues, creating a majority population of Han Chinese settlers that benefit from forced land redistribution in Tibet. Massive redevelopment projects including railways, mines, roadways, dams and shopping centers forcibly displace Tibetans and erode the environment. From 2015 to present, farmlands and ancestral nomadic grazing lands are also being confiscated from Tibetans. Reports state that administrators of monasteries have been replaced by police or by people considered government infiltrators, while military surveillance units have been installed at Kirti Monastery, Yarchen Gar, Shak Rongpo Gaden Dargyeling Monastery, and at other monasteries, along with CCTV cameras. Drongna Monastery was forcibly closed in 2013, and its chant master Thardhod Gyaltsen received an 18-year prison sentence in 2014 for possession of a picture and recording of the 14th Dalai Lama. Since Xi gained office in 2012, \\"China has forced many Tibetan monks and nuns studying in Tibetans areas of Amdo and Kham to return to their respective hometowns in TAR as part of the intensified policy to control and manage Tibetan monastic population.\\"Lobsang Tenchoe, Tibetan monk‚Äôs account declares sexual abuse and torture rampant in China‚Äôs ‚Äòpolitical re-education centres‚Äô , (30 May 2018), https://tibetexpress.net/8411/tibetan-monks-account-declares-sexual-abuse-and- torture-rampant-in-chinas-political-re-education-centres/ By 2013, Xi continued using tourism and redevelopment plans as methods to separate Tibetans from their Buddhist culture, to forcibly dislocate Tibetans, and to destroy heritage sites intrinsically important to Buddhists. Plans in 2012 included demolishing the spiritually sacred Barkhor central district of Lhasa's historic circumambulation path around the Norbulingka and the Jokhang, to build a shopping center, which appears to be also causing structural damage to these adjacent UNESCO world heritage sites. The shopping center is designed for Chinese tourists, of which over 10 million toured Tibet in 2011. By 2020, after Chinese state-sponsored tourist agencies funneled people from inner China to Lhasa, reports state the tourists disrupt ceremonies, are disrespectful to Tibetan customs, and throw trash around sacred sites. Police support the tourists confronted by complaints. While continuing to experience state-sponsored discrimination, Tibetans are barred by Chinese authorities from entering sacred sites into which Chinese tourists are allowed. Unnamed Tibetan sources add that their \\"culture is becoming a showpiece for Chinese tourists\\". The historic residential community at the base of the Dalai Lama's Potala Palace was previously demolished after residents were forcibly displaced, and a large square glorifying China's invasion was built. Reports also indicate tourism is used to disrupt monastic life within Buddhist monasteries. Monastic residences of nuns and monks were demolished before mass evictions began in 2016 at Larung Gar, in 2019 at Yarchen Gar, in 2013 at Jhada Gon Palden Khachoe Nunnery, and elsewhere. Reports indicate that nuns and nunneries are targeted for demolition more often than those of monks. Tourist accommodations and roads replaced the residences, or are planned for the sites where residences were demolished. Other monasteries are partially renovated for tourist accommodations whose proximity disrupts daily life. After the mass evictions, nuns and monks were bused away, and reportedly detained in reeducation centers. Among others, an identified reeducation center is named Ningtri. Reports include beatings and the torture of monastics and of laypeople at reeducation centers, and in jails after arrests. In 2016, the CCP commenced a campaign to sinicize religion, which intensified after 2018. The Sinicization of Tibet has been widely condemned as cultural cleansing. The ethnic cleansing policies in Tibet were managed by hardliner Chen Quanguo, before his 2016 transfer to govern Xinjiang. As the leaked Xinjiang papers state, \\"[n]ew security controls and a drastic expansion of the indoctrination camps followed\\" behind Chen Quanguo. In Tibet, nuns have been photographed while forced to wear military clothing and sing, forced to disavow Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, and reports state that beatings for disobedience are also common occurrences. Reports document incidents of sexual abuse, rape, and gender-based violence at the Chinese detention centers. In April 2019, the Chinese police-enforced ban against photographs of the Dalai Lama spread to remote areas of Tibet.  Christians  The persecution of members of other spiritual organizations is also continuing under Xi Jinping. Journalist Ian Johnson noted that officials have targeted Christianity, and Islam, with particular intensity because of their perceived foreign ties. In the Chinese province of Zhejiang alone, over 1200 Christian crosses have been removed from their steeples since 2013. In August 2017, a number of Catholic Christian priests, as well as laypeople, were injured while they were trying to prevent a government-owned bulldozer from demolishing their historic church in the Shanxi province. In February 2018, government authorities in Kashgar, \\"launched an anti-religion propaganda drive through local police stations\\", which included policemen erecting a banner proclaiming ‚ÄúWe Must Solemnly Reject Religion, Must Not Believe in Religion‚Äù. In December 2018, Chinese officials raided Christian house churches just prior to Christmas and coerced their owners to close them down; Christmas trees and Santa Clauses were also forcibly removed. In 2018, the United Front Work Department initiated a crackdown on large outdoor religious statues. The government of China continued to persecute Christians during the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, demolishing the Xiangbaishu Church in Yixing and removing a Christian Cross from the steeple of a church in Guiyang County. In the Shandong Province, \\"officials issued guidance forbidding online preaching, a vital way for churches to reach congregants amid both persecution and the spread of the virus\\". In 2020, the Chinese government put additional regulations in place to restrict religious education and proselytizing.  Muslims  By November 2018, the Chinese government had detained over one million Uyghurs in what it refers to as \\"training centers\\" as part of a thought reform campaign, \\"where Uyghur Muslims are remade into atheist Chinese subjects\\". For children forcibly taken away from their parents, the Chinese government has established \\"kindergartens\\" with the aim of combating 'three evil forces' (\\"separatism, extremism and terrorism\\"), and \\"converting future generations of Uyghur Muslim children into loyal subjects who embrace atheism\\". Under Xi Jinping, destruction of mosques and Muslim religious sites is widespread. Government campaigns against Islam have extended to the Hui people and Utsul community in Hainan. Chinese officials did not acknowledge the existence of any sort of detention camps, but in November 2019 the detention centers were confirmed by the leaked Xinjiang papers, and are contributing to the genocide of Uyghurs. The Chinese government claims that Uyghurs are being sent to vocational training centers in order to prevent the spread of extremism and to increase their employability. In 1991, the U.S. government estimated that about one million people were being held in the re-education camps, mainly Uyghurs.

History Mexico and North Korea established diplomatic relations on 4 September 1980; 27 years after the end of the Korean War.Bilateral relations between Mexico and North Korea (in Spanish) In 1993, North Korea opened an embassy in Mexico City. Initial diplomatic relations between both nations were cordial. In 1999, Mexico donated to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization and North Korea has collaborated in projects throughout Mexico, particularly in the Mexican states of Durango, Oaxaca and Puebla. In 2003, relations between both nations came to a low when North Korea withdrew from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Since then, Mexico has repeatedly condemned all missile launches from North Korea. In June 2009, as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, Mexico voted in favor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 which imposed further economic and commercial sanctions on North Korea and encouraged UN member states to search North Korean cargo ships. In July 2014, a North Korean merchant ship called the Mu Du Bong ran aground and damaged nearly an acre of coral reefs near the Mexican state of Veracruz. Mexico detained the ship after discovering that it belongs to a blacklisted shipping firm.North Korea Blames U.S. for Blocking Release of Ship Held by Mexico The merchant ship was never released back to North Korea and in 2016 Mexico began scrapping the ship and released the crew members back to their home country.Mexico declares N.

Bilateral Agreements Since establishing diplomatic relations in 1980, Mexico and North Korea have signed several bilateral agreements, such as an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation; Customs Agreement; Agreement on the prohibition of certain import and export products; Agreement on Health; Agreement on Education and Cultural Cooperation and a Treaty on the prohibition of testing nuclear weapons.
