As a logistics officer in 1959, he was awarded the George Medal for risking his own life to save one of his drivers. He was the father of politician Crispin Blunt and grandfather of actress Emily Blunt. Early life Born at Farnborough, Hampshire, into an army family, Blunt was the son of Claudia Mabel (n√©e Wintle) and Albert Blunt, then a sergeant in the Royal Tank Corps. In 1929, his family moved to Kanpur, where he was educated. He left India in 1937 at the age of 14 to enroll as an apprentice tradesman in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) school on the island of Jersey. Military career In 1940, after the fall of France, and with the German occupation of the Channel Islands imminent, the school was evacuated and Blunt found himself in an RASC training battalion in England. Shortly after his 18th birthday, he was sent to the Mediterranean theatre, but first won the lightweight inter- service boxing contest at Letchworth, Hertfordshire. He saw active service in the Italian campaign in 1944, before returning to England for officer training. He was then commissioned into the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers in November 1944 as a second lieutenant and commanded a close protection platoon defending Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group headquarters. He was present at the signing of the unconditional German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath on 4 May 1945. During the Second World War, Blunt served also in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. After an appointment as adjutant of the British Army garrison in Dieppe, Blunt left the army in 1946 and joined the Allied Control Commission in Germany, then was an inspector at Bletchley Park. He briefly worked as an export manager of the Midland Metal Spinning Company in Wolverhampton but in 1949 returned to the army on a short- service commission in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. As he was unable to advance without a university degree, Blunt transferred back to the Royal Army Service Corps in 1951 on a regular commission. He passed the Staff College, Camberley, in 1957, which opened up his career path as an officer. In 1959, Blunt saved a driver whose lorry, carrying a load of petrol, crashed near Bielefeld, Germany. While the injured driver was trapped in the car, Blunt‚Äîwith disregard for his own safety‚Äîclimbed into the cab and applied a tourniquet to the driver's badly injured leg and administered morphine. Despite the risk of fire, Blunt stayed with the injured and frightened man for an hour, until he was cut from the vehicle. He was awarded the George Medal for his courage and humanitarian action. Blunt passed the Joint Services Staff College in 1963, and then in 1965 was sent to command 26 (Heavy Ferry) Bridging Regiment and, by some accounts, to resolve a mutiny. Later that year the unit became 26 Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport. In 1968 he was appointed General Staff Officer 1 for Defence Plans, Far East Land Forces, and from 1970 to 1972 commanded the Royal Corps of Transport 1st Corps, before being seconded to the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1972. After service as Deputy Transport Officer-in-Chief for the Army, Blunt became Transport Officer-in-Chief in 1973, then was Assistant Chief of Personnel and Logistics (Army) at the Ministry of Defence in 1977‚Äì78 and Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics), 1978‚Äì79, when he retired the service, while continuing in the ceremonial role of Colonel Commandant of the Royal Corps of Transport (1974‚Äì1989). Corporate career Entering the world of business, Blunt was Managing Director of Earls Court Ltd., 1979‚Äì80, Angex-Watson, 1980‚Äì83, and Market Sensors, 1980‚Äì88. He was Chairman of Angex Ltd., 1988‚Äì90, and of Argus Shield Ltd., 1988‚Äì89. He was also a director of Associated Newspapers. Blunt was a special Commissioner of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, from 1979 to 1985, and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Carmen from 1973. His address at the time of his death was Harefield House, Ramsbury, in Wiltshire. Family In 1949, Blunt married Adrienne the daughter of General T. W. Richardson, and they had three sons, including Oliver Blunt QC, and Crispin Blunt, Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate. His grandchildren include the actress Emily Blunt.

He has been called \\"one of the foremost scholars on hell\\" by The Christian Post. He is the subject of the 2012 independent film Hell and Mr. Fudge.  Personal life  Fudge was raised by devout parents. His mother was the child of missionaries to southern Africa, and his father was a Christian publisher and a minister in Churches of Christ. He received bachelor's and master's degrees at Abilene Christian University and completed law school at the University of Houston College of Law. Fudge was raised in non- institutional Churches of Christ, attending Florida College before transferring to Abilene Christian. After completing his master's in Biblical languages from Abilene, Fudge ministered for non-institutional Churches of Christ in St. Louis and Athens, Alabama. Fudge then moved to Houston, Texas, where he lived until His death on November 25, 2017, which was announced via his GracEmail newsletter and later reported in The Christian Chronicle.  The Fire That Consumes  Although Fudge published several books, only The Fire That Consumes has been through multiple editions. The first printing of the first edition, subtitled A Biblical and Historical Study of Final Punishment, was published in early 1982 () by Verdict Publications (Australia), with a foreword by F. F. Bruce of Manchester, U.K. The book examined the doctrine of the final punishment of the unredeemed from throughout the whole Bible, non- biblical literature of Second Temple Judaism (Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls), as well as the historical development of the doctrine of final punishment through the Apostolic Fathers, Ante-Nicene, Nicene, and Post-Nicene Fathers, medieval and later theologians, Reformers and later theologians. Special attention is given to Augustine (\\"City of God\\") and to John Calvin (\\"Psychopannychia\\"). Fudge argues that the doctrine of hell as eternal, conscious torment was not a necessary corollary of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, brought into the Christian church by apologists such as Athenagoras and especially Tertullian. When the first printing sold out in five months, Verdict gave all rights to the author, who for 29 years self- published the book through multiple printings under the name Providential Press. The second printing was an Alternate Selection of the Evangelical Book Club. The only change was enlarging the subtitle to say: \\"A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment.\\" Twelve years later in 1994, a second, condensed, British edition (), subtitled The Biblical Case for Conditional Immortality was published by Paternoster Press in England, with a second foreword by John W. Wenham of Oxford. Paternoster was later bought by Authentic Media, who let the second edition go out of print. Seventeen years later, after a year of Fudge's rigorous updating, revising, and enlarging the first edition, Cascade Books, the academic division of Wipf & Stock published the definitive third edition (), subtitled A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment, with an original third foreword by Richard Bauckham of Cambridge University, formerly of St. Andrews University, Scotland. Throughout the third edition, Fudge also interacts with seventeen authors of eleven traditionalist books, bringing the dialogue forward by three decades. Christianity Today has called The Fire That Consumes \\"the standard reference on the subject.\\" Since its first publication, The Fire That Consumes has been cited with increasing frequency by scholars and other serious authors writing on the topic. Among these are articles in Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, Evangelical Quarterly, Christian Research Institute Journal, Reformation & Revival, and Themelios. Christianity Today picked it as one of four volumes representing the \\"annihilationist\\" viewpoint on Hell in a 2000 topical bibliography. In addition to The Fire That Consumes, Fudge's discussions regarding Hell include Two Views of Hell: A Biblical & Theological Dialogue, with Robert A. Peterson defending a traditional interpretation of Hell. And in Hell--A Final Word: The Surprising Truths I Found in the Bible (978-089112-149-7), he makes the data accessible to a popular audience.  Hell and Mr. Fudge  Fudge is the subject of a biopic, entitled Hell and Mr. Fudge, produced by Pat Arrabito and directed by Jeff Wood, with Mackenzie Astin starring as Fudge. The film was released at the 2012 Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival. Fudge cooperated in the film's development. Other activities Fudge ran gracEmail, an email ministry in which he sent out several short emails focusing on biblical and Christian themes every week. He also wrote books on other topics, including a commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews and a book on the topic of receiving guidance from God. Education *A.A.

Generally, personal identity is the unique numerical identity of a person in the course of time. Personal Identity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)Identity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) That is, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the person, persisting through time. In philosophy, the problem of personal identity is concerned with how one is able to identify a single person over a time interval, dealing with such questions as, \\"What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?\\" or \\"What kinds of things are we persons?\\" In contemporary metaphysics, the matter of personal identity is referred to as the diachronic problem of personal identity.An Essay Concerning Human Understanding; Volumes 1‚Äì3. By John Locke The synchronic problem concerns the question of what features and traits characterize a person at a given time. In continental philosophy and in analytic philosophy, enquiry to the nature of Identity is common. Continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity when confronted by different philosophic propositions, postulates, and presuppositions about the world and its nature.Self and Subjectivity; \\"Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance\\". Edited by Kim Atkins. p257.Cultural Theory: An Anthology. Edited by Imre Szeman, Timothy Kaposy. p481. \\"Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance\\" Continuity of substance Bodily substance One concept of personal persistence over time is simply to have continuous bodily existence.Olson, Eric T. 1997. The Human Animal: Personal Identity Without Psychology. New York: Oxford University Press. However, as the Ship of Theseus problem illustrates, even for inanimate objects there are difficulties in determining whether one physical body at one time is the same thing as a physical body at another time. With humans, over time our bodies age and grow, losing and gaining matter, and over sufficient years will not consist of most of the matter they once consisted of. It is thus problematic to ground persistence of personal identity over time in the continuous existence of our bodies. Nevertheless, this approach has its supporters which define humans as a biological organism and asserts the proposition that a psychological relation is not necessary for personal continuity. This personal identity ontology assumes the relational theoryOlson, Eric T. 2007. What Are We? A Study in Personal Ontology. New York: Oxford University Press. of life- sustaining processes instead of bodily continuity. The teletransportation problem of Derek Parfit is designed to bring out intuitions about corporeal continuity. This thought experiment discusses cases in which a person is teleported from Earth to Mars. Ultimately, the inability to specify where on a spectrum does the transmitted person stop being identical to the initial person on Earth appears to show that having a numerically identical physical body is not the criterion for personal identity.Durante, Chris. 2013. \\"A Philosophical Identity Crisis.\\" Philosophy Now 97. . Mental substance In another concept of mind, the set of cognitive faculties are considered to consist of an immaterial substance, separate from and independent of the body.Going, Jonathan. 1835. The Christian Library, Vols. 3-4. p. 786+. cf. p. 803: \\"Now all would believe in the separate existence of the soul if they had experience of its existing apart from the body. But the facts referred to proves that it does exist apart from one body with which it once was united, and though it is in union with another, yet as it is not adherent to the same, it is shown to have an existence separate from, and independent of that body.\\" If a person is then identified with their mind, rather than their body‚Äîif a person is considered to their mind‚Äîand their mind is such a non-physical substance, then personal identity over time may be grounded in the persistence of this non-physical substance, despite the continuous change in the substance of the body it is associated with. The mind-body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship, if any, that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. One of the aims of philosophers who work in this area is to explain how a non-material mind can influence a material body and vice versa. However, this is not uncontroversial or unproblematic, and adopting it as a solution raises questions. Perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in mental states; ultimately causing sensation. A desire for food, for example, will tend to cause a person to move their body in a manner and in a direction to obtain food. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an organ (the human brain) possessing electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause neurons of the brain to fire and muscles to contract in the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of Ren√© Descartes. Continuity of consciousness Locke's conception An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in four books (1690) by John Locke (1632‚Äì1704) John Locke considered personal identity (or the self) to be founded on consciousness (viz. memory), and not on the substance of either the soul or the body.Locke, John. An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Vols 1‚Äì3. Chapter 27 of Book II of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), entitled \\"On Identity and Diversity\\", has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualizations of consciousness as the repeated self-identification of oneself. Through this identification, moral responsibility could be attributed to the subject and punishment and guilt could be justified, as critics such as Nietzsche would point out. According to Locke, personal identity (the self) \\"depends on consciousness, not on substance\\" nor on the soul. We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of the past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this \\"thought\\" which \\"goes along with the substance‚Ä¶which makes the same person,\\" then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: \\"This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but‚Ä¶in the identity of consciousness.\\" For example, one may claim to be a reincarnation of Plato, therefore having the same soul substance. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities. Neither is self- identity founded on the body substance, argues Locke, as the body may change while the person remains the same. Even the identity of animals is not founded on their body: \\"animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance,\\" as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life. On the other hand, identity of humans is based on their consciousness. However, this interesting border-case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and only oneself can be aware of one's consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they are really judging‚Äîand punishing‚Äîthe same person, or simply the same body. In other words, Locke argues that one may be judged only for the acts of the body, as this is what is apparent to all but God; however, we are in truth only responsible for the acts of which are conscious. This forms the basis of the insanity defense‚Äîone cannot be held accountable for acts of which one was unconscious‚Äîand therefore leads to interesting philosophical questions: Or again: Henceforth, Locke's conception of personal identity founds it not on the substance or the body, but in the \\"same continued consciousness\\", which is also distinct from the soul since the soul may have no consciousness of itself (as in reincarnation). He creates a third term between the soul and the body. For Locke, the body may change, while consciousness remains the same.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Volume 18. Edited by Hugh Chisholm.p225+253. Therefore, personal identity, for Locke, is not in the body but in consciousness. Philosophical intuition Bernard Williams presents a thought experiment appealing to the intuitions about what it is to be the same person in the future.Williams, Bernard. 1970. \\"The Self and the Future.\\" Philosophical Review 79(2):161‚Äì80. The thought experiment consists of two approaches to the same experiment. For the first approach Williams suggests that suppose that there is some process by which subjecting two persons to it can result in the two persons have \\"exchanged\\" bodies. The process has put into the body of person B the memories, behavioral dispositions, and psychological characteristics of the person who prior to undergoing the process belonged to person A; and conversely with person B. To show this one is to suppose that before undergoing the process person A and B are asked to which resulting person, A-Body-Person or B-Body-Person, they wish to receive a punishment and which a reward. Upon undergoing the process and receiving either the punishment or reward, it appears to that A-Body-Person expresses the memories of choosing who gets which treatment as if that person was person B; conversely with B-Body-Person. This sort of approach to the thought experiment appears to show that since the person who expresses the psychological characteristics of person A to be person A, then intuition is that psychological continuity is the criterion for personal identity. The second approach is to suppose that someone is told that one will have memories erased and then one will be tortured. Does one need to be afraid of being tortured? The intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured, since it will still be one despite not having one's memories. Next, Williams asked one to consider several similar scenarios. Intuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured, that it is still one's self despite having one's memories erased and receiving new memories. However, the last scenario is an identical scenario to the one in the first scenario. In the first approach, intuition is to show that one's psychological continuity is the criterion for personal identity, but in second approach, intuition is that it is one's bodily continuity that is the criterion for personal identity. To resolve this conflict Williams feels one's intuition in the second approach is stronger and if he was given the choice of distributing a punishment and a reward he would want his body-person to receive the reward and the other body-person to receive the punishment, even if that other body- person has his memories. Psychological continuity In psychology, personal continuity, also called personal persistence or self-continuity, is the uninterrupted connection concerning a particular person of his or her private life and personality. Personal continuity is the union affecting the facets arising from personality in order to avoid discontinuities from one moment of time to another time.Frost, Martin. March 2009. \\"Identity and self- image.\\" martinfrost.ws. Personal continuity is an important part of identity; this is the process of ensuring that the qualities of the mind, such as self- awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment, are consistent from one moment to the next. Personal continuity is the property of a continuous and connected period of timeHume, David. \\"Of contiguity and distance in space and time.\\" A Treatise of Human Nature VII. pp. 427, 432.Locke, John. \\"On Identity and Diversity.\\" Ch. 27 in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding 1-3. pp. 46, 69. and is intimately related to do with a person's body or physical being in a single four-dimensional continuum.Giddens, Anthony. 1990. \\"Modernity, Time, Space.\\" In The Consequences of Modernity. Associationism, a theory of how ideas combine in the mind, allows events or views to be associated with each other in the mind, thus leading to a form of learning. Associations can result from contiguity, similarity, or contrast. Through contiguity, one associates ideas or events that usually happen to occur at the same time. Some of these events form an autobiographical memory in which each is a personal representation of the general or specific events and personal facts. Ego integrity is the psychological concept of the ego's accumulated assurance of its capacity for order and meaning. Ego identity is the accrued confidence that the inner sameness and continuity prepared in the past are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for others, as evidenced in the promise of a career.

Identity continuum It has been argued from the nature of sensations and ideas that there is no such thing as a permanent identity. Daniel Shapiro asserts that one of four major views on identity does not recognize a \\"permanent identity\\" and instead thinks of \\"thoughts without a thinker\\"‚Äî\\"a consciousness shell with drifting emotions and thoughts but no essence\\". According to him this view is based on the Buddhist concept of anatta, \\"a continuously evolving flow of awareness.\\" Malcolm David Eckel states that \\"the self changes at every moment and has no permanent identity\\"‚Äîit is a \\"constant process of changing or becoming;\\" a \\"fluid ever- changing self.\\"  Bundle theory of the self  A Treatise Of Human Nature: Being An Attempt To Introduce The Experimental Method Of Reasoning Into Moral Subjects. For John Noon, 1739 David Hume undertook looking at the mind‚Äìbody problem. Hume also investigated a person's character, the relationship between human and animal nature, and the nature of agency. Hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we've changed in many respects, the same person appears present now as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we begin introspecting:A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, part IV, ¬ß 6. > [We] always stumble on some particular perception or other.‚Ä¶ I may venture > to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or > collection of different perceptions which succeed each other with an > inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement. It is plain that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.A Treatise of Human Nature, 4.1, 2. Note in particular that, in Hume's view, these perceptions do not belong to anything. Hume, similar to the Buddha,Ross, Nancy Wilson. Buddhism: Way of Life & Thought. p. 29. compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements.Hume, David A Treatise of Human Nature, I, IV, sec.6: \\"In this respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, without losing his identity\\". The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience. In short, what matters for Hume is not that 'identity' exists, but the fact that the relations of causation, contiguity, and resemblances obtain among the perceptions. Critics of Hume state that in order for the various states and processes of the mind to seem unified, there must be something which perceives their unity, the existence of which would be no less mysterious than a personal identity. Hume solves this by considering substance as engendered by the togetherness of its properties. No-self theory The \\"no-self theory\\" holds that the self cannot be reduced to a bundle because the concept of a self is incompatible with the idea of a bundle. Propositionally, the idea of a bundle implies the notion of bodily or psychological relations that do not in fact exist. James Giles, a principal exponent of this view, argues that the no-self or eliminativist theory and the bundle or reductionist theory agree about the non-existence of a substantive self. The reductionist theory, according to Giles, mistakenly resurrects the idea of the selfThe No-Self Theory : Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity. James Giles in terms of various accounts about psychological relations. The no-self theory, on the other hand, \\"lets the self lie where it has fallen\\". James Giles, No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity, University Press of America, 1997, p. 10 This is because the no-self theory rejects all theories of the self, even the bundle theory. On Giles' reading, Hume is actually a no-self theorist and it is a mistake to attribute to him a reductionist view like the bundle theory. Hume's assertion that personal identity is a fiction supports this reading, according to Giles. The Buddhist view of personal identity is also a no-self theory rather than a reductionist theory, because the Buddha rejects attempts to reconstructions in terms of consciousness, feelings, or the body in notions of an eternal/permanent, unchanging Self, Giles, James. 1993. \\"The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity.\\" Philosophy East and West 42. since our thoughts, personalities and bodies are never the same from moment to moment, as specifically explained in ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ. According to this line of criticism, the sense of self is an evolutionary artifact, which saves time in the circumstances it evolved for. But sense of self breaks down when considering some events such as memory loss, split personality disorder, brain damage, brainwashing, and various thought experiments.\\"Staying alive game - Examples of thought experiments on personal identity\\" When presented with imperfections in the intuitive sense of self and the consequences to this concept which rely on the strict concept of self, a tendency to mend the concept occurs, possibly because of cognitive dissonance.

The railroad opened in 1963, making it one of the oldest operating rides at Cedar Point. It consists of a total of five steam locomotives, with four of them in operating condition. In 2013, the railroad celebrated its 50th anniversary in operation. History The railroad originally opened in 1963 with construction starting in the Fall of 1962. Some of the railroad cars were previously before being converted to gauge. The railroad runs on a 2-mile circuit around the park. There are currently two stations, the Main Station in Celebration Plaza and the Frontier Town Station in Frontier Town. Much track work has been done over the years to re-route the track but the most significant track work came in 2007 when the track by the Frontier Town station had to be re-done to navigate around Cedar Point's new coaster, Maverick. In 2013, Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad celebrated its 50th anniversary. In its first 50 years of operation the ride had more than 116 million passengers. Locomotives There are currently five steam locomotives on the railroad, with four of them in operating condition, #44 \\"Judy K.\\", #22 \\"Myron H.\\", #4 \\"George R.\\", and #1 \\"G.A. Boeckling\\". Myron H. or Judy K. are the primary locomotives used on a daily basis. Either locomotive can be used as the second engine for two train operations. The G.A. Boeckling and the George R. are available as back ups if their services are needed. The engines used at Cedar Point are all historic locomotives that were built for a variety of uses before ending up at the park. All four of the operating engines fire on coal as their fuel source. Engine #44 \\"Judy K.\\" Judy K. locomotive at Gemini Midway grade crossing. Engine #44, nicknamed the \\"Judy K.\\", was built by the Vulcan Iron Works in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1923 as construction number 3333. As an type, it is nearly identical to the engine which became the Myron H. It is not known who the original owner was, but it was sold at an unknown date to the Lehigh Stone Company in Lehigh, Illinois. In 1960, it was sold to Peter Burno, a private collector in Spring Green, Wisconsin. It was sold to Cedar Point in August 1968 and converted to a type with tender. It was unnamed until 1974, when it was named the \\"Jack Foster\\" after the first superintendent of the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad. The engine had been retired by the late 1980s and sat with the Myron H. in the back of the enginehouse. It was fully restored in 1992 and renamed the \\"Judy K.\\" after the wife of Richard Kinzel. Engine #22 \\"Myron H.\\" Myron H. pulls train into the Frontier Town Station. Engine #22, nicknamed the \\"Myron H.\\", was built by the Vulcan Iron Works in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in October 1922 as construction number 3264 and was sold to the Wayne Coal Company in Claybank, Ohio to haul coal. As an type, it is nearly identical to the engine which became the Judy K. It was sold in 1927 to Birmingham Rail and Locomotive Products, a locomotive broker based in Birmingham, Alabama. It was then used by Standard Coated Products in Hephzibah, Georgia, the Merry Brothers Brick and Tile Company in Augusta, Georgia, and private collector Charles Weber in Archbold, Ohio. It was sold to Cedar Point in 1963 and converted to a with tender. In 1981 it was named \\"Myron H.\\" after Mike \\"Myron\\" Hetrick, a superintendent of the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad. The Myron H. had been retired by the late 1980s and sat in the back of the enginehouse with the #5 Jack Foster. In 1990 Myron H. was fully restored and is the primary engine used today at Cedar Point. Engine #4 \\"George R.\\" Cedar Point and Lake Erie Rail Road George R. steam locomotive.Engine #4, nicknamed the \\"George R.\\", was built by the H.K. Porter, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in March 1942 as construction number 7348 for the Carbon Limestone Company in Hillsville, Pennsylvania to haul limestone. It was sold to American Railroad Equipment Association in 1962 and leased to Cherokee Wonderland in Cherokee, North Carolina until it was sold to Cedar Point in 1964. The Carbon Limestone engines were unusual in having been built to gauge instead of the more common gauge, making it necessary to narrow the engine by two inches during a restoration by Cedar Point. Engine #1 \\"G.A. Boeckling\\" Cedar Point and Lake Erie Rail Road G.A. Boeckling steam locomotive. Engine #1, nicknamed the G.A. Boeckling, which is the full name of George Arthur Boeckling, was built by the Davenport Locomotive Works in Davenport, Iowa in July 1927 as construction number 2081 for N&S; Coal Company in Pittsburg, Kansas. It was later sold to the Mackie Clemens Fuel Company in Mulberry, Kansas. In 1977, it was acquired by the Keystone Light Railway Company in Herminie, Pennsylvania. The engine was later restored as a for Marriott Corporation's Great America amusement park in Gurnee, Illinois. While the engine was delivered to the park in 1980, it was stored behind the park's enginehouse in its shipping crate and never used. Marriott attempted to sell it around 1983 for , but it did not sell and was a part of the sale of the park to Six Flags in May 1984. By 1991, it had been restored for Bill Norred, who was planning a Victorian village in Southern California. Norred traded it to Disney for five of the original 1955 Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad closed coaches (part of the Retlaw 1 passenger train), which had been out of service for nearly twenty years. The engine was too large for Disneyland, and was sent to Walt Disney World where it was named after Ward Kimball. It was placed on display at Epcot before being traded to Cedar Point in 1999 from Walt Disney World for the Maud L., one of the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad original engines running since 1963. The engine sat in the back of the engine house for years and was finally sent to Knott's Berry Farm In California to be restored in 2010. In late 2011 it returned to Cedar Point and was run in late August that year after being converted to a type tender engine by the CP&LE; RR crews. In 2013 for Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroads 50th Anniversary the \\"Davenport\\" (which was its nickname until it got a name) was renamed G.A. Boeckling, after one of Cedar Point's previous owners. Meanwhile, the former Maud L. of the CP&LE; RR was restored to service in 2005 at Disneyland, where it operates as the new Ward Kimball, locomotive #5 of the Disneyland Railroad. Engine #3 \\"Albert\\" Albert, a retired engine, is on display in a pavilion across from Millennium Force. Engine #3, nicknamed the Albert, was built by the Davenport Locomotive Works in Davenport, Iowa in September 1910 as construction number 1042 to haul sugar cane at the J.B. Levert-St.John Plantation in St. Martinville, Louisiana. It was given the name Albert while at the plantation. It is a type tender engine. The Albert was sold in 1959 to the Sutton Junk and Salvage Company in New Iberia, Louisiana and then sold in 1960 to the American Railroad Equipment Association, which had built a series of tourist railroads. It was restored using the last replacement boiler built before Davenport ceased manufacturing locomotives. Albert ran a few seasons at the Cherokee Wonderland tourist railroad in Cherokee, North Carolina. It was pictured in Ron Ziel's book Twilight of Steam Locomotives while at Cherokee. The engine was sold to Cedar Point in 1963 and remained in service until its official retirement after the Myron H. returned to service in 1991. It is currently on display in a pavilion across from Millennium Force. Whether or not it will run again is currently uncertain. Engine #7 \\"Little Engine\\" Engine #7, nicknamed the Little Engine, was built by the Plymouth Locomotive Works between the late 1960s and early 1970s for Cedar Point. It was custom ordered by the park, and while not a full-size locomotive, it was designed to look like a steam locomotive. The park traded the engine for a basket of tickets that allowed Plymouth Locomotive Works employees to spend a day at the park. The design is based on the mining locomotives that Plymouth was known for building with a straight 4 gasoline engine that has a 4 speed forward and reverse transmission. It is used by the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad for moving engines and empty coaches around the shop and railyard. The engine is also used for track work and maintenance. Grade crossings Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad grade crossing at Gemini Midway. The Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad utilizes nine grade crossings. Four of these are used by park guests and contain gates, lights, and bells to warn guests of an approaching train and to provide a safe barrier preventing guests from reaching the train. The remaining grade crossings all have stop signs and several have flashing lights, to warn approaching vehicles and pedestrians of oncoming trains. Stations There are currently two stations, the Main Station in Celebration Plaza and the Frontier Town Station in Frontier Town. Main Station The Main Station (also known as the Funway Station) is the first station on the line and serves as the main station for the Railroad, and is located in the center of Cedar Point next to the engine house and yard. When the station originally opened and the railroad charged admission, tickets were sold in the front windows. Since tickets are no longer needed to ride, the front half of the station is now storage. The building was moved before the 1970 season and placed closer to the tracks. Frontier Town Station The Frontier Town Station is located in the back of Cedar Point in front of Steel Vengeance, and next to the Maverick. At one time this station was one of only two ways to enter Frontier Town. The station building itself is not very large and does not resemble a traditional train station. Boneville Boneville is a western themed fictional town along the rails that is home to 52 mostly animatronic skeletons depicted as going about life in the American frontier. Activities depicted include a shoot out, going to school, a fire, and workers singing while they are doing maintenance on the railroad.

The Natchez and French had lived alongside each other in the Louisiana colony for more than a decade prior to the incident, mostly conducting peaceful trade and occasionally intermarrying. After a period of deteriorating relations, however, Natchez leaders were provoked to revolt when the French colonial commandant, Sieur de Ch√©part, demanded land from a Natchez village for his own plantation near Fort Rosalie. They plotted their attack over several days and managed to conceal their plans from most of the French; those who overheard and warned Ch√©part of an attack were considered untruthful and were punished. In a coordinated attack on the fort and the homesteads, the Natchez killed almost all of the Frenchmen, while sparing most of the women and African slaves. Approximately 230 colonists were killed overall, and the fort and homes were burned to the ground. When the French in New Orleans, the colonial capital, heard the news of the massacre, they feared a general Indian uprising and were concerned that the Natchez might have conspired with other tribes. They first responded by ordering a massacre of the Chaouacha people, who had no relation to the Natchez revolt, wiping out their entire village. The French and their Choctaw allies then retaliated against the Natchez villages, capturing hundreds of Natchez and selling them into slavery, although many managed to escape to the north and take refuge among the Chickasaw people. The Natchez waged low-intensity warfare against the French over the following years, but retaliatory expeditions against Natchez refugees among the Chickasaw in 1730 and 1731 forced them to move on and live as refugees among the Creek and Cherokee tribes. By 1736 the Natchez had ceased to exist as an independent people. The attack on Fort Rosalie destroyed some of the Louisiana colony's most productive farms and endangered shipments of food and trade goods on the Mississippi River. As a result, the French state returned control of Louisiana from the Company of the Indies to the crown in 1731, as the company had been having trouble running the colony. Louisiana governor √âtienne P√©rier was held responsible for the massacre and its aftermath, and he was recalled to France in 1732. Background Grand Village in the city of Natchez in 2008alt=A mound amidst a field of short grass, fallen leaves and a trail While descending the Mississippi River in 1682, Robert de La Salle became the first Frenchman to encounter the Natchez and declared them an ally. The Natchez were sedentary and lived in nine semi- autonomous villages; the French considered them the most civilized tribe of the region. By 1700 the Natchez' numbers had been reduced to about 3,500 by the diseases that ravaged indigenous populations in the wake of contact with Europeans, and by 1720 further epidemics had halved that population. Their society was strictly divided into a noble class called \\"the Suns\\" (Natchez: ') and a commoner class called in French \\"the Stinkards\\" (Natchez: '). Between 1699 and 1702, the Natchez received the explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in peace and allowed a French missionary to settle among them. At this time, the Natchez were at war with the Chickasaw people, who had received guns from their English allies, and the Natchez expected to benefit similarly from their relation with the French. Nonetheless, the British presence in the territory led the Natchez to split into pro-British and pro-French factions. The central village, called Natchez or the Grand Village, was led by the paramount chief Great Sun (Natchez: ') and the war chief Tattooed Serpent (Serpent Piqu√© in the French sources, Natchez obalalkabiche), both of whom were interested in pursuing an alliance with the French. First, Second and Third Natchez Wars The first conflict between the French and the Natchez took place in 1716, when the Governor of Louisiana, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, passed through Natchez territory and neglected to renew the alliance with the Natchez by smoking the peace calumet. The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by inviting them to attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French‚ÄìNatchez relations to further deteriorate. As part of the terms of the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials for the construction of a fort for the French. The fort was named Fort Rosalie, and it was aimed at protecting the French trade monopoly in the region from British incursions. By 1717, French colonists had established the fort and a trading post in what is now Natchez, Mississippi. They also granted numerous concessions for large plantations, as well as smaller farms, on land acquired from the Natchez. Relations between Natchez and colonists were generally friendly‚Äîsome Frenchmen even married and had children with Natchez women‚Äîbut there were tensions. There were reports of colonists abusing Natchez, forcing them to provide labor or goods, and as more colonists arrived, their concessions gradually encroached on Natchez lands. 1758 drawing of the Natchez paramount chief Great Sun, by alt=An antique line drawing of a man with a feather crown being carried by eight nearly naked carriers From 1722 to 1724, brief armed conflicts between the Natchez and French were settled through negotiations between Louisiana governor Bienville and Natchez war chief Tattooed Serpent. In 1723, Bienville had been informed that some Natchez had harassed villagers, and he razed the Natchez village of White Apple and enslaved several villagers, only to discover that the alleged harassment had been faked by the colonists to frame the Natchez. One of the later skirmishes in 1724 consisted of the murder of a Natchez chief's son by a colonist, to which the Natchez responded by killing another Frenchman named Guenot. Bienville then sent French soldiers from New Orleans to attack the Natchez at their fields and settlements, and the Natchez surrendered. Their plea for peace was met following the execution of one of their chiefs by the French. Chronicler Le Page du Pratz, who lived among the Natchez and was a close friend of Tattooed Serpent, records that he once asked his friend why the Natchez were resentful towards the French. Tattooed Serpent answered that the French seemed to have \\"two hearts, a good one today, and tomorrow a bad one\\", and proceeded to tell how Natchez life had been better before the French arrived. He finished by saying, \\"Before the arrival of the French we lived like men who can be satisfied with what they have, whereas today we live like slaves, who are not suffered to do as they please.\\" The most faithful ally of the French, Tattooed Serpent died in 1725, another blow to the relations between the Natchez and the colonists. According to archaeologist Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, another factor that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists was the fact that the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez. Commandant Ch√©part In 1728, Sieur de Ch√©part (also known as Etcheparre and Chopart), whom Governor √âtienne P√©rier had recently appointed as commandant of Fort Rosalie, was brought to New Orleans and put on trial before the governor for abuse of power, specifically behavior toward the Natchez that was unpopular among the French. Ch√©part was saved from punishment, however, by \\"the interference of influential friends\\", and upon returning to the fort, he continued to administer it as he had before. Ch√©part told the Natchez that November that he wished to seize land for a plantation in the center of White Apple, where the Natchez had a temple of their people's graves. Governor P√©rier sided with Ch√©part and planted a cross on the land he sought. By this point, most of the colonists disapproved of Ch√©part's actions, including Jean- Fran√ßois-Benjamin Dumont de Montigny, a French historian who wrote that Ch√©part's demand marked the first time that a French colonial leader had simply claimed Natchez land as his own, without prior negotiations. When the Natchez began to protest the seizure of their land for the plantation, Ch√©part said he would burn down the temple that contained their ancestors' graves. In response to this threat, the Natchez seemed to promise to cede the land, wrote Dumont de Montigny, but only if they were given two months to relocate their temple and graves. Ch√©part agreed to give them the time in exchange for pelts, oil, poultry, and grain‚Äîa request the Natchez promised to fulfill later. Attack The event took place in what is now Natchez National Historical Park in Natchez, Mississippi, along the lower Mississippi River. The Natchez then began to prepare for a strike on the French at Fort Rosalie, borrowing firearms from some French colonists with promises to go hunting and to share the game with the guns' owners. Some French men and women overheard the Natchez planning such an attack. According to Le Page du Pratz, it was the Natchez female chief Tattooed Arm who attempted to alert the French of an upcoming attack led by her rivals at White Apple. When colonists told Ch√©part, he disregarded them and placed some in irons on the night before the massacre, when he was drunk. On the morning of November 29, 1729, the Natchez came to Ch√©part with corn, poultry, and deerskins, also carrying with them a calumet‚Äîwell known as a peace symbol. The commandant, still somewhat intoxicated from drinking the night before, was certain that the Natchez had no violent intentions, and he challenged those who had warned of an attack to prove that the rumors were accurate. While Ch√©part was accepting the goods, the Natchez started firing, giving the signal for a coordinated attack on Fort Rosalie and on the outlying farms and concessions in the area now covered by the city of Natchez. Ch√©part ran to call his soldiers to arms, but they had already been killed. The details of the attack are mostly unknown, as chroniclers such as Le Page du Pratz, who talked with several eyewitnesses, stated that the events were \\"simply too horrific\\" to recount. The Natchez had prepared by seizing the galley of the Company of the Indies anchored on the river, so that no Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape. They had also stationed warriors on the other side of the river to intercept those who might flee in that direction. The commandant at the Yazoo trading post of Fort St. Pierre, Monsieur du Cod√®re, was visiting Fort Rosalie with a Jesuit priest when they heard gunshots. They turned around to return to their ship, but warriors caught up with them, killing and scalping them. The Natchez killed almost all of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and African slaves were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen defending their husbands from the violence, or trying to avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some scholars argue that the Natchez spared the African slaves due to a general sense of affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some enslaved people joined the Natchez against the people who held them against their will, while others took the chance to effect their own freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Cod√®re remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers. The Natchez lost only about 12 warriors during the attack. Eight warriors died attacking the homestead of the La Loire des Ursins family, where the men had been able to prepare a defense against the intruding Natchez. Ch√©part himself was taken captive by the Natchez, who were at first unsure what to do with him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard‚Äîa member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was employed by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view. French response Map published in 1753 by Dumont de Montigny in his M√©moires Historiques sur la Louisiane, with labels added to show locations of places mentioned in the text News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans in early December, and the colonists there began to panic. The city depended upon grain and other supplies from the Illinois settlement, and shipments up and down the Mississippi River would be threatened by the loss of Fort Rosalie. Governor P√©rier reacted to the massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of Choctaw people into the city, for fear that they were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack. He then ordered slaves and French troops to march downstream and massacre a small village of Chaouacha people who had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been intended to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists. Many Louisiana colonists‚ÄîDumont de Montigny in particular‚Äîblamed Ch√©part (who was killed by the Natchez) and P√©rier for the massacre; Louis XV, the French king, ordered P√©rier back to France in 1732. P√©rier's replacement was his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region. A year earlier, the Company of the Indies had given up control of the colony to Louis XV because it had been costly and difficult to manage even before the rebellion. More serious retaliation against the Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and Henri de Loubo√´y. The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built near the site of the Grand Village of the Natchez, a mile or so east of Fort Rosalie, which had been rebuilt. They killed about 80 men and captured 18 women, and released some French women who had been captured during the massacre of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from Tunica and Choctaw warriors. The Choctaw attacked the Natchez without the French, killing 100 and capturing women and children. This ruined the element of surprise for the French as the Natchez had already scattered. At first, the Natchez were well prepared for French retaliatory strikes, having stocked up several cannons as well as the firearms that they had used in the massacre two months earlier. The Natchez captured by the Choctaw and Tunica allies of the French were given over to the governor and sold into slavery, and some were publicly tortured to death in New Orleans. In late February 1730, with Loubo√´y seeking to catch the Natchez by surprise, the Natchez negotiated a peace treaty and freed French captives, but the French planned an attack on the Natchez fort the following day. The Natchez then brought gifts to Loubo√´y, but left their fort that night and escaped across the Mississippi River, taking African slaves with them. The next day, Loubo√´y and his men burned down the abandoned Grand Village fort as the Natchez hid in the bayous along the Black River. A subsequent expedition led by P√©rier in 1731 to dislodge the Natchez captured many of them and their leaders, including Saint Cosme, who was the new Great Sun, and his mother‚Äîthe Female Sun, Tattooed Arm. The 387 captives, most of whom had belonged to the pro- French faction of the Natchez, were sold into slavery in Saint-Domingue. Many other Natchez escaped again, now taking refuge with the Chickasaw. Over the next decade, the few hundred remaining Natchez lived a life on the run, waging a low-intensity guerrilla campaign against the French. French historian Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix wrote in his history, \\"We were not slow in perceiving that the Natchez could still render themselves formidable, and that the step of sending the Sun and all who had been taken with him to be sold as slaves in Saint-Domingue, had rather exasperated than intimidated the remnant of that nation, in whom hatred and despair had transformed their natural pride and ferocity into a valor of which they were never deemed capable.\\" The French continued to press for the destruction of the Natchez who now lived among the Chickasaw, traditional allies of the British‚Äîthis sparked the Chickasaw Wars. The Chickasaw at first agreed to drive out the Natchez from among them, but they did not keep good on the promise. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1736, the French, under Governor Bienville, attacked the Chickasaw villages of Apeony and Ackia, and then retreated, suffering significant casualties, but inflicting few. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1739, Bienville summoned more than 1,000 troops to be sent over from France. Bienville's army ascended the Mississippi River to the site of present-day Memphis, Tennessee, and attempted to build a military road westward toward Chickasaw villages. After waiting for months in the winter of 1739‚Äì40, the French never mounted an attack and retreated back to New Orleans. After having suffered the attacks against the Chickasaw, the remaining Natchez moved on to live among the Cherokee and Creek people. By that time the Natchez, reduced to scattered refugees, had ceased to exist as a political entity.

The Natchez revolt figured as an event of monumental significance in French historiography and literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. In France, the massacre and its aftermath was described in numerous historical works and inspired several works of fiction. Eighteenth-century historians generally attributed the Natchez uprising to oppression by Commandant Ch√©part. In the French sources, one important discussion has centered on the question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor √âtienne P√©rier, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. P√©rier then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. P√©rier in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that P√©rier's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana. To describe the details of the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural. Fran√ßois- Ren√© de Chateaubriand depicted the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and Ren√© into a longer narrative that greatly embellished the history of the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining moment in the history of the Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th- century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny. The 19th- century Louisiana historian Charles Gayarr√© also embellished the story of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in the attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources. In contrast to the French tradition, the Natchez and their conflicts with the French have been mostly forgotten in contemporary American historiography. Historian Gordon Sayre attributes this to the fact that both the French and the Natchez were defeated in colonial wars before the birth of the United States.

Overview Jensen's argument consisted of a series of related claims.Loehlin, Lindzey and Spuhler (1975) IQ tests are valid measurements of a real human ability‚Äîwhat people generally describe as \\"intelligence\\"‚Äîthat is important to many parts of contemporary life. Intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is about 80 percent heritable. Intelligent parents are much more likely to have intelligent children than other parents. Remedial educational programs have failed to raise the measured intelligence of individuals or groups. Indeed, one of the most inflammatory sentences is the opener: \\"Compensatory education has been tried and apparently has failed.\\" The article generated extensive discussion and controversy both in the popular press and in the academic literature.Jencks and Phillips (1998) The article prompted 29 academic rebuttals published in the same journal, which eventually decided to refuse reprints or allow Jensen to respond to critical letters. Many college students also responded to the publication of the paper by burning effigies of Jensen and sending him death threats. In 1982, Schiff et al. conducted an adoption study that aimed to provide a direct answer to the question Jensen had posted in his 1969 paper. They reported that children who were adopted into families of a higher social class experienced, on average, \\"an increase of 14 IQ points in the mean IQ score estimated with 2 tests and a reduction by a factor of 4 in the probability of repeating a grade.\\" Jensen's critics argue that most aspects of his analysis were flawed: IQ tests do not provide a stable or meaningful measure of intelligence; IQ is affected by the environment and not solely or mainly a function of genetics; there is no evidence for genetic differences in racial intelligence; and that the entire topic was too controversial to be productively discussed. Controversy over the article led to the coining of the term \\"Jensenism\\" defined as the theory that IQ is largely determined by genes, including racial heritage.

He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, where he also won an NCAA championship his freshman year in 1995. Johnson played eight years professionally in multiple countries, winning the Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) Champions Cup in 2002 and being named the tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP). He later worked as a basketball analyst for Fox Sports before starting his own sports website, JerseyChaser.com. Johnson played high school basketball for Crenshaw High School, where he was named Los Angeles City Section Player of the Year and won two consecutive California state basketball championships. He and his father, Marques‚Äîwho played basketball professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and college under legendary coach John Wooden at UCLA‚Äîare one of the few father‚Äìson combinations to either each be named Los Angeles City Section Player of the Year or to have both won an NCAA basketball championship. Early life Johnson was born in Los Angeles on July 18, 1975 to former NBA player Marques Johnson and health and beauty practitioner Sabrina Sheran. He changed schools often due to his father's changing locations during his professional basketball career. He estimated he attended 27 schools. In 1987, Johnson was instructed to watch his 15-month-old brother, Marques Jr., when his little brother later accidentally drowned in the pool of the family's home in Bel Air in Los Angeles. Johnson contemplated suicide. His parents decided to move Johnson to Atlanta with his mother to ease the pain. He ended up in juvenile court after a school incident and was later kicked out of the Clayton County school system. After repeated conflicts with his mother, Johnson returned to Los Angeles, and he did not speak to his mother for three years. Johnson gained weight and was taunted by kids. He played two years at Montclair Prep, where he lost between his freshman and sophomore years. He transferred his junior year from the private school of mostly whites to Crenshaw High School, a predominantly black public school. His father had told him that his best chance of playing for a big Division I college like UCLA was to attend a school like Crenshaw, where Marques had starred. Johnson averaged 22.6 points and 14 rebounds his first season at Crenshaw and won the Los Angeles City Section 4-A Player of the Year; he and Marques, who won the award in 1973, became the first father‚Äìson combo to be honored. Johnson won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) State Division I championship with Crenshaw that season as well as in his senior year in 1994. He averaged 23.3 points and 9.2 rebounds his final season. Johnson associated with gangs while at Crenshaw, which was in the Crips' territory. He was once shot at by a member of the Bloods, a rival gang. UCLA career Johnson caught UCLA's attention during recruiting with his ability to score and rebound in traffic. He was tough to defend, especially when he backed in toward the basket. He became the third Crenshaw High basketball player to attend UCLA‚Äîhis father was the first. Marques had won the 1977 John R. Wooden Award as the college basketball player of the year. Johnson chose UCLA over Washington State, Arizona State, Arizona, Loyola Marymount, Ohio State and Louisville. He was a key player from 1994‚Äì98 at UCLA, where he wore his father's No. 54. Like his father, he won a national championship. The Johnsons are one of four father- son duos to each win an NCAA basketball championship. UCLA was 102‚Äì27 and won three consecutive Pacific-10 titles during Johnson's career. A swingman with the ability to score in the low post and outside, Johnson was at times between and overweight. Combined with his temper, he was called by one newspaper \\"The Round Mound of Sound\\", a play on Charles Barkley's nickname of \\"The Round Mound of Rebound\\". Johnson lost another after his first year. He was listed at in his senior year. He was slowed by arthroscopic surgery the summer before in his college freshman season. After impressive preseason practices during the fall, UCLA coaches projected him as a major contributor. However, he suffered a small stress fracture in his left leg and was sidelined for one month. Johnson returned heavier, but never regained his conditioning and was removed from UCLA's regular rotation. He initially pouted on the bench and was thrown out of practice, but he later became supportive of the team's success and retained his teammates' respect. UCLA won the NCAA tournament, which Johnson in 2009 called \\"the greatest experience of his life.\\" His second season in 1995‚Äì96 ended with UCLA's 43‚Äì41 upset loss to Ivy League champion Princeton in the first round of the NCAA tournament. \\"There was just a lot of chemistry- type issues about who was going to be the star,\\" said Johnson about the team. \\"I can't say we were the most focused team going into the tournament. We kind of went into it like, 'Ivy League, schmivey league.' It was a total 'whatever.' What-ever.\\" In his junior season in 1996‚Äì97, the Bruins won 12 consecutive game before losing in the Elite Eight. Johnson was suspended for 50 days in the 1997‚Äì98 season, reportedly violating the school's drug policy on marijuana. He also enrolled in a violence intervention program. While nobody ever blamed Johnson for Marques Jr.'s death, he was not able to overcome the guilt over the death until after his suspension. \\"I knew I couldn't carry that weight for the rest of my life. My career, everything I had worked for, was hanging in the balance. My life flashed before my eyes,\\" he said. Johnson led UCLA in scoring in his senior year with an 18.4 average, 21.1 in Pac-10 play. He also averaged 5.0 rebounds and was named All-Pac-10 honorable mention. He was honored as the team's co-Most Valuable Player along with Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson. Johnson became so responsible after the suspension that coach Steve Lavin used him as a model for the freshmen. \\"The trivial things that made him mad before don't bother him. He sees the bigger picture. He always felt like he had something to prove. Now, he seems at peace,\\" said Bailey. The team advanced to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament that season. Professional career The Los Angeles Daily News wrote that Johnson lacked the quickness and defensive ability to play shooting guard in the NBA, and was too short to play small forward. He was projected to be an undrafted free agent or a player in Europe. Johnson was drafted by the Yakima Sun Kings in the eighth round with the 67th pick of the 1998 Continental Basketball Association draft. \\"I saw him work out in Seattle with (NBA draft picks) Felipe L√≥pez, Corey Benjamin and Miles Simon, and he was as good or better than those guys,\\" said Kings coach Paul Woopert. He played professionally for eight seasons in Russia, Turkey, Qatar, Lebanon, and China.Sechback 2009, 1:59 He started playing in Russia for Avtodor Saratov before playing in Turkey for a few months. He returned to the United States and played in the Continental Basketball Association for the Quad City Thunder in the 1999‚Äì2000 season and briefly the next season for the Sioux Falls Skyforce in 2000. He next went to Qatar and played in 2001‚Äì2003 with Al Rayyan, winning the 2002 Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) Champions Cup; Johnson scored 32 points in the championship game and was named the MVP of the tournament. He later went to Lebanon to join Riyadi, and then Antranik in 2005. Outside basketball Johnson worked at Fox Sports starting in 2008, where he worked for three years and served as a college basketball studio analyst and co-host of a segment named \\"Beyond the Arc.\\"Sechback 2009, 2:46 He managed several business ventures, and started the sports website JerseyChaser.com.Sechback 2009, 0:39 Personal Johnson has a younger brother, Josiah, who also played basketball at Montclair Prep and UCLA.

During rolling they are often filled with ground walnuts. Immediately after baking, they are immersed for a few seconds in cold syrup made of honey and sugar dissolved in water. Finally, they are decorated with ground, as well as bigger pieces of walnut. Dark chocolate-covered melomakarona are also a more recent variation of the traditional recipe.

During the mid-1970s, the only genre-specific musical awards ceremonies were for country music (where the Nashville-based Country Music Association, West Coast-oriented Academy of Country Music and short-lived Association of Country Entertainers all had competing awards ceremonies at the time). Up to this point, rock music, in its various forms, had been the dominant form of American popular music since overtaking doo-wop in the 1950s; as such, rock songs dominated general music awards such as the Grammy Awards and American Music Awards. By the mid-1970s, however, disco began a rise to mainstream popularity, pushing rock into a niche. The Rock Music Awards were conceived as a way to continue to recognize rock music that was not being recognized due to the rise of disco. The Rock Music Awards was not able to establish a long-term presence, and the ceremony was not reprised after the third edition. History The first annual awards program was produced in the summer of 1975 in Los Angeles by Don Kirshner and featured Elton John and Diana Ross as hosts and presenters. Winners of the 1975 awards included Elton John as 'Rock Personality of the Year' and The Who's Tommy as 'Rock Movie of the Year.' Linda Ronstadt was awarded the 'Best Rock Female Vocalist' honor, which she would also win the next two years after that. Other winners included The Eagles, Stevie Wonder and Bad Company. The Second Annual awards show featured Diana Ross and Alice Cooper as hosts and presenters. The Third Annual awards show featured Olivia Newton-John, pre- Grease, and Peter Frampton at the height of his fame as hosts and presenters.

He served as an officer of Hessian j√§gers during the American Revolutionary War. He wrote a series of letters to his Minister of War which survive as an important historical record. Some time after the war, he offered his sword to the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 he commanded a brigade in the Prussian army and was captured in one of the early battles. American Revolution Hinrichs was born in 1752Montag, Lexikon: He-Hn and joined the army of Hesse-Kassel. He fought in the American Revolutionary War as part of the first group of Hessian soldiers to arrive in America starting in 1776. While serving as a lieutenant of j√§gers, he was badly wounded in the chest during the New York and New Jersey Campaign. He was promoted to captain in 1778 and wounded \\"several\\" more times during the war. He penned a series of letters to Friedrich Christian Arnold von Jungkenn, the Hesse-Kassel Minister of State. These missives survived and provide an important account of the war.Boatner (1994), 503 On 18 January 1778 he wrote that the Americans were not, \\"to be despised\\", and that it only, \\"requires Time and good leadership to make them formidable\\".Wright (1989), 152. The author named him Johann Heinrichs but it is clearly the same person. He also described his activities in detail during the Siege of Charleston in 1780. Historian Mark M. Boatner III remarked that his writings show that, \\"he was well-educated and had a keen and intelligent interest in a wide variety of subjects from fighting to music\\". He was trained as an engineer, fought as a j√§ger officer, and entered the line infantry in 1784. Transferring his allegiance to Prussia soon after, he was granted a title of nobility. Napoleonic Wars Map of the Battle of Halle on 17 October 1806 By 1806, Hinrichs was a General-major in command of a brigade in Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg's Prussian Reserve in the War of the Fourth Coalition. On 17 October 1806, he fought in the Battle of Halle against the French I Corps under France Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Hinrichs' Advance Guard was made up of the Borell Fusilier battalion Nr. 9, Knorr Fusilier battalion Nr. 12, and Hinrichs Fusilier battalion Nr. 17, two squadrons of Usedom Hussar Regiment Nr. 10, one squadron of Hertzberg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 9, one squadron of Heyking Dragoon Regiment Nr. 10, and two horse artillery pieces.Smith (1998), 226-227 W√ºrttemberg's two infantry divisions lined up facing the city of Halle on the east bank of the Saale River. Meanwhile, Hinrichs defended the bridges on the west side of the city with a screen of infantry and dragoons, plus a few artillery pieces. Pierre Dupont de l'Etang sent the 32nd Line Infantry Regiment charging east along the causeway that led to the bridges with the 9th Light Infantry and three cannons in support. The French smashed through the Prussian defenses and quickly seized an island in the river. The Prussian foot soldiers remaining on the west bank were rounded up and captured while the dragoons swam their horses to safety. Within an hour Dupont's soldiers captured all three bridges and made Hinrichs a prisoner. Rushing into Halle, the I Corps overran a Prussian battalion and routed another from the city.Petre (1993), 206 In the subsequent fighting, W√ºrttemberg's force was badly mauled, losing 5,000 killed, wounded, and captured. Bernadotte reported only 800 casualties. In the War of the Sixth Coalition, Hinrichs commanded 8,400 Prussian Landwehr at the siege of K√ºstrin. The operation lasted from April 1813 to 7 March 1814 before 5,000 French troops under Jean-Louis Fournier d'Albe surrendered. Hinrichs led three battalions each of the 1st East Prussian, 2nd East Prussian, and 3rd Neumark Landwehr Regiments, two squadrons of the 2nd Neumark Landwehr Cavalry Regiment, and one 6-pound foot battery.Smith (1998), 508 Hinrichs was promoted to Generalleutnant before his death in 1834.Montag, Lexikon: He-Hn.

Description Emily Thorne has been described as a flawed and multifaceted heroine figure. Due to her father being betrayed and her being forced into foster care and juvenile detention, Thorne has become emotionally troubled. Emily VanCamp, who portrays Thorne, described the character as having become \\"corrupted\\" to the point where VanCamp was concerned that it would be difficult to make Thorne appealing to audiences. The character usually appears calm and cold while dealing with difficult circumstances but as the series progresses, she begins to reveal vulnerabilities in her demeanor and reacts more emotionally to situations, which also impedes her efforts to get vengeance. According to VanCamp, Thorne has tried to bury her emotions but has an unstable emotional side, which means her feelings come out in extremes. Emily Thorne is a modern female interpretation of the character Edmond Dant√®s from The Count of Monte Cristo. In Revenge Thorne serves as a modern female version of Edmond Dant√®s, the lead character from The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, which is the novel that inspired the series. According to Anthony Letizia of alterna- Tv.com, similar to Dant√®s being falsely imprisoned for fourteen years on the charge of treason, Thorne was imprisoned in juvenile detention and her father was framed for the crime of financing a terrorist attack on the United States. Thorne has been left shares in Nolcorp which she liquidates to the value of $40 billion and is a fund for her revenge against the Grayson family, making her the second richest character in the series after Nolan. Letizia notes several more similarities between the characters such as both of them training in combat after leaving incarceration in preparation for their plans of revenge and both pursuing revenge against a group of powerful and wealthy conspirators. Her pursuit of revenge has been noted as a sympathetic aspect of the character. Commentators cited the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession as making viewers more receptive to Thorne's efforts to get revenge against a group of privileged elites for the harm they caused her family. VanCamp described the character as \\"quite justified in what she's doing\\" adding that \\"everybody can connect with the theme of revenge, whether they act on it or not.\\" The character's \\"girl next door\\" appearance is attributed as contributing to this appeal, with show producer Mike Kelly suggesting that it means viewers are \\"rooting for her even though she's doing something that's kind of diabolical.\\" Madeline Stowe, who portrays the antagonist Victoria Grayson on Revenge, has likened her own character to Thorne. Stowe notes the two characters as being complicated and said that Thorne is on a similarly amoral path as Victoria. She suggests that because of these similarities her character is able to recognize \\"something really amiss\\" about Thorne. Lyle Masaki of AfterElton also noted similarities between the characters stating that they are \\"equally cool customers, equally matched and neither are completely sympathetic.\\" Like her father, she is incredibly intelligent and is capable of resolving complicated situations with great cleverness. She is also proficient in shooting and martial arts and speaks fluent French and Japanese. Emily does not kill her targets, although some of her actions have led to people dying at the hands of others. \\"Illusion\\" reveals Emily's birthdate as July 11, 1984, making her 27‚Äì28 years old during the events of season 2, which takes place in 2012. She has a net worth of $1 billion, as stated on the show (although ABC.com's biography states that \\"only Emily Thorne knows\\"). As of \\"Endurance\\" Emily's wounds from being shot in the stomach by Daniel have left her unable to have biological children. Character arc Background Amanda Clarke was the daughter of the Clarke family, living in the Hamptons in 1992. Her mother, Kara Wilkins, was said to have died of illness when Amanda was five, although Amanda later discovered her mother isolated herself due to her psychological issues. David, who worked as a hedge fund manager at Grayson Global, was having an affair with his boss Conrad Grayson's wife, Victoria, and they were prepared to divorce their respective spouses to marry each other. During this time, Conrad Grayson, Victoria's husband, laundered money to a terrorist group, Americon Initiative, which they used to bring down Flight 197. Desiring to save themselves, Conrad and Victoria manipulated the evidence to point to David Clarke. The FBI arrested David for treason, while Amanda was taken into foster care for at least eight years, and she never saw her father again. She spent two years at Alanwood Juvenile Detention Center, until she was released to Nolan Ross, a friend of her father's, who informed her of the truth and gave her a wooden box of mementos from her father (dubbed the \\"Infinity Box\\"), along with 49% shares of stock in Nolan's computer software company, NolCorp, in which her father had invested. She has a tattoo on her wrist of a double infinity symbol, representing her father's love for \\"infinity times infinity\\", as he told her as a child. David had pleaded with her in his journals not to confront the true culprits behind Flight 197, but she refused to follow his advice. She spends several years researching the members of the conspiracy and creating an elaborate fake back-story by changing her name to the one of her former cellmate, to seek revenge. Season 1 The \\"Pilot\\" begins by showing the future \\"Fire and Ice\\" engagement party for Emily and Daniel Grayson, the son of Conrad and Victoria Grayson, taking place on Labor Day Weekend. All seems to be going well until a body assumed to be Daniel's is discovered on the beach by his sister Charlotte. Five months before, Emily rents her childhood beach home and begins her revenge plan by destroying the careers and lives of the minor players in the conspiracy against her father, beginning with Lydia Davis, her father's secretary and Conrad's mistress. She saves Conrad and Victoria for last, and schemes to marry their son Daniel in order to have access to the Grayson family records. Nolan Ross, a billionaire software developer and friend of David Clarke, recognizes Emily as Amanda and deduces her plans for revenge. He offers to assist her; she initially rejects him, but later counts on him as a trusted ally. Daniel's college friend, Tyler Barrol, shows up in the Hamptons to stay with the Graysons. Emily is distrustful of him from the start, while Emily's friend and Victoria's event planner, Ashley Davenport, is smitten with him. When Lydia returns, determined to get her house and reputation back after her affair with Conrad was revealed, she blackmails the Graysons and Emily. Emily, however, sets her up to take the fall for her other takedowns, causing the Grayson head of security Frank Stevens to throw her off her balcony, although she survives. Emily sends Conrad a video recording of the Frank and Lydia incident, which causes Conrad to fire Frank. As a result, Frank attempts to regain favor with the Graysons by digging into Emily's past. He discovers Emily's former cellmate, the real Emily Thorne who is posing as Amanda Clarke, but she murders him before he can warn Victoria. After \\"Amanda\\" alerts Emily to the killing, Emily sets up the Graysons for Frank's murder. Her attempts to send Amanda away fail, and her former cellmate stays in the Hamptons and becomes involved with Emily's old friend Jack Porter. Tyler, meanwhile, becomes a larger problem, and Emily enlists Nolan to get rid of him, only for him to begin a romantic relationship with Tyler. Emily exposes Tyler's misdeeds, but Tyler ends up blackmailing Conrad when he tries to fire him. Emily steals the leverage Tyler has on Conrad, and Daniel evicts him from Grayson Manor. Daniel's birthday party later goes awry when Tyler appears and holds the party at gunpoint. Daniel and Jack get the upper hand and have Tyler arrested by the police. Emily burns down the house of her antepenultimate target Mason Treadwell, an author who wrote a faux tell-all about David Clarke, destroying his work. Before the fire, she steals several of his interview tapes, which reveal that Charlotte, the Graysons' daughter, is her biological half-sister. Emily uses this against Victoria, and Conrad threatens to expose this information in the midst of their divorce proceedings. Emily returns home one day to find her Infinity Box missing. Tyler, who has escaped custody, reveals himself as the thief and that he has kidnapped Amanda. When Amanda turns on Emily, she enlists her mentor Satoshi Takeda for assistance at her engagement party. Takeda retrieves her Infinity Box and murders Tyler on the beach before fleeing with Amanda. Returning to the starting point of the pilot, the partygoers find that the body is not that of Daniel, but Tyler, and Daniel becomes the prime suspect. Emily discovers that Victoria hired a contractor named Lee Moran to attack Daniel in order to have him released on bail. Emily implicates Moran in Tyler's murder, and he is later found dead in prison, seemingly having committed suicide, although Emily discovers that Conrad contracted to have him killed by the same man as her father's killer. Investigating her father's murder, Emily learns that Conrad often spoke with a \\"white-haired man\\", whom she discovers is her father's killer. She becomes determined to kill him. Victoria acquires immunity as she exposes Conrad to the SEC. She later hands evidence of David Clarke's innocence over to Daniel, only for Emily to steal it from Daniel's briefcase. The white-haired man abducts Nolan. Emily rescues him and attacks the white-haired man, but she spares his life. Nolan hands Victoria's evidence over to the SEC, but as Victoria and Lydia come forward as witnesses, the plane carrying them to the hearing crashes, supposedly killing them and destroying the evidence. However, Nolan reveals that he copied a hard drive in Conrad's evidence, which contains a video that reveals Emily's supposedly deceased mother to be alive. Season 2 Emily in the second season premiere. In the second season premiere, the Amanda (Jack Porter's boat) is shown as having sunk, with at least one casualty. Three months earlier, Emily returns to the Hamptons after a long absence and begins to investigate what happened to her mother, Kara Wallace Clarke. At a Memorial Day party, Charlotte tells Emily that Victoria is alive and in hiding before she is taken back to rehab at Conrad's doing. After Emily visits Victoria, she contracts the white-haired man to kill her. Victoria double-crosses the white-haired man (Gordon Murphy), who was helping her and Charlotte to disappear, causing him to seek out Emily for assistance. She asks for information about her mother, but Murphy attempts to kill her again. He is killed by Emily's ex-lover Aiden Mathis before she can learn more. Kara eventually resurfaces, but recognizes Amanda, not Emily as her daughter. Mason Treadwell also returns, and discovers the truth about Amanda Clarke only to be framed by Emily for Gordon Murphy's death. They strike a deal in which he will take the fall until Emily finishes her revenge, in exchange for the rights to her biography and an exoneration. Emily assists Daniel in becoming elected CEO of Grayson Global. His victory draws out Helen Crowley from the Initiative. Emily abducts Crowley and Aiden and \\"dies\\" in an ensuing shootout in a ruse to make Crowley trust Aiden. Convinced that Victoria was involved, Crowley blackmails Aiden into killing her, though he discovers her leverage is false. Believing her to be a danger to Daniel, Victoria kills Crowley and leads the Initiative to believe that Amanda was behind her disappearance. The Initiative's intentions soon become clear: with the use of Nolan's incomplete \\"Carrion\\" project, they will disable the power in Manhattan for their next attack. To this end, they hire a young woman named Padma Lahari to obtain it from Nolan, though they develop a relationship. Emily learns that Conrad has bought half of the Stowaway, Jack's bar, and urges Amanda to buy it back. When Conrad refuses to sell it, Amanda uses Emily's laptop without her knowledge to blackmail him. Emily spots a man on the Amanda as it is leaving for Jack and Amanda's honeymoon. Nolan identifies him as Nate Ryan, a mobster with a vendetta against Jack. The two of them rescue Jack, though in an ensuing fight Nate destroys the boat and mortally wounds Amanda, who dies in Emily's arms on the water. Her thirst for revenge reignited, Emily sets out to identify and locate both \\"the Fa1c0n\\", a hacker employed by the Initiative, and Patrick, the secret firstborn son of Victoria. Because of the Fa1c0n, Nolan is unable to locate Padma before she is killed by \\"Trask\\" from the Initiative. Emily, Nolan and Aiden avenge Padma by having Lee arrested by the FBI, and killing Trask. As Daniel and Emily become re-engaged, Takeda returns with knowledge of the Initiative's next attack, but he is killed by Aiden in a battle. Afterwards, Aiden and Nolan bankrupt the Graysons against Emily's wishes, which activates the stolen Carrion program and shuts down the power across all of New York, commencing the Initiative's next attack. Emily learns that Takeda was tracking an assassin named Gregor Hoffman, who she finds posing as an IT tech at Grayson Global. Conrad, who reveals to Victoria his role in the Initiative, attempts to have Jack killed. In the midst of his gubernatorial election speech, an explosion occurs close by at the company with Jack and Declan inside. Emily later learns that while Jack escaped before the explosion, Declan did not. Daniel sends the police after Aiden, suspecting he perpetrated the attack, though Nolan is arrested due to the Fa1c0n's tampering. Aiden's fate is left uncertain after Daniel is seen with a bloodied shirt following a confrontation. After Declan dies of his injuries, Jack attempts to murder Conrad as he is making his winning speech. Emily stops him by revealing that she is Amanda Clarke. Season 3 In the third season premiere, Emily is shown in a wedding dress on a boat. She turns around, and apologizes to an unknown person, before she is shot twice, causing her to fall into the water. Two months earlier, she returns to the Hamptons having spent six months away. Emily poisons Conrad, which causes him to be falsely diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Emily and Daniel set a date for their wedding: August 8 (double infinity), the day she destroys Victoria. Emily destroys a new David Clarke conspirator, Paul Whitley, now a priest. However, she determines that he has atoned for his own sins, but is unable to undo her takedown. Feeling guilt, she requests his assistance in making Conrad confess to the conspiracy. Later, Emily pulls up to a crashed car on the side of the road and finds Whitley severely injured. After Whitley dies of his injuries, Emily suspects that Conrad murdered him, but discovers that the brakes on his car were tampered with. It is revealed that Patrick - who has reunited with Victoria - caused the accident in an attempt to kill Conrad and protect his mother. Emily reveals her final plan to Nolan and Jack: fake her death, and frame Victoria for her murder on her wedding day. To keep Daniel in her grasp, Emily claims she is pregnant. Lydia Davis, thought to have died in the plane crash at the end of season 1, returns and uncovers evidence that Emily has plotted against them. Lydia shows this evidence to Victoria, derailing her plan. In an argument, Emily reveals that she is not pregnant. Daniel overhears this and shoots her off the boat in a drunken rage. Barely surviving, Emily is discharged into Victoria's care, where she meets Niko, Takeda's daughter, who poses as her nurse. Niko has an agenda of her own, having come to the Hamptons to hunt down her father's killer. Emily initially plans to flee the Hamptons, but she changes her mind when she discovers that her injuries have sterilized her. She outs Lydia as her shooter to the press, blackmailing Daniel and Victoria to remain in the Grayson family. Daniel dates Sara and sits with her in bed to irk Emily, then Emily calls Sara's mom and after some disagreement Sara decides to leave. In a fit of rage Daniel attacks Emily grabbing her by the hair and pushing her onto the bed, he then says sterilising her was his gift to the universe. Aiden is abducted by Niko, who has discovered he killed her father, and she vows to kill Emily as revenge. Emily manages to defeat Niko in a difficult struggle, but spares her life. Stevie Grayson, a lawyer, Jack's mother and Conrad's ex-wife, is summoned to the Hamptons by Emily. She offers her assistance in Emily's scheme and reveals the existence of evidence disks confiscated by her law firm. Jack steals them, and they are revealed to contain a letter written by Victoria's lover Pascal LeMarchal, mentioning Aiden's father. Further investigations lead Aiden to Oscar Chapman, a reporter in hiding from the Graysons. Chapman reveals that Trevor Mathis was killed by Pascal, who in the present day tracks down Chapman and silences him as well. Emily poses as a Homeland Security agent and wins Pascal's allegiance in extracting a confession out of Conrad. However, this goes completely awry when he is pushed into a helicopter blade by Conrad and killed instantly. With all other options exhausted, Emily abducts Charlotte and holds her for ransom, but then releases her sister and has her extract a confession from Conrad, which is then broadcast on television. Conrad is arrested and David Clarke is finally exonerated. Dead set on destroying Victoria, Aiden goes to Michelle Banks, Emily's old therapist, but Victoria - now aware that Emily is Amanda Clarke - anticipates Aiden's visit, and murders him as revenge for Pascal's death. In her final revenge against Victoria, Emily has her committed to a psychiatric facility. Emily walks away as Victoria struggles and repeatedly screams that Emily is Amanda Clarke. Season 4 In the fourth season premiere, picking up six months following the events of \\"Execution\\", Emily has taken over Grayson Manor. Conrad was murdered and Victoria remains under psychiatric care, concluding her revenge. Despite this, she slowly begins to move on, but is galvanized back into action when Victoria escapes. One night, a hooded man attempts to kill Emily, but is scared off by Nolan. They are unable to recognize the assailant. Asked to look at police suspects, Emily is astonished to see her father, David Clarke among them. David claims that he was held captive by Conrad and tortured. However, Emily finds evidence suggesting that this is untrue and that David murdered Conrad. Victoria's hold over David delays Emily reconnecting with him. She eventually reveals herself to David, but he is unwilling to sever ties with Victoria. Two men attempt to abduct David, though Emily intervenes. David reveals that a rival of Conrad named Malcolm Black is hunting him. Emily discovers evidence that links him to FBI Agent Kate Taylor. Taylor approaches Emily and claims that Malcolm Black is holding her mother hostage. As they discuss how to dispose of him, Taylor reveals that not only is she his willing operative, but she is his daughter. The two women engage in a violent battle. Daniel, who happens upon the fight while on the beach runs to Emily's assistance only to be killed by Taylor. Jack kills Taylor moments later. Emily and Jack dispose of Kate's body and stage the scene as if Emily killed Daniel in self-defense. Seeking revenge, Malcolm Black abducts Emily and Victoria. Both women overcome him as David, Jack and the police find them. Emily brawls with Malcolm, but he gains the upper hand. Before he can kill her, David shoots Black into a furnace, killing him. After this, Emily begins a relationship with Jack's partner and later detective, Ben Hunter. Margaux LeMarchal, Daniel's pregnant girlfriend, repeatedly attempts to destroy Emily, culminating in a miscarriage. Feeling guilt, Emily changes her public narrative of Daniel's death to one closer to the truth and reveals her true identity to the world. After her reputation is publicly ruined, Victoria ends her own life by detonating Grayson Manor while inside, but leaves evidence suggesting she was murdered. Emily is arrested by the police. Jack and Nolan arrange for Margaux's arrest, allowing Emily to interrogate her. Margaux reveals that Victoria is in fact alive. Emily conveys this information to Ben, who investigates the home of a deceased woman whose body was used in the \\"murder\\". He finds Victoria, but is murdered by an assassin Margaux hired, \\"White Gold\\". Emily escapes to hunt down Victoria, discovering that she used her mother's body in the setup. White Gold stabs Jack, which pushes Emily to her breaking point. She confronts Victoria for the final time with the intention of killing her for her crimes. Before she can fire, David appears behind her and kills Victoria, who shoots Emily in the back before succumbing to her wounds. Emily barely survives with the help of a heart transplant, which is revealed in a recurring nightmare to have come from Victoria. It is left ambiguous as to whether this nightmare is real. David, who has cancer, is released on compassionate grounds before dying of the disease. Months later, Emily marries Jack and they sail off on their honeymoon. In a voiceover, she remarks that karma spared her from suffering the consequences of her actions, and asks the viewer to consider her story as they embark on a journey of revenge of their own. Relationships *Victoria Grayson - Emily detests and hates Victoria for her role in her father's downfall and wishes only to see her suffer, making her the ultimate target of her revenge. While Emily shows no trace of her negative feelings around Victoria, the two have a tense relationship throughout the series especially when Emily begins dating Daniel, Victoria's beloved son. Victoria's distrust of Emily goes as far as to suggest framing her for Tyler's murder because it was committed with her weapon, and contracting Gordon Murphy, who killed David, to kill Emily. Victoria later uncovers Emily's true identity and, feeling that she is responsible for the death of Pascal LeMarchal, murders Aiden. In retaliation, Emily leaves her in a mental institution. After six months, Victoria manages to escape and takes revenge on Emily by getting to her father first and feeding him lies. Emily admits that she has considered killing Victoria, but has not gone through with it because she had no intention of causing death and too many lives had been lost by that point. *Charlotte Grayson/Clarke - Initially, Emily and Charlotte had no interactions, until Emily discovered Charlotte was her half-sister from Mason Treadwell's interview tapes, and they grow close. Charlotte becomes one of the few people Emily seeks to protect from her revenge scheme. Charlotte developed an addiction to oxycodone, and she attempted suicide in the first season finale, though Emily's reaction to this was never depicted. At one point, Emily attempts to console Charlotte on her porch swing by telling Charlotte a story she remembers from her childhood that she claims Amanda told her. Charlotte trusted Emily enough to tell her that Victoria was alive and in hiding. Emily is shown to realize the relationship she is missing with Charlotte by posing as the real Emily Thorne, and vice versa. When Charlotte announces her decision to change her surname to Clarke on her 18th birthday, Emily is seen smiling. Animosity develops on Charlotte's part towards Emily when she discovers her pregnancy was false, and continues in spite of Emily revealing her true identity as her sister. Charlotte is so angered that she subdues Emily in the Stowaway and sets it ablaze in an attempt to kill her. Emily decides to forgive Charlotte, who later calls on her for help when she accidentally kills a man she had slept with, who threatened her father. Taking Emily's advice, Charlotte leaves for rehab. *Nolan Ross - Emily met Nolan when he released her from juvenile detention in 2002. He gave her the Infinity Box, which contained her father's possessions and proof of his innocence. Years later, when Emily returns to the Hamptons, Nolan offers his assistance, which she initially refuses. Despite being antagonistic with him at the start, Emily finds his technical genius and ability to be quite useful, though her plans put him in physical danger numerous times. She later warms to him and accepts him as a friend and trusted ally. Nolan also acts as her conscience and tries to reason with her when he feels she is taking things too far. Nolan considers Emily to be family, going so far as to give up Nolcorp, his company, to Grayson Global to prevent a forensic investigation that would expose Emily. Nolan affectionately refers to Emily as \\"Ems\\". Some fans support a romantic relationship between Nolan and Emily. While Gabriel Mann has entertained the prospect of \\"Nemily\\", creator Mike Kelley and VanCamp are opposed to the idea, considering Nolan and Emily to have a sibling relationship. *Daniel Grayson- As part of her revenge scheme, Emily planned to seduce Daniel and marry him to gain access to Grayson Global, in order to find evidence of her father's innocence. However, this is complicated by real feelings that Emily develops for him. They become engaged midway through the first season, although Daniel's decision to conceal his father's part in framing David Clarke ruins her love for him. The engagement ends when Ashley tells Daniel she saw Emily and Jack kissing. However, Daniel never quite gets over Emily, and she still views him as someone useful. They reunite, with Emily asking to take it slow, although she has a dream at one point where they engage in passionate sex. They become engaged again in season 2 and marry in the first part of season 3. However, on their honeymoon boat Daniel discovers Emily has been using him and shoots her off in a drunken rage. Emily becomes sterile as a result of these wounds, but stays in the marriage through blackmail for a little longer. After Daniel learns Emily's real identity, they become cordially, if not exactly friendly. Daniel finally understands why she used him, although he still resents her. Daniel overhears Emily fighting with Kate Taylor and runs to her assistance, taking a fatal gunshot wound for her. In his final moments, Emily holds him and admits that despite all that happened everything that the two shared was real. *Aiden Mathis - Emily met Aiden in 2006 at a New York nightclub when she was sent by Satoshi Takeda to access the kidnapper of Aiden's sister Colleen. Emily stops him from killing his sister's kidnapper twice and puts herself in physical danger to rescue him. Two years later, a flashback shows that Aiden was recruited by Takeda and that he and Emily had begun a relationship, a weakness Aiden exploited in their training. Aiden prepares to leave when Takeda locates his sister, and chooses to bring Emily, although he instead leaves her behind. This causes Emily to become embittered towards him in season 2, rejecting his attempts to reconcile. She eventually forgives Aiden and they rekindle their relationship. The two argue often, but have a deep love for one another. Aiden wishes for Emily to finish her revenge so that they can be together. This dream is shattered, however, when Victoria murders Aiden in cold blood. *Amanda Clarke - \\"Amanda Clarke\\", or the real Emily Thorne, was Emily's cellmate in juvenile detention. Initially, the two often engaged in physical fights, although they later became friends at the suggestion of their warden. Emily visits her friend in juvie and they agree to switch identities in return for $500,000. Eight years later, \\"Amanda\\" reunites with Emily when she murders Frank Stevens after he discovers their secret. Amanda then begins to complicate Emily's plans by becoming involved with Jack Porter and thus endangering him to the Graysons. Though the two have a rivalry, Amanda stands by her vow to \\"do anything\\" for Emily. Tyler later kidnaps Amanda and turns her against Emily, although she ultimately remains loyal to Emily and disappears from the Hamptons for several months. By the time she returns, she is six months pregnant with Jack's child, which breaks Emily's heart. Amanda, freshly trained by Takeda as an asset to Emily remains loyal even after she nearly loses her baby in a fall. At her son's baptism, she notices Emily's misery and believes she deserves a family like hers, a claim Emily rebuffs. Amanda desired to confess her identity to Jack, feeling guilt for stealing him from Emily, although Emily advised against it. In her dying moments, Amanda returns a locket necklace that Emily gave her years ago and thanks her for giving her a \\"real family\\". Emily is incredibly devastated after Amanda's death, which fuels her to refocus her revenge back onto the Graysons. *Kara Wallace Clarke - Emily had very few memories of her mother, who she believed dead of an illness unknown to her. After learning that she is in fact alive, Emily postpones her revenge plan and goes so far as to put Amanda's life on the line to locate her mother, only to be disappointed when she finally resurfaces. As a child, Kara's psychological issues led her to attempt to drown Emily, and to keep her from danger Kara left the Clarke family, David lying that she succumbed to her sickness. Despite Kara believing Amanda is her daughter, Emily attempts to build a friendly relationship with her mother through Amanda's son. Emily even visits Victoria to give her a wedding gift, which is really a ploy to see her mother for the \\"last\\" time. While she loves her mother, Emily knows that she is a danger to those around her and convinces her to leave the Hamptons after Aiden stops her from murdering the Graysons when she learns the truth about David. As Emily watches Kara leaving, she has a flashback where her mother sings to her as a child. *Gordon Murphy - As the killer of her father, Emily resents Murphy. It did not appear as if Emily was interested in identifying her father's killer until she listened into a conversation between Murphy and Conrad Grayson, which revealed their involvement in David's murder. Deciding that she will kill Murphy, the only time she has ever expressed interest in murdering someone herself, she reveals herself as Amanda Clarke to him and is brought to his secret torture chamber, where they engage in a fight, though she chooses to honor her father by not going through with the killing. This in turn leads to the destruction of the evidence Emily had accumulated when Murphy detonates the plane carrying Lydia and Victoria. Although Murphy meets with the Graysons a few times after the fight with Emily, for unknown reasons he does not reveal her identity to them. In season 2, Murphy asks Emily for tapes that will exonerate him as the \\"kidnapper\\" of Victoria, but when she asks for her mother he attempts to kill her only to be killed by Aiden Mathis. Emily later learns that Murphy is her stepfather through marriage to Kara Clarke. *Satoshi Takeda - Takeda recruited Emily after she was referred to him by Warden Stiles. From what has been seen thus far, it appears that while she could often be frustrated with Takeda, she still deeply respected him. In the present day, they have more differences and argue more often. Examples of this are when Takeda chastises her for being in love with Daniel and their fight in her home when he reveals he is Tyler's murderer and that he framed Daniel and Jack. At the start of season 2, after Aiden stops Emily from intentionally drowning (as a method of remembering her mother), Takeda disapproves of her desire to find her mother as it conflicts with revenge for her father. To this, Emily replies that after she learns her mother's fate, she will take down everyone who kept them apart, Takeda included. She also angrily thinks Takeda sent her a \\"nanny\\" in the form of Aiden when he comes to the Hamptons to help her. Takeda returns to the Hamptons months later and attempts to take Aiden away after revealing his past to Daniel, for which Emily scolds him. Takeda refuses to allow her and Aiden to help him prevent the Initiative's attack. In spite of Takeda's faults as perceived by Emily, she cries bitterly upon finding his body. Emily would later learn that Takeda was using her and Aiden to avenge the death of his fianc√©, an unrecorded passenger on Flight 197. Reception The choice of VanCamp to portray the character was generally well-received among critics, with Scott Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune citing VanCamp's past involvement with Everwood and Brothers & Sisters as helping audiences contrast Thorne's sympathetic appearance with her ruthless pursuit of vengeance. VanCamp's portrayal of the character has been praised by several critics for how she has depicted Thorne's charming and duplicitous nature. Daniel Fienberg of HitFix has been more negative regarding the portrayal of the character. When the show premiered Fienberg stated that, while he was appreciative of VanCamp's work on other shows, he felt she was \\"passive\\" in the role of Thorne and that she portrayed the character as \\"robotically efficient\\", which made Thorne a less sympathetic character for him. Catherine Weagle of the Salem State Log criticized VanCamp's portrayal, stating that Thorne's \\"revenge glare\\" was not sufficiently intimidating and also found it implausible that Thorne would be able to keep her true identity a secret. An initial review by Maureen Ryan of AOLTV was negative regarding the portrayal of the character, though Ryan faulted the premise of the show as making it difficult for VanCamp to portray Thorne realistically. Ryan became more positive about the character's portrayal as the show progressed stating that VanCamp had \\"made Emily more interesting than the character almost has a right to be.\\" Thorne's voice-over narrations during the show were described by Stephanie Goldberg of CNN as \\"insightful\\" and as being able to get the support of viewers, but other commentators have criticized the narrations as clich√© and formulaic. Fienberg stated that the narrations were devoid of meaning and attributed it to ABC having \\"an in-house style that says that having your female lead narrate nothingness at the start of every episode is a worthy strategy\\", which he stated does not provide a good setting for a story about revenge. Some critics favorably compared the role of Thorne on Revenge to that of Dexter Morgan on the Showtime series Dexter. Tierney Bricker of E! states that, like Dexter, Thorne captivates audiences even when they may not support her actions. In a review of the episode \\"Infamy\\" for ChicagoNow, Andrew Daglas noted the portrayal of Thorne burning down Treadwell's home in the episode and suggested that Thorne's actions would prompt audiences to question their sympathies for the character's pursuit of revenge. Daglas then states that the character of Dexter has prompted similar questions, adding that in both series the characters force viewers \\"to realize how easily our darkest impulses can bubble up to the surface, and how those impulses become more dangerous when they're wrapped in a nobler guise like justice.\\" In other media In early 2014, it was announced that Marvel Comics and ABC Studios had plans to jointly develop a comic book inspired by Revenge that detailed the origin of Emily Thorne. Co-authored by Ted Sullivan (a writer for the show) and Erica Schultz, and illustrated by Vincenzo Balzano, Dustin Nguyen, and Felix Ruiz, Revenge: The Secret Origin of Emily Thorne was published September 2, 2014. The story is set in Switzerland years before the events of the television series and follows Emily/Amanda on her first revenge mission, aided by her mentor Takeda. Marvel has stated that the comic's plot is considered canon.

In the book, Bensel undertakes an analysis of the causes of the American Civil War and the failed policies of Reconstruction to construct an argument about the rise of the American national state. The book is a contribution to scholarship on American Political Development and political and economic modernization. Synopsis Causes of the American Civil War Bensel argues that the attractiveness of secession for Southerners rested on a threefold calculation. First, the Republican Party won both the presidency in the election of Abraham Lincoln and a plurality in the House of Representatives at the 36th Congress. The Republicans represented a credible threat to the continued dominance of slavery in the national political economy, particularly when it came to the question of slavery in the western territories and the Lecompton Constitution. Second, secession would be a relatively easy process, with little disruption of state activity and no serious threat of social unrest from Southern whites. Third, secession would be increasingly difficult as the southern economy was increasingly bound up with and subordinated to the industrial northern economy. For this reason, it was seen as better to secede earlier rather than later. Given the attractiveness of secession for the South, Bensel argues that civil war became unavoidable for three reasons. First, there was an absence of constraints on the further radicalization of the Republican Party on the question of slavery. Radical Republicans could justify federal intervention on the grounds that the extinction of slavery was inevitable anyway, and moderate Republicans could justify restraint on the same grounds, but the fundamental agreement over the point, along with persistent pressure from the abolitionist base of the party gave the radical position an advantage. Second, the compromise measures proposed by the South were largely self-defeating. Bensel supports this point with an extended discussion of the contest for the Speaker of the House of the 36th Congress, in which John Sherman, the Republican candidate, was blocked for two months by Southern opposition and which concluded with the eventual election of William Pennington. Third, the threat of further fragmentation of the northern part of the country motivated federal intervention to prevent secession. Only New England was firmly Unionist in response to the secession of the south; the Midwest and other parts of the Northeast had more ambivalent responses to secession. Bensel argues that all of this precipitated a secession crisis in which the federal government completely lost control over its southern installations. The context of a lack of a substantial federal statist bureaucracy capable of handling the crisis meant that the only way to regain federal control was military intervention. Comparison of Union and Confederate states Secession and the subsequent war mobilization rendered the central state apparatuses of both the Union and the Confederacy substantially stronger than at any point in the antebellum United States. In a comparison of the two states regarding their relative sizes, and their relationships to their respective economic and social bases, Bensel argues that the Confederacy was, in many respects, much more statist and modern than the Union. =Theoretical framework= Bensel undertakes the analysis of the two states in a framework which distinguishes between the structural design of the state and the substantive content of its policies. Structural design refers to the skeletal form of organization of the state apparatuses themselves, while substantive content refers to the actions of the state. In total, Bensel investigates forty-two different policy areas under this framework. Structural design Dimensions of structural design of states There are two dimensions of structural design: centralization of authority and administrative capacity. Centralization of authority refers to measures which concentrate decision-making power in any of the central state institutions, while administrative capacity concerns the distribution of decision-making power between the central state institutions themselves. The state has a higher degree of centralized authority to the extent that it is able to shift discretion to itself from subordinate governments such as states, counties, and municipalities; and also to the extent that it encroaches on the private sphere and civil society. The state has higher administrative capacity the more decision-making power is concentrated in central state institutions insulated from political, partisan, and popular influence. Bensel roughly ranks these institutions' adherence to statist principles in descending order as follows: state bureaucracy, national courts, presidency, congress. Substantive content Bensel investigates five dimensions of substantive state-building policies: #Citizenship - includes policies relating to non-property related rights and duties of individual citizens and their relationship with the central state. #Property rights - includes policies related to central state control over the use and ownership of property. #Client-group formation - includes policies which create a relation of dependency between individuals and the central state; examples include pensions, civil service salaries, and any other bond which creates for the client an interest in the future strength of the central state. #Extraction - includes policies, primarily taxation, which enable continued state operation by reallocating private wealth into the state treasury. #Involvement in the world-system - concerns policies affecting relations with other sovereign states. =Analysis= Bensel argues that the Confederacy far outpaced the Union in some of the most important dimensions of state building. This was especially true with respect to administrative capacity, citizenship and property rights. The Confederate state enjoyed more effective concentration of decision-making power in the office of the Presidency and a Congress more effectively shielded from popular pressure on account of meeting in secret session. The Confederacy had near-complete control over the southern economy; they controlled the allocation of manpower via conscription policies and the allocation of raw materials through military impressment of the railways. Confiscation of private property and the establishment of price controls were also features of the Confederate war mobilization effort. The Union state was much less modernized by comparison. The secession of the South led to a Republican party-state in the North which encouraged a high degree of patronage and clientelism, and sacrificed rational-bureaucratic considerations to more purely political ones. The Union did not approach a command of its economy comparable to the Confederacy; instead, they depended almost solely on voluntary, open-market contracts with private persons and corporations for meeting the requirements of the war effort. Instead, the most important domestic aspect of the Union state-building process was the nationalization of the currency in the form of the greenback and the creation of a national banking system. The latter policies, along with the massive expansion of national debt, rendered financial capitalists a client group of the central state. In all, the comparison shows that, with respect to their own respective political economies, the Confederacy was a more modern state despite its material and economic backwardness relative to the Union. Bensel argues that this observation suggests a much looser relationship between political and economic modernization than had been assumed by many social scientists and theorists of modernization (e.g., Barrington Moore, Jr., Walt Whitman Rostow). Causes for failure of Reconstruction Bensel argues that the state- building trajectory taken by the Union during the Civil War had a highly self- limiting character. Specifically, the formation of a finance capitalist client group in the context of a one-party state characterized by a lack of rational- bureaucratic capacity undermined the central state's ability to meaningfully pursue the massive state-enhancing opportunity represented by Reconstruction. The US Treasury became enormously important for the regulation of the money supply in the economy after the establishment of the national banking system, the nationalization of the currency and the related issuance of greenbacks, and the temporary abolition of the gold standard. The incompetency of the Treasury was a constant preoccupation of finance capital, indicated by the financial press at the time. The preoccupation was well-founded: incompetency and mismanagement were common; positions in the Treasury were especially susceptible to purely political appointments and the distribution of patronage; and the Treasury secretary was selected on the basis of willingness to prioritize the organizational needs of the Republican Party over other concerns. Finance capitalists' primary interest was in the overall stability of the financial system. This interest militated against continued Reconstruction for several reasons. *The potential for monetary instability as a result of Treasury incompetence made finance capitalists skeptical of state intervention in the economy. Finance capitalists supported a return to the gold standard, which would re-expose the United States economy to international influence, especially the British sterling, widely seen as more trustworthy and stable than US Treasury regulation. Finance capitalists' general suspicion toward the central state also meant they opposed practically every measure that would increase state revenue and supported tax reductions. A permanent military occupation of the South by federal troops would be extremely expensive, and would require increased extraction from the private economy, a slower return to the gold standard, and impeded the stabilization of the national debt. *Reconstruction threatened to continue the disruption of cotton production. Because most cotton exported for the international market went through Northeastern ports, Northern financiers had a strong interest in uninterrupted cotton production. *Supporters of Radical Reconstruction (notably, a Reconstruction bill sponsored by Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens) aimed to enact a highly redistributive program for the South in order to create an economically independent base for the Republican Party. Under such a program, on the basis of loyalty to the Union, Freedmen and poor yeomen Southern white Unionists would receive wealth directly confiscated from Southern separatists. This had the potential to transform a race-based cleavage between Blacks and Whites into a class-based cleavage between poor farmers and landholding elites. At this point, it was difficult to see how this conflict could be contained in the South. Northern labor would almost certainly begin to make demands for eligibility in the transfer of Southern wealth to the lower classes, since they had remained loyal to the Union as well. This was an unattractive option for Northern capitalist members of the Republican coalition, both because of the disruptive effect on Southern agricultural production and the potential for an increase in generalized class conflict. Bensel shows that Republican politicians representing banking districts voted closely in line with the interests of finance capital; a large part of the Republican coalition was thereby put against the project of Reconstruction and the state-enhancing measures that would have come with it, while other Northern sections of the Republican Party did not have deep enough interests in Reconstruction to constitute a veto over the influence of finance capitalists. In other words, the client-group formation path of state-building had a strong self-limiting character, wherein further state-building was stymied by this client group.

Opened in 1862, it is owned and operated by SBB-CFF-FFS. The station forms part of the Lausanne‚ÄìBern railway, which is the original portion of the Olten‚ÄìLausanne railway line (; ). It is also the junction for the Yverdon-les-Bains‚ÄìPayerne‚ÄìFribourg railway, and the Fribourg‚ÄìIns railway. Location Fribourg railway station is right in the heart of the city centre, which has shifted from the Old City to the railway station quarter since the station's construction. History The station was opened on 20 August 1862 by the Western Swiss Railways (), upon completion of the Fribourg‚ÄìBern section of the Lausanne‚ÄìBern railway. Completion of that section had been delayed for two years, due to the need to construct the long Grandfey Viaduct over the Saane/Sarine river, just to the north of the station. On 2 September 1862, the remaining section of the line was opened between Lausanne and Fribourg. The first station building at Fribourg was a simple wooden hut. Between 1872 and 1873, a more substantial replacement building was constructed adjacent to the hut. The new building's design had been entrusted to the architect Adolphe Fraisse. Initially, the army had not wanted the Lausanne‚ÄìBern railway to pass through Fribourg. The military had believed that the line would be too \\"vulnerable\\" in case of conflict. The government and the city had to fight for the route and the station. By 1905, the authorities wanted a new station building, which was completed in 1928. On 7 September 2007, the 1872 station building became a cultural centre, incorporating a caf√©, an entertainment hall and two festival theatres, for $4.5 million Swiss francs. A Swiss heritage site of regional significance (class B), the building houses the Nouveau Monde and its theatre, the International Film Festival of Fribourg and Belluard Bollwerk International.

Plant breeding involves development of varieties for different environmental conditions ‚Äì some of them are not favorable. Among them, heat stress is one of such factor that reduces the production and quality significantly. So breeding against heat is a very important criterion for breeding for current as well as future environments produced by global climate change (e.g. global warming).  Breeding for heat stress tolerance in plants  Heat stress due to increased temperature is a very important problem globally. Occasional or prolonged high temperatures cause different morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes in plants. The ultimate effect is on plant growth as well as development and reduced yield and quality. Breeding for heat stress tolerance can be mitigated by breeding plant varieties that have improved levels of thermo-tolerance using different conventional or advanced genetic tools. Marker assisted selection techniques for breeding are highly useful. Recently 41 polymorphic SSR markers has been identified between a heat tolerant rice variety 'N22' and heat susceptible-high yielding variety 'Uma' for the development of new 'high yielding-heat tolerant' rice varieties.Waghmare, S. G., Sindhumole, P., Shylaja, M. R., Mathew, D., Francies, R. M., Abida, P. S., & Sajini, S. (2018). Analysis of simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphism between N22 and Uma rice varieties for marker assisted selection. Electronic Journal of Plant Breeding, 9(2), 511-517.  What is heat stress tolerance  Heat stress is defined as increased temperature level sufficient to cause irreversible damage to plant growth and development. Generally a temperature rise, above usually 10 to 15 ¬∞C above ambient, can be considered heat shock or heat stress. Heat tolerance is broadly defined as the ability of the plant tolerate heat ‚Äì means that grow and produce economic yield under high temperatures.  Significance: current and future - global warming  Heat stress is a serious threat to crop production globally (Hall, 2001, 1992).Hall, A.E., 1992. Breeding for heat tolerance. Plant Breed. Rev. 10, 129‚Äì168.Hall, A.E., 2001. Crop Responses to Environment. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, Florida Global warming is particularly consequence of increased level of green house gases such as CO2, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxides. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) has predicted a rise of 0.3 ¬∞C per decade (Jones et al., 1999) Jones, P.D., New, M., Parker, D.E., Mortin, S., Rigor, I.G., 1999. Surface area temperature and its change over the past 150 years. Rev. Geophys. 37, 173‚Äì199 reaching to approximately 1 and 3 ¬∞C above the present value by 2025 and 2100 AD, respectively.  Physiological consequence of heat stress  At very high temperatures cause severe cellular injury and cell death may occur within short time, thus leading to a catastrophic collapse of cellular organization (Schoffl et al., 1999).Schoffl, F., Prandl, R., Reindl, A., 1999. Molecular responses to heat stress. In: Shinozaki, K., Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K. (Eds.), Molecular Responses to Cold, Drought, Heat and Salt Stress in Higher Plants. R. G. Landes Co.,Austin, Texas, pp. 81‚Äì98 However, under moderately high temperatures, the injury can only occur after longer exposure to such a temperature however the plant efficiency can be severely affected. High temperature directly affect injuries such as protein denaturation and aggregation, and increased fluidity of membrane lipids. Other indirect or slower heat injuries involve inactivation of enzymes in chloroplast and mitochondria, protein degradation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and loss of membrane integrity. Heat stress associated injuries ultimately lead to starvation, inhibition of growth, reduced ion flux, production of toxic compounds and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Immediately after exposure to high temperature stress- related proteins are expressed as stress defense strategy of the cell. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), protein with 10 to 200 kDa, is supposed to be involved in signal transduction during heat stress. In many species it has been demonstrated that HSPs results in improved physiological phenomena such as photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, water and nutrient use efficiency, and membrane stability. Studies have found tremendous variation within and between species, thus this will help to breed heat tolerance for future environment. Some of attempts to develop heat-tolerant genotypes are successful. (Ehlers and Hall, 1998;Ehlers, J.D., Hall, A.E., 1998. Heat tolerance of contrasting cowpea lines in short and long days. Field Crops Res. 55, 11‚Äì21. Camejo et al., 2005 Camejo, D., Jimenez, A., Alarc ¬¥ on, J.J., Torres, W., G ¬¥ omez, J.M., Sevilla, ¬¥F., 2006. Changes in photosynthetic parameters and antioxidant activities following heat-shock treatment in tomato plants. Funct. Plant Biol. 33,177‚Äì18)  Traits associated with heat stress tolerance  Different physiological mechanisms may contribute to heat tolerance in the field‚Äîfor example, heat tolerant metabolism as indicated by higher photosynthetic rates, stay-green, and membrane thermo-stability, or heat avoidance as indicated by canopy temperature depression. Several physiological and morphological traits have been evaluated for heat tolerance - Canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll, stay green, leaf conductance, spike number, biomass, and flowering date. (a) Canopy temperature depression (CTD) CTD has shown clear association with yield in warm environments shows it association with heat stress tolerance. CTD shows high genetic correlation with yield and high values of proportion of direct response to selection (Reynolds et al., 1998)Reynolds, M.P., R.P. Singh, A. Ibrahim, O.A.A. Ageeb, A. Larqu√©-Saavedra, and J.S. Quick.1998. Evaluating physiological traits to complement empirical selection for wheat in warm environments. Euphytica 100:84-95., indicating that the trait is heritable and therefore amenable to early generation selection. Since an integrated CTD value can be measured almost instantaneously on scores of plants in a small breeding plot (thus reducing error normally associated with traits measured on individual plants), work has been conducted to evaluate its potential as an indirect selection criterion for genetic gains in yield. CTD is affected by many physiological factors, which makes it a powerful. (b) Stomatal conductance Canopy temperature depression is highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in warm, low relative humidity environments where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling of up to 10 ¬∞C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using infrared thermometry. However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative humidity environments because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences in the rate of CO2 fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. Porometry can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks. (C) Membrane thermostability Although resistance to high temperatures involves several complex tolerance and avoidance mechanisms, the membrane is thought to be a site of primary physiological injury by heat, and measurement of solute leakage from tissue can be used to estimate damage to membranes. Since membrane thermostability is reasonably heritable (Fokar et al., 1998) Fokar, M., H.T. Nguyen, and A. Blum. 1998. Heat tolerance in spring wheat. I. Genetic variability and heritability of cellular thermotolerance. Euphytica 104:1-8. and shows high genetic correlation with yield. (D) Chlorophyll fluorescence Chlorophyll fluorescence, an indication of the fate of excitation energy in the photosynthetic apparatus, has been used indicator for heat stress tolerance.Rosyara, U. R., S. Subdedi, R. C. Sharma and E. Duveiller. 2010. Photochemical Efficiency and SPAD Value as Indirect Selection Criteria for Combined Selection of Spot Blotch and Terminal Heat Stress in Wheat.

The Stg1 and Stg2 regions also contain the genes for key photosynthetic enzymes, heat shock proteins, and an abscisic acid (ABA) responsive gene. (F) Photosynthesis Declined photosynthesis is suggested as measure of heat stress sensitivity in plants.Berry J. and O. Bjorkman. 1980. Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 31:491‚Äì543.''' (G) Stem reserve remobilization'''  Combination breeding and physiological breeding  The physiological-trait- based breeding approach has merit over breeding for yield per se because it increases the probability of crosses resulting in additive gene action.Physiological approaches to wheat breeding, http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4011e/y4011e0a.htmU.R. Rosyara, N.K. Gupta, S. Gupta, R.C.

Sharma (2012) Breeding for Heat Stress Tolerance in Plants via Molecular and Physiological Manipulation In: Stanislas Josipovic and Elias Ludwig, Heat Stress: Causes, Treatment and Prevention, N.Y. : Nova Science Publishers The concept of combination phenomics comes from the idea that two or more stress have common physiological effect or common traits - which is an indicator of overall plant health.Rosyara, U.R., Vromman, D., Duveiller, E. 2008. Canopy temperature depression as indication of correlative measure of spot blotch resistance and heat stress tolerance in spring wheat. J. Plant Path. 90 :103‚Äì107.Rosyara, U. R., S. Subdedi, R. C.

Photochemical Efficiency and SPAD Value as Indirect Selection Criteria for Combined Selection of Spot Blotch and Terminal Heat Stress in Wheat. Journal of Phytopathology Volume 158, Issue 11-12, pages 813‚Äì821 Similar analogy in human medical terms is high blood pressure or high body temperature or high white blood cells in body is an indicator of health problems and thus we can select healthy people from unhealthy using such a measure. As both abiotic and abiotic stresses can result in similar physiological consequence, tolerant plant can be separated from sensitive plants. Some imaging or infrared measuring techniques can help to speed the process for breeding process. For example, spot blotch intensity and canopy temperature depression can be monitored with canopy temperature depression.Rosyara, U.R., Vromman, D., Duveiller, E. 2008. Canopy temperature depression as indication of correlative measure of spot blotch resistance and heat stress tolerance in spring wheat. J. Plant Path. 90 :103‚Äì107.

In cell lines expressing rat 5-HT6 receptors, it acted as a partial agonist (on presumed silent receptors), while it acted as a full agonist on human 5-HT6 receptors (which are constitutively active). Oral administration of E-6837 reduced food intake, but only transiently. In rats, twice daily administration of E-6837 over the course of 4 weeks resulted in a 15.7% reduction in body weight, compared to 11% reduction for sibutramine. This weight loss remained significant for E-6837 after a 43-day withdrawal period, whereas the weight difference was non-significant for sibutramine (i.e., sibutramine had a rebound effect while E-6837 did not), and this weight loss was found to be due to a loss of fat mass. The reduction in fat mass in E-6837 treated animals was associated with a 50% decrease in plasma leptin levels, and also reduced glucose and insulin levels in plasma after a glucose tolerance test. This indicates that weight loss from E-6837 is associated with improved insulin sensitivity, and thus, better glycemic control. One proposed mechanism of action is that E-6837 acts on neurons in the hypothalamus, which has shown significant levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA. The hypothalamus is one key structure involved in regulating food intake.

It was planned to be album second CD-single from her debut album Breath from Another. However record company declined to release song as a single after disappointing sales of the album, although its video picked up Canadian airplay. Song received positive reviews from critics who called it \\"brass-tinged\\" and compared to songs by smooth jazz group Swing Out Sister.  Music video  Despite no official release of the single, a music video for the song was released in June 1999 and received airplay on Canadian and American TV. The music video for the song was filmed on 17‚Äì18 April 1999 in Toronto and directed by Patrick Hoelck. Synopsis The music video features Esthero as an alien living in a sealed glass room in the middle of a busy street presumably because she can't breathe air outside. She's occasionally visited by a young man she's attracted to (played by Tony Ward) and after dreaming about following him around the city in regular clothing, she decides to leave the room, wearing a clear plastic spacesuit for protection. She then walks to a restaurant where she sees the young man chatting with another girl and takes the suit off. After passing out off-screen, she wakes in the glass room with her love interest looking at her and smiling before she smiles back. Accolades The music video was nominated for \\"Cinematography of the Year\\" at the 1998 MuchMusic Video Awards, ultimately losing to \\"Release\\" by The Tea Party.

The Causeyville Historic District consists of four buildings at the center of the community‚Äìtwo general stores and two residences‚Äìthat exemplify the pivotal contribution that small communities like Causeyville made to the development of Lauderdale County. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History Established in 1833, Lauderdale County has always been one of the most prosperous counties in Mississippi. Meridian, the county seat, is located at the intersection of several major railroads and thus served as a transportation hub for early Lauderdale County. Locals in the farming and timber industries sent their products to Meridian to be loaded onto the trains and shipped to other cities. With the exception of Meridian, Lauderdale County is mostly rural, remaining largely as it was at the turn of the 20th century and even earlier. Before automobiles and personal transportation became widespread, many of the early settlers of Lauderdale County grouped into small population clusters that relied nearly entirely on local resources, each community isolated from the others. Some communities like Causeyville had a store, and some had post offices and other infrastructural institutions, but many did not have any of these buildings. Causeyville, named after a local family that settled the area in the 1820s, thrived in the pre-Civil War era. The community was a commercial center in southeastern Lauderdale County, and its inhabitants also produced lumber and agricultural products. Though most of the buildings that fed the local economy have long been demolished, there are pictures of an antebellum store, a cotton gin, and a sawmill used for a local logging company. The four buildings in the Causeyville Historic District were built between 1860 and 1930 and demonstrate the community's growth during that period. All four buildings are located along Causeyville Road; the two general stores are on the northern side of the road, and the two residences face the stores on the southern side. The four buildings in the district are all that remain of this economy. Contributing properties Raynor's store The R.S. Raynor store is the oldest of the four buildings in the district, built around 1860, and it still retains most of its original board and batten siding. The building also retains the original design of the undercut porch, which runs along the southern and eastern sides of the buildings, although it was reconstructed in the latter half of the 20th century. It is rumored that the pine boards used to construct the inner walls of the store were cut at the sawmill that used to exist behind the store. The building was originally a trading post between European settlers and Choctaw Indians but was repurposed to serve as a community post office in 1894. Because there was already a \\"Causeyville\\" post office in Mississippi, the post office before the one at Raynor's store had been named \\"Edbony\\" since 1887. When the post office moved to Raynor's store, the name was changed to \\"Increase\\". Many maps still use \\"Increase\\" for the community. When the Increase post office was discontinued in 1929, the community was officially called \\"Causeyville\\". After T.J. Bostick's store was built in 1895, Raynor's store served as a warehouse for Bostick's lumber mill and turpentine manufacturing business. During the 1920s, the original wooden roof was replaced with a tin one, which is still in place today. The building was used as a cotton warehouse in the 1930s and as an auto repair garage in the 1940s. In 1943, the original wooden floor was removed and replaced with cement, and garage doors were installed on the eastern side of the building. The garage doors were later removed when the building was repurposed yet again as the Lauderdale County Equipment Maintenance Shop throughout the 1950s and '60s, as a warehouse again between 1976 and 1983, and finally as a commercial building again after 1983. Other alterations to the original design include the addition of an interior wall to shield customers from the dust produced by the grist mill in the rear of the building and the addition of two small rooms‚Äìone at the rear of the building and the other on the western side‚Äìthat served as a grist mill equipment shed and a feed storage area. The additions were built with materials similar to those used in the original design. The International Harvester grist mill usually operates only on Saturdays. T.J. Bostick's store The T.J. Bostick Store has sold merchandise continuously since it was built in 1895. Over its lifespan it has more than tripled in size, being home a different points throughout its history to a post office, a barbershop, a doctor's office, a drug store, the town hall, a voting precinct, a Ford dealership, a residence, a feed and fertilizer storage area, a theater, and a storage area for merchandise. The post office was moved from Raynor's store when Bostick's was built in 1895, and it remained in Bostick's store until 1929. The building was split into two halves in the 1930s and later recombined in 1983. The original facade is now covered by a false front parapet on which many commercial signs have hung throughout the building's lifetime. A room was added to the southeast corner of the house to hold the doctor's office, and a covered patio previously held the grist mill now in Raynor's store. The back of the store today holds a mechanical music museum, which is home to antique music boxes, player pianos, movie posters, and other antique instruments. Though the store originally began as a general store, it has slowly morphed into something akin to a convenient store as culture has evolved to be more automobile-centered. When the Hagwood family bought the store in 1942, their son Leslie remembers people buying an entire month's supply, but by the 1980s, that no longer happened. Hagwood told the Kentucky New Era in 1988 that the store could no longer be defined as a true country store because his main competitors were convenient stores. James E. Smith house The James E. Smith house was built in 1895 in the Queen Anne Cottage style. Smith, the house's original owner was a partner of Bostick's in his store. Smith's son, Grady W. Smith, was the first president of the East Mississippi Electric Power Association (EMEPA) and helped bring electricity to Causeyville through the Rural Electrification Act. Will Bostick, one of T.J.'s sons, rented a room in the house for a few years while managing the lumbermill onsite. J.W. Grantham house When the Bosticks moved to Meridian in about 1905, J.W. Grantham bought the Bostick store as well as this house across the street from the Raynor's store. Grantham continued to operate the store until the 1930s.

Career Palihakkara joined the Sri Lanka Overseas Service (the foreign service) in 1979, receiving training in Australia in 1980. He then studied international human rights and humanitarian law at the Raul Wallenberg Institute, Lund University. Palihakkara was Sri Lanka‚Äôs Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva and an officer at Sri Lanka's UN Mission in New York. He was ambassador to Thailand from 2001 to 2004 (also accredited to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam). He was also Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. He was appointed Foreign Secretary on 20 April 2004, retiring on 31 December 2006. He served as Director General of government's Peace Secretariat at the same time (he had been deputy chief of the secretariat before being appointed foreign secretary). Palihakkara was appointed Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in August 2008, serving until August 2009. During the bitter fighting in the final months of the Sri Lankan Civil War Palihakkara defended the Sri Lankan military at the United Nations Security Council, denying that they had fired heavy weapons into the \\"No Fire Zone\\". In May 2010 President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Palihakkara a member of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Palihakkara appointment was criticised because, as Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, he represented the government and defended the actions of the Sri Lankan military during the final months of the civil war when both sides of the conflict are alleged to have committed war crimes. Newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Palihakkara Governor of Northern Province on 27 January 2015. He resigned in February 2016.

Plot  The plot's setting is a post-apocalyptic world where the majority of people live either in a poor, technologically backwards Urkaina (not to be confused with the present Ukraine, though the pun is likely intended) with about 300 million Russian speaking inhabitants with a capital city \\"Slava\\" or in a technologically advanced artificial flying city \\"Big Byz\\" (or \\"Byzantium\\") which is locked in the sky above Urkaina and has a population of about 30 million, where English is used only as a Church language, Russian is used for regular communication. The book invents a set of neologisms (mainly using English even in the Russian original) such as discourse monger - a provoker paid by Big Byz media and military who under disguise of defending human rights against Urkainian dictatorship (which is in fact covertly controlled by Big Byz), provokes a conflict, which usually leads to regularly repeated \\"wars\\" - organized slaughter and bombing campaigns by Big Byz's fused military and media against virtually weaponless Urkaine's people. Such \\"wars\\", thoroughly filmed and used for entertainment, are organized nearly every year, the perpetrators from the Big Byz side being porn stars wearing suits of Batman or Ninja Turtles rather than soldiers, and protected by flying drones from any damage. The resulting footage is called \\"S.N.U.F.F.\\", an acronym from \\"Special Newsreel/Universal Feature Film\\", and sold both in Big Byz and in Urkaina. The story is narrated from the person of one Damilola Karpov, a pilot of a remotely controlled drone which is equipped with both a camera and multiple weapons including guns and bombs. He works for both the military and media and his usual work in peacetime is to broadcast poverty, brutality and chaos from Urkaina to confirm the barbaric and totalitarian nature of this people, called \\"Orcs\\" in the slang of Big Byz, and their authorities. In other cases he protects discourse mongers with the guns of his drone so that they can denigrate and provoke Urkainian officials safely. Another invented term is smart free speech, a term used to denote intelligent following (or even predicting) of current political trends by Big Byz media employees in order to earn good money and avoid being ostracized. The people of Big Byz are not living in paradise either. It turns out that a popular custom among Big Byz elite and pilots is to use robotic women as sexual partners. Sex and pornography with persons under 46 is prohibited due to age of consent, and according to the narrative it is planned to increase it up to 48 due to a lobby of aging porn stars and feminists. Still, having sex with people under 46 isn't a big problem due to the hypocritical rule don't look, don't see; only doing (as well as watching) it in public is punished. The naturally- decreasing population of Big Byz is usually replenished with immigrants from Urkaine and by child-buyers who go to poor Urkainian villages to buy babies. The rich immigrants from \\"Urkaine\\" to Big Byz usually live in a virtual \\"London\\" which is nothing more than a 3D picture of London (a parallel with Russian oligarchs) landscape that can be installed in any apartment for good money and is considered most prestigious (while there are other landscapes that can be installed for free). As the story progresses, Damilola's sex toy elopes with a young orc named Grym, and he loses his drone in pursuit. His personal doom is accompanied by an impending global disaster, as the people of Urkaina sabotage the ground facilities of Big Byz.

It narrates the love story of two fictional men: Artush Saroyan, an Armenian, and Zaur Jalilov, an Azerbaijani. The novel became a controversy due to the existing enmity between Armenia and Azerbaijan as a result of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as homosexuality being a taboo topic in both societies, despite being made legal in the early 2000s.Armenian Gays Face Long Walk to Freedom Armenia‚Äôs Animosity Towards Gays Author's viewpoint In a 2009 interview, Ali Akbar stated that the chosen topic united \\"morally justified, mentally approved and intellectually substantiated\\" negative stereotypes which exist in Azerbaijani society. According to him, people of Azerbaijan should not label those they dislike as \\"homosexual\\" and \\"Armenian\\", because these characteristics are nothing to be ashamed of, unlike bribery, embezzlement, theft, treason, and libel. He described the theme of homosexuality as a distracting manoeuvre behind the more significant theme of the mutual estrangement of the two societies.Alakbar Aliyev: Artush and Zaur Is a Battle against Fixed Stereotypes . Plot The novel consists of six segments (The Meeting, The Retrospective, Rain and Wine, Marriage and Parting, Sleepwalking, and The Maiden Tower). Each segment begins with a quotation from a ghazal (a love poem) by mediaeval Azeri poet Nasimi dedicated to an Armenian, where the word \\"Armenian\\" () constitutes a monorhyme. The novel begins with an Azerbaijani journalist and non-governmental organisation activist Zaur Jalilov leaving his native city of Baku, Azerbaijan, for a conference in Tbilisi, the capital of neighbouring Georgia. There he confronts a fellow journalist from Armenia named Artush Saroyan. Both men are left perplexed, as the next part reveals that Artush was in fact an Armenian refugee who fled Baku with his family as a teenager some 17 years ago in the midst of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Prior to the conflict, Artush and Zaur were classmates who had been involved with each other sexually as preteens and soon afterwards had found themselves in love with each other. Even though the war tore them apart, the Tbilisi meeting made both Artush and Zaur realise that they still nurtured mutual feelings. After spending time together in Tbilisi, the two decide to marry despite the fact that, similar to their home countries, the Georgian law makes no provision for same-sex marriages. With the help of their Georgian colleague and friend Shota, the couple heads to Poti to meet Klaas Hendrikse, a Dutch priest said to be the mentor of Georgia's First Lady Sandra Roelofs. He performs a wedding ceremony for Artush and Zaur in accordance with the regulations of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. After returning to Baku, Zaur seeks a way to visit Artush in Armenia where free entrance of Azerbaijani citizens has been prohibited since the advent of the war. Through an NGO, he manages to arrange for participation in a two-day civil conference in Yerevan where Artush resides. However upon Zaur's arrival in Yerevan, Artush refuses to meet, explaining this by his fear of the Armenian secret service which would later persecute him and his family for rubbing shoulders with a citizen of an enemy state. Back in Baku, Zaur is attacked by members of the radical movement Organisation for the Freedom of Karabakh in retaliation for his visit to Armenia. They harass and threaten him and force him to participate in a state-sponsored television program to make denouncing statements with regard to his journey, in line with the state's official anti- Armenian propaganda. Meanwhile, Artush meets a priest in Echmiadzin whose nephew is due to represent Armenia in an upcoming wrestling championship to be held in Baku. Through him Artush manages to be included in the official list of media reporters who will accompany the athletes. In Baku, Artush escapes the event and meets Zaur. The two spend the night together only to discover in the morning that Artush's disappearance was reported to Azerbaijani authorities and he is being searched. Realising the problems, public reproach and punishment they will face if caught, Artush and Zaur head to Old City, Baku where they climb to the Maiden Tower and commit joint suicide by jumping from its top. Critical reception Azerbaijani-Russian writer Chingiz Huseynov noted the forbiddenness of the topic and compared the controversial nature of the novel to that of Nabokov's Lolita. According to him, the rather allegorical ending of the book reveals the tragedy of a couple who is victimised not for being homosexual (which is still a taboo in the South Caucasus), but for belonging to two rival nations.Artush and Zaur.

On 29 May 1915 he was wounded at Gallipoli and after recovering in England held a number of staff appointments with the 3rd Division on the Western Front in 1917‚Äì18. Following Jackson's birth the family returned to Australia in 1920 so that his father could resume his military career. He subsequently attended a number of schools, completing his secondary education at Scotch College, Melbourne in 1936, where he was a member of the athletics and rugby teams. Military career Early career and Second World War Jackson subsequently joined the Australian Army in March 1937 as a regular officer in the PMF. His older brother, Donald, was also a professional soldier, having entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1934 and later also reached the rank of brigadier. After completing his own training at Duntroon, Jackson graduated into the infantry as a lieutenant in December 1939, following the outbreak of the Second World War two months earlier. Transferring to the 2nd AIF for overseas service, in July 1940 he took up his first appointment commanding a platoon in the 2/25th Battalion where he saw action in the Middle East in North Africa and Syria. Meanwhile, Jackson's father had been appointed to command Northern Command in May 1940 and was promoted to major general in July. However, the following year he was posted to Western Command and believed that he had been passed over for a combat command after opposing the Brisbane Line strategy, subsequently retiring in early 1942. By late 1942 Jackson's battalion returned from the Middle East, and he later served in New Guinea fighting the Japanese at Gona, as well as in the Ramu Valley, the Finisterre Ranges and the New Guinea north coast. He was subsequently posted to Headquarters 18th Brigade as a major during the period 1943‚Äì44. In June 1944, he took up a position as an instructor at the Canadian Staff College in Kingston, where he remained until the end of the war. Interbellum Returning to Australia, Jackson filled a number of staff positions, including postings to the Royal Military College, Army Headquarters and Headquarters Western Command. His father died of pneumonia at Heidelberg, Victoria, on 24 November 1948. Jackson was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1949 and to colonel in 1951. On 21 June 1956, Jackson assumed command of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) in South Korea deployed as part of the UN garrison which had remained there following the end of the Korean War and oversaw the battalion's final operational activities before its return to Australia. He subsequently took up a two-year appointment in the United States as Australian Military Attache in Washington. In 1959 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps. Vietnam War In 1961, he took up the position of Director of Infantry at Army Headquarters. He subsequently commanded the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) in 1963, before serving as the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) in 1963‚Äì64. Ultimately, Jackson was the only officer to command all three of the original battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment. Jackson took over command of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) on 5 February 1965. Following the arrival of Australian ground forces in South Vietnam in May 1965, he was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the new headquarters in Saigon, known as the Australian Army Force Vietnam (AAFV). In March 1966, the Australian government further increased its commitment to the Vietnam War, announcing the deployment of a two-battalion brigade with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support, designated the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). Jackson was subsequently appointed as its first commander. Based in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, 1 ATF was involved in counter-insurgency operations against the Viet Cong. During his period in command the task force was successfully established at Nui Dat, clearing a security zone around the base and conducting offensive operations to the edge of the Tactical Area of Responsibility, while a number of significant actions were fought, including the Battle of Long Tan, which established 1 ATF's dominance over the province. Jackson was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his command of 1 ATF during this period. In June 1967, Jackson returned to Australia having served nearly two years in Vietnam, and subsequently served on the staff of Australian Headquarters. His final posting was as the Chief of Staff at Headquarters 1st Division, before retiring with the rank of brigadier in May 1974. Later life Settling in Sydney in his later life Jackson enjoyed sailing and gardening. Married to Dorothy Honor, the couple had a son and two daughters. Jackson died in Burradoo, New South Wales, on 7 May 2004, aged eighty-four.

The series was created by Jeremy Padawer and Jared Wolfson. It is distributed by FremantleMedia and is produced by Dentsu Entertainment USA (part of Dentsu Aegis Network), FremantleMedia, Jakks Pacific, and The Topps Company. Japanese animation studio Larx Entertainment animated the series. Synopsis Season 1 ‚Äì Monsuno: World Master The show revolves around \\"re-awakened Monster DNA called Monsuno\\" that finds its way into the unsuspecting hands of adventure-seeking teenagers Chase, Jinja, and Bren. Accompanied by their Monsuno, Lock, Charger, and Quickforce, they are searching for Chase's father Jeredy Suno, the creator of the Monsuno. They are soon joined by Beyal, a monk from the Himalayas along with his Monsuno Glowblade. Beyal often speaks of five people that with the help of their Monsuno, could change the world. It just so happens that they are that five, along with Dax, a teenager who along with his Monsuno Airswitch, opposes the team and is disliked among most people. The team has yet to befriend him and persuade him to join their cause. They are also on the run from a H.A.M.M.E.R.-type agency called \\"S.T.O.R.M.\\" (Strategic Tactical Operatives for Recovery of Monsuno) whose plans are still in question and Dr. Emanuel Klipse, a malevolent scientist who has his own nefarious plans. Season 2 ‚Äì Monsuno: Combat Chaos The 5 adventure-seeking teenagers are once again in the battle of Monsunos, now, however, with Jeredy Suno officially back from being missing or kidnapped. But along with old foes, come new ones, with The Forge Resistance, a manufacturer bent on destroying the world with Wild Core Bombs, The S.T.O.R.M. Strike Squad, a team which could be considered the anti version of Team Core-Tech handpicked by Charlemagne, the Hand of Destiny, a team of century-old tribes who have hidden themselves from the world underground long ago, and Six, a teenager clone of Dr. Eklipse. Now on Team Core-Tech's tail, Chase and his friends are ready to take the heat. But as the battle becomes tougher, the team must face new problems and must come to connect to their Monsunos than ever before.  Season 3  The series continues after the events of Monsuno: Combat Chaos, with the introduction of Core-Tech and S.T.O.R.M's merging, Eklipse and Forge Resistance with the newly-manufactured Dino Monsuno, and return of Hand of Destiny with their new non-shapeshifting alien Monsunos. The three survived members of the Hand have been reverted to children- Petros, Terz and Dasha now work with Digby Droog. There are also some returning characters from Season 1, like the Bookman and Grandma Future. With the help of their new Hyper Monsuno, Team Core-Tech may stand a chance against their adversaries.  Characters  The characters are accompanied by Monsunos (giant high-tech/mechanical/armored hybrid monsters of one or more animal species), which are contained in cylinder regeneration chamber capsules known as \\"cores\\". * (voiced by Cam Clarke in English and by Kenn in the Japanese dub) - One of the main protagonists. A brave and adventurous boy, Chase is the leader of Team Core-Tech. In the first season \\"World Masters,\\" Chase engages on a journey to find his father Jeredy Suno, a research scientist who disappeared while experimenting with the mysterious power source called Monsuno Essence which brought him into conflict with both the corrupt government agency S.T.O.R.M. and the rouge scientist Dr. Klipse. In the second season \\"Combat Chaos\\" Chase is repeatedly having visions of his mother Sophia who was believed to be deceased which leaves him to confront The Hand of Destiny which might have a hand at Sofia's disappearance. * (voiced by Karen Strassman in English and by Asami Tano in the Japanese dub) - One of the main protagonists, renamed in the Japanese version. Jinja is the self- proclaimed \\"sassy\\" and genuinely outspoken tomboy member of Team Core-Tech who is often the first one into battle. Jinja is a strong supporter to Chase in his journeys and is known to playfully tease Bren on occasion. Jinja was at first interested in Beyal and had no fear of showing it. In the second and third season she was more comfortable and calm about it. * (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith in English and by Chihiro Suzuki in the Japanese dub) - One of the main protagonists. A timid but inquisitive boy who's an adept computer programmer and hacker. Bren is one of Chase's closest friends and is usually the one to kaiser or decode any piece of Technology or Monsuno Equipment that Team Core-Tech comes across.

He was renamed in the Japanese version. An introspective and spiritual young man, Beyal was introduced in the episode \\"Knowledge\\" as a monk who possesses \\"The Monsuno Sight\\"; A special ability that allows one to see into the future. Beyal helped Chase, Bren, and Jinja escape from The Bookman's evil clutches and joined Team Core-Tech afterwards. He was a good friend of Dax, since they were the last members who joined the team. His wide spectrum of knowledge, his alternative methods and his intense emotions have aided in tackling difficult situations and making him the most beloved character of the series. Beyal is attracted to Jinja although he does not admit it aloud. * Dax (voiced by Keith Silverstein in English by Hiroshi Shimozaki in the Japanese dub) - A cocky young drifter that joined Team Core-Tech in the episode \\"R.S.P.V.\\". Dax has a mysterious past that might tie into Dr. Klipse's illegal Monsuno research. In the original English version, he has a bit of an Australian accent. Renamed in the Japanese version.

It has a 36/18 2300 ft turf runway and has a pattern altitude of 800 ft MSL and shares a taxiway with Spadaro Airport. The field is mainly used for banner towing, skydiving, glider towing, and flight instruction, and has been operational since the late 1940s. The airport was purchased April 1984 by Louis Lufker from Teddy Kijowski. The airfield is open to the public and has FAA Identifier: 49N. There is no control tower and operations are restricted to daylight hours.  History  The airport was originally a farm field owned by Teddy Kijowski's father. The farm was used to grow cabbage, melons etc. Teddy began taking flying lessons from Frog Chapman's Airfield in the late 1940s which was located one mile to the west of Lufker Airport in the same town of East Moriches (Frog Chapmans Airport has long been closed and the East Moriches Elementary School sits were the airport used to be). This happens to be the same airport (Chapmans) where Juan Trippe (The founder of Pan American Airlines) bought his first airplane, a \\"Curtiss Jenny\\" for the Harvard Aero Club. After Teddy soloed his first airplane, he began taking airplanes into his father's field. He used a dirt road that ran down the middle of the fields as his runway. The dirt road is where the current runway lays. Eventually, Teddy bought his own airplane and began keeping it on the field. He also turned the dirt road into a grass runway. Friends began to bring their airplanes there and people started to rent tie down spaces. It was not until 1963 that Bart Spadaro bought land next to Teddy's Airfield and decided to put a runway in that paralleled Teddy's runway. In the 1970s the airport was used for flight instruction and several airplanes were built from the ground up. Including one built by Donald Trumps cousin Al Creighton. Airport sold Teddy Kijowski sold the airfield to Louis Lufker in April 1984. Lou Lufker was a Suffolk County police officer who was interested in the field for several years. At the time Mr. Lufker was operating an aerial advertising business around the New York City area and was looking for his own field. Lou was familiar with the field, many years prior he gave flight instruction lessons (out of Zahn's and Bayport Airports) and brought his students in there. Mr. Lufker was also operating seaplanes (charter) around the Long Island area around the same time. As an Army Reserve Aviator, Lou brought Army helicopters into Teddy's Field and gave Mr. Kijowski rides. A friendship started which eventually led to Teddy selling the field to Mr. Lufker. Lufker Airport today Since 1984, Mr. Lufker has rented the field out to several banner towing operations and at one time operated a glider school. He also gave aerobatic flight lessons in his 1941 Stearman Biplane. Mr. Lufker is an A and P mechanic and maintains aircraft on the field. In the early 1990s Mr. Lufker opened a machine shop at the field. Lufker Precision Manufacturing made precision metal and plastic gears for the aircraft, automotive and medical industry. The field is home to general aviation aircraft including antique biplanes, ultralights, powered parachutes, helicopters, and gliders. There is also a skydiving operation and a non profit airplane museum called \\"The Pioneers of Flight\\". During the summer, there is a flea market on the airport grounds. The EAA (Experimental Aircraft Association) has a chapter on the field. In the past years, the field has also hosted carnivals and a circus during the summer months. Trivia In 1995 Mr. Lufker purchased a 1931 open cockpit Bird biplane in Penn Valley, California. With his eldest son, he flew it back to Lufker Field. During the 52 hours that it took to traverse the country they encountered extreme heat over the Mojave desert, severe turbulence, strong headwinds over Texas, and a rainstorm in Alabama. A leaking magnetic compass put them off course by 50 miles forcing Mr. Lufker to use his hand held survival compass the remainder of the flight. The trip was accomplished strictly by dead reckoning and pilotage navigation. No radios or GPS were used. The field has also been used by Hollywood actor Cliff Robertson. He flew into the field in the 1970s and hang around. John F. Kennedy Jr. also flew in and park his airplane and go out to the Hamptons. Mr. Lufker owns a plane (Marine Corps L-19) that President John F. Kennedy bought and put on his compound so John Jr. could play in as a kid. New York State Governor George Pataki used the field in the state helicopter.  Facilities and aircraft  Lufker Airport covers an area of 30 acres (12 ha) at an elevation of 57 feet (17 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated N/S with a turf surface measuring 2,300 by 100 feet (701 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending September 8, 2010, the airport had 2,500 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 208 per month. At that time there were 43 aircraft based at this airport: 58% single-engine, 35% ultralight, and 7% glider.

The company was preemptively liquidated in 2010 following the revelation that they had been illegally manufacturing and selling breast implants made from cheaper industrial-grade silicone since 2001 (instead of the mandated medical-grade silicone they had previously used). The hundreds of thousands of unapproved implants sold globally by PIP from 2001 to 2010 were found to have a 500% higher risk of rupturing or leaking than approved models, as well as being implicated in several deaths due to systemic toxicity and several cases of induced breast cancer. The scandal, which produced fears of a massive health disaster, prompted a full recall of the company's implants by the French health ministry in 2010, by which time the company was already defunct. History Breast implant PIP was founded in 1991 by the Frenchman Jean-Claude Mas, born in 1939, a former butcher and later medical sales representative for the Bristol Myers company for 15 years. Mas had previously teamed up with plastic surgeon Henri Arion, who had introduced breast implants to France in 1965. After Arion died in a plane crash, Mas went on alone and launched PIP in 1991. Scandal Starting in 1991, the company produced approximately 2 million sets of silicone breast implants over a 20-year period. The implants were exported to Latin American countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, Western European markets including Britain (25,000), Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as Australia (8900). Following the FDA ruling in 2000 which banned silicone breast implants in the US market (leading to a slump in sales worldwide), Mas sought to \\"tighten PIP's belt\\" and recoup some of its lost market share by severely cutting costs. In particular, Mas was credited with the idea that by switching PIP's silicone from externally purchased medical-grade to in-house produced industrial-grade, huge savings (on the order of 90%) could be generated that would ensure profits remained high no matter the market. As one PIP engineer later noted, this decision involved a relatively small change in the formula for the silicone, enough so that only superficial differences in the end product were noted. However, none of the relevant regulations were followed for manufacturing medical implants, and no pre-launch tests were conducted.  Timeline  2000: Implant sales in USA halted by an FDA launched moratorium on silicone implants. 2001: PIP began to use unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of medical-grade silicone in the majority of its implants. 2003: the first signs of legal problems and financial losses can be traced by regulatory filings. 2009: Concerns surfaced in France first in 2009 when surgeons started reporting an abnormally high rupture rates. Which resulted in a flood of legal complaints and the company's bankruptcy. 2010: T√úV Rheinland, headquartered in Germany, gave a quality certificate to the production process used by the company until March 2010. However, this didn't apply to the type of silicone used. A former PIP worker and union chief, Eric Mariaccia said, \\"You had to have been a chemist to have noticed anything\\". He also said that \\"The responsible ones aren't the workers but the heads of the company, notably the four who were linked to production and thus responsible for their quality\\". 2010: In March 2010 PIP was placed into liquidation with losses of after the French medical safety agency recalled its implants. In a subsequent inspection of the manufacturing site, the company was found to use unapproved industrial-grade, silicone, with a cost of only 10% of an approved gel. 2011: On December 20 French officials say that an action plan is underway following the death of a woman from ALCL. The French government recommended on December 23, 2011 that 30,000 women in France seek removal of breast implants made of a suspect silicone gel by the worldwide exporting PIP firm.  Issues  Medical problems arise when breast implants rupture and cause inflammation and irritation. Further, impure gel may also release toxic substances. Removing implants \\"carries risks in itself\\", says the French government. By the end of 2011, eight cases of breast tumours had been uncovered in women after removing the implants, yet, while of concern, according to the French government, there is no evidence of any increased cancer risk. The UK medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), says France has reported rupture rates of around 5% for PIP implants, compared with 1% in the UK. But a \\"leading cosmetic surgery firm\\" has privately warned ministers that the proportion of women at risk is as high as 8%. Symptoms can include lumps around the implant or in the under-arm, inflammation in the breast tissue and a hardening of the breast.independent.co.uk - Exclusive: Silicone implant risk 'eight times greater, 2012-01-01 Patient UK says French regulatory authority has reported a rupture rate of up to 10%, with a gel leak in 11% of cases. Nigel Mercer of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says the French move was \\"certainly not unreasonable\\" but the British cosmetic surgeon Kevin Hancock said the divergent government responses would cause distress for British women. Plastic surgeon Hancock, of the Liverpool Women's Hospital, says there were concerns in the profession over a high rupture rate and that \\"We are worried about the rupture risk because it is the rupture that brings the contents into direct contact with the body's tissues... We know that the contents were not what they were supposed to be. So in general we agree with the (French) decision to remove them\\". Patients are used as \\"guinea pigs\\", said Nigel Mercer, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), because medical implants lack the requirement of an independent clinical trial. The company sold a high-end product that used approved silicone for wealthier clients and which cost five times more than products with silicon gel manufactured in-house. Most PIP implants were manufactured with the in-house silicon. The lawyer, Haddad, representing the founder, said \\"There is a product made by PIP which did not formally receive the [regulators'] approval and in this regard there was a violation of regulations,\\". The company did not ask France's medical device safety regulators for approval of their in-house manufactured product, but expected it would have received approval if the company asked for it. Cancer has been found in 20 women with the allegedly faulty PIP breast implants but French health authorities (Agence fran√ßaise de s√©curit√© sanitaire des produits de sant√© (AFSSAPS)) insisted there was still no proven link with the disease.medicalxpress.com - 20 cancer cases in French women with PIP implants: agency, 2011-12-30 AFSSAPS has as of 28 December 2011, registered 15 cases of breast adenocarcinoma, the most frequent form of breast cancer, one case of breast lymphoma, two cases of other lymphoma, one case of lung cancer and one case of acute myelogenous leukemia in women with the implants. A French woman with a PIP breast implant where capsular scar tissue formed in the breast, which is a common occurrence with implants. This tissue developed anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), a rare form of cancer that affects the immune system cells. The cancer caused death in this case and caused the French authorities to act. During the 672 registered preventive extractions, in 43 cases (6.4%) the implants had ruptured and in 14 cases (2.1%) they were \\"oozing\\", AFSSAPS said. The PIP implants have been resold as \\"Rofil M-implants\\". British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) believes many British women may have had the bad Rofil M-implants used when they bought cut-price breast enlargement surgery from clinics in Eastern and Central Europe. The PIP factory was shut down and their products banned after it was found they had used the chemicals Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil in their implants. These chemicals are normally used as fuel additives or in the manufacture of industrial rubber tubing. In 1993, there was an availability crisis of silicone materials for use in medical long-term implant applications.nusil.com - Healthcare products , 2012, read 2012-01-26 In 1993, Mas ordered the staff to \\"hide the truth\\" and \\"We did it for 13 years without a problem\\". The PIP gel cost per litre while the authorized American gel Nusil cost per litre. The PIP implants were made with 75% non-authorised gel and 25% Nusil. \\"The material was better than that used to make the officially authorised gel,\\" Mas said. \\"Usually, from 1997 onwards we hid the products used to make the PIP gel. I wasn't allowed to buy these products because they were not authorised. We organised everything to escape being monitored.\\" Investigators interviewed Mas on 18 and 19 November 2010 after the French health authority AFSSAPS discovered the PIP breast implants did not conform to regulations. They passed the case to a judge who ordered a police inquiry for \\"aggravated deception\\".guardian.co.uk - French breast implant firm boss unrepentant over unauthorised silicone, 2012-01-06  Chest, testicle and buttock implants  The bad silicone has been used to make male chest, testicle and buttock implants as well. \\"Three people were specially trained to work with a machine that made silicon testicles'\\" said a former PIP worker. Most of the male chest, buttock and testicle implants were exported to Latin America.  Impact per country   France  The French government recommended per December 23, 2011 that 30,000 women in France seek removal of breast implants made by PIP.REUTERS/Interpol/Handout For women that want to keep their implants, the state will pay for a six-month ultrasound scan. French public health care funds will be used to finance the recommended implant removals, at a cost estimated at . New implants will be paid for in cases where they were used initially for medical reasons, others will need to finance a new implant by themselves. Associations representing women with PIP implants demand that public funds cover all cases. \\"This announcement is just a smokescreen and the victims of PIP are angry,\\" said Alexandra Blachere, head of the association of PIP implant users in France. A government hotline has been set up by December 2011.  United Kingdom  In Britain, there are an estimated 30,00040,000 affected women. The chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said, \\"Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon\\". Removing the implant \\"carries risks in itself,\\" she said. Concerns were filed with the UK MHRA in 2009 when a lump was found during a mammogram and ultrasound scan in a female patients breast but no action was taken by MHRA at the time. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said private clinics in Britain that fitted PIP implants must be forced to pick up the cost of removing them. On 6 January 2012, NHS officials began to offer examinations and possible removal - in instances where a doctor ruled that necessary. They also called on private medical centers to offer the same deal to patients who had paid for private sector cosmetic surgery.bellinghamherald.com - Mixed advice in Europe over faulty breast implants, 2012-01-06 On 8 January 2012, The Sunday Times reported that leading cosmetic surgeon Jan Stanek had conducted a study with colleague Mike Berry into PIP implants. Their report to the Journal of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery revealed that, in an audit of 453 patients, between 16% and 34% of the PIP implants ruptured. This compared to a failure rate of less than 1% in other implants.Sarah-Kate Templeton, John Follain, 'Leak Rate Of Faulty Implants Is 1 in 3 In The UK' , The Sunday Times, 8 January 2012 Republic of Ireland Around 1,500 Irish women received PIP implants in Shandon Street Hospital in Cork and Clane General Hospital in County Kildare. The implants were removed free-of-charge by the Health Service Executive.  Germany and Brazil  Germany's medical safety board and Brazil's health watchdog called for users of PIP implants to visit their doctor for checks. On 6 January 2012 Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices recommended the removal of PIP breast implants as a precaution.  Netherlands  The bad breast implants were sold to about 1 000 Dutch women under the name \\"M-implants\\" by the Dutch importer Rofil. The Dutch healthcare spokeswoman Diana Bouhys said, \\"We have advised them to consult their physician\\", but also declined to disclose the name of the company. PIP was the third largest maker of breast implants in the world.gmanetwork.com - Sub-standard breast implants sold to Dutch firm under new name, 2011-12-27  Sweden  Approximately 5 000 implants have already been sold, corresponding to an estimated 2 500 Swedish women with the controversial implants. Nine clinics in Sweden has sold them says Gert Bruse of the Swedish Medical Products Agency (L√§kemedelsverket) told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper this week. The agency also recommends that the implants to be removed. Sweden banned the company's implants in March 2010, along with many other European countries, when it was discovered that substandard silicone gel was causing unusually many implants to burst. \\"We've had cases where the implants have burst in Sweden, but it's fewer than in France in relation to how many women have these implants in both countries... Implants shouldn't burst and they shouldn't have an irritating effect that spreads throughout the body. What this company has done is criminal, simply put.\\" said Bruse. PIP's implants have only been used in cosmetic breast augmentation surgery, not in reconstructive surgery.thelocal.se - Swedish women warned over French fake boobs, 2011-12-23  Finland and Estonia  In Finland only 7 women were given PIP implants, all implants were imported from Sweden by the same surgeon. The Society of Finnish Plastic Surgeons was advicing to remove the implants in January 2012. Patients from Finland often visit Tallinn in Estonia to get cosmetic surgery. In October 2011 (two months before the ban on the 22 of December 2011), a Finnish woman in her 30s had received a different implant than what was agreed to in advance. An M-implant with the same type code as the implant from PIP was inserted instead of a promised Allergan implant. At least two Estonian clinics operating in Tallinn have offered M-implants as recently as December 2011. According to the Estonian Health Board, 364 patients were installed with PIP and M-implants. PIP-implants were used by two clinics: Villa Medica and KT Kliinik O√ú, where these breast implants were installed to 163 patients. M-implant implants were installed in 2004‚Äî2009 in KT Kliinik O√ú and Plastilise Kirurgia O√ú clinics to 139 patients. In 2011, M-implants have been installed by KT Kliinik O√ú to 61 patients.  United States  Documents filed with the US government show that implants were sold until May 2000 through Heritage Worldwide, when the FDA launched a moratorium on silicone implants. At the time, the US market accounted for 40% of Heritage Worldwide's revenues, or , according to corporate documents filed in 2009 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2007 significant losses started as both users and distributors filed complaints. Between 1996 and 2009, PIP was targeted by several dozen lawsuits in the United States, filed by users and business partners, claiming breach of contract or unmet payments. Starting in 2003, dozens of women began filing lawsuits mainly for product liability against PIP. However, as of 2009, no trial date had yet been set. Many of the lawsuits were later dismissed.thelocal.fr - French breast implant maker faced US lawsuits, 2011-12-27  Italy  On 29 December Health Minister Renato Balduzzi said that hospitals and clinics are required to compile a list of women who has received breast implants from PIP.

Iceland  According to the Icelandic Directorate of Health, 440 women underwent breast surgery where PIP breast implants were used. The Ministry of Welfare have stated that health insured women will be offered counsel and ultrasound examination, free of charge. The Ministry of Welfare also stated that in the event that the implant is leaking, the government will pay a portion of the cost to have it removed.grapevine.is - Government Will Assist With Breast Implant Removal, 2012-01-10  Latin and South America  * Costa Rica - breast implants banned and taken off the market in March 2010 * Brazil - banned the breast implants on 30 December 2011, taken off the market in 2010 * Bolivia - implants replaced free of charge for some women on 29 December 2011 * Venezuela - promised to remove them free of charge * Ecuador - sales banned on 29 December 2011 * Argentina - ban * Chile - ban * Colombia - ban  Iran  Ministry of Health and Medical Education banned the breast implants and took them off the market in 2012. They advised women that used the products to consult with a doctor and if deemed a health threat, to have them removed.  European Union  The adequacy of regulations on silicone-filled breast implants, investigation by the regulatory authorities and advice given to women implanted with PIP silicone pre-filled breast implants was criticized in December 2012 in a report examining information publicly available from the regulatory authorities.  New company  A new firm has been registered under the name France Implant Technologie (FIT), with Mas' son Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and daughter, Peggy Lucciardi, 24, at the address of their mother, Dominique Lucciardi, who was Mas' former civil partner. The local paper Nice- Matin obtained the business plan in which Mas is named as a \\"technical- commercial consultant\\" to the company and described as \\"a creative genius\\". Two former PIP managers were listed in senior positions in the company. With the objective to export implants to the \\"European, South American and Chinese markets\\". An investment of was planned to put the former PIP plant back into operation, aiming to manufacture 400 implants a day with about 20 workers. However, Nicolas Lucciardi said that the project had collapsed due to media coverage of the scandal, adding, \\"That's obvious\\".rfi.fr - French breast implant fraud boss tries to start new company, 2011-12-30  Legal process  The lawyer Yves Haddad is representing Mas. Legal complaints have been filed by 2 500 women in France and 250 women in Britain. Mas is wanted in Costa Rica for \\"life and health\\" offenses, a warrant issued by Interpol. By February 2011, T√úV Rheinland sued PIP, claiming it had been \\"thoroughly and continuously misled\\" regarding the silicone used. Many executives are expected to face charges of aggravated fraud in an ongoing court case in France, expected to be scheduled for October 2012, which carries the possibility of prison terms of up to five years. The death of a cancer victim who had such implants may result in more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter. Fr√©d√©ric Van Roekeghem, general director for La Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (French state social insurance agency, CNAM), will go to court regarding the complaints of bad implants. A criminal charge will be made within a few days he said to TF1 on 25 December 2011. The decision has been made in consultation with minister of health, Xavier Bertrand. Mas underwent a difficult surgery regarding a vascular problem that prevents him from walking said his lawyer Haddad. Sources say a Marseilles court could soon announce fraud charges against four to six former PIP employees. A fraud case was filed against PIP on 30 December 2011 by France‚Äôs state-run health insurance fund (CNAM) officials in Marseille announced. Which is near the company‚Äôs laboratory at La Seyne-sur-Mer. On 26 January 2012 at just before 07:00 the founder Mas was arrested in the home of a friend in the Six-Fours in the Var located in South of France and taken into custody. Investigators searched the house. A deputy chief executive was also arrested at his home. Philippe Courtois, a lawyer represents 1 300 women in France. Laurent Gaudon, represents four women and say a surgeon should inform about complications from both the surgery and devices used. Nathalie Lozano, lawyer, represents more than 1 400 women from Colombia, Argentina, United Kingdom and Venezuela. She claims T√úV Rheinland's gross negligence in the process of certifying the quality process. On 17 April 2013, the trial of 5 executives in begun in Marseille, France. Those charged are the company founder Mr Mas, who was booed in the court, his deputy Claude Couty, the quality director Hannelore Font, technical director Loic Gossart and products chief Thierry Brinon. They face up to five years in prison. The trial was expected to last until 17 May. On 10 December 2013, Jean-Claude Mas was sent to prison for four years, and was fined 75,000 euros (¬£63,000) by a court in Marseille, France.  Aftermath  British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that poor postmarketing surveillance is the root of the crisis, and proposes significantly more stringent monitoring of all medical devices including breast implants and all cosmetic injectables, via compulsory, regular reporting of adverse effects and mystery shopping. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS Medical Director, will look into whether the cosmetic surgery industry needs to be more effectively regulated.

Football career Brown was born in Andover, Hampshire and joined Southampton as a part-time professional in January 1952, while continuing his trade as a sign- writer. Later that year, he was called up for national service which he spent with the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) at Crookham Camp, near Aldershot. He returned to Southampton in 1954, when he became a full-time professional, making his debut in the first team on 30 April 1954 at Norwich City. He played at outside-right in place of John Flood; the match ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat, with Brown missing a chance to level the scores. He spent most of his time at The Dell in the reserves, making three first team appearances at the end of the 1954‚Äì55 season, again as a replacement for Flood, with his first goal coming in a 5‚Äì3 victory at Colchester United on 30 April. Brown played the first five matches of the following season, scoring against Ipswich Town with a \\"splendid individual effort\\" on 24 August 1955; he then gave way to Flood before making a further four appearances towards the end of the season. With Terry Paine beginning to establish himself at outside-right, Brown's first team appearances became more infrequent and in July 1958 he was transferred to Wrexham.

Fido was written about in many Italian and international magazines and newspapers, appeared in newsreels throughout Italy, and was bestowed several honors, including a public statue erected in his honor. Early life Fido probably began life sometime in the autumn of 1941 as an independent street dog in Luco di Mugello, a small town in the municipality of Borgo San Lorenzo, in the Tuscan Province of Florence, Italy. One night in November 1941, a brick kiln worker in Borgo San Lorenzo named Carlo Soriani, on his way home from the bus stop, found the dog lying injured in a roadside ditch. Not knowing whom the dog belonged to, Soriani took him home and nursed him back to health. Soriani and his wife decided to adopt the dog, naming him Fido (\\"faithful\\", from Latin fidus). Adulthood After Fido recovered, he followed Soriani to the bus stop in the central square of Luco di Mugello and watched him board the bus for his job. When the bus returned in the evening, Fido found and greeted Soriani with obvious great joy and followed him home again. This pattern repeated every workday for two years: Fido would stay in the square, avoiding all others, waiting and sniffing the air until excitedly greeting Soriani and enthusiastically following him home. Vigil This was during the Second World War, and on December 30, 1943, Borgo San Lorenzo was subjected to a violent allied bombardment: many factories were hit, and many workers, including Soriani, perished. That evening, Fido showed up as usual at the bus stop, but did not see his beloved master disembark. Fido later returned home, but for fourteen years thereafter (more than 5,000 times) until the day of his death, he went daily to the stop, watching and sniffing the air, waiting in vain for Soriani to get off the bus. Media interest in Fido grew during his lifetime. Italian magazines Gente and Grand Hotel published the story of the dog, which also appeared in several newsreels of the Istituto Luce. Many readers were struck by the extraordinary faithfulness of Fido, including the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, who, on November 9, 1957, awarded him a gold medal in the presence of many citizens including Soriani's moved widow. Time magazine wrote an article about Fido in April 1957. Death Fido died still waiting for his master on June 9, 1958. The news of his death was announced to the public by the newspaper on a four-column front-page story in La Nazione. On 22 June, La Domenica del Corriere commemorated Fido with a poignant cover story. The cover painting by Walter Molino shows Fido dying on the roadside, with the bus waiting in the background. Fido was buried outside the cemetery of Luco di Mugello beside his master, Carlo Soriani. Memorials At the end of 1957, when Fido was still alive, the Comune of Borgo San Lorenzo commissioned the sculptor Salvatore Cipolla to create a monument of the dog as a testimony of that exemplary story of love and fidelity. The work, entitled \\"Monument to the dog Fido\\", was placed in Piazza Dante in Borgo San Lorenzo, next to the municipal palace. Under the statue depicting the dog is the dedication: A FIDO, ESEMPIO DI FEDELT√Ä (TO FIDO, EXAMPLE OF LOYALTY). The monument was inaugurated by the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, in presence of Fido and Soriani's widow. Originally, the statue was realized in majolica, but a few months after the inauguration some vandals destroyed it. Consequently, the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo commissioned to Salvatore Cipolla a new statue, this time in bronze, which replaced the first one and that is still today in Piazza Dante.

Biography Whitworth was born in Sowerby, West Riding of Yorkshire to Henry and Mary Whitworth. He was baptised on 15 November 1734, and was their sixth child of seven. His father worked as a combsmith, and the family lived in a house called Waterside or Wheatleyroyd, where he probably lived until he married Sarah Irwin on 26 December 1765. After a brief period in Norton in the Moors around 1772, Whitworth and his family, which by now included two sons, returned to Sowerby, and stayed there until the 1790s. During the latter part of this period he lived in Waterside, but moved to Burnley for the final years of his life, to be closer to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, on which he was working. He died on 30 March 1799 at the White Lion Inn in Halifax, aged 64. Early career Details of Whitworth's early life have not been found, but in 1761 he produced plans of an estate in Erringden, by which time he was a qualified land surveyor. He undertook a variety of tasks, which included measuring the stonework of Sowerby Church, so that the contractors who had built it could be paid the correct amount, and conducting a survey of the religious affiliations of families in Sowerby. Although its purpose is unknown, he surveyed part of the River Calder and produced a plan. The engineer John Smeaton had been working on the Calder and Hebble Navigation since 1759, working upstream from Wakefield. There is no direct evidence to connect the two men, but it seems likely that Whitworth would have taken an interest in such a significant project, and that he learnt a great deal from watching Smeaton's methods. Smeaton was replaced by James Brindley as the engineer for the Calder and Hebble project in 1765, and again there is no direct evidence to link the two men at this stage, but plans for the Huddersfield Broad Canal, produced for Sir John Ramsden in 1766, are variously attributed either to Brindley or to Whitworth, and by 1767, Whitworth had become the chief surveyor and draughtsman within Brindley's organisation. There are a number of cases where Brindley was able to obtain commissions for survey work because of his reputation, but the work was then delegated to Whitworth to carry out. During this period he produced plans for the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal's Birmingham to Aldersley Junction route, the canal from Coventry to Fradley Heath on the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Droitwich Barge Canal and the Oxford Canal. He also attended Parliament to assist Brindley during the 1767‚Äì68 session. His next projects were farther afield, as he went to Ireland to assess proposals for the Lagan Canal, and then to County Durham to produce plans and reports for a proposed canal to link Winston to Stockton-on-Tees. Nearly a year later, he collaborated with Brindley on the production of an estimate for the cost of the scheme. He assessed John Longbotham's plans for the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and a year later reviewed plans for a more southern route for that canal, which was rejected when he pointed out flaws in the levels used for the route. After advising on a scheme for a canal from Leeds to Selby, he spent three months in Devon, surveying possible routes for a ship canal to link Exeter to the Bristol Channel. Next he made a survey for the Andover Canal in 1770, and then joined Brindley in London, to advise on improvements to the River Thames. The joint report, suggesting that the river channel be bypassed from Isleworth in West London to Monkey Island near Bray, Berkshire, was supported by a long plan, drawn by Whitworth. He then surveyed a second bypass, from Monkey Island to Reading, and gave evidence in Parliament to support a bill for its construction, which was eventually defeated. Recognition by his peers occurred in 1771, when they voted to admit him to the newly formed Society of Civil Engineers, later renamed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers after its founder, John Smeaton. Wider public recognition occurred when the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine approached him for information and plans to support a series of articles about proposed canals and those being constructed. He assisted in this way between 1771 and 1774. He continued to produce plans and reports, which covered the River Trent at Newark in collaboration with John Grundy, Jr., the Lancaster Canal to Kendal in the Lake District, and the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation in Essex. A plan to bypass the lower Lee Navigation by the construction of a canal from Waltham Abbey to Moorfields, close to the City of London, with a branch to Marylebone, provided an opportunity for him to show how his canals could be integrated into a wider urban landscape. Canal engineering In 1774, Whitworth and Thomas Yeoman were asked to report on improvements to the River Thames between London and Staines. The report was produced in June 1774, after which Whitworth became Surveyor to the Navigation Committee, a post which he held until 1784. Initially, he received ¬£250 per year, although this was reduced to ¬£100 in 1780, as the amount of work required of him reduced. Through much of this period, he continued to act as a consultant, assessing plans and producing reports. In 1777, he reported on the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal, and between 1779 and 1780, on a possible route to extend the Stort Navigation from Bishop's Stortford to Cambridge. Also in 1779, he reported on the completion of the Oxford Canal between Oxford and Banbury. In 1782 there were rival schemes for a link between the River Severn and the River Thames. Following a review of them, he found in favour of the extension of the Stroudwater Navigation to Lechlade, on the basis that it was more fully planned than the alternative to Tewkesbury. He gave evidence in Parliament in support of the bill for what became the Thames and Severn Canal, and although he did not act as engineer for the project, he probably recommended Josiah Clowes for the post, and later assisted him with the most difficult part of the engineering, which was the setting out and production of profiles for Sapperton Tunnel. He went on to act as Chief Engineer for the extension of the Forth and Clyde Canal between 1785 and 1791, and as Engineer for the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Gargrave to Accrington section between 1790 and 1799. Again, his duties were reduced from 1795, as was his salary, and he was involved with a number of other canal schemes, including the Ashby Canal, the Wilts and Berks Canal, the Dearne and Dove Canal, and the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal. His sons Robert and William both worked on canal projects, and were assisted by their father.

Life Warner was born in London, probably in 1713, the third son of John Warner, a goldsmith and banker, in business in The Strand near Temple Bar. John Warner, sheriff of London in 1640, and lord mayor in 1648, in which year he was knighted, was probably Richard Warner's great- grandfather. John Warner, Richard's father, was a friend of Gilbert Burnet; he and his son Robert, a barrister, purchased property in Clerkenwell, comprising what was afterwards Little Warner Street, Cold Bath Square, Great and Little Bath Streets, etc. John Warner seems to have died about 1721 or 1722, and his widow then purchased Harts, an estate at Woodford, Essex, which, on her death in 1743, she left to her son Richard. Richard Warner entered Wadham College, Oxford, in July 1730, and graduated B.A. in 1734. He had chambers in Lincoln's Inn; but lived mainly at Woodford where he maintained a botanical garden, and cultivated exotic plants. In 1748 Warner received a visit from Pehr Kalm, the disciple of Linn√¶us, then on his way to North America. Warner took Kalm to London, to Peter Collinson's garden at Peckham, to visit Philip Miller in Chelsea, and to see the aging Sir Hans Sloane. Warner then received from the Cape of Good Hope the so-called Cape jasmine (Gardenia jasminoides), which flowered in his hothouse. John Ellis in a letter to Linn√¶us dated 21 July 1758, proposed should be called Warneria; Warner, however, objected, and it was named Gardenia. Miller dedicated a genus to him in 1760, but it had been given the name Hydrastis by Linn√¶us in the previous year. Warner died unmarried on 11 April 1775, at Harts, and was buried on the 20th in Woodford churchyard, more probably, as stated in the register, aged 62, rather than, as stated on his tomb, sixty-four. Works Warner made collections for a new edition of Shakespeare, but gave up the project when George Steevens began in the field. In 1768 Warner published a letter to David Garrick Concerning a Glossary to the Plays of Shakespeare. Papers concerning the glossary came to the Garrick Collection. Manuscripts for this glossary, including one in fifty- one quarto volumes, and another in twenty octavo volumes, are in the British Library (Addit. MSS. 10464‚Äì543). Warner also translated several plays of Plautus into prose, and the Captives into verse, before the announcement of Bonnell Thornton's version. In the preface to his two volumes published in 1766 Thornton wrote of Warner's help, and his translating the life of Plautus from Petrus Crinitus. After Thornton's death in May 1768, Warner issued a revised edition of the two volumes (1769), and then continued the work, translating fourteen plays and issuing them in three additional volumes, two published in 1772, and the last in 1774, the continuation being dedicated to Garrick. Meanwhile, he had, in 1771, printed his botanical work, Plant√¶ Woodfordienses: Catalogue of ‚Ä¶ Plants growing spontaneously about Woodford. This little book had its origin in the ‚Äòherborisations‚Äô of the Apothecaries' Company, to the master, wardens, and court of assistants of which it is dedicated. An index of Linn√¶an names is added. Though somewhat inaccurate, the Plant√¶ Woodfordienses served as a model for Edward Jacob's Plant√¶ Favershamienses (1777), and in 1784 Thomas Furly Forster printed some Additions. Legacy Warner bequeathed the bulk of his property to Jervoise Clark, the widower of his niece Kitty, only child of his brother Robert. A director of the East India Company in 1760, he left money to their hospital at Poplar, to David Garrick, and to fund for decayed actors. His books and drawings relating to botany and natural history went to Wadham College, with money to found a botanical exhibition at the college tenable for seven years by the presentation of fifty dried plants and a certificate. At Idsworth, Hampshire, the seat of the Jervoise family, there was a portrait of Richard Warner.

It was established in Stockholm in June 2010, after the wedding of Swedish Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling. The aim of the AERM is to provide a network for cross-party republican movements in all the countries of Europe that have a monarch as their head of state, in order to share information, resources and ideas and provide mutual assistance. Each member organisation will retain their autonomous national campaigns however, in recognition of their particular political and constitutional circumstances. There are currently twelve extant monarchies in Europe. AERM has member organisations in seven of these: Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The AERM protested against the wedding of British Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011 in London, and planned to meet each year thereafter. Member organisations *Belgium: The Republican Circle (CRK), variously known in the three official languages of Belgium as Cercle r√©publicain, Republikeinse Kring and Republikanischer Kreis. *Denmark: Republik nu (formerly DRGB or Den Republikanske Grundlovsbev√¶gelse or The Republican Constitional Movement), launched in 2010. *Netherlands: There are two groups campaigning for a republic in the Netherlands affiliated to AERM. One is the New Republican Society (NRG), and the other is Pro Republica. *Norway: The Norwegian republican group Foreningen Norge Som Republikk or Norway As Republic Association was founded in March 2011 in Oslo. *Spain: In Spain the member organisation of AERM is Red Inter-Civico Republicana, a group that seeks to draw together the various strands of Spanish republicanism to campaign for the Spanish Third Republic. *Sweden: The Republikanska F√∂reningen or Swedish Republican Association campaigns for a republic in Sweden based on the Finnish model. *United Kingdom: The main republican organisation in Britain is Republic, reinvented as a campaigning pressure group in 2006.

It was established in 1960 by the Chittagong Government Service (C.G.S) Colony. Though it was established for secondary education, it is now a through school, from kindergarten to Secondary School Certificate (SSC). The present headmaster is Shofikullah. History This is an old school of port city Chittagong. People of the region Agrabad were searching for a good educational institution for the children of the government service officers and other people of this locality. Eventually, on 3 January 1956, the Agrabad Government Colony Association took a decision to establish a school in this region. And they started a primary school but they did not have a permanent school building. Classes were taken at P.W.D Godown building. Sometimes the classes were taken at a quarter of the colony. The school started as Junior High School in 1960. Later the P.W.D go-down was used as the main school building. In 1965-66 H. Akbar Ali helped to build the main premise by giving money to the school. He bore most of the expenses for the school building. To give him respect the name of the school auditorium was named after him as 'H. Akbar Ali Hall'. Due to excessive students in school, the auditorium is now used as a classroom. Haji Osman Goni helped by giving money for the school library. This school was taken under Comilla Board on 1 April 1963 when the number of students of the school was only 79. The first batch of SSC students was enrolled in 1964. Campus The school has two campuses. The girls' section is located at Agrabad CGS(Chittagong Government Staff) colony. The boys' section is located about south at on Jamboree Field Road. The school is one of several in the area that are susceptible to flooding. Organisation The school is divided into three sections. These are the kindergarten section, the boy's section and girls section. In kindergarten section, they teach students from play to class five, both boys and girls. For secondary students, there are two school buildings for boys and girls where they study from class six to SSC. About 80 teachers are working for these three sections and the number of students is about 5000 which is the biggest number in Chittagong District. About 1,300 are enrolled in the girls' section.

It is a riveted, wrought iron, Tied-arch bridge at the entrance to Darley Park in Derby spanning the River Derwent and was part of the Great Northern Railway Derbyshire Extension popularly known as the (Derby) Friargate Line. The next station was Friargate Station with another Bridge, also built by Andrew Handyside. History The bridge was built by Andrew Handyside and Company in 1878 when the Great Northern Railway's Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension reached Derby; it designed by Richard Johnson, the GNR's chief engineer for the extension. It consists of a single span of , high at the centre, supported by two bow-shaped wrought iron trusses. The unusual design avoided the need for a supporting pier in the river, keeping the Derwent clear for navigation.. During construction, a test was carried out to see if it would hold the weight of the expected rail traffic. Andrew Handyside ran six locomotives across the bridge with a combined weight of 432 tons to see if it could take the strain.Handyside Bridge Sign, Derby City Council, 2010 The bridge carried trains from 1878 to 1968, with the last passenger train crossing on 5 September 1964 and the last goods train May 1968 by the Stephenson Locomotive Society, when the branch was closed by the Beeching cuts. The deck, which used to carry the track, is suspended from steel segmental arches of a lattice construction, with stone abutments. When the bridge was first built a Cantilever pedestrian footpath was attached to the North-side of the bridge which would have allowed the workers to cross. This was removed in 1978. The Handyside-owned Britannia Foundry works were 200 metres downstream of the bridge and was served by sidings connected to the mainline via a branch line. This spur allowed for products from the foundry to be transported by goods train. Another substantial business nearby was the refrigeration business of Sir Alfred Seale Haslam.. It now forms part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and was designated a Grade II listed building on 2 March 1976. The next bridge downstream to cross over the River Derwent is Saint Mary's Bridge which is 448 meters away and the next bridge upstream Haslam's Lane Toll bridge which is 1,541 meters away.

Drawing the example of the Material Girl brand‚Äîwhich was already a commercial success‚ÄîCole believed that there would be high demand for a brand that is endoresed solely by Madonna. Truth or Dare would be initially launched with handbags, footwear, accessories, intimates and fragrances. Since the Material Girl clothing was aimed at teenagers, Madonna's targe for the brand was women in the age range of 27‚Äì50. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Madonna stated her inspiration behind the name Truth or Dare: > Over the past several years, I have been approached countless times to > create my own brand. The timing is right and I have found great partners in > Iconix, who can help translate my vision to reality. I have always been > obsessed by fragrance and for years wanted to create something personal that > was an expression of me but that other people could relate to as well. > Something honest, and yet daring, hence the name Truth or Dare. Development Cole said that the first plan for the venture includes launch of fragrance and accessories in 2012. Women's Wear Daily had reported in September 2011 that perfume manufacturing company Coty, Inc. was looking for a possible fragrance deal with Madonna. A press release from the company confirmed the deal and said that the first fragrance for the brand, titled Truth or Dare, will be released in April 2012 exclusively at Macy's in the United States. Global distribution for the product would begin in May 2012. Truth or Dare was confirmed in the press release as a floral perfume, and would be Madonna's first scent to be released. The release also described the blend as a mixture of \\"narcotic florals, balanced with smells of wood and vanilla.\\" The bottle was described in the release as \\"playing the Truth or Dare duality ‚Äì a classic and sophisticated shape, with modern and edgy detailing\\". Madonna's inspiration behind the perfume was her late mother. She explained that the oldest memory she cherished about her mother was the perfume she put on. Describing the scent as consisting of gardenias and tuberose, Madonna revealed that she carries that perfume everywhere she goes. To create the particular smell that she had in mind, Madonna collaborated with Stephen Nilsen, who had previously produced fragrances for designers like Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan and Tom Ford. After the scent was developed, they believed the finished product to be a modern interpretation of Madonna's mother's perfume. The top note of Truth or Dare consists of essences from gardenia and tuberose, jasmine was embedded in the middle note, and the base was a mixture of vanilla and musk.Madonna's New Scent by Lisa Niven on Vogue Australia, 4 Nov 2011 Fragrances According to the CEO of Coty, Inc., Bernd Beetz, promotion for the brand and the perfume included Madonna's feature in print-ads, television, and online marketing campaign; the promotional activities would be produced with Fabien Baron, of Baron & Baron with whom Madonna had previously worked on her 1992 coffee table book, Sex. The print-ad was shot by French Vogue magazine photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. A number of promotional items accompanied the perfume, namely earrings, lingerie, bracelets and a bottle of Dom P√©rignon champagne. Also included was a vase of yellow waterlillies, a gold box, a blindfold designed by French painter Kiki de Montparnasse, and a small vial of the scent. In order to deliver the perfume to beauty editors for review, Madonna hired two handsome male models; one dressed in white and the other in black. The one dressed in white held tuberose and gardenia in his hand, while the otherin black held the white-colored perfume bottle; their costume was supposed to symbolize Madonna's mother and the duality of the perfume name. Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. from Billboard magazine believed Madonna to be fully aware that sexual imagery was still in demand, hence she hired the male models. He concluded by saying, \\"What better way to pep up a dull day?\\" In December 2011, the first advertisement for the perfume was revealed. The ad featured Madonna topless, and looking towards the camera with the Truth or Dare perfume bottle in front. The poster was created by re-using images from Madonna's 2010 photoshoot with Interview magazine, which was shot by Alas and Piggott. Jessica Vince from Grazia magazine complimented the ad, describing the singer's look as \\"recycle chic\\". The writer continued: \\"[She] is looking every inch the Hollywood glamazon, topless except for striking lipstick and her trademark crucifix, plus a mass of blonde waves. And no, you haven‚Äôt had one too many glasses of mulled wine ‚Äì that is indeed herself she‚Äôs cosying up to.\\" In December 2012, a second fragrance was announced and titled as Truth or Dare by Madonna: Naked. The press ad campaign featured a naked image of Madonna with a back banner across her breasts with the words \\"Naked - a new fragrance\\" on it. Footwear The second product from the brand was announced in March 2012, women's footwear, through ALDO Group. The initial footwear consists of more than 60 styles, including shoes, platform shoes, flats, heels, booties and over-the-knee boots. The product is sold through Nordstrom, ASOS.com and Macy‚Äôs in the United States, Selfridges in the UK and Hudson's Bay and Little Burgundy Stores in Canada.

It is differentiated, however, by its lack of an annulus, by the volval deposits on its stipe/base, and by its pileal striations. It occasionally lacks a stipe bulb entirely, instead just tapering to a point in the ground with powdery volval deposits on its surface. It ranges from in length and is occasional to common in the Southeastern United States, occurring primarily in Quercus forests though it has been observed in forests with a mix of conifers and oaks. Taxonomy This Amanita is in the subgenus Amanita and in the section Amanita. It was first described by Charles Horton Peck in 1900 as Amanitopsis parcivolvata. Murrill the placed it in the now defunct genus, Vaginata, in 1910, comparing it to the local specimens of Vaginata plumbea in Blacksburg, Virginia and finding it distinct. However, it was not formally described in literature until 1913. J.E. Gilbert placed in the genus Amanita in 1941, where it resides to this day. Description Cap: The pileus is bright red ranging from in diameter with warts which range in color from pale yellow to white. With rain, these can wash off, giving it a somewhat similar appearance to an Amanita in section Caesareae from a distance, especially if all but the cap is covered by detritus. Gills: The lamellae are white to pale yellow, closely spaced, free from the stipe, and sometimes with a serrated margin. Stipe: in length and about in width, with pale yellow to white powdery volval remnants all along the stipe. The volva, if it even may be called that, is rather undeveloped as compared to other members of Amanita. Microscopic Features: According to Rod Tulloss, the spores of Amanita parcivolvata measure (8.4-) 9.1-11.5 (-12.6) X (5.6-) 6.3-7.9 (-8.0) Œºm, are inamyloid, and the basidia rarely have clamps at bases. Chemical Reactions: With KOH, the red color of the cap quickly fades to an orange, then yellow color.

Career Franses was born in Ealing on 16 June 1927, to a Jewish family which had immigrated from Salonika in 1904. He completed National Service in the British armed forces, and then fought for the Israelis in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He then began work as an art dealer, and in 1969, together with one of his brothers, set up the tapestry and carpet dealership \\"Franses of Piccadilly\\". In 1974 he was appointed consultant to the new carpet and textiles department at Sotheby's, in 1979 senior director for the Middle East and India, and in 1981 head of the new Islamic Art department. His greatest asset was his perfect recall of almost every rug or textile he had ever seen. Both at Sotheby's and as a dealer, he advised numerous collectors, among them Metropolitan Museum of Art, and royalty such as Hussein of Jordan, Umberto II of Italy, and Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In 1974 he was involved in ascertaining the genuineness of a 16th-century rug bought from Sotheby's by J. Paul Getty for ¬£22,000. Franses organised many successful sales across Europe and the Far East during his time at Sotheby's. During his tenure at Sotheby's Franses recorded that sales in Europe rose from ¬£200,000 to ¬£5.3 million. However in 1985 he overestimated the possibilities when, years ahead of his time, he organised an unsuccessful Sotheby's auction in Dubai. This led to his departure from the auction house and a return to the trade. After leaving Sotheby's, Franses worked as an independent consultant, dealer, and expert witness. He died on 10 December 2010. His ashes are scattered under 'Jack's tree' in the Della Gherardesca Gardens in Firenze, his favourite city.

The origins of the campaign are not attested in historical sources, but it was probably in response to a revolt of the Cadusii and the refusal of paying tribute.Rollin 1820, p. 58 The Cadusii people lived in a mountainous district of Media Atropatene on the south-west shores of the Caspian Sea, between the parallels of 39¬∞ and 37¬∞ North latitude, called for its inhabitants Cadusia. This district was probably bounded on the North by the river Cyrus (today Kura, in Azerbaijan, historically known as Arran and Caucasian Albania), and on the South by the river Mardus (today Sefid River), and corresponds with the modern Iranian provinces of Gilan and Ardabil. They are described by StraboStrabo, Geography, xi. 6, 7, 8, 13 as a warlike tribe of mountaineers, fighting chiefly on foot, and well skilled in the use of the short spear or javelin. Artaxerxes organized an expedition that, according to Plutarch, consisted of 300,000 infantry soldiers and 10,000 cavalry soldiers.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Artaxerxes\\", 24 He commanded the expedition in person and among the officers accompanying him were Tiribazus and Datames. Advancing inside enemy territory, it didn't take long before the army started to suffer from starvation.Rollin 1820, p. 59 The mountainous terrain offered little food but some pears, apples, and other tree-fruits insufficient to feed such a host of fighting men. The army was reduced to eating their own beasts of burden first and later their own cavalry mounts. Tiribazus found a solution to resolve the campaign and save the King's army. He knew that the Cadusii were divided between two rival chiefs so he sent his son to negotiate with one while he negotiated with the other.Rollin 1820, p. 59 Both Tiribazus and his son convinced the Cadusii chiefs that the other had sent envoys to the Persian King and sought an advantageous peace.Rollin 1820, p. 59 Neither of the two chiefs wanting to be outmaneuvered by their rival, they submitted to Artaxerxes.Rollin 1820, p. 59 With the successful negotiations concluded the army retreated, ending the campaign.

It was one of several convoy battles that occurred during the crisis month of May 1943. Background SC 129 was an east bound convoy of 25 ships, plus local contingents, which sailed from New York on 2 May 1943 bound for Liverpool and carrying war materials. Mid- Ocean Escort Force group B2 joined the convoy from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador on 6 May. Escort group B2 was led by Cdr D MacIntyre in HMS Hesperus; other ships of this group were destroyer and five corvettes. They were joined for the voyage by two armed trawlers, plus a convoy rescue ship and an oiler. Arrayed against them in the North Atlantic were patrol lines Rhein, Elbe and Drossel, though although in the event only Elbe, re-configured and comprising 21 U-boats, engaged SC 129. Action First contact with the convoy was made on 11 May by U-504, which called up other boats from Elbe and commenced shadowing. The radio activity alerted the Admiralty to the threat, and they ordered Support Group 5, comprising escort carrier HMS Biter and four destroyers to join. SG 5 was at that time supporting HX 237, under attack by boats from Rhein and Drossel, but was then in range of Coastal Command aircraft, and it was decided SC 129 was in more need.Blair p328 The report by U-504 had brought up about a dozen U-boats, and on the evening of 11 May one of these, U-402, slipped past the escorts and torpedoed two ships. These were the freighter Antigone, and the Norwegian freighter Grado. Both ships sank, Antigone with the loss of three of her crew. MacIntyre was, in his own words, \\"furious\\" that ships under his group's protection had been sunk;MacIntyre p126 in the previous nine months they had escorted tens of convoys without loss. MacIntyre organized a vigorous hunt for the U-boat; she was found by , attacked with depth charges, and so badly damaged she was forced to abandon her patrol and return to base. Later that night HMS Hesperus got a contact with U-223 and attacked; by depth charge and ramming. U-223 was also so badly damaged she was forced to retire. On returning to the convoy HMS Hesperus found another U-boat in the early hours of 12 May. This was U-186, tracking the convoy. HMS Hesperus quickly closed in, and as the U-boat crash-dived, attacked with depth charges. This time the boat was destroyed, all hands were lost.Kemp p115Niestle p128 During 12 May the assembled U-boats made over a dozen separate attempts to penetrate the escort screen, but an aggressive defence by the warships, despite being low on fuel and ammunition, prevented any losses. On 13 May the convoy was joined by HMS Biter and her group; HMS Hesperus and her group were able to re-fuel and re-arm, and HMS Biter was able to mount continuous air patrols. At this BdU saw there was nothing to be achieved, and the attack by the Elbe boats was called off, though they continued to shadow. On 17 May this too was abandoned, and Elbe was disbanded. During this period, one of the Drossel boats, U-607, encountered a neutral Irish freighter, Irish Oak, on 15 May and torpedoed her. The incident caused a political controversy in Ireland, as there were allegations that Irish Oak had warned the convoy of the presence of U-boats. The U-boat commander received a mild reprimand. SC 129 arrived without further incident in Liverpool on 22 May 1943. Aftermath SC 129 was a success for the Allies. Despite the loss of two ships, 23 ships had arrived safely. Added to this, an attack by a wolfpack of 12 U-boats had been beaten off, one U-boat had been destroyed, and two more so badly damaged they had to return to base. The convoy was another in a series of set-backs suffered by the U-boat Arm collectively known as Black May.

The Operaball merged with Oslo Opera Festival in 2004 for a week of concerts and performances with Opera and classical music. History Period dance at the Oslo Operaball in 1990 Operaball in Oslo 2005 Operaball in Oslo 2004 Operaball in Oslo 2003 The balls have been period historical costume or masquerade balls and have been held in the historical Gamle Logen. The old Freemasons Lodge in Oslo was renovated in 1989, but housed similar events in Christiania throughout the 19th century attended by some of Norway's most famous composers and artists ‚Äì such as Edvard Grieg, Halfdan Kjerulf, Johan Svendsen, etc. Participants have first attended an Opera performance at the national opera house, then walk in a costume or carnival procession with horse-drawn carts through the historical centre of Oslo to the historical former freemasons Lodge. Then follows parallel performances and dance in up to six different halls with several orchestras and groups of musicians. All participants are invited to two evenings of rehearsals in historical dances, such as the menuett, mazurka, francaise, lanciers, galopp and so forth. Lectures and information evenings inform about the period, culture and attires chosen as theme for the event. The annual series have historical precedents since the 1850s in the same hall. There were annual masquerade balls in the Old Freemasons lodge, by the student association and later also by the artist association in the carnival season in Christiania. These traditions are closesly related to the present Operaball in Oslo. Several compositions have been written for these events, notably Johan Svendsens Festival Polonaise. Edvard Grieg has performed and held concerts in the freemasons lodge and one piano composition is called At the carnival. The present series were initiated by Bj√∏rn Einar Sakseid. His first full-scale ball required roccoco costumes with Mozart style wigs, powder, and white stockings. After the restoration and reopening of the old Freemasons Lodge, this ball series has been the largest event in this hall. The capacity is 600 people. After a gala performance a procession walks a historical route through the city streets Count to Wedel's Square and the freemasons Lodge. From 1988 to 2006 the performance was at the Norwegian Opera in Folketeaterbygningen, the new Opera House in Bj√∏rvika opened in 2008. In 2007 and 2011 a mini-opera was held in the old freemasons Lodge. The Opera Ball Operaballs have alternately been called Roccoco Ball, Mozart Ball, masquerade or Mask Balls, in 1992 it was a Leap Year Ball on 29 February. In 1998, there was an Operaball on Valentine's Day, with the Orchestra playing A midsummer Night's dream by Mendelssohn, and in 1993 there was also a Christiania Soir√©e, where the organizers held the first public ball at Akershus fortress since the Middle Ages. Bj√∏rn Einar \\"Mozart\\" Sakseid Bj√∏rn Einar \\"Mozart\\" Sakseid The organizers of the Operaballs were first private initiatives by Bj√∏rn Einar Sakseid with Christopher Brown (1988) and Tormod Carlsen (1989) among students at the University of Oslo. In 1990 the ball was part of the student week of the Norwegian student society led by Beatrice Johnson, from 1991 it was fronted by Jo Siri Ekgren and Signe Marie Hernes and in 1992 the Association T√•rnseilerne (swift) was founded.

The leader of the Operaballs (2004‚Äì2011), Gj√∏rill Songvoll, received the City of Oslo's Culture Prize in 2010. The Operaball in Oslo has inspired several similar balls, notably by the student society in Trondheim, the Jyske Opera in Denmark, the Opera house in Rostock, Germany and Copenhagen Opera House. These have visited, referred to and invited members of the Operaballs in Oslo to similar events. The Jutland Opera (den Jyske Opera) has organized several masquerade balls after visiting the Oslo Opera Ball and with participation from Oslo, with a masked Ball held on 5 February 2005.

It reflects his individualistic nature and vitality. Poem Release Anwar first read \\"Aku\\" at the Jakarta Cultural Centre in July 1943. It was then printed in Pemandangan under the title \\"Semangat\\" (\\"Spirit\\"); according to Indonesian literary documentarian HB Jassin, this was to avoid censorship and to better promote the nascent independence movement. \\"Aku\\" has gone on to become Anwar's most celebrated poem. Indonesian writer Muhammad Balfas notes that one of Anwar's contemporaries, Bung Usman, wrote \\"Hendak Jadi Orang Besar???\\" (\\"So You Want to Be a Big Person???\\") in response to \\"Aku\\". Balfas suggests that Usman was greatly irritated by the \\"vitality and new way of life\\" that Anwar showed in the poem. Analysis Anwar's \\"Aku\\", on a wall in the Netherlands According to Timorese scholar of Indonesian literature A. G. Hadzarmawit Netti, the title \\"Aku\\" emphasizes Anwar's individualistic nature, while the temporary title \\"Semangat\\" reflects his vitality. Netti analyzes the poem itself as reflecting Anwar's need to control his environment and not be shaped by outside forces, emphasizing the first two stanzas. According to Netti, through controlling his environment, Anwar is able to better protect his freedom and individualistic nature. Netti sees the final line as reflecting Anwar's pride in his individualistic nature, finally surmising that Anwar would have agreed with Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism. Indonesian literary scholar Arief Budiman notes that \\"Aku\\" reflects Anwar's worldview, that others should not care for him as he does not care for others. Budiman also notes that the third and fourth stanzas reflect Friedrich Nietzsche's view that suffering makes one stronger.

One of the foremost disciples of Sri Prativadibhayankar Swamiji of Kanchi, he popularized Sri Vaishnavism throughout North India among the masses and brought Sri Vaishnavism beyond its traditional domain of South India. After Sri Rangadeshika Swamiji, who founded the Ranganathji temple in the mid-19th century, he can rightly be counted amongst the most noteworthy Acharyas of Sri Vaishnava sampradaya. He manifested himself on Baishakha Krishna Paksha third, Friday in Anuradha Nakshatra Vikram era 1962 (1905 A.D) in the Shishirgadh village, 12 km southward of the Buxar town in the state of Bihar. He descended in the lap of Shrimati Mahamanya Indira Devi, the virtuous wife of an immensely devout kanykubja Brahmin named Shrinarayan Chaturvedi. Later life He (who later on became Tridandi Swami) was a yogi (a contemplative saint) and a sage possessing true spiritual knowledge by birth. However, following the worldly order he went to Lakshmi Narayan Temple, Charitravan, Buxar for study. He stood first class first at the ‚ÄòSahityacharya‚Äô examination held in Buxar. After that he went to Ayodhya and engaged himself exclusively for the deep study of grammar and again he secured the first rank in the first class at the ‚ÄòVyakarnacharya‚Äô examination held there. Initiation and education Tridandi Swami Vishwaksenacharyaji in his youth(right after taking renunciation). The revered Tridandi Swamiji Maharaj adopted consecration in Vaishnavism from Shri 1008 Swami Ram Krishnacharya ji, the fifth head of the spiritual shrine named Lakshmi Narayan Temple situated in the Charitravan, Buxar. His spiritual preceptor assigned him a new name i.e. Vishwaksenacharya in place of his previous home name ‚ÄòVaidya Nath Chaturvedi‚Äô. This very Vishwaksenacharya ji met Shri Kanchi Prativadi Bhayankar Mathadhishwar Gadi Anantacharya Swami who was a well reputed preceptor in every nook and corner of India in 1926 A.D.. Shri Gadi Swami was a great man endowed with astonishing talent. Swami Vishwaksenacharya was instantly overwhelmed to see Shri Gadi Swami ji and so he expressed his keen desire to become a recluse under his guidance. Shri Gadi Swami ji taught him several books containing the knowledge of Nyaya and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta Philosophy. He also made him well acquainted with the teachings of several esoteric scriptures and adept in the scriptural deliberation. After this Shri Gadi Swami became instrumental in making him adopt the Tridanda Sanyas ( Tridanda Asceticism ) from Shri Vadi Kesari Azhagiya Manavala Ramanuja Jeeyar Swami ji and then he (Shri Gadi Swami ji) accepted him as his disciple. Thereafter Shri Vishwaksenacharya ji became Tridandi Swami endowed with excessive dispassion. Now Shri Gadi Swami made him behold the omniscient and all pervading God Sriman Narayana in no time. Since then Shri Tidandi Swami's Acharya Nishtha ( allegiance and loyalty to his preceptor ) and Bhagavat Priti ( love and devotion to God ) had become so deep that he started remaining in Bhava Samadhi (emotional trance) for 2-2, 3‚Äì3 days. Sometimes he wailed loudly, at times became unconscious to hear the transcendental conduct of God and His devotees. Every now and then he used to become oblivious to the external surroundings, inter alia, even of his saffron belongings and Kamandal (water pot ‚Äì earthen or wooden used by ascetics). He was often seen sitting at secluded spots under trees with a view to beholding and realizing the Supreme God.Shri Tridandi Swami Ji was endowed with rare ability to usually memorise the contents of the book once he went through it. He was at home in \\"Ashtanga Yoga\\" and he remained in trance for 5 days together. In the Siddhashram Buxar itself he started chanting the sacred ‚ÄòNarayana Mantra‚Äô with utmost faith and devotion. He attained mastery over all the limbs of the eightfold yoga of Nathamuni and performed sadhana in famous centres of pilgrimage like Badrinath , Muktinath , Gangotri etc. By dint of this Yogic practice he acquired surprising supernatural powers. Owing to be spontaneous grace of the Lord he soon became an undisputed master of the ‚ÄòAshtanga Yoga‚Äô of Nathamuni and its limbs (Yam ‚Äì Niyam-aasan ‚Äì Pranayam ‚Äì Pratyahar ‚Äì Dharana -Dhyan ‚Äì Samadhi ). Shortly thereafter, he kept himself fully absorbed in yogic meditation after which he used the siddhis(occult powers) attained thereby for the benefit of hapless souls. Propagation of Sri Vaishnavism The duration of his trance went on farther. He remained in extreme exaltation for five, seven and fifteen days continuously. Just for pulling on his physical body he started taking some unboiled cow-milk obtained in alms. Sometimes he took only a few fruits like mango, guava, etc. Observing the total renunciation and ascetic leaving and seeing characteristics of a great man of divine nature in Tridandi Swami ji people got highly attracted towards him. Now Shri Swami ji dwelt in a hut made of grass and straw. In the meantime, his spiritual guru (teacher) who had given him the Vaishnava initiation gave up his worldly body and reached the Supreme abode in the Uttarabhadra Nakshatra of the eleventh day of the dark fortnight of the month of Jyesth of the Vikram era 1998 (1941 A.D.). In accordance with the last wish of his divine preacher he had to manage the sixth throne of Shripati Peeth Shri Lakshmi Narayana Temple, Charitravan, Buxar. But as Shri Tridandi Swami ji was, in effect, a Paribrajak Sanyasi (wandering ascetic) and had taken a vow for propagating the devotion to God from village to village roaming throughout India, he entrusted the responsibility of managing the said Shripati Peeth on the shoulders of his most worthy and competent disciple Shri Swami Devanayakacharya. Besides, there was also a mutt named Shri Kosalesh Sadan belonging to the said Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Ayodhya. Shri Trindandi Swami entrusted the responsibility of managing this ‚Äòmutt‚Äô on the shoulders of his well capable disciple named Vedmartand Shri Rama Narayanacharya ji. After sometime he made his both disciples ‚Äòpithadheesh‚Äô (proprietors of the shrines). He also conferred on them the vows of Tridandi Sanyas (renunciation). Final salvation Shri Tridandi swami ji got salvation(samadhi) on Margshirsh Krishna Paksha tenth, Thursday in Utara Falguni Nakshtra Vikram era 2056 (1999 A.D). There is a beautiful temple where pujya Shri Tridandi swamiji got salvation(samadhi) and people often visit there to get his blessings. Salient Points 1\\\\. The renounced life of Shri Tridandi Swami ji was of 74 years (from 1926‚Äì1999). During the span of these 74 years Shri Swami ji carried through various activities of the utmost importance for the welfare of the world. He has written several commendable sacred books. He got constructed several temples, schools and cow stalls, etc.. He moulded the life current of a good deal of persons. By virtue of his holy and merciful vision a large number of atheists became theists. During his lifetime many astonishing yogic miracles were noticed by the people at large every now and then. He had great faith in the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of the Lord Ramanujacharya. His votaries believed that he was a partial incarnation of Vishvaksena ji ‚Äì the commander in chief of the Lord Narayana.

CEO and consultant for Radio Shack. Retired as Raytheon Historian Norman (Norm) B. Krim (1913‚Äì2011) was an American electronics engineer and engineering executive. His drive to create a transistor product for the electronics experimenter-hobbyist market contributed to paving the path for a generation of American electronics engineers and technicians during the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The result was that a whole generation of aspiring engineers ‚Äî kids, really, working in their garages and basements ‚Äî got to make all kinds of electronic projects. A lot of them went on to become engineers.‚ÄîHarry Goldstein, editor for IEEE Spectrum magazine.  Early years  Norm Krim was born June 3, 1913 Manhattan, New York, one of four children of parents Abraham and Ida Krim. He graduated from George Washington High School at age 16 then attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he graduated 1934 in electrical engineering. He worked for most of his career for Raytheon, (over 75 years). He began as an engineer at Raytheon when he was hired in 1933 during his junior year at MIT for 50 cents an hour. His first success was in the development of subminiature tubes, in the Special Tubes group. While working in the special tube division, before the outbreak of WW2, he wanted to use subminiature tubes in consumer products (hearing aids and radios). After Raytheon's success in subminiature tubes for wartime applications such as the proximity fuze, Raytheon became the leader in the design and production of subminiature tubes. Raytheon promoted Krim to be head of the Special Tube Division. The proximity fuze was a small radar-like device attached to on a bomb or artillery shell that would detonate the bomb or shell before impact, causing a greater destruction. Just as importantly, the fuze initiated detonation *without* needing to impact the target directly, or to rely on an altitude setting in the fuze that would detonate the shell at an estimated target height, and close enough that the shrapnel cloud would impact the target. Given the extremes of aircraft target range and speed, and of shell accuracy of the day, the proximity fuze dramatically increased the effectiveness of anti-aircraft fire. After World War Two ended, Norman Krim got the go ahead from Laurence Marshall head of Raytheon, to build the first pocket portable tube radio using and adapting subminiature tubes for commercial products. The radio was called the Belmont Boulevard designed by Niles Gowell (Raytheon had acquired Belmont Radio Corp for this purpose). Raytheon Subminiature Tube (CK5676 shown)- Made the proximity fuze possible in wartime and the portable hearing aid possible in peacetime  Raytheon Semiconductor Products  Although the Belmont Boulevard did not sell well, he later was given another challenge by Laurence Marshall the head of Raytheon to start making semiconductor products. Under his direction Raytheon became a leader in making hearing aid transistors. A Time Magazine article in 1953 stated, ‚ÄúThis little device, a single speck of germanium, is smaller than a paper clip and works perfectly at one-tenth the power needed by the smallest vacuum tube. Today, much of Raytheon‚Äôs transistor output goes to America‚Äôs hearing aid industry.‚Äù The hearing aid was first mass-produced consumer electronics to be miniaturized. By 1948 Raytheon had 98% of the hearing aid tube market. Because of the invention transistor by Bell Labs in 1948, Raytheon, under Krim's direction started making transistors for hearing aids. Their first transistor product was the CK703 point contact transistor. His successes in Raytheon's Semiconductor Products allowed him to become Vice President of Receiving, Cathode Ray Tubes and Semiconductor Division. 1954 Acousticon Hearing Aid with Hybrid Design showing Raytheon CK549DX Hearing Aid Tubes and the Raytheon CK718 Hearing Aid Transistor He is particularly known for developing the first mass-production alloy junction transistor and used the fallouts or transistors that did not meet specifications as transistors to be sold at a much lower cost, the CK721 and CK722. Raytheon quickly moved into alloy junction transistor because of the lower noise, more rugged and lend itself to mass production, compared to point contact transistor. Establishing a tradition that would become a distinctive feature of early transistors, these (CK722) were production drop-outs from another transistor line, the CK721, that did not pass test criteria for the CK718 hearing aid transistor (the main product). However they could be sold at a much lower cost as a lower specification product. This concept help start a new market for transistors, the experimenter and hobby line. Seeing this window of opportunity Krim linked up with Radio Shack to market the hobby grade transistors. Other manufacturers followed soon after. Early- Before 1956 * CK718 hearing aid transistor PASS ALL TEST sell to hearing aid companies **DID NOT MEET ALL KEY PARAMETERS retest as CK721 and CK722 *** HAS highest gain and lowest noise label as CK721 sell as audio amplifier ****lower gain and higher noise label as CK722 sell as hobby/experimenter Later as transistor yield improved and size got smaller- After 1956 * CK78X series (CK781 thru CK789) mini hearing aid transistor PASS ALL TESTS sell to hearing aid companies **DID NOT MEET ALL KEY PARAMETERS retest as CK721 and CK722 ***HAS highest gain and lowest noise put mini transistor into larger case label CK721 ****lower gain and higher noise put mini transistor into larger case label CK722 In the later runs Raytheon kept the bigger transistor case size for the CK721 and CK722. A possible reason was marketing. The size was like an identifying physical trademark. Many people who used these transistor still remembered what they looked like.  Transistor radios  Although Regency is credited of building and marketing the first Transistor Radio (Model TR-1 in 1954), Raytheon was only a few months behind with the 8TP1 through 4 \\"lunchbox\\" style radio. Norman Krim was involved in the early transistor radio designs. According to Krim, at the Chapel St labs, they made a six transistor superheterodyne radio in 1952-53. Transistor radio designs for mass production went to Belmont Radio Corporation headed by Henry F. Argento a division of Raytheon. More info on Belmont go to this link Belmont-Raytheon. Unlike Regency (IDEA Inc), Raytheon used their own transistors. Regency contracted with Texas Instruments, a young upcoming semiconductor manufacturer. According to Consumer Reports Magazine articles dated April and July 1955, the Raytheon was a better radio (used 7 transistors vs 4 in the Regency), but quite a bit larger. Raytheon marketed only four models (8TP series, T-100 series, T-150 series and T-2500) and got out of the transistor radio market after 1956.

They had three children Robert, Arthur and Donald. For a brief time he left his VP position at Raytheon and served as CEO of Radio Shack from 1961-1963. He sold his interests to the Tandy Corporation in 1962. He returned to Raytheon until his retirement in 1997. During those years he was also part of a consulting firm. In later years he would act as Raytheon's in-house historian. Norman Krim was a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or IEEE. He died in December 2011, in Newton, MA at the age of 98.  Engineering contribution to society  According to Jack Ward's \\"Semiconductor Museum\\", Norman Krim is credited with inspiring the transistor hobbyist and experimenter market with the creation of the CK721 and CK722. As Jack Ward, curator of the Semiconductor Museum website, states, \\"Many of the talented and dedicated professionals and amateurs who have been responsible for the tremendous rise of the electronics industry over the past four decades can still remember the time when, as a young hobbyist, they were able to scrape together enough money (maybe through saving allowance or cutting the neighbor‚Äôs grass) to buy that first CK722....\\" From the CK722 came articles in electronics magazines, and books and pamphlets on do-it-yourself building projects, as well as competition, notably General Electric who, following Krim's lead of recycling out-of-specification transistors, came up with the 2N107 transistor.

The stems are covered narrow, threadlike leaves up to long and no more than half a millimeter wide. The leaves are sometimes split into segments. They are solitary or arranged in fascicles. The inflorescence is a panicle of hanging flower heads. Each head contains sterile disc florets and 2 to 3 fertile ray florets. The fruit is a tiny achene. The achenes do not tend to disperse far from the parent plant. Ecology Artemisia filifolia is a dominant species across much of the west-central United States, particularly in areas where the substrate is a deep, sandy soil. It is an indicator of sandy soils. It is efficient for preventing erosion on such soils.Sand Sagebrush. Range Plants of Utah. Utah State University. Retrieved 12-26-2011. It is common in parts of the Great Plains, where it is a dominant component of prairie, grassland, and shrubland ecosystems alongside grasses such as sand bluestem, grama grasses, sand reedgrass, little bluestem, and sand dropseed.Western Great Plains Sandhill Shrubland. Ecosystems. Colorado State. Retrieved 12-26-2011. Some regions dominated by this sagebrush include the occurrences of the sandsage prairie from Nebraska to central Texas, various river systems in eastern Colorado and Kansas, the sandhills and mixed-grass prairies of Colorado, and parts of southeastern Wyoming. In Texas, it is common in the Trans-Pecos region, where it grows with honey mesquite, and many other areas in the state where it grows with sand shinnery oak. This ecosystem is most commonly affected by fire and grazing. Before human presence, the ecosystem was maintained by a pattern of disturbance caused by natural wildfire and grazing by bison, a pattern which is called pyric herbivory. Rangeland impact When humans began to use this terrain as rangeland, this system was altered, causing a homogenization of life forms in the habitat.Doxon, E. D., et al. (2011). Aboveground macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in sand sagebrush prairie managed with the use of pyric herbivory. Rangeland Ecol Manage. 64 394-403. Retrieved 12-26-2011.

Fire also helps prevent the succession of woody vegetation onto shrublands. The sagebrush is tolerant of fire, resprouting vigorously after its aboveground parts are burned away.Vermeire, L.

Retrieved 12-26-2011. Ecosystem Sand sagebrush ecosystems are important habitat types for many animals. Prairie dogs build towns in sandy sage grassland, and when they abandon them, burrowing owls move in. Sage grouse live in sand sagebrush, though they prefer big sagebrush. Some animals eat the seeds, such as lesser prairie chickens and scaled quail. Lesser prairie chickens also use it for cover and nesting purposes. Extensive removal of sand sagebrush has been shown to reduce the diversity and abundance of breeding birds in the habitat.Rodgers, R. D. and M. L. Sexson. (1990). Impacts of extensive chemical control of sand sagebrush on breeding birds. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation. 45(4) 494-97. Retrieved 12-26-2011.

One method of control is burning, then placing livestock where they will graze the new sprouts as they come up. It is also controlled with herbicides and mowing. Commercial use Sand sagebrush seed is sold commercially. It is sometimes used for revegetation efforts on rangeland and coal fields. The Navajo had several uses for the plant. It was used medicinally and for ritual purposes. Being quite soft, it was used as toilet paper.Artemisia filifolia. University of Michigan Ethnobotany. Retrieved 12-26-2011.

Its first, and so far only, eruption occurred in January 2010. Morphology Tor Zawar is a group of closely spaced fissure vents on a non-volcanic mountain in a tectonically active region between the Bibai and Gogai thrust faults (Global Volcanism Program), which is in the Ziarat region near the village of Wham. 2010 eruption An eruption in the region on January 29, 2010 surprised volcanologists because no previous volcanic activity had ever taken place there before. A local scientist reported that fissures opened, then emitted gases for a little while before the eruption began. The eruption produced a small spatter cone and a lava flow that only travelled 8.2 metres, and caused some minor damage. The lava is trachybasalt and basaltic andesite. The eruption was preceded by a 60 km deep earthquake on 27 January. The calculated source depth of the lava is consistent with an origin at this depth in the asthenosphere.Kerr, A. C. and Khan M.

He was educated at Burlington College and the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to his professional roles, he was a descendant of Captain John Underhill and served as the first president of the Underhill Society of America, a lineage society that was formed to perpetuate John Underhill's memory. Biography Underhill was born in New York City on September 13, 1839, the son of Ira B. Underhill (1800-1857), grandson of Joshua Underhill (1765-1839), and great-grandson of Isaac Underhill (1726-1814). Underhill was raised in Burlington, New Jersey and was graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. From 1859-1862 he served as a clerk in the insurance business. Underhill married Emily H. Griffin, the daughter of John L. Griffin who was a prominent member of the Society of Friends. He also served as a member of the Township Committee of Montclair, New Jersey in the 1890s. In business he was a clerk in the commission business from 1858 to 1862. He entered the service of United States Fire Insurance Company in 1862 as assistant secretary. In 1865 he became secretary and in 1882 he was elected President, replacing his uncle Abraham Sutton Underhill who served as President before him. A war among insurance companies around 1898, caused a committee of 15 New York based insurance companies to be formed, and to organize a tariff association. E.C. Irvin of the Fire Association of Philadelphia said at the time, \\"Rates at first were made so high as to invite and foster unfair and illegitimate competition, loose practices, private deals, broken agreements, and at last utter demoralization. A meeting in September 1898 called for an association to rate and govern the fire insurance businesses in New York City. He was involved in discussions leading to formation of the tariff association, given his role as President of the United State Fire Insurance Company. Underhill was subsequently elected as Secretary for the Fire Insurance Tariff Committee. Citing the withdrawal of small companies and a large loss ration for the last two months in 1898, that the work of the committee would be favorably received. Underhill was selected as the first President of the Underhill Society of America and also Chairman of the Monument Committee. The Underhill Society of America was founded in 1892 with the purpose of helping to establish this monument. Having made insufficient headway with raising the $6,000 in needed funds, He resigned as President of the Underhill Society and as Chairman of the Monument Committee. Estelle Skidmore Doremus took his place as the second President. Underhill died in the home of his daughter Mrs. Henry C. Meyer, Jr., at 25 Highland Avenue in Montclair, New Jersey, on June 11, 1935. Underhill had been living there the past 15 years prior to his death at the age of 96. Surviving beside his daughter were two sons: Ernest Underhill of Verona, New Jersey and John Griffin Underhill of St. Petersburg, Florida.

Biography Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion (R), Tekoah, and Eytan, Jerusalem, Israel (1957) Tekoah was born in Lyakhavichy, Poland as Yosef Tukaczynski. At the age of five he emigrated with his family to Harbin, due to the rise of fascism in his homeland. Some time after the Fall of Harbin to the Imperial Japanese Army, Tekoah's family moved to Shanghai for financial purposes. He had a Doctorate in international relations from Harvard University, where he also taught and Master's degree in Natural and legal rights from Aurora University. In 1948 he made Aliyah, changed his name to Tekoah and started working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he met his wife, Ruth Tekoah. During his work in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tekoah appointed for several positions: * The Israel Foreign Ministry legal adviser (1949‚Äì1953) * Head of Armistice Affairs in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1954‚Äì1958) * Deputy and Acting Head of the Israeli delegation to the UN (1958‚Äì1960) * The Israeli Ambassador to Brazil (1960‚Äì1962) * The Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1962‚Äì1965) * VP of the Israeli Foreign Ministry (1965‚Äì1967) * Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations (1968‚Äì1975) He was the President of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from 1975 to 1981, following Moshe Prywes and succeeded by Shlomo Gazit. Historian Avi Shlaim stated that he \\"could always be relied on [by Israel and the IDF] to produce legal arguments to justify even the most outrageous Israeli actions,\\" and that \\"in his view the basic function of Israeli diplomacy was to service the country's security needs.\\" Tekoah died in 1991 in New York City after a heart attack.

Charles was the second son of the wealthy businessman and art collector Hendrik Rochussen (1779‚Äì1852), who was himself an amateur draftsman of some distinction and owned an extensive art and history library. His brother Henri Rochussen (1812‚Äì89) became a painter. While still a child, Charles showed a talent for drawing; between 1831 and 1834 he produced watercolor studies of birds. However, it was decided that he would pursue a career in business. He worked for a few years in an office before resolving at the age of 22 to turn to painting. In 1837 he enrolled at the academy in The Hague, where he was taught by Wijnand Nuijen (1813‚Äì39) and, after Nuyen's death, by Anthonie Waldorp (1803‚Äì66).Charles Rochussen in the RKD During his Hague period, which lasted until 1843 (or, according to some sources, 1846), he painted landscapes and beach and village views.

Flaubert and DC Root, is a Melbourne musician who is best known as the frontman for TISM, Root!, The DC3, and Damian Cowell's Disco Machine.  History  Cowell was born and schooled in Melbourne. His musical output began in the 1970s, when he played in various high school bands. In the early 1980s, he was part of a little-known group called I Can Run, featuring future TISM bandmate Eugene Cester. In December 1982, TISM formed and Cowell adopted the pseudonym \\"Humphrey B. Flaubert\\", a play on Australian children's television character Humphrey B. Bear and French author Gustave Flaubert. The group enjoyed underground success in the late 1980s and reached the ARIA top 10 in 1995 with their album Machiavelli and the Four Seasons. TISM remained largely anonymous throughout their career. Cowell publicly acknowledged his involvement in TISM via the debut single of his band the DC3 - a song titled \\"I Was The Guy In TISM\\".  Post-TISM  Cowell returned to the stage in 2007 under the moniker DC Root, fronting a band called ROOT!Root: a musical celebration of our beloved national verb During this period Cowell was commissioned by David Walsh to create a soundtrack for his Museum of Old and New Art. The soundtrack was titled Vs Art. In 2010, ROOT! disbanded, and quickly re-formed as The DC3.The DC3 / PonyloafAn Interview With Damian Cowell Even though much of Cowell's work uses programmed drums, he has played live drums at times, most notably during some songs in TISM's performance at Homebake 1998.

She was also a charter officer and regent of the New York City chapter of the DAR between 1892 and 1894. The wife of U.S. chemist Robert Ogden Doremus, Estelle (Skidmore) Doremus was a leading member of the American community in Paris during the height of the Second French Empire. Upon returning to New York City, she and her husband became important figures in society and well-known supporters of music and the arts, including the Philharmonic Society, of which her husband served as president for many years. Biography Doremus was born in New York, the daughter of Hubbard Skidmore and Caroline Avery. Hubbard Skidmore was believed to have served at a young age in the American Revolution under guidance from his father, the soldier Zophar Skidmore. On her mother's side Doremus was a granddaughter of Thaddeus Avery, a Revolutionary War soldier. On 1 October 1850 she married Dr. Robert Ogden Doremus, son of philanthropist Sarah Platt Doremus and Thomas C. Doremus, a merchant, and a Professor of Chemistry at New York City College. In the early 1860s her husband's work took them to Paris, where he advised the French government. Estelle was remembered as \\"the leader of the American colony in Paris during the most brilliant part of the reign of Napoleon III\\". Doremus returned to the United States from France following the end of the Civil War. Mrs. Doremus was a friend of many of the great singers and musicians at the time. The Doremuses formerly lived on Fourth Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, and later at a family home at 241 Madison Avenue that was frequented by leaders of the musical world. An issue of the New York Tribune published following her death described the creative and stimulating environment Doremus cultivated: > She had brilliant conversational powers, and a charm of manner which created > about her a wide circle of friends. She had a wide acquaintance throughout > the country and hosts of distinguished friends abroad. There gathered at her > entertainments statesmen, professional men, men of affairs, artists, > musicians, actors and others of distinction. These, with their wives and > daughters, formed a \\"salon,\\" in which those who entertained the company with > voice or instrumental music. Following her death on 21 May 1905, she was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. A \\"Memorial Sketch\\" to Doremus was prepared by David Harris Underhill and read at the Underhill Family Reunion on 7 October 1905. Role in lineage societies Doremus went on to participate in a number of organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Colonial Dames of America, and the Underhill Society of America. She was a member of the Colonial Dames of America and the Daughters of the American Revolution. Estelle was said to be the only member of the New York Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution whose father actually served in the Revolution. She was a Regent of the New York Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and honorary Vice President of the National Society. Doremus was influential in honoring Captain Thaddeus Avery, her maternal grandfather, by placing a plaque at the Avery Homestead in Mount Pleasant, New York. Over 100 people attended the dedication ceremony on 9 June 1900. The plaque read: > Captain Thaddeus Avery was branded with hot irons in this room, and his wife > threatened with death by the Hessians, when they refused to divulge the > hiding place of the money of the Continental Army. Mrs. Avery baked bread in > this oven for the Revolutionary soldiers. This hero and heroine were the > grandparents of Mrs. R. Ogden Doremus, Second Regent of the New York City > Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution, which organization affixed > this tablet June 9th, 1900. Born October 30, 1749. Died November 16, 1836. Born August 8, 1762. Died May 22, 1841. \\"Vicit ites durum pietas\\" From 1898 until her death in 1905, Mrs. Doremus served as the second president of the Underhill Society of America, which had been founded in 1892 with the purpose of helping to establish a suitable monument to the memory of Captain John Underhill. Having made insufficient headway with raising the $6,000 in needed funds, her predecessor, William Wilson Underhill, resigned as President of the Underhill Society and as Chairman of the Monument Committee. Doremus took his place as the second president. Doremus made it her objective to find a Chairman for the Monument Committee, and wisely selected Colonel John Torboss Underhill to fill that role. Following Doremus's death in 1905, John Torboss Underhill succeeded her as the third president. Now as President of the Society and Chairman of the Monument Committee, he felt renewed pressure to raise the additional money needed and proceed with work on the monument. While neither Doremus nor her husband lived to see the results of their labors, a plaque at the base of the Underhill monument recognizes Mrs. Robert Ogden Doremus as one of two \\"Patrons\\" who supported erection of the monument. Family Estelle and Robert Doremus had the following children: * Charles Avery Doremus (6 September 1851 ‚Äì 2 December 1925), chemist. For 22 years he served as a faculty member of the College of the City of New York.

Since the song refers to a young man wanting to find a wife like his mother, it is perhaps inevitable that some commentators have suggested, with varying degrees of seriousness, that the song's title and lyrics promote an Oedipus complex.Wylie, Philip.

Chorus I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad She was a pearl and the only girl that Daddy ever had, A good old fashioned girl with heart so true, One who loves nobody else but you, I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad. Verse 2 By the old mill stream there sit a couple old and gray, Though years have rolled away, their hearts are young today. Mother dear looks up at Dad with love light in her eye, He steals a kiss, a fond embrace, while ev'ning breezes sigh, They're as happy as can be, so that's the kind of love for me.Sheet Music (1911) Notable recordings * Columbia Quartette (29 May 1911) * American Quartet with Walter Van Brunt (27 July 1911)Library of Congress archive - 1911 recording by American Quartet * Dorothy Ward (January 1913) * Ella Retford (1920s?) * Dan Hornsby Trio (1928) Columbia * Al Jolson (28 November 1947) * Frankie Carle (1948) * Four Lovers (1956) * Graham Cuthbertson as Eddie Gluskin in Outlast: Whistleblower (2013) * Singing Mushrooms from Kings Dominion (1975-1990;2014-) References External links * 1911 recording by American Quartet (Library of Congress) * Sheet Music at Levy Sheet Music Collection 1911 songs Barbershop music Songs with music by Harry Von Tilzer ","title":"I Want A Girl (Just Like The Girl That Married Dear Old Dad)"},{"id":"34174523","text":"This is a list of museums in Aruba.

Its primary customers are the United States Department of Defense, the United States Intelligence Community, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). History Herschel Matheny and Dr. Steve Gilbert founded Dynetics in 1974. During the 1980s, Dynetics expanded to include electro-optic and infrared sensors, missile systems analysis and design, software development, modeling and simulation, and foreign material exploitation of radars, missiles, and missile seekers. In the 1990s, Dynetics continued to grow its core business, and expanded into the automotive supply industry as a provider of electrical test systems. Since 2000, Dynetics has been selling information technology (IT) and cybersecurity services, including winning a contract to provide IT services to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The company entered the space business with the development of the FASTSAT (Fast Affordable Science and Technology Satellite) micro-satellite and the purchase of Orion Propulsion. Its space business continued to grow with a 2013 SLS (Space Launch System) contract with NASA. On 17 December 2019, Leidos announced the purchase of Dynetics for US$1.65 billion and acquisition was complete on 31 January 2020. Operations Dynetics divides its services and products into the following categories: Intelligence, Missiles, Aviation, Cyber, Automotive, and Space. The company opened a new building in 2012 called \\"The Solutions Complex\\" that is 226,500 square feet of research and development facilities located in Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama. Dynetics operates remote operations additionally in Michigan, Florida, Virginia, Ohio, and Texas. Projects * In 2009, Dynetics teamed up with Freedom Information Systems, Inc. CIBER, MacAulay-Brown/Gray Research, and MEI Technologies and won the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) contract. This contract is valued at approximately - US$335 million over five years and covers IT security services; IT planning; telecommunication services; applications and web services; computing and audio visual information services. * In 2010, Dynetics teamed up with Marshall Space Flight Center and the Von Braun Center for Science and Innovation (VCSI) to build the FASTSAT-HSV. * In 2012, Dynetics submitted a proposal to NASA based on affordability, reliability, and performance for the F-1 engine, Main Propulsion System, and Structure risk reduction tasks for a possible SLS contract. Dynetics, with partner Aerojet Rocketdyne, was chosen and charged with the task of testing and manufacturing innovative engine components such as an integrated power pack, the primary rotating machinery of the engine. * Dynetics is to be a key partner to Aerojet Rocketdyne in the development of the AR1 rocket engine. Under a joint venture agreement, Dynetics is to supply elements of the AR1 engine‚Äôs main propulsion system, the ignition system, and ground support equipment, along with analysis support to critical engine designs.http://www.americaspace.com/?p=91985 Dynetics served as systems integrator for the development of what was then the world's largest precision-guided air-dropped system, the MOAB bomb. In May 2014, Dynetics announced that they will build up to 18 satellites to orbit Earth, in order to gather more data about the planet for the government and businesses. The company will be partnering with OmniEarth LLC, Harris Corp. and Draper Laboratories for the project. Dynetics also partnered with rocket propulsion company Aerojet Rocketdyne to help design upgrades to NASA's Space Launch System. In 2016, Dynetics was one of four companies to be awarded a contract by DARPA for an air recoverable experimental Unmanned aerial vehicle. Dynetics was chosen from the four companies to build the aircraft, which became the Dynetics X-61 Gremlins. The first X-61A made its maiden flight in January 2020. Dynetics Human Landing System Dynetics, working with Sierra Nevada Corporation‚Äôs Space Systems participated in some early human landing system (HLS) design studies under NASA's HLS Appendix E program. They submitted a proposal to NASA for HLS Appendix H for a concept called the Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) which in April 2020, was one of three proposals funded for further design work in a in NASA development funding contract during 2020/21, along with Blue Origin's Integrated Lander Vehicle () and SpaceX' Starship HLS (). At the end of the ten month program, NASA will evaluate which contractors will be offered contracts for initial demonstration missions and select firms for development and maturation of lunar lander systems. NASA's Stephen Jurczyk identified the fuel drop tanks and low crew module as innovative strengths, but the propulsion system (identified by Scott Manley as SNC's Vortex engines) was a low-maturity risk. Overall, their technical rating and management rating were listed as \\"very good\\", making the Dynetics proposal the highest-rated project. Robert Wright of Dynetics reported that the Dynetics team selected methane and LOX as the fuel/oxidizer system for their HLS lander because their studies indicated this choice offered the best combination of performance and long-term sustainability.

In a career that lasted little more than three months in the summer and autumn of 1864, he ran seven times and won five races including one walk-over. His wins included The Derby and the St Leger. Despite the brevity of his racing career, he was regarded by contemporary experts as one of the best British racehorses of his era and arguably the greatest horse ever trained in the North of England. He went on to become a highly successful stallion, siring the winners of many races. Background Blair Athol was a flaxen chestnut with a broad white blaze. He was bred, owned and trained by William I'Anson, who was based in Malton, North Yorkshire. His sire, Stockwell, was the leading British colt of his generation, winning the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger in 1852. He went on to become the dominant sire of his era, winning the title of Champion sire on seven occasions. Blair Athol's dam was the outstanding racemare Blink Bonny, who won the Derby in 1857. Racing career Blair Athol was slow to mature and did not race as a two-year-old. He did, however, show significant promise in trial gallops, and I‚ÄôAnson turned down an offer of ¬£7,000 for the colt from the bookmaker John Jackson. The fact that he had been entered in nine races without actually running caused some scepticism, but he was recognised by many observers as a horse of exceptional potential and a serious \\"dark horse\\" contender for the Derby. In the spring of 1864, Blair Athol had training difficulties and missed an intended run in the Dee Stakes at Chester. He suffered from dental problems which sometimes prevented him from feeding. He was also the victim of repeated attacks by a stable lad who had been paid by bookmakers to prevent the horse from running in the Derby. Before the culprit was caught, he had repeatedly kicked the colt on his legs and genitals, causing intermittent lameness. Blair Athol made his racecourse debut in the 1864 Derby on 25 May. He started at odds of 14/1 against twenty-nine opponents, in a strong fieldhttp://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=HBH18640806.2.9&srpos;=5&e;=01-08-1864-15-08-1864 --10--1----0Blair+Athol-- led by the 2000 Guineas winner General Peel who started joint-favourite on 9/2 with Scottish Chief. The race was run in fine, sunny weather and attracted an immense crowd including the Prince of Wales. The colt was ridden by James Snowden, a highly talented but troubled Yorkshireman who struggled with alcoholism. The race was delayed by eight false starts, and when the runners eventually got under way, Blair Athol broke slowly and was towards the back of the field in the early stages. Snowden rode a patient race, steadily making ground and moving up to track the leaders on the final turn. General Peel went to the front and appeared the likely winner until Snowden produced Blair Athol with a challenge. A furlong from the finish, Blair Athol moved level with the leader and then drew away with \\"ridiculous ease\\" to win by two lengths from General Peel with Scottish Chief third. The first prize was ¬£6,675 and the winning time was a record 2:43.6 Immediately after his Derby win, Blair Athol was sent to France for the second running of the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. The 3000m event was the most valuable prize in world racing, and attracted a large crowd including the French Emperor and Empress. Blair Athol's journey was delayed by bad weather at Folkestone and he arrived at the course only the night before the race. He started favourite ahead of Fille de l'Air, a French filly whose hostile reception after winning The Oaks had led to an intensification of the nationalistic rivalry surrounding the event. Ridden on this occasion by Tom Chaloner, Blair Athol was held up in last place before moving up to contest the lead in the straight. He was unable, however, to overhaul the long-time leader Vermout and finished second, beaten two lengths. The defeat of the English champion provoked scenes of wild excitement and celebration amongst the French crowd. On his return to England, Blair Athol was sent to Royal Ascot where he won the Triennial Stakes over one mile. In July, he won the Gratwicke Stakes at Goodwood and walked over in the Zetland Plate when no other runners opposed him. In August, he was beaten in the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York by a colt named The Miner. Blair Athol had the race apparently won in the closing stages but was caught close home and beaten a length in what was considered a huge upset. At Doncaster on 14 September, Blair Athol started 2/1 favourite for the St Leger in a field of ten, being slightly favoured over General Peel, who was believed to be in much better form than at Epsom. The race was run in heavy rain and \\"fearful\\" conditions, but attracted a huge crowd of supporters hoping to see the Yorkshire-trained Blair Athol win the great Yorkshire race. The visiting dignitaries on this occasion included the King of Italy. Ridden again by Snowden, Blair Athol was held up as usual before making his challenge in the straight. Inside the final furlong he was switched to the outside and came \\"shooting past\\" the other runners and won very easily by two lengths from General Peel. As Blair Athol was making his decisive run he was struck by another horse and sustained a tendon injury. He returned from the race lame and never raced again. When Blair Athol was moved from Malton to take up stud duties at Fairfield, near York, the road was lined by cheering supporters. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Blair Athol was ranked fifth, having been placed in the top ten by fifty-two of the contributors. He was the second highest-placed horse of the 1860s behind Gladiateur. The bloodstock expert William Allison described him as \\"the best horse I have ever seen.\\" Stud career Blair Athol in retirement, by an unknown artist Blair Athol began his stud career at the farm of John Jackson, the York bookmaker who had attempted to buy him as a two-year-old. Jackson paid ¬£7,500 for Blair Athol, reported as the largest sum ever paid for a racehorse up to that time. When Jackson became ill in 1868 he sold off all his horses and Blair Athol was bought for ¬£5,000 and moved to the Middle Park stud at Newmarket. In 1871, he was sold again, this time for ¬£12,500 to the Cobham Stud Company. Blair Athol was a highly successful stallion, being Champion sire four times between 1872 and 1877. His Classic winners included Silvio, Prince Charlie, Craig Millar, Cecilia and Scottish Queen. In 1878, his stud fee was raised to 200 guineas, leading to him being boycotted by most breeders who felt that the fee was excessive. In 1879, Blair Athol was sold for the final time, to the Pound Stud, also based at Cobham. He remained an impressive sight even in old age, and could regularly be seen exercising on the country lanes around Cobham. Blair Athol died in his stable in 1882.

Born in Southsea in Hampshire, he went to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and commissioned into the Royal Artillery. During the First World War, he became involved in super heavy artillery (see BL 14 inch Railway Gun) and was reputedly recalled to Dover in the Second World War on Churchill's instructions to help reassemble the same guns when they were deployed for coastal defence. After 1946, when he had retired from the army, he dedicated himself to music; especially the violin which he taught enthusiastically to many generations of London schoolboys. In later life, Cleeve helped with the revival of the viola d'amore and he formed, with others, the Viola d'Amore Society with the composer Frank Merrick as their first president (Ian White took over the Society in 1991). In 1967, Cleeve attended a class run by Maurice Bouette and made his first reproduction. He made several improvements to increase the volume and assist tuning to meet the demands of modern music, increasing the strings to 18. Through the Viola d'Amore Society he gave concerts, commissioned works from contemporary composers and edited some 400 himself.

Life  William Henry was born in Usingen, the fifth son of William Henry of Nassau-Usingen Born and Princess Charlotte Amalia of Nassau-Dillenburg. His father died just weeks before his birth. His mother then acted as guardian and regent until her death in 1738. She provided a comprehensive education and raised her sons in the Calvinist faith. In 1730 and 1731, he and his brother were enrolled at the University of Strasbourg and was taught by various tutors. He probably also studied for a while at the University of Geneva, which was popular among reformed students. His Grand Tour took William Henry to the court of Louis XV in France, among other places. After his mother's death, his brother Charles acted as regent until William Henry came of age in 1741. In 1741, the brothers decided to divide their inheritance. Charles received Nassau-Usingen on the right bank of the Rhine; William Henry received Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken on the left bank. At the time, Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken measured about 12 square miles and it had . This made it one of the smallest principalities in the Holy Roman Empire.Dotzauer: F√ºrst Wilhelm Heinrich, p. 89  Politics and economy  Shortly after his accession to power, he participated with his Royal-Allemand regiment in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1742 he sold his regiment to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, during his stay in Frankfurt on the occasion of the coronation of Charles VII. During this visit, he also met Princess Sophie of Erbach, his future wife. He later took part in the Seven Years' War, again with his own troops. He had a close relationship with France, his large neighbour. He often traveled to Paris, where he received military honors--as was usual at the time for ruling nobility--including a promotion to field marshal. William Henry reformed the administration and justice. He separated these two branches of government and issued some orders typical of the enlightened absolutists of his time. These included a cameralistic economic policy. He took measures to standardize taxes and introduced a modern cadastre on the Austrian model. He also promoted modern agricultural methods, such as the potato cultivation and pest control. He was also involved in coal mining and iron smelting. He nationalized the mines and leased the ironworks to entrepreneurs such as Cerf Beer. He laid the basis for a proto-industrialized economy, which would later evolve into the highly industrialized Saarland region. Despite the increase in revenues, his financial situation did not improve, because of his high spending on construction activities.Dotzauer: F√ºrst Wilhelm Heinrich, p. 92 ff He died in Saarbr√ºcken.  Extension of the residence  Saarbr√ºcken Castle Louis Church at night When William Henry's reign began, he and his family and some noble families moved from Usingen to Saarbr√ºcken and he began to develop his capital. The city had been severely affected by the confusion of the Thirty Years' War and the War of the Reunions. It was redesigned and expanded into a baroque capital, especially by the architect Friedrich Joachim Stengel. Noteworthy buildings from this periods are the Saarbr√ºcken Castle, the Louis Church and Basilica of St. John. He also built a number of palaces and town houses. The downside of his magnificent city was an immense debt, which his son and successor Louis had to deal with. Nevertheless, the city of Saarbr√ºcken is still dominated by William Henry's buildings and the keep his memory alive.Jung: Zwischen Ackerbau und F√ºrstenhof, p. 60-70  William Henry as enlightened absolutist  William Henry and his princely contemporaries show the possibilities and limits of an enlightened absolutist policy. As much as he insisted on enlightened principles of legal reforms, continued economic stimulus and the exercise of religious tolerance, he also remained a patriarchal ruler who forbade his subjects to actively participate in government and who tried to regulate all areas of life with an immense flood of regulations, and who suppressed social protests harshly.Ries: Obrigkeit und Untertanen, p. 425-436  Marriage and issue  Sophie of Erbach-Erbach, by an unknown artist, William Henry married on 28 February 1742 in Erbach with Sophie (1725‚Äì1795), the daughter of Count George William of Erbach and granddaughter of George Albert II, Count of Erbach-F√ºrstenau.

Route The flyway covers an area of and spans 64 countries from South Africa and Madagascar to Eastern Siberia and Alaska. The indirect route, where the birds fly west and then south rather than directly south, avoids the obstacle of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas. The birds usually migrate quickly from the Palaeartic to northeast Africa, reaching Ethiopia or Northern Sudan by late August or September. Some birds then remain in northern Africa for most of the fall before heading south either via Uganda and the Lake Victoria basin or via the Kenyan highlands. In the spring, many birds complete the return journey in six weeks or less, usually taking a route along the coast of East Africa. Willow warbler 331 species use the flyway. Seven sites along the route have over a million birds. About 25 species come from the far eastern Palearctic or even from Alaska. These include the northern wheatear, willow warbler and barn swallow. The willow warbler is the most numerous of the birds migrating along this route, accounting for 15.8% of the total number of passerines and near- passerines. Raptors such as the steppe buzzard also migrate along the flyway in large numbers. Some species follow variants of the route. The Amur falcon breeds in northeastern Asia and overwinters in southern Africa, making a round-trip journey of . Most of these birds fly south along the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and stop in northeastern India and Bangladesh for several months. In late November the falcons cross India and fly in great flocks over the Indian Ocean to Somalia and Kenya. They return via the Arabian peninsula, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Concerns The populations of birds that depend on the flyway are threatened. Changes in land use that cause deterioration or loss of wetlands is a major factor. Changes in agricultural practices, use of pesticides and recreational hunting are also threats. Hunting, on the rise in the Middle East, causes direct loss of life and indirect damage through lead pollution. Twenty of the species that use the flyway are globally threatened. These include the northern bald ibis, sociable lapwing, spotted ground-thrush and Basra reed-warbler. Data on the bird populations using this flyway are limited. It is only possible to assess trends for 35% of the wader species. Of these, 53% are in decline. Lake Chilwa in the south of Malawi illustrates the problem. The lake supports a waterbird population of around 1.5 million with about 160 species. With 12 species, the number is over 1% of their total flyway population. The local human population is dense and growing, and hunts waterbirds in large numbers as a source of protein when fish stocks are low. Efforts are being made to ensure that this hunting is done in a sustainable manner. The Asian ‚Äì East African Flyway largely lies within the area covered by the African Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA), which had 59 signatory states as of 2007. This agreement covers 235 species for which conservation measures would be put in place. Flyways overlap. Birds from the eastern Palaeartic breeding grounds also migrate to south-east and south Asia, and birds from eastern Europe and the Caucasus migrate to the wintering areas in east Africa. Wild migratory birds appear to play a significant role in distribution of avian influenza and in introduction of new viruses to resident and domestic birds.

For this reason, he is sometimes considered the \\"first grand master\\" of that order, even if it was only given recognition in 1192, and transformed into a military order in 1198. Sibrand had travelled to Outremer in 1188, in the Third Crusade of Frederick Barbarossa, as a follower of Adolf III of Holstein. Sibrand is mentioned as the founder of that hospital in a document by king Guy of Lusignan dated to September 1190. The field hospital was operated for German troops during the siege of Akkon. Such a hospital had been set up and operated by merchants of Bremen and L√ºbeck, near the cemetery of St. Nicholas, using a sail for shelter. After the conquest of Akkon, Guy gave to Sibrand a house in the city, the Armenian hospital, where the German hospital found more permanent quarters. After the fall of Acre in July 1191, the hospital was moved into the city and it evolves into the permanent base of the Teutonic Kings. With the help of donations made by the faithful, was purchased a garden for hospital in front of the gate of St Nicolas. In fiction Sibrand is one of the assassination targets in the original Assassin's Creed video game, where he is depicted as an atheist and as excessively paranoid (due to Alta√Ør recent success). He traffics in the port of Acre and he use the ships he acquired to block the Templars force.

Career  Born in Dresden, Rademann grew up in Schwarzenberg and received his first musical experiences in his father's church choir. As a teenager he was taught the violin and piano. From 1975 to 1983, he was a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor. After completing school, he studied choral and orchestral conducting at the Musikhochschule Dresden until 1990. He acquired further experience in several classes with Helmuth Rilling and Philippe Herreweghe. Rademann has conducted the chamber choir Dresdner Kammerchor since its founding in 1985. During 1991‚Äì1999 he was artistic director of the Academy of Music in Dresden. From 1999 to 2004, Rademann served as choir director of the NDR Chor. With the start of the 2007/2008 season Rademann took over as chief conductor for RIAS Kammerchor; he had already conducted several times as guest conductor. Rademann has served as guest conductor of various leading vocal ensembles, among them Collegium Vocale Gent, the National Chamber Choir of Ireland and the radio choruses of ARD. In 1997 he made his debut as an opera conductor at the Saxony Theatre with Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. In 1999 he conducted the Netherlands Bach Society's annual performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion. In 2010 he conducted the RIAS Kammerchor and the Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Berlin in performances of Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine, 400 years after its premiere, including a concert at the Rheingau Musik Festival in Eberbach Abbey, with Mar√≠a Cristina Kiehr, Gerlinde S√§mann, James Elliott, Andreas Karasiak and Harry van der Kamp. In 2000, Rademann was appointed professor of choral conducting at the Musikhochschule in Dresden. On 31 May 2008, he was awarded the S√§chsische Verfassungsmedaille of the Landtag of Saxony by the President of the Landtag, Erich Iltgen, \\"for his commitment to arts and culture in and for Saxony\\". In 2010 he founded the festival Musikfest Erzgebirge, which is focussed on early music from the region of the Ore Mountains. In 2013 Rademann succeeded Helmuth Rilling as director of the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart.  Selected recordings  In 1995, Rademann conducted Max Bruch's Das Lied von der Glocke after Schiller's ballad with the Dresdner Singakademie and the Dresden Philharmonic at the Kreuzkirche. In 2002, he conducted the Dresdner Kammerchor for a CD Weihnachten (Christmas), a collection of a cappella choral works including Tr√∂stet, tr√∂stet mein Volk by Sch√ºtz, Rheinberger's Ave Maria, Reger's O Jesulein s√º√ü, P√§rt's Magnificat, Poulenc's Hodie Christus natus est, Praetorius/Sandstr√∂m's Es ist ein Ros entsprungen, summarized in a review as \\"even the Angel Gabriel himself would have to approve!\\" His recording with the NDR Chor Reger: O Tod, wie bitter bist du. Reger vocal I was awarded the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik in April 2005 and the Diapason d'or in January 2006. Their recording Reger: Es sungen drei Engel. Reger vocal II combines works for Christmas, Epiphany and Easter. On a third CD they have recorded works by Bruckner for choir and brass. With the Dresdner Kammerchor he has also recorded music written for the court of Dresden, including sacred choral works by Johann David Heinichen, Johann Adolf Hasse and Jan Dismas Zelenka, and Membra Jesu Nostri by Dieterich Buxtehude, among others. With the RIAS Kammerchor, he recorded in 2008 lieder and choral works by Mendelssohn. David Vernier remarked in a review: \\"Mendelssohn's choral composition sensibility ... places more emphasis and importance on the voices ‚Äì their tone quality, blend and balance, phrasing, and expressive nuances. And in these things, Hans-Christoph Rademann and his RIAS Kammerchor are unsurpassed\\". In 2010, also with the RIAS Kammerchor, he recorded works by Krenek including Six Motets to Words by Franz Kafka. In 2011, he recorded with the Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Johann Ludwig Bach's Trauermusik, the funeral music for Duke Ernst Ludwig of Saxe-Meiningen.

He is known for inventing new surgical techniques for treatment of various ophthalmological disorders, and received professional awards for his contributions.  Career  Arnott was educated at Harrow School (Elmfield) and Trinity College, Dublin where he was awarded the Surgical Prize in 1952; BA (Hons) 1953 and MB (Hons), BCh (Hons) and BAO (Hons) 1954. He gained his Diploma in Ophthalmology (DO) in 1956 and Fellowship to the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) in 1963. Arnott's first ophthalmic appointment was as Houseman at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, following which he held early appointments at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, and University College Hospital London, where he trained under Sir Stewart Duke-Elder and H. B. Stallard. Whilst at Moorfields he worked with Sir Harold Ridley, the inventor of the intraocular lens; Arnott was inspired by Ridley‚Äôs work on the intraocular lens and they later became lifelong friends. After completing training at University College Hospital, Arnott was appointed as consultant initially to the Royal Eye Hospital and later, in 1965, to Charing Cross Hospital; then still in the Strand. In 1973 the hospital moved to its current site in Fulham, where Arnott was responsible for setting up the ophthalmic surgical services. In 1974, Arnott and his wife Veronica organised the first Live International Ophthalmic Micro-Surgical Symposium in Charing Cross Hospital, where ten of the world‚Äôs top eye surgeons performed live surgery, relayed to over 300 international delegates, courtesy of the BBC. This novel concept in advanced surgical teaching set a standard for future surgical conferences. He later organised two other live symposia with Professor Emanuel Rosen, with the objective of bringing new ideas in cataract surgery to a wider audience. Arnott was known for his pioneering work in ophthalmology and many of today‚Äôs top eye surgeons were trained by him whilst registrars at Charing Cross. He retired from the NHS in 1994.  Phacoemulsification  In 1968, whilst Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom he invited Dr Charles Kelman MD, the inventor of phacoemulsification (\\"phaco\\"), to address the Society. Kelman had found a method of removing the cataract through an incision of 3.5mm compared to the 12mm required for most surgery at the time. This meant that patients no longer had to remain in bed for two weeks after surgery with all movement restricted. In 1971, Arnott visited the United States to attend one of Kelman‚Äôs first courses. On his return, he privately raised the finance to buy the expensive equipment required for the procedure. When he started performing this new type of cataract operation, history indicates that it was not well received by his colleagues. Six years later Arnott was virtually alone in performing and teaching this procedure outside America. Today, almost all cataract surgery is carried out using a variation of the technique that Arnott pioneered in the UK in the early seventies.  Lens implantation  In 1974, influenced by Sir Harold Ridley's work on lens implantation, Arnott designed the Little-Arnott lens, which was manufactured by Rayners. This was one of the first intraocular lenses to be positioned behind the iris, the normal position of the natural lens. Previously, lenses were implanted in front of the iris, and many of them caused severe ocular problems.Apple D.J., Kincaid M.C., Mamalis N, Olson R.J. Intraocular Lenses: Evolution, Designs, Complications, and Pathology. Baltimore, Williams & Wilkins (1989) Arnott followed this up with several other designs before inventing \\"the totally encircling loop\\" lens which was manufactured under license by Alcon, Pharmacia and Smith & Nephew and others. Clinical data demonstrated that this lens maintained an excellent position within the eye and over 2 million were implanted worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s.Arnott E.J. Condon R. TELL - 3 year follow up of 1800 cases from Aug 1982 - Aug 1985. Cataract Journal Vol. 2 No. 8 During the seventies, all of the lenses designed by Arnott were made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). In 1981, Arnott and Richard Packard, his then senior registrar at Charing Cross Hospital, were the first to describe the use of a soft lens material, which could be folded to go through a small incision.Arnott E.J., Packard R.B.S., & Garner A. Poly-Hema as a material for intraocular lens implantation - a preliminary report. B.J.O. 65. (1981) In 1988 Arnott was the first surgeon to insert a bi-focal lens implant in Europe. Following cataract removal, it used to be common for patients to require thick pebble glasses to be able to see. Nowadays, virtually all patients receive a lens implant following cataract surgery, avoiding the need for glasses.  Other contributions Arnott was also responsible for introducing other surgical techniques. In 1966 he was amongst the first surgeons in the world to follow Dermot Pearce‚Äôs use of the surgical microscope.1978 Nursing Mirror Nov. 30-34 E J Arnott & M C W Treplin; Surgical use of the microscope in ophthalmics In 1967 he and Paddy Condon, his then senior registrar, used the first silicone implant for retinal detachment surgery. In 1968 he modified the final approach to glaucoma surgery by making the opening into the anterior chamber through the clear cornea, as opposed to the previous dialysis approach. In 1976 he and Jared Emery of Houston, Texas, invented the diamond tipped \\"spear headed\\" surgical knife for making the phaco incision and in 1978 he was the first surgeon to perform a combined phaco cataract and glaucoma operation. Arnott was very early in recognising the new trend of laser refractive surgery to correct myopia (shortsightedness). He acquired one of the first excimer lasers, which he located in Cromwell Hospital in 1991, where his private practice was based. In 1992 he was the first person in the UK to perform LASIK.Scotland on Sunday (13 December 1992), The Times, Guardian, Daily Mail and The Sun (13 December 1992) In 2000 Arnott received an award from the International Intra-Ocular Implant Club - the IIIC Medal, at the Club's annual autumn meeting in Brussels, Belgium.  Charity work  In 1982 he reduced his work in the NHS (from maximum part-time) to four sessions a week and began concentrating on charitable work at the Royal Masonic Hospital, London, (where he remained an honouree consultant until 1994) and international teaching commitments. Over the course of his career, Arnott lectured and performed live surgery throughout the world, paying particular attention to the Asian and African continents where cataracts are most prevalent. In 1984 he was one of the first surgeons to demonstrate phaco surgery and lens implantation in India and in 1991 he received a special award from the Asian branch of the Royal National Institute for the Blind for \\"outstanding support\\" to blind Asians in London and India. The same award was presented a year later to his son Stephen, who managed Arnott's private practice. In 1996, Arnott was invited to officially open the first meeting of the Indian Academy of Ophthalmology, and in 1998 he was made an honorary visiting Professor at Indore University. After Arnott's retirement in 1999, with the help of his wife Veronica and son Stephen, he raised funds to fund and equip a mobile operating theatre to perform modern eye surgery in remote Indian villages. This project was undertaken in conjunction with the Sathya Sai Institute.Ocular Surgery News ‚Äì 15 October 1999 Along with Dr G Chandra, he established the charity organisation 'Balrampur Hospital Foundation UK' in 2007 and served as a Trustee and its President.  Medical societies  Arnott was a member of many international ophthalmic societies and was the founder President of the European Society for Phaco and Laser Surgery (1986‚Äì89), Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom (1967 ‚Äì 1968), President of the Chelsea Clinical Society (1985) and President of the International Association of Ocular Surgeons (1983). He was also one of the original founder members of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. In 2007 Arnott received the Honoured Guest award from the ASCRS for his services to ophthalmology.American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS)  Publications  He wrote over 40 published scientific articles for British and foreign ophthalmic journals on strabismus surgery, congenital abnormalities, cataract extraction, Phaco-emulsification and intra- ocular lenses.Publications ‚Ä¢ 1964 B.J.O.

Personal life  Arnott was born in Sunningdale, Berkshire, the second son of Sir Robert Arnott Bt. and Cynthia Amelia (n√©e James). His family were notable Anglo-Irish philanthropists who owned, amongst other things, Arnotts department store, the Irish Times, and the Phoenix Park Racecourse. He was married to Veronica (n√©e Langu√©) from 1960 until her death in 2011 and had two sons, Stephen John 1962, Robert Laureston John 1971 and one daughter Tatiana Amelia 1963. Until 2001 he remained fit by swimming a mile every morning and in 1974 he successfully completed a challenge to swim from the infamous Alcatraz Island to the shore of San Francisco. When Arnott finally retired at the age of 70 years, he bought a retirement cottage in Cornwall in Mounts Bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean from where he wrote his memoirs \\"A New Beginning in Sight\\" before his death 1 December 2011.International Intra-ocular Implant ClubThe Telegraph 17 February 2012Euro Times, Volume 17, issue 2, P34Telegraph, Letters to the Editor, Friday 17 February 2012The Times, 17 February 2012  See also  *Harold Ridley *IIIC *David J.

As its name suggests, it runs down the left, or west, bank of Lake Z√ºrich, connecting Z√ºrich to Ziegelbr√ºcke and N√§fels. The left-bank railway opened in 1875 and forms part of the Z√ºrich‚ÄìChur main line. It is long, standard gauge, double track and electrified at supplied by overhead line. Between Z√ºrich and Thalwil, the line originally shared its tracks with the Z√ºrich‚ÄìLucerne main line, although many through trains on this stretch now use the Zimmerberg Base Tunnel rather than the lakeside line. Geography Linksufrige Z√ºrichseebahn en History The line was opened by the Swiss Northeastern Railway in 1875. Prior to this, trains between Z√ºrich and Chur travelled on the Wallisellen to Rapperswil via Uster line. The parallel line on the opposite bank of Lake Z√ºrich did not open until 1894. Between 1875 and 1925, the line followed a routing through Z√ºrich north of Wollishofen that differed from the current alignment and was largely at street level, with many level crossings. The line passed through a single tunnel, the original Ulmberg rail tunnel, and crossed the Sihl river on a bridge.

Because he played for Achilles '29 on an amateur basis, he was able to sign on a free transfer with his childhood club, De Graafschap, in January 2015, on a one-and-a-half year contract. On 27 January 2015, Kaak made his official return to the club as a 83rd-minute substitute in a 0-2 win over SC Telstar. In the summer of 2017, Kaak moved to FC Oss, which became TOP Oss from 1 July 2018. In 2019, he signed a contract extension, which would keep him in Oss until 2022.

He was called \\"The George Washington of American Karate\\" by Kick Illustrated Magazine, October and November 1981. As well, Urban was founder of the karate style named American G≈çJ≈´ Ry≈´ Karate Do (USA GoJu Karate). Urban was one of only a small number of \\"white\\" students under G≈çgen Yamaguchi, an early Japanese G≈çJ≈´ Ry≈´ Sensei, Practitioner, and Instructor as well as the head of the style's organization, The GoJu Kai. Controversially, Urban created an American style of G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ without the permission of Yamaguchi who would not allow Urban to represent Japanese Karate in America as head representative for the GoJu Kai.  Early life  Urban was born in Jersey City Medical Center, New Jersey, on August 14, 1934. He lived a short while in Altoona, Pennsylvania, then was raised and educated in Union City, New Jersey, where as a boy he shined shoes and delivered the local newspaper, The Hudson Dispatch. At this point in his life he had shown an acute interest in the Martial Art Science of JiuJitsu and American Boxing. He graduated from Emerson High School in Union City, NJ in 1952 and thereafter joined the United States Navy.  US Navy duty in Japan  Urban began studying the martial arts while serving in the US Navy in Yokohama, Japan. He apprenticed with Richard Kim in 1953 and became his Uchideshi (house student). He was transferred to Tokyo in 1954 to continue his training with Kim, who introduced Urban to teachers Masutatsu Oyama, founder of the Kyokushin Kai and Gogen Yamaguchi, founder of Zen Nippon GoJu Kai. In 1954, Yamaguchi accepted Urban as his student. Urban trained with Oyama in 1955. When he left Japan in 1959 he had advanced to 5th degree black belt, which was granted by Yamaguchi.  Return to the US  In 1959, Urban moved to America and opened his first G≈çJu Ry≈´ DoJo on 13th Street and Summit Avenue in Union City, N.J. The following year he shared a school in Manhattan which was owned and operated by the Lephofker brothers before moving his classes to 20 E. 17th street in NYC. By 1964, Urban relocated to downtown locations in NYC‚Äôs Chinatown; Canal Street, Crosby Street, Wooster Street and Williams Street in the Financial District, respectively. Urban was also responsible for establishing structured tournaments with the use of a point system in America. The first of these was the 1st North American Karate Championships held at Madison Square Garden in 1962. .GoJu Ryu History  1964 visit to Japan  In 1963-64, Urban traveled back to Japan to seek Yamaguchi‚Äôs consent to create an official GoJu Ryu club in America and planned to remain for several years hoping to obtain higher rank. Yamaguchi refused his request and the relationship between the men fell apart. Urban quoted: ‚ÄúThe feudal system still exists in Japan, they have lost the true spirit, their system builds blind followers and I believe karate should build seekers not followers.‚Äù Urban returned to San Francisco and spent time training with Richard Kim; who promoted Urban to 6th degree black belt. The next year Urban, a gifted writer, would self-publish his now famous, \\"The Karate DoJo,\\" and by the beginning of the following year he would incorporate as, \\"Peter Urban Karate Inc.\\" and would establish \\"USA GoJu Karate,\\" as his DBA.  Back in the US  Urban continued to work under Richard Kim and the BuTokuKai but later went on to form his own U.S.A. GoJu Association (U.S.A.G.A) which is still in operation. Several students have been given permission by Urban to teach and continue to propagate the Urban System. Urban trained hundreds of well-known martial artists such as: Frank Ruiz, founder of Nisei GoJu-Ryu, Alberto Gotay, founder of World Goju, Sekwii Sha, founder of Goju Shanando, William Louie, founder of Chinese American Goju, Leon Wallace, founder of Harlem Goju, John Kuhl, founder of Combat Karate, Ron Van Clief, founder of Chinese Goju, Harry Rosenstein, founder of Kanzen Goju-Ryu, Manny Saavedra, founder of Sansei Goju-Ryu, Chaka Zulu, founder of ZuJitsu-Ryu, Steven Malanoski, founder of ShoBuDo GoJu Jitsu, Carlos Paris, founder of Yoshi Goju-Ryu, Anthony Lau, founder of Ying Yee Kwoon, Arcelio Rullan, founder of Rullan Goju-Ryu, Raymond A.

This perennial grass forms tufts of stems growing up to about 30 cm tall. It forms a sod. It spreads by stolons which extend along the ground and root to grow new tufts. The grass has been known to spread 4 m in one season. This is the main method of reproduction in the plant because it is often sterile and rarely forms seeds.Zlatnik, Elena. 1999. Hilaria belangeri. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. One of the two varieties, H. b. var. longifolia, does not form stolons, however. This grass grows in a number of southwestern habitat types, such as desert grasslands, woodlands, and shrubsteppe. It is a dominant species on some grasslands. It tolerates a wide variety of soils. It tolerates low levels of precipitation as it typical of deserts, but not necessarily drought, during which it goes dormant. This is an important forage for animals in some local regions. In central and western Texas, it is the main forage for cattle. Cattle find it very palatable. Wild ungulates such as pronghorn and deer graze on it. The grass is tolerant of grazing pressure, and even overgrazing. In some areas, it is productive early in the season, but most of its productivity occurs after summer rainfall. The growth of this grass is inhibited by the introduced African plant sweet resin bush (Euryops multifidus).

He was educated at King Edward VI's School, Bury St. Edmunds. He went to Catharine Hall, Cambridge and in January 1756 was fourth junior optime in the Mathematical Tripos. His classics, however, were stronger and in 1758 he obtained the member's prize for the best dissertation in Latin prose. He was elected Fellow of his college and was only just defeated in an election for the mastership. In April 1762, he was presented by his father to the rectory of Hawstead and in December 1774, he was instituted to the vicarage of Great Thurlow, also Suffolk. In the same year, he succeeded his father as the sixth baronet. Cullum was a scholar, antiquary and student of natural science. In March 1774 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and in March 1775 a Fellow of the Royal Society. Cullum died of consumption on 9 October 1785 and was buried at Hawstead. Works Cullum's diaries and correspondence survived at Hardwick House in Bury St. Edmunds, and elsewhere. Among his circle were the Duchess of Portland, Mary Delany, Richard Gough who began his Sepulchral Monuments at Cullum's prompting, Michael Lort, Peter Sandford, Thomas Pennant, James Granger, George Ashby, Michael Tyson, John Lightfoot, and William Cole. Cullum devoted time to the preparation of The History and Antiquities of Hawsted and Hardwick in the County of Suffolk, published in No. xxiii. (1784) of Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, and subsequently in separate form. He made collections for a History of Suffolk, and projected a new Flora Anglicana, but neither were published.

The first section, which is a river navigation, was opened in 1763, and linked Belfast to Lisburn. The second section from Lisburn to Lough Neagh includes a small amount of river navigation, but was largely built as a canal. At its peak it was one of the most successful of the Irish canals, but ultimately it was unable to compete with road and rail transport, and the two sections were closed in 1954 and 1958. The central section from Sprucefield to Moira was destroyed by the construction of the M1 motorway in the 1960s. Responsibility for most of its remains passed first to the Department of Agriculture and then to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, although the section between Aghalee Bridge and Lough Neagh, including the final ten locks, passed into private ownership. There is an active campaign to re-open the canal, including reinstatement of the central section. History The River Lagan at Moira is only from Lough Neagh, the largest inland lake in Britain and Ireland, and the terrain between the two is relatively flat. In 1637, the first suggestions that a navigable link could be constructed were made, but no action was taken at the time. Following the discovery of coal deposits in east Tyrone, which resulted in the construction of the Newry Canal, there was renewed interest, and in 1741 Arthur Dobbs, the Surveyor General, surveyed the route. Another twelve years elapsed before a petition was presented to the Irish House of Commons, which resulted in an Act of Parliament being passed on 24 October 1753 to authorise the work. The engineer Acheson Johnston estimated that making the River Lagan navigable to Moira and then building a navigable cut to Lough Neagh would cost ¬£20,000. Since 1729, all such work was managed by the Commissioners of Inland Navigation for Ireland, but the funds at their disposal were limited. The canal was therefore funded by imposing an extra tax on alcohol sold in the districts through which the canal would pass, which amounted to one penny per gallon on ale and fourpence on spirits. The tax would last for eleven years from 1753, and on this basis, work began in 1756. The engineer overseeing the project was Thomas Omer, and some of river had been made navigable within the first year. The work included new cuts to remove meandering sections of the river, four locks, the removal of shoals, and the construction of a towpath. The Irish Parliament gave additional grants of ¬£4,000 towards the project in 1759 and 1761, and the navigation was completed as far as Lisburn in 1763. A formal opening took place in September, when the Lord Hertford, a 60-ton lighter, loaded with 45 tons of coal and timber, made the journey from Belfast to Lisburn. A small additional section to Sprucefield had been completed by 1765, but work then stopped. Around ¬£40,000 had been spent on the project, but it was evident that using the river was not ideal, as it was subject to flooding in winter, and there was a linen bleaching industry along its course, who objected to the navigation commissioners having control of the flow of the river. In 1768, the engineer Robert Whitworth, who by this time was James Brindley's chief surveyor and draughtsman, was asked to assess the project. He reported that the river section was not suitable for navigation, and should be replaced by a canal, for which he suggested two routes and a cost of ¬£22,000, and that beyond Sprucefield the navigation should be constructed as a canal, either on the north bank of the Lagan, or on the south, which would involve building an aqueduct at Spencer's Bridge to cross the river. Although attempts were made to raise the necessary finance, and two Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1772 and 1774, to give additional powers to local commissioners, no real progress was made, and in 1779, the 'Company of Undertakers of the Lagan Navigation' was formed. The Marquess of Donegall was the chief shareholder, and most other members were either landed gentry or drawn from the nobility, and so had considerable financial resources. In June 1782, Richard Owen, who had worked on the construction of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for ten years agreed to oversee the project for four years. The company had insufficient capital to build a new canal below Lisburn, nor to fund the northern route to Lough Neagh, and so construction started on the southern route. The four Union Locks raised boats from the river to a summit level, which followed a course due west, and then turned to the north west to cross the Lagan. The aqueduct cost ¬£3,000 and took nearly three years to build. Progress was much slower than expected, but Aghalee was reached in March 1792, ten years after Owen began work. Initially, goods were transferred between the canal and the shore of the lough by road, for the final connection was not completed until December 1793. The Marquess of Donegall opened the canal on 1 January 1794, by travelling from Owen's house at Moira to Lough Neagh by boat. He had funded most of the ¬£62,000 cost himself. The summit level was long, with a flight of 10 locks, each at Aghalee, and four at Sprucefield. Operation The canal was not as successful as expected. There were problems with water supply on the summit level, because water from the Lagan was needed by the bleaching industry further down the river, and so could not be used indiscriminately. Below Lisburn, there were often problems where excess water during periods of high rainfall washed away the new banks. The Union Locks were not completed, and work continued until 1796, while it was suggested that Owen had prolonged the work for his own benefit. John Dubourdieu, writing in 1802, concluded that the use of the river was a fatal flaw, and that the navigation would have been much better if the lower section had been built as a canal to the same standard as the upper section. The canal had been planned to enable coal from the east Tyrone coalfields to reach Belfast, but in practice, higher quality coal was imported through Belfast and distributed to the communities around the canal and Lough Neagh. A group of businessmen from Belfast took over the canal in 1810. They investigated costs for a new canal section from Belfast to Union Locks. Owen estimated that it would cost ¬£42,425, and an application was made for half of this amount to the Directors General of Inland Navigation. They sent John Killaly to report on the plans, who suggested a new canal section from the Blackstaff river to the second lock, to avoid the tidal section near to Belfast. Owen's and Killaly's ideas formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1814, but the proposals to split the navigation channel from the river and to build a reservoir at Broadwater near Aghalee to supply the summit level were never implemented. However, improvements were made, towpaths were created, and traffic increased, although there were still some water supply problems. The canal did not make a profit, and when the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners refused to make a loan to fund the work, the likelihood of a new canal at the lower end receded. Kilpatrick Families lock- keeper's cottage near Shaw's Bridge, built 1827‚Äì34 In the 1820s and 1830s, there was competition on short-haul traffic from the road network, but it was hoped that the construction of the Ulster Canal, linking Lough Neagh to Lough Erne and the River Shannon, would create long-haul traffic. The Directors General of Inland Waterways were replaced by the Board of Public Works, and although they took control of the Tyrone Navigation in 1831 and the Ulster Canal in 1851, there was local opposition to them taking over the Lagan Canal. The old company was replaced by the Lagan Navigation Company in 1843, to ensure that the canal was maintained in good order, but the Board of Public Works supervised its activities quite closely. They successfully competed with the Ulster Railway, which had reached Portadown in 1842, and ploughed all profits back into improvements until 1859, when they announced a first dividend of one per cent. The canal was one of only two inland waterways in the north of Ireland that was commercially successful. Dividends gradually increased, and by the 1870s, traffic figures were more than double those of the 1830s. The condition of the Ulster Canal worried the Lagan Navigation Company, as almost no trade passed between the two. This was not helped by the fact that the locks on the Ulster Canal were narrower, and the depth over the cills was less, so that Lagan boats could not work the canal, and goods had to be transshipped. Although the Board of Public Works controlled the Ulster Canal, and had spent ¬£20,000 on it since they took control in 1865, no additional traffic had been generated. Between 1878 and 1880, the Lagan Canal built five boats which could work through both canals. The Lagan Canal was persuaded to take over the Ulster Canal and the Coalisland Canal or Tyrone Navigation in 1888. Although they spent a great deal on improvements, the additional canals remained in a poor state and continued to make a loss. The Lagan itself was maintained well, and traffic rose from 153,000 tons in 1893 to 170,000 tons in 1898. Crossing of the Lagan Canal by the Ulster Railway near Moira. Decline An overgrown section of the Lagan Canal near Dunmurry During the First World War, traffic dropped by half, but after hostilities ended, the government returned the canal to private ownership, some ¬£20,000 was spent on repairs, and traffic flourished. In the 1920s, traffic from Belfast to Lisburn averaged 307,033 tons of coal and 19,126 tons of other goods. Traffic above Lisburn was much lower, but some coal continued to reach the Ulster Canal until it was closed in 1931. There were large cargoes of sand and gravel travelling in the opposite direction, originating on the east Tyrone shores of Lough Neagh, and used for building projects in Belfast. The years immediately before the Second World War saw a collapse in commercial canal traffic. Downstream traffic dropped from 29,000 tons to 600 tons between 1931 and 1941, while upstream traffic dropped from 87,000 tons to 28,000 tons. The canals were thought to be too slow, compared to roads and railways. With their funds exhausted, the company considered closure of their canal and the Coalisland Canal. However, there was a clause in the Act of Parliament from 1843 which stated that if the canals became unnavigable, the Lagan Navigation Company would automatically cease to exist. Rather than create an awkward political situation, where the Ministry of Commerce inherited canals that were already defunct, the government made payments to the company to cover operating losses and some repairs to the infrastructure. Between 1938 and 1952, these payments amounted to ¬£130,000. There had been no traffic above Lisburn since 1947, and the Ministry of Commerce announced that the canals would close in the spring of 1954. The Inland Navigation Act (NI) was passed in April 1954, and the Coalisland Canal, the Upper Bann Navigation and the Lagan Canal above Lisburn were closed. Below Lisburn, the canal remained open for another four years, but was closed on 1 July 1958. In 1965, some of the central section, between Moira and Sprucefield, were destroyed by the building of the M1 motorway along its route. Restoration The restored Lock 12 at Lisburn There are proposals to restore the canal, to once again provide a navigable link between Belfast and Lough Neagh. Initially, a steering group was formed, with representatives from local councils, user groups and central government. The Lagan Canal Restoration Trust was a logical development of this group, and was formed as a company limited by guarantee in 2008 with representatives from the four councils which administer the areas through which the canal runs, and six other key partners, including the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure, and the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland. There are also representatives from other groups with an interest in the area. If 2016, the Trust was renamed to become the Lagan Navigation Trust. As part of the assessment process, a feasibility study was carried out by Fergus and McIlveen of Belfast. It concluded that even though parts of the route have been destroyed by the building of the M1 motorway, there were no insurmountable barriers to restoring the canal, which \\"has the potential to become one of the most significant recreational waterways in these islands.\\" A small section of the canal near Lisburn Civic Centre, which includes lock 12, has been restored to navigable condition, and there are three major sections of towpath which can now be accessed by the public. All of the locks and many of the other structures associated with the canal are scheduled monuments, which gives them some protection. A proposal for a ¬£2.5 million scheme to build a new lock, weir and footbridge at Stranmillis Gateway, at the site of the original first lock, was first suggested in 2005, and an economic appraisal of the scheme was undertaken. The scope was increased, to include restoration of the first of the navigation, as far as Edenberrry, but despite the Ulster Garden Villages Trust offering ¬£1 million to kick-start the project, little progress was made. The project was to include restoration of the second lock at Corby Wood. Lock 3 at Newforge has been restored, together with the lock keeper's cottage, with funding provided by the Heritage Fund, the Lottery Partnership Scheme and the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure. An stretch of the towpath has been reopened at Aghagallon, following work by Craigavon Borough Council to obtain access rights. Since the closure of the canal, the section between Aghalee and Lough Neagh has been privately owned, and this is the first part of that section where public access has been restored. Moira The project to build a new lock at Stranmillis and to restore lock 2 was restarted in late 2017. The site of the lock is occupied by a pen weir, which maintains the river levels between Stranmillis and Newforge, but it is inefficient, causes erosion of the river bed, and prevents navigation. The cost has risen to ¬£4 million, which has been provided by Belfast City Council, Ulster Garden Villages, and the Department for Intrastructure. Lock 2 is at Mooreland Meadow, which is in the Lagan Valley Regional Park.

The falls are the lowest of a long series of rapids that render the river unnavigable, forcing colonial explorers to travel by foot as far as the Stanley Pool upstream. The Congo is the third largest river in the world by volume of water discharged, and the deepest in the world. The section of river that ends with the Yellala falls has over 300 species of fish, many found nowhere else. Location The region drained by the Congo River covers one eighth of Africa, including both tropical rain forest and savanna, much of it in a huge, shallow basin. The present system of rivers seems to date from around five million years ago, not long ago on a geological time scale. At that time the Atlantic continental margin was lifted up and formed a barrier between the basin and the sea. A large lake formed before the Congo River broke through this barrier, running through a narrow, rocky channel about long from Kinshasa to Matadi. The river is navigable both above and below this stretch, called the lower Congo. The upper portion of the Lower Congo starts with the steep Livingstone Falls just below Kinshasa and continues for through a number of smaller rapids. The central portion of about is navigable, at times lake-like and at times narrow and as deep as . The lower portion of about is the steepest, with huge rapids at the Inga Falls and again at the Yellala falls, after which the river is navigable to the ocean. About of water flows over the falls each second. First European discovery The Stone of Yellala, bearing an inscription of 1485 by Diogo C√£o The Yellala Falls were reached by Europeans as early as 1485, when the Portuguese explorer Diogo C√£o took a group of men as far as the falls before they were forced to turn back by disease, probably malaria. In that place he set a padr√£o, a large stone cross-shaped marker, customary during the Portuguese Age of Discovery. The stone, which was not rediscovered until 1911, bears the words: \\"Aqui chegaram os navios do esclarecido rei D.Jo√£o II de Portugal - Diogo C√£o, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa.\\" (\\"Here arrived the ships of illustrious John II, King of Portugal ‚Äì Diogo C√£o, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa\\".) Later European visitors and descriptions Captain James Hingston Tuckey visited in 1816. He said that the local people thought the falls were the residence of an evil spirit, and that anyone who saw them would never see them again. Visiting in the dry season, he was disappointed by the falls. He described the site as comprising a large hill of syenite, a course- grained igneous rock, on the south side. The northern side, made of the same material, was not as high, but steeper than the south. He described the river as having forced its course and within the middle of the river an island of slate \\"still defies its power, and breaks the current into two narrow channels; that near the south side gives vent to a great mass of water, over which the torrent rushes with great fury and noise, as may easily be conceived\\". Tuckey, who was sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society of London to obtain information on the slave trade, noted the brutality of the Portuguese slave trade and gathered valuable information about the geography, animals, plants, minerals and people of the region. Talking of the people who lived above the falls, Tuckey said that fowls, eggs, manioc and fruits were the property of women. The items were never dealt with by the men without a discussion with their wives. Beads were given as presents from the men. In 1848 the Hungarian L√°szl√≥ Magyar ascended the Congo to the Yellala falls, before spending five years exploring the region to the south. Due to his lack of contact with the outside world, the valuable information that he gathered received little circulation. Yellala Falls from Sir Harry Johnston's 1884 account Sir Richard Francis Burton, who first saw the falls in 1863, wrote a description of the great Yellala. Waves developed in the course of the river \\"for a mile and a half above\\". Afterwards, the water heads down a slope of around thirty feet \\"in 300 yards, spuming, colliding and throwing up foam, which looks dingy white against the dull yellow-brown of the less disturbed channel - the movement is that of waves dashing upon a pier\\". He went on: \\"The old river-valley, shown by the scarp of the rocks, must have presented gigantic features, and the height of the trough-walls, at least a thousand feet, gives the Yellala a certain beauty and grandeur. The site is apparently the highest axis of the dividing ridge separating the maritime lowlands from the inner plateau\\". The explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who visited the falls on April 6, 1880, wrote that over a five or six mile stretch the incline was only , but that the \\"general fury of the water is caused by the obstructions which the giant volume meets in the bed of the narrow defile.\\" Sir Harry Johnston, who visited the falls in 1883, called the river \\"the last grand fall of Yellala\\" and detailed the sight and sounds of his impression of the falls. Ecological importance Steatocranus gibbiceps, a species of cichlid found in the lower Congo The Yellala Falls and the other falls and rapids upstream have largely isolated the aquatic fauna of the Congo Basin for around five million years, a significant period on an evolutionary timescale. The cichlid genera Steatocranus, Nanochromis, Lamprologus and Teleogramma are found only in the Congo basin. Several dozen species in these genera are found only in the lower Congo. Steatocranus are rheophilic, meaning they have adapted to living in fast water. The four species of Teleogramma are found only in the lower Congo rapids. Genetically distinct populations have been found on opposite sides of the river. Although only apart, powerful currents that may exceed have prevented interbreeding.

Numerous limb bones, probably belonging to only a few individuals, are also known. Specimens of Victoriaceros were collected in the middle Miocene site of Maboko located in Lake Victoria in Kenya, from the Maboko beds, dating to about 15 million years ago.

The Court rejected a challenge by the generic drug manufacturer Apotex to declare Synthelabo Canada's patent for Plavix, an anti-coagulant drug, invalid. At issue was whether selection patents are invalid in principle, and if they are not, whether the subject selection patent was invalid on the grounds of anticipation, obviousness or double patenting.  Reasons of the Court   Selection Patents  A selection patent by definition is a patent for a selection of compounds from a larger class of compounds described in a prior patent. The prior patent, often referred to as the originating patent or genus patent, is usually based on the discovery of a new reaction or class of compounds. As with all patents, selection patents must be novel and non-obvious. The selected compounds cannot have been made before, otherwise the selection patent is not novel. But if the selected compound is novel and possesses a special property of an unexpected character, the invention is not obvious. Justice Rothstein, for the Court, accepted that selection patents do not in their nature differ from other patents and are acceptable in principle.  Novelty  Apotex claimed that the patent did not satisfy the novelty requirement. The Supreme Court of Canada employed a two-part test for anticipation. In order for there to be a finding of anticipation, the prior art must satisfy both of the following branches: #prior disclosure; and #enablement. The disclosure branch requires that a single prior art reference must have been available to the public and must disclose the subject matter of the claimed invention. Once the disclosure requirement has been made out, the enablement branch must be satisfied. A disclosure is enabling if the skilled person of the art is able to work the invention. While routine trials are acceptable for this branch, no inventive steps are permitted. The Supreme Court stated four non-exhaustive factors to be considered in determining whether there has been enablement: # Enablement is to be assessed having regard to the prior patent as a whole including the specification and the claims. There is no reason to limit what the skilled person may consider in the prior patent in order to discover how to perform or make the invention of the subsequent patent. The entire prior patent constitutes prior art. # The skilled person may use his or her common general knowledge to supplement information contained in the prior patent. Common general knowledge means knowledge generally known by persons skilled in the relevant art at the relevant time. # The prior patent must provide enough information to allow the subsequently claimed invention to be performed without undue burden. When considering whether there is undue burden, the nature of the invention must be taken into account. For example, if the invention takes place in a field of technology in which trials and experiments are generally carried out, the threshold for undue burden will tend to be higher than in circumstances in which less effort is normal. If inventive steps are required, the prior art will not be considered as enabling. However, routine trials are acceptable and would not be considered undue burden. But experiments or trials and errors are not to be prolonged even in fields of technology in which trials and experiments are generally carried out. No time limits on exercises of energy can be laid down; however, prolonged or arduous trial and error would not be considered routine. # Obvious errors or omissions in the prior patent will not prevent enablement if reasonable skill and knowledge in the art could readily correct the error or find what was omitted. In this case, the Supreme Court concluded that the prior genus patent did not disclose the special advantages of the selection patent. Therefore, the enablement step did not need to be undertaken and the selection patent was novel.  Non-obviousness  In determining whether the subject patent was obvious, Justice Rothstein, for the Court, endorsed the four step approach from Windsurfing International Inc. v. Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd.,Windsurfing International Inc. v. Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd., [1985] RPC 59 (CA). as restated in Pozzoli SPA v. BDMO SA:Pozzoli SPA v. BDMO SA, [2007] F.S.R. 37 (p. 872), [2007] EWCA Civ 588. # Identify the notional \\"person skilled in the art\\" and identify the relevant common general knowledge of that person; # Identify the inventive concept of the claim in question or if that cannot readily be done, construe it; # Identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as forming part of the \\"state of the art\\" and the inventive concept of the claim or the claim as construed; # Viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed, do those differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art or do they require any degree of invention? In fields where advances are typically obtained by experimentation, an \\"obvious to try\\" test may be taken into consideration in the fourth step of the obviousness inquiry. The Supreme Court stated that if an \\"obvious to try\\" test is warranted, the following non-exclusive factors may be relevant: #Is it more or less self- evident that what is being tried ought to work? Are there a finite number of identified predictable solutions known to persons skilled in the art? # What is the extent, nature and amount of effort required to achieve the invention? Are routine trials carried out or is the experimentation prolonged and arduous, such that the trials would not be considered routine? # Is there a motive provided in the prior art to find the solution the patent addresses? The subject case turned on the \\"obvious to try\\" test. The Supreme Court found that the advantage of the selection patent was not quickly or easily predictable, and therefore the person skilled in the art would not have found it self-evident to try to find the claimed invention.  Double patenting  Apotex claimed that selection patents allow a patent holder to \\"evergreen\\" an invention. The Supreme Court rejected this argument for two reasons. First, a selection patent may be obtained by someone other than the inventor of the genus patent. Second, selection patents encourage improvement by selection. The Supreme Court concluded that there was no \\"same invention double patenting\\" because the claims of the genus patent and the subject selection patent are not identical or coterminous. Furthermore, there was no \\"obviousness double patenting\\" because the claims in the selection patent reflected a patentably distinct compound from the compounds in the genus patent. In view of the above, there was no double patenting.

They bore into the stem or branches of their host plant.Crop Insect Pest - Plantation crops - Pest of Coffee In the Thrissur district of Kerala, India, larvae of the coffee carpenter were found damaging allspice for the first time. Pest attack After larval attack, the crops can show many symptoms. Branches and twigs wilt quickly and become brittle resulting in them breaking off from the plant. Holes are frequently visible from which the frass is exuded. Stems show dieback due to internal feeding and finally wilt. After complete internal feeding, the dieback quickly occurs. Control Cultural methods of control include hand picking of adults and larva immediately after an infestation is spotted or planting barrier crops such as taro, sweet potato, Leucaena glauca or Pueraria. Many parasitoids and predators are used for biological control. To control larva, Bracon zeuzerae, larva of Eulophonotus myrmeleon, and Pantorhytes species are used. Woodpeckers are also effective.

David Fury and Graham Roland co-wrote the episode, while Jeannot Szwarc directed. Plot Peter (Joshua Jackson) fails to gain the support of the prime universe's Walter (John Noble) in returning to his original timeline, so Peter schemes with Olivia (Anna Torv) and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) to travel to the parallel universe so that Peter can ask Walternate (Noble) for help. To avoid crossing over via the Machine Room, Lincoln retrieves Walter's original dimension-crossing device, which in this timeline has been acquired by Massive Dynamic. The plan is for Lincoln to pose as the parallel universe's Lincoln and bring Peter to Walternate. Peter does not learn until later that Olivia has told Lincoln to discover whether Walternate is behind the appearance of a new class of shapeshifters. Olivia remains behind while Peter and Lincoln cross over at the Orpheum theater. Though Lincoln temporarily succeeds as posing as his doppelganger, Lincoln and Peter's real identities are soon discovered by the parallel universe's version of Lincoln (Gabel) and Olivia (Torv), having been called off a case by Walternate himself. As Lincoln and Peter are being taken back to Fringe headquarters, the driver of their van diverts from the convoy after receiving a call ordering him to murder Peter and Lincoln. Before Fauxlivia and the parallel universe's version of Lincoln arrive, Peter shoots the driver and is able to get away, leaving the prime universe's Lincoln to confront Fauxlivia and the other Lincoln. They lock up Lincoln in a closet as Olivia tries to convince alternate-Lincoln that Walternate's actions are suspicious: Walternate had taken them off of a case involving these new shapeshifters, clearly a Fringe case. Olivia speculates that Walternate might be behind these new shapeshifters. Peter travels to his mother, Elizabeth's (Orla Brady), home and convinces her to take him to Walternate. There, Walternate reveals that he had already known about Peter, as he had been \\"spying\\" on the prime universe. Peter explains that the prime universe does not trust Walternate, believing him to be responsible for the new shapeshifters. Walternate calls in his lead scientist, Brandon (Ryan James McDonald), to vouch for him, but surprises Peter by shocking Brandon unconscious with a special device, revealing Brandon to be a shapeshifter. Walternate is aware that these new shapeshifters have started to infiltrate his government, and the only reliable method he has found to detect them is the tazer-device, but that this will not be effective as it is fatal to humans. He requests for Peter to return to the prime universe to gain their trust on his behalf, as he believes that Peter, as a neutral party, is the only person he can truly trust. Only then will Walternate help him return to his timeline. Fauxlivia and Lincoln discover the location from where a phone call to one of the drivers was made, and get Broyles' (Lance Reddick) permission to investigate the source. After they depart, Broyles contacts David Robert Jones (Jared Harris), and warns him of the arrival of Fauxlivia and Lincoln; Jones is shown to have several more shapeshifters ready for deployment. In the prime universe, Olivia wakes up at the theater to find the Observer September (Michael Cerveris) sitting in one of the theater's front rows, shot in the chest. September warns her that he has seen all possible futures, and in all of them Olivia has to die. The Observer disappears before she has a chance to help him. Production \\"Back to Where You've Never Been\\" was co-written by co-producer Graham Roland and co-executive producer David Fury, while being directed by French director Jeannot Szwarc. The episode was shot in October 2011. Actress Anna Torv noted that the episode was similar to the eighth installment of the third season, in that it really helped kickstart the remainder of the season. She also said that \\"Back to Where You've Never Been\\" was \\"a really wonderful one for\\" Joshua Jackson, as there was \\"a lot of meaty stuff for [him] to do, which is great.

Polly was a Chinese American former teenage slave whose story became a biographical novel and was fictionalized in the 1991 film A Thousand Pieces of Gold. History and background Charlie and Polly Bemis were among the first pioneers to settle along the Salmon River (The River of No Return), only a few yards from the riverside. It was a mining claim rather than a homestead. Even today this house is not accessible by road; boats are a common means of access. In 1922, a fire gutted the Bemis home on the Salmon River, possibly caused by an untended or overheated woodstove; Charlie died soon afterwards. He had been ill in the previous several years, reportedly suffering from a lung ailment (probably tuberculosis). In 1923, Peter Klinkhammer and Charlie Shepp, who lived on the other side of the Salmon River on the east side of the confluence of Crooked Creek, helped Polly to rebuild a new home in the same spot as the one that burned down. Except for a short stay in Warren, Idaho, she lived there until 1933, when she moved to Grangeville, Idaho, dying shortly thereafter. While on a trip to Boise, Idaho, she stayed at the Idanha hotel and saw her first movie, rode her first streetcar, and had her first elevator ride. The Polly Bemis House is located east of Riggins, Idaho, and north of Warren, Idaho. The house meets two criteria of the National Register of Historic Places: criterion A for its connection with the social history of Chinese women in Idaho and criterion C as an excellent example of wooden logs and shingles construction and of the gable-front single-pen dwellings used in the central Idaho mountains. Some stone was also used in its construction. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 4, 1988. It is also the only structure on the inventory constructed with whipsawn lumber. About 15 x 20 feet in dimension, it has two rooms on the first floor, a half story sleeping loft, a gable front, and overhanging roof. Chinese miners made up almost half the population of this region during the late 1800s but suppression forced most to move to Chinatowns on the west coast. Few records exist of most of them, but there are many documents about Polly, making her home and experience significant. It is now part of the non-profit Polly Bemis Ranch. The home of Klinkhammer and Shepp is now a guest ranch known as Shepp Ranch.

Katherina is a feisty lesbian security guard at a Soviet archive facility that holds the brains of the USSR's late leaders. After getting her the job at the facility, Popolitipov (Jones), an apparatchik, attempts to woo her.

She appears as both an apparition during a man's inebriated state and again in 1992 in Siberia but this time alive and mute.It is there in Siberia where Katherina and Bonfila confront the fallout and human misery caused by nuclear waste.

The architecture and overall design of the park is intentionally rustic, a common idiom promoted by federal land management agencies in the early part of the 20th century. Lewisville park is the oldest in the county park system and is one of the most significant and lasting examples of the WPA in Clark County. Several of the existing structures were built by WPA workers between 1936 and 1940 and were still existing when the park was added to the national register, including a caretaker's cottage, bathhouse, kitchen, one large and two small shelters. All were built to appear non-intrusive and used local logs and rocks in their construction. Several other buildings, not a part of the historic register list, were built in the 1950s and 1960s and maintained the natural aesthetic designs of the existing structures. Present day Facilities include: Swimming hole (no lifeguard on duty), nature trails, playgrounds, tennis/basketball court and sports fields, fishing, and other facilities typical of large regional asset parks.

Community schoolhouse The small, red, one-and-one-half story gabled building with a cupola and bell was built in 1912 by John Kullberg. Kullberg, a Swedish immigrant, was a carpenter who also built a number of homes in the community and a church. The building stopped functioning as a school in 1931 when the Battle Ground school district absorbed the student population. Community activity center The next year it was purchased by the Venersborg Social and Athletic Club which had formed in 1915. The club was forced to discontinue its popular entertainment due to issues with crowd control. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1989. It is listed in the Washington Heritage Register as the state's oldest community center in operation. The roof was replaced by the Venersborg Historic Preservation Society in 2018, the building continues to serve as a center for community activities and a venue for wedding banquets for the church next door.

Schmahmann‚Äôs syndrome - identification of the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology. Cerebellum and Ataxias 2015, 2:2 is a condition that follows from lesions (damage) to the cerebellum of the brain. It refers to a constellation of deficits in the cognitive domains of executive function, spatial cognition, language, and affect resulting from damage to the cerebellum.Schmahmann, J.

Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 21, 245-253. Impairments of executive function include problems with planning, set-shifting, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, and working memory, and there is often perseveration, distractibility and inattention. Language problems include dysprosodia, agrammatism and mild anomia. Deficits in spatial cognition produce visual‚Äìspatial disorganization and impaired visual‚Äìspatial memory. Personality changes manifest as blunting of affect or disinhibited and inappropriate behavior. These cognitive impairments result in an overall lowering of intellectual function. CCAS challenges the traditional view of the cerebellum being responsible solely for regulation of motor functions. It is now thought that the cerebellum is responsible for monitoring both motor and nonmotor functions. The nonmotor deficits described in CCAS are believed to be caused by dysfunction in cerebellar connections to the cerebral cortex and limbic system.Schmahmann, J. (1991). An emerging concept. The cerebellar contribution to higher function. Archives of Neurology, 48, 1178-1187. Signs and symptoms The CCAS has been described in both adults and children. The precise manifestations may vary on an individual basis, likely reflecting the precise location of the injury in the cerebellum. These investigators subsequently elaborated on the affective component of the CCAS, i.e., the neuropsychiatric phenomena. They reported that patients with injury isolated to the cerebellum may demonstrate distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, disinhibition, anxiety, ritualistic and stereotypical behaviors, illogical thought and lack of empathy, aggression, irritability, ruminative and obsessive behaviors, dysphoria and depression, tactile defensiveness and sensory overload, apathy, childlike behavior, and inability to comprehend social boundaries and assign ulterior motives. The CCAS can be recognized by the pattern of deficits involving executive function, visual- spatial cognition, linguistic performance and changes in emotion and personality. Underdiagnosis may reflect lack of familiarity of this syndrome in the scientific and medical community. The nature and variety of the symptoms may also prove challenging. Levels of depression, anxiety, lack of emotion, and affect deregulation can vary between patients. The symptoms of CCAS are often moderately severe following acute injury in adults and children, but tend to lessen with time. This supports the view that the cerebellum is involved with the regulation of cognitive processes.Courchesne, E. & Allen, G. (1997). Prediction and preparation, fundamental functions of the cerebellum. Learning & Memory, 4, 1-35.Hokkanen, L. S. K., Kauranen, V., Roine, R. O., Salonen, O., & Kotila, M. (2006). Subtle cognitive deficits after cerebellar infarcts. European Journal of Neurology, 13, 161-170. Psychiatric Disorders There are a number of psychiatric disorders that are thought to be related to dysfunction of the cerebellum and that appear similar to symptoms of CCAS. It has been suggested that lesions in the cerebellum may be responsible for certain characteristics of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental dyslexia, Down syndrome, and Fragile X syndrome.Yildiz, O., Kabatas, S., Yilmaz, C., Altinors, N., & Agaoglu, B.

Brain Structucture & Function, [Epub ahead of print] Schmahmann‚Äôs dysmetria of thought hypothesis has been applied to these psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, it has been suggested that there is dysfunction of the cortical-thalamo-cerebellar circuit, which leads to problems with emotional behaviors and cognition.Andreasen, N. C., Nopoulos, P., O‚ÄôLeary, D. S., Miller, D. D., Wassink, T. & Flaum, M. (1999). Defining the phenotype of schizophrenia: Cognitive dysmetria and its neural mechanisms. Biological Psychiatry, 46, 908-920. Supporting this idea are postmortem studies that have shown smaller anterior portions of the vermisReyes, M. G. & Gordon, A. (1981). Cerebellar vermis in schizophrenia. Lancet, 2, 700-701. and reduced density of the Purkinje cells in the vermis in schizophrenia.Tran, K. D., Smutzer, G. S., Doty, R. L., & Arnold, S. E. (1998). Reduced Purkinje cell size in the cerebellar vermis of elderly patients with schizophrenia. American Journal of Psychiatry, 155, 1288-1290. There are several pieces of evidence that support the hypothesis that symptoms of some psychiatric disorders are the result of cerebellar dysfunction. One study found that people with schizophrenia had smaller inferior vermis and less cerebellar hemispheric asymmetry than control adults. It has also been found that individuals with ADHD have smaller posterior inferior lobes than a control group.Berquin, P. C., Giedd, J. N., Jacobsen, L. K., Hamburger, S. D., Krain, A. L., Rapoport, J. L., & Castellanos, F. X. (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study. Neurology, 50, 1087-1093. Other studies have suggested that the size of the vermis is correlated with the severity of ADHD. A study of people with dyslexia showed lower activation via positron emission tomography (PET) in the cerebellum during a motor task relative to a control group.Nicolson, R. I., Fawcett, A. J., Berry, E. L., Jenkins, I. H., Dean, P. & Brooks D. J. (1999). Association of abnormal cerebellar activation with motor learning difficulties in dyslexic adults. The Lancet, 353, 1662-1666. It may be possible to further understand the pathology of these psychiatric disorders by studying CCAS. Cause The causes of CCAS lead to variations in symptoms, but a common core of symptoms can be seen regardless of etiology. Causes of CCAS include cerebellar agenesis, dysplasia and hypoplasia, cerebellar stroke, tumor, cerebellitis, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases (such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy). CCAS can also be seen in children with prenatal, early postnatal, or developmental lesions. In these cases there are lesions of the cerebellum resulting in cognitive and affect deficits. The severity of CCAS varies depending on the site and extent of the lesion. In the original report that described this syndrome, patients with bihemispheric infarction, pancerebellar disease, or large unilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarcts had more cognitive deficits than patients with small right PICA infarcts, small right anterior interior cerebellar artery infarcts or superior cerebellar artery (SCA) territory. Overall, patients with damage to either the posterior lobe of the cerebellum or with bilateral lesions had the greatest severity of symptoms, whereas patients with lesions in the anterior lobe had less severe symptoms. In children, it was found that those with astrocytoma performed better than those with medulloblastoma on neuropsychological tests. When diagnosing a patient with CCAS, medical professionals must remember that CCAS has many different causes. Pathology Cerebellar pathways There are pathways that have been proposed to explain the non-motor dysfunctions seen in CCAS. A leading view of CCAS is the dysmetria of thought hypothesis, which proposes that the non-motor deficits in CCAS are caused by dysfunction in the cerebrocerebellar system linking the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. The normal cerebellum is now thought to be responsible for regulating motor, cognitive and emotional behaviors. When there is some type of damage to the cerebellum, this regulation is affected, leading to deregulation of emotional behaviors. This effect has been compared to dysmetria of movement, which describes the motor dysfunctions seen after cerebellar lesions.Schmahmann, J. (1991). An emerging concept. The cerebellar contribution to higher function. Archives of Neurology, 48, 1178-1187. These ideas build upon earlier theories and results of investigations indicating that the cerebellum is linked with the frontal orbital cortex, limbic system, and reticular structures. It was proposed that these circuits are involved with emotional regulation, such that damage to this circuit would result in behavioral dysfunctions such as hyperactivity, apathy, and stimulus-seeking behaviors.Prescott, J. W. (1971). Early somatosensory deprivation as ontogenetic process in the abnormal development of the brain and behavior. In Moor-Jankowski J. & Goldsmith E.I. (Eds.), Medical Primatology 1970. Basel: Karger. Connections lead from the cerebral cortex (including sensorimotor regions as well as cognitively relevant association areas and emotion-related limbic areas) to the cerebellum by a two-stage feedfoward system. The pathway starts in the layer V neurons of the cerebral cortex that project via the cerebral peduncle to the neurons of the anterior portion of the pons (the basis pontis). The pontine axons projects via the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle, terminating in the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. The feedback circuit from the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex is also a two- stage system. The cerebellar cortex projects to the deep cerebellar nuclei (the corticonuclear microcomplex). The deep nuclei then project to the thalamus, which in turn projects back to the cerebral cortex. This cerebrocerebellar circuit is key to understanding the motor as well as the non-motor roles of the cerebellum. The relevant cognitive areas of the cerebral cortex that project to the cerebellum include the posterior parietal cortex (spatial awareness), the supramodal areas of the superior temporal gyrus (language), the posterior parahippocampal areas (spatial memory), the visual association areas in the parastriate cortices (higher-order visual processing), and the prefrontal cortex (complex reasoning, judgment attention, and working memory). There are also projections from the cingulate gyrus to the pons. The organization of these anatomical pathways helps clarify the role the cerebellum plays in motor as well as non-motor functions. The cerebellum has also been shown to connect brainstem nuclei to the limbic system with implications for the function of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and the limbic system.Konarski, J. Z., McIntyre, R. S., Grupp, L. A., & Kennedy, S. H. (2005). Is the cerebellum relevant in the circuitry of neuropsychiatric disorders? Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience, 30, 178-176. The connection with the limbic system presumably underlies the affective symptoms of CCAS. Cerebellar anatomy It has been suggested that specific parts of the cerebellum are responsible for different functions. Mapping of the cerebellum has shown that sensorimotor, motor, and somatosensory information is processed in the anterior lobe, specifically in lobules V, VI, VIII A/B. The posterior lobe (notably cerebellar lobules VI and VII) is responsible for cognitive and emotional functions. Lobule VII includes the vermis in the midline, and the hemispheric parts of lobule VIIA (Crus I and Crus II), and lobule VIIB). This explains why CCAS occurs with damage to the posterior lobe.Stoodley, C. J. & Schmahmann, J. D. (2009). Functional topography in the human cerebellum: A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. NeuroImage, 44, 489-501. In the study of Levisohn et al. children with CCAS showed a positive correlation between damage to the midline vermis and impairments in affect. The authors hypothesized that deficits in affect are linked to damage of the vermis and fastigial nuclei, whereas deficits in cognition are linked to damage of the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. These notions were consistent with the earlier suggestion (by psychiatrist Robert G. HeathHeath, R. G. (1997). Foreword. In J. D. Schmahmann (Ed.), The Cerebellum and Cognition. International Review Neurobiology, 41, xxiii-xxv. San Diego: Academic.), that the vermis of the cerebellum is responsible for emotional regulation. The deep nuclei of the cerebellum also have specific functions. The interpositus nucleus is involved with motor function, the dentate nucleus with cognitive functions, and the fastigial nucleus with limbic functions. It has been shown that phylogenetically the dentate nuclei developed with the association areas of the frontal cortex,Leiner, H. C., Leiner, A. L., & Dow, R. S. (1986). Does the cerebellum contribute to mental skills? Behavioral Neuroscience, 100, 443-454. supporting the view that the dentate nucleus is responsible for cognitive functions. Lateralization There have been studies that show laterality effects of cerebellar damage with relation to CCAS. Language in the cerebellum seems to be contralateral to the dominant language hemisphere in the frontal lobes, meaning if the language is dominant in the left hemisphere of the frontal lobes, the right side of the cerebellum will be responsible for languageHubrich-Ungureanu, P., Kaemmerer, N., Henn, F. A., & Braus, D. F. (2002). Lateralized organization of the cerebellum in a silent verbal fluency task: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in health volunteers. Neuroscience Letters, 319, 91-94. (see Tedesco et al.Tedesco, A. M., Chiricozzi, F. R., Clausi, S., Lupo, M., Molinari, M., & Leggio, M. G. (2011). The cerebellar cognitive profile. Brain, 2011 Oct 27 [Epub ahead of print]. for a discussion of lack of lateralization). Lateralization is also observed with visuospatial functions. One study found that patients with left cerebellar lesions performed more poorly on a visuospatial task than did patients with right cerebellar lesions and healthy control adults.Molinari, M. & Leggio, M. G. (2007). Cerebellar information processing and visuospatial functions. The Cerebellum, 6, 214-220. It has also been shown that lesions of the right cerebellum result in greater cognitive deficits than lesions of the left hemisphere.Maeshima, S. & Osawa, A. (2007). Stroke rehabilitation in a patient with cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. Brain Injury, 21, 877-883. Treatments The current treatments for CCAS focus on relieving the symptoms. One treatment is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) technique that involves making the patient aware of their cognitive problems. For example, many CCAS patients struggle with multitasking. With CBT, the patient would have to be aware of this problem and focus on just one task at a time. This technique is also used to relieve some motor symptoms. In a case study with a patient who had a stroke and developed CCAS, improvements in mental function and attention were achieved through reality orientation therapy and attention process training. Reality orientation therapy consists of continually exposing the patient to stimuli of past events, such as photos. Attention process training consists of visual and auditory tasks that have been shown to improve attention. The patient struggled in applying these skills to ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù situations. It was the help of his family at home that significantly helped him regain his ability to perform activities of daily living. The family would motivate the patient to perform basic tasks and made a regular schedule for him to follow. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has also been proposed to be a possible treatment of psychiatric disorders of the cerebellum. One study used TMS on the vermis of patients with schizophrenia. After stimulation, the patients showed increased happiness, alertness and energy, and decreased sadness. Neuropsychological testing post-stimulation showed improvements in working memory, attention, and visual spatial skill.Demirtas-Tatlidede, A., Freitas, C., Cromer, J. R., Safar, L., Ongur, D., Stone, W. S., Seidman L.J., Schmahmann, J.D., Pascual-Leone, A. (2010). Safety and proof of principle study of cerebellar vermal theta burst stimulation in refractory schizophrenia. Schizophrenia Research, 124, 91-100. Another possible method of treatment for CCAS is doing exercises that are used to relieve the motor symptoms. These physical exercises have been shown to also help with the cognitive symptoms.Schmahmann, J. D. (1997). Therapeutic and research implications. International Review of Neurobiology, 41, 637-647. Medications that help relieve deficits in traumatic brain injuries in adults have been proposed as candidates to treat CCAS. Bromocriptine, a direct D2 agonist, has been shown to help with deficits in executive function and spatial learning abilities. Methylphenidate has been shown to help with deficits in attention and inhibition. Neither of these drugs has yet been tested on a CCAS population. It may also be that some of the symptoms of CCAS improve over time without any formal treatment. In the original report of CCAS, four patients with CCAS were re-examined one to nine months after their initial neuropsychological evaluation. Three of the patients showed improvement in deficits without any kind of formal treatment, though executive function was still found to be one standard deviation below average. In one patient, the deficits worsened over time. This patient had cerebellar atrophy and worsened in visual spatial abilities, concept formation, and verbal memory. None of these treatments were tested on a large enough sample to determine if they would help with the general CCAS population. Further research needs to be done on treatments for CCAS. Future research There is much research that needs to be conducted on CCAS. A necessity for future research is to conduct more longitudinal studies in order to determine the long-term effects of CCAS. One way this can be done is by studying cerebellar hemorrhage that occurs during infancy. This would allow CCAS to be studied over a long period to see how CCAS affects development. It may be of interest to researchers to conduct more research on children with CCAS, as the survival rate of children with tumors in the cerebellum is increasing. Hopefully future research will bring new insights on CCAS and develop better treatments.

Life Gershoy emigrated to New York City with her family in 1903. Aided by scholarships, she studied at the Art Students League under Alexander Stirling Calder, Leo Lentelli, Kenneth Hayes Miller, and Boardman Robinson. Around this time, she created a group of portrait figurines of her fellow artists, including Arnold Blanch, Lucile Blanch, Raphael Soyer, William Zorach, Concetta Scaravaglione, and Emil Ganso, which were exhibited as a group at the Whitney Museum of American Art. At age 17, she was awarded the Saint-Gaudens Medal for fine draughtsmanship. Gershoy married Romanian-born artist Harry Gottlieb. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the pair kept a studio in Woodstock, New York. There, Gershoy was influenced by sculptor John Flanagan, who lived and worked nearby. From 1936 to 1939, Gershoy worked for the WPA Federal Art Project. She collaborated with Max Spivak on murals for the children's recreation room of the Queens Borough Public Library in Astoria, New York. She developed a mixture of wheat paste, plaster, and egg tempera, which she used in polychrome papier-m√¢ch√© sculptures; she was the only New York sculptor to work in polychrome at this time. She also designed cement and mosaic sculptures of animals and figures to be placed in New York City playgrounds. Alongside others employed by the FAP, she participated in a sit-down strike in Washington, DC, to advocate for better pay and improved working conditions for the projects' artists. Gershoy's first solo exhibition was held at the Robinson Gallery in New York in 1940. She moved to San Francisco in 1942, and began teaching ceramics at the California School of Fine Arts in 1946. In 1950, she studied at the artists' colony at Yaddo. Gershoy traveled extensively throughout her life. She visited England and France in the early 1930s, and worked in Paris in 1951. She traveled to Mexico and Guatemala in the late 1940s, and also toured Africa, India, and the Orient in 1955. In 1977, Gershoy dedicated a sculpture to Audrey McMahon, who was actively involved in the creation of the Federal Art Project and served as its regional director in New York, in recognition of the work McMahon provided struggling artists in the 1930s. Gershoy's work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Her papers are held at Syracuse University.

The style also has been called Carpenter Victorian to emphasize both the vertical, Italianate features and the skill of craftsmanship, believed to be the work of Edward Slocum, brother of the owner. Ornamental medallions inside the house were signed and included patent dates from 1842 and 1846, although the house is believed by some to have been constructed in 1867. The 1867 date is not supported by local newspaper reports as there was no dwelling on the land at this time, and Charles W. Slocum was still busy in other areas of the Pacific Northwest. However many websites and reference books do mention the 1867 date, perhaps using a common source. After returning to Vancouver, Washington Territory in 1869, Slocum became interested in building a mansion in the vicinity of downtown Vancouver. The foundation was laid in May 1877, further progress despite \\"its large dimensions, and the substantial character of the materials and work\\" was reported in late June 1877, and work was completed by the beginning of 1878. When completed and unveiled to society on New Year's Day in 1878, the local paper described it as follows: > Mr. and Mrs. Charles Slocum received their friends at their elegant new home > on New Year's day. They have now finished and nearly furnished one of the > handsomest residences in Washington Territory. For completeness, neatness, > convenience, and architectural beauty, it discounts any house we know of in > the country. Their friends are glad to see them so agreeably situated. Charles W. Slocum had been trained as a carpenter in Rhode Island, and in 1857 he arrived in Vancouver and worked as a carpenter at the Vancouver Barracks. Later, he became superintendent of the barracks. In 1860, Slocum opened several general stores in the Pacific Northwest. He is credited with platting the town of Boise, Idaho, in 1863. The Slocum House is the only surviving structure in its former residential neighborhood of the Vancouver historic core. It was moved one block from its original location in 1966 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The building originally served as the city hall when it was built in the 1920s. However, for all practical purposes it no longer serves this role, as the mayor's office and city administration have since relocated to the Wall Street Building a block down the road. The building is currently used by the police department and by the city council to hold public meetings. Renaming effort In the summer of 2011, members of the community proposed that the building be renamed \\"William E. Moore Historic City Hall\\" in honor of Bill Moore, who served as mayor of Everett from 1977 to 1990. However, the nonprofit group Historic Everett pointed out that the proposal violates a city policy that prohibits renaming buildings that are on historical registries. The city council voted unanimously in 2012 to relax the naming policy, and also name the building after Moore. A formal dedication ceremony was held on September 13, 2014, installing a plaque at the building.

The National Hockey League (NHL) is a major professional ice hockey league which operates in Canada and the United States. Since its inception in 1917‚Äì18, 53 players born within the current borders of the United Kingdom have taken part. None of them, however, were trained within the country. Of these players, 23 are from England, 21 from Scotland, 5 from Northern Ireland and 4 from Wales. Steve Thomas and Owen Nolan played over 1,000 regular season games, while Thomas and Steve Smith are the only ones to have appeared in over 100 playoff games. All three players finished their careers in the 21st century. The only players born in the UK currently playing in the NHL are Brendan Perlini of the Detroit Red Wings, and Nathan Walker of the Washington Capitals. The modern form of ice hockey is generally considered to have begun in the mid-19th century. One of the first games to use a puck was played by a group of Englishmen from the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment in Kingston, Ontario. In the United Kingdom, a five team league was established in 1903, while Great Britain was one of the founding members of the International Ice Hockey Federation five years later. The game was first administrated by the British Ice Hockey Association, from 1914 until 1999, when Ice Hockey UK took over. In the early part of the 20th century the Great Britain national team enjoyed some success: they won gold at the 1936 Olympics, improving on their result of bronze twelve years earlier; won medals at three World Championships (bronze in 1935, and silver in 1937 and 1938), and won the first European Championships in 1910. The British team's heavy reliance on Canadian-trained players during its 1936 Olympic run was especially controversial, and prompted a protest from Canadian hockey officials. Two players born in the United Kingdom participated in the first season of the NHL. Ken Thompson had played the previous season for the Montreal Wanderers in the National Hockey Association (NHA), and played one game in the NHL before the Wanderers disbanded shortly after their home rink burnt down. Joe Hall had also played in the NHA prior to the NHL: he spent eight years playing for the Montreal Shamrocks and the Quebec Bulldogs, and won the Stanley Cup twice with the latter side. He joined the Montreal Canadiens for the first season of the NHL. Hall competed in the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals which were cancelled when most of his league champion Canadiens contracted Spanish influenza, and Hall died from flu-induced pneumonia shortly after. In 1961, he became the second player born in the United Kingdom to have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The first Hall of Famer born in the UK was Charlie Gardiner, inducted in 1945. Described as \\"one of the game's preeminent goaltenders during the 1920s and 1930s,\\" he played seven seasons in the NHL with the Chicago Black Hawks. He won the Vezina Trophy on two occasions, and was named team captain for the 1933‚Äì34 season, leading his team to win their first Stanley Cup. It was the only time a goaltender had captained a Cup-winning side. Just over two months after the Stanley Cup victory, Gardiner died of a brain hemorrhage. Players Charlie Gardiner, born in Edinburgh, won the Vezina Trophy in 1932 and 1934, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945. Owen Nolan, who was born in Northern Ireland, won Olympic gold for Canada. Daniel Taylor has played 4 games in the NHL, all with the Los Angeles Kings and Ottawa Senators. Brendan Perlini, who made his NHL debut in 2016 with the Arizona Coyotes, is currently the only UK-born player in the NHL. ;Key * Pos ‚Äì Position, G (Goaltender), D (Defenceman), LW (Left Wing), C (Centre), RW (Right Wing) * RS ‚Äì Number of regular season games played in the NHL * PO ‚Äì Number of playoff games played in the NHL * ‚Äì Player has been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - !

It is a major feature of the city's downtown core. It ceased functioning as a hotel in 1972. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1976. In 1994 it was restored and redeveloped into low income housing. Building The six story brick building was largest hotel project in Everett. It was built on the site of the original Monte Cristo Hotel, which opened in 1892 and had hosted the Providence Hospital from 1905 to 1924. Construction was a community project with hundreds of stockholders. Designed by Seattle architect Henry Bittman the hotel opened on May 29, 1925. The facade fronts on Wall Street looking south. The height of the building and its elevated position on the slope of downtown make it visible from some distance approaching the city from the south. This landmark was the town's important hotel and social center for over 40 years. The hotel closed in 1972. Modern times The building was redeveloped and historically restored in 1994 to apartments, an arts venue and a wedding and banquet facility. False start In 1991 after the building had been vacant about 20 years a group of investors spent about working on a redevelopment plan that fell through. Plans were announced in 1993 to renovate the building as low cost housing. At that time Mayor Pete Kinch described the Monte Cristo Hotel as a \\"bellwether of how we as a community are dealing with\\" the problem of downtown decline. Redevelopment and restoration In August 1993 private developer Lojis Corp. had assembled a financing package for the redevelopment into low income housing. The package was contingent on leasing some of the building's space. A plan for the city to lease the space for an arts venue led to a lengthy city council debate. On August 25, 1993 the Everett City Council approved spending per year to lease of space in the building, including the grand lobby, mezzanine and ballroom areas. By November of that year the building had been re‚Äìroofed, new sidewalks poured, new interior stairs built and exterior restoration started as part of a $6.8 million construction project. The Washington Community Renewal Association invested $3M and Lojis Corp. secured $3.8M in equity by selling $6.7M in federal historic and low income housing tax credits. Reopening At a three day grand reopening on June 10‚Äì12, 1994 Mayor Ed Hansen lauded Lojis president David Mandley for persevering in getting the project organized and skill in the historical restoration of the buildings exterior and common spaces. The guest rooms had been converted to 69 residential units which as a condition of using the tax credits must be rented to tenants with a income 60% or less of the area's median. Historic renovation and preservation were mandated by the use of the historic tax credits. Reporter Diane Brooks wrote in The Seattle Times, \\"Once a symbol of downtown decay, the hotel now symbolizes Everett's development boom\\". Popular downtown restaurant Passport moved into the Monte Cristo in 1994. 21st century In 1997 the building was again serving as a civic center when a public forum for candidates for judge on the county superior court was held there. The building was home to the Everett Center for the Arts and the Arts Council of Snohomish County which displayed art in the grand lobby and mezzanine including shows and exhibitions. The Monte Cristo Ballroom was named Best Wedding Venue in a 2019 readers poll in The Herald Business Journal. All inclusive wedding packages were offered.

Background Persia attempted to ratify the Treaty of Constantinople (1736), by demanding that the Ja'fari, also known as the Imamiyyah was to be accepted as a fifth legal sect of Islam.Nicolae Jorga: Geschichte des Osmannischen Reiches, vol IV, (trans: Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli) Yeditepe Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 2009, , p. 371 In 1743, Nader Shah declared war on the Ottoman Empire. He demanded the surrender of Baghdad. The Persians had captured Baghdad in 1623 and Mosul in 1624, but the Ottomans had recaptured Mosul in 1625 and Bagdad in 1638. The Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Empire had resulted in peace for 85 years. After the fall of the Safavid Dynasty, Russia and the Ottoman Empire agreed to divide the northwest and the Caspian region of Persia, but with the advent of Nader Shah, the Russians and the Turks withdrew from the region. Nader Shah waged war against the Ottomans from 1730 to 1736 but it ended with a stalemate. Nader Shah afterwards turned east and declared war on the Moghul Empire and invaded India, in order to refund his wars against the Ottomans. The war Nader Shah dreamed of an empire which would stretch from the Indus to the Bosphorus. Therefore he raised an army of 200,000, which consisted largely of rebellious Central Asian tribesmen, and he planned to march towards Constantinople, but after he learned that the Ottoman ulema was preparing for a holy war against Persia, he turned eastward. He captured Kirkuk, Arbil and besieged Mosul on 14 September 1743. The siege lasted for 40 days. The Pasha of Mosul, Hajji Hossein Al Jalili, successfully defended Mosul and Nader Shah was forced to retreat. The offensive was halted due to revolts in Persia (1743‚Äì44) over high taxes. Hostilities also spilled into Georgia, where Prince Givi Amilakhvari employed an Ottoman force in a futile attempt to undermine the Persian influence and dislodge Nader's Georgian allies, Princes Teimuraz and Erekle.Allen, William Edward David (1932), A History of the Georgian People: From the Beginning Down to the Russian Conquest in the Nineteenth Century, p. 193. Taylor & Francis, In early 1744 Nader Shah resumed his offensive and besieged Kars, but returned to Daghestan to suppress a revolt. He returned afterwards and routed an Ottoman army at the battle of Kars in August 1745. The war disintegrated. Nader Shah grew insane and started to punish his own subjects, which led to a revolt from early 1745 to June 1746. In 1746 peace was made. The boundaries were unchanged and Baghdad remained in Ottoman hands. Nader Shah dropped his demand for Ja'fari recognition. The Porte was pleased and dispatched an ambassador but before he could arrive, Nader Shah was assassinated by his own officers.

Description and history The one a half story wood frame cottage fronts on Pine St. Designed by Everett architect Frederick A. Sexton it combines elements of the Stick‚ÄìEastlake and Shingle architectural styles. Sexton came to the Everett town site in 1891 and became essentially the architect for the eastern side of town. He went on build the first brick building in town. Built in the winter of 1891‚Äì1892 the cottage was the home of Alfred W. Swalwell. Swalwell's parents and his brothers were active investors and developers in Everett, starting during a land boom based on speculation that the railroad would reach the coast in the area. The Swalwells filed the plat for their a few months before John D. Rockefeller's group filed their plat for the town of Everett. As investors could not yet buy land in the unfiled plat a rush ensued and the Swalwells did as much business in a day as the worth of real estate sold the day the plat the cottage is in went on sale. Alfred Swalwell built the cottage and later sold the property to his brother who lost it in a mortgage foreclosure after the Silver Panic of 1893. Pine St. was Swalwell Avenue at the time of construction. The cottage is one of the oldest residences in the city, possibly the only to retain its architectural character.

It was located up the Snohomish River to the company's Mill B, located near the Legion Memorial Golf Course. The structure served as an office space until the mill closed in 1979. In 1983, the building was donated to the Port of Everett. It was relocated at the Port's south marina. The structure served as an office space for the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.

The trial showed remarkable success in preventing HIV transmission and were so compelling that the study's Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) asked the research team to share the results with all study participants and offer ART to the control group (people who had been randomized to not start ART) before the study ended. As a result of the study there was increased consensus that treatment as prevention should be included as a public health strategy in lowering HIV infection. The trial was organized by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and its chief architect was Myron S. Cohen.  Results  As reported by a 2011 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, in the trial there were 1763 couples, where only one partner was infected with HIV. After following them for a median of 1.7 years, there were 4 HIV infections in the group on ART and 35 in the group not on ART. However, when comparing the HIV viruses in the 4 infections in the ART group, 3 of them were different than that of the partner who had originally had HIV. It is likely that these were contracted from another sexual partner, who was not involved in the trial. Therefore, only 1 transmission was recorded in the ART group with 886 couples followed for almost 2 years. That was estimated to be a 96% reduction from the control group, who had only started on ART if they had become sick or their CD4 cell counts had dropped below 250. It is also notable that both groups had received extensive counseling, condoms, and STI treatment. After the finding of such a drastic reduction in transmission the control arm was stopped prematurely in 2011 and all participants were offered ART. Couples were followed for four more years and by 2015, 1,171 couples were still being followed when the study was completed. As reported in a follow-up publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, only 8 cases of HIV transmission were recorded from patients on ART and 4 of them happened in the first three months after treatment was started and before the virus was able to be suppressed. The other 4 were in patients who had detectable levels of virus in their blood despite being on ART, likely due to resistance and virologic failure. Overall there was a sustained 93% reduction in HIV transmission.  Ethics  This study was groundbreaking for providing compelling evidence that treating persons with HIV actually reduces HIV infection rates in communities. Now that this information is available, it has created debates about ethical obligations which communities might have when making decisions about providing HIV treatment.  Reception  In December 2011, Science named the study as \\"Breakthrough of the Year\\".

He was the Count of Hanau from 1452 to 1458. The county was then divided between him and his uncle Philipp the Elder. Philipp the Younger received Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and ruled there from 1458 until his death.  Childhood  Philipp I was born at Windecken Castle (now in Nidderau) and was baptized in the local church. His godparents were * Reinhard of Cleves, or, according to another tradition, Reinhard of Kleen, dean of Mainz * Kuno of Beldersheim, abbot of the monastery in Seligenstadt, and * Katharina of Kronberg, n√©e of Isenburg, wife of Frank XII of Kronberg (1414‚Äì1490). In 1452, his father, Reinhard III, died after a reign lasting only ten months. Philipp was at this time only four years old, which is why a guardianship had to be set up for him. From 1452 until the county was divided in 1458, the regency was exercised by a council, consisting of his maternal grandfather Count Palatine Otto I of Mosbach, his paternal grandmother, Katharina of Nassau-Beilstein, and his only uncle, Philipp the Elder. From 1458 to 1467, Philipp the Elder was the sole guardian and regent. In 1467, Philipp the Younger came of age. Not much else is known about his childhood.  Division of the county  Count Philipp I the Younger of Hanau, shown as Roman captain in the crucifixion scene on the altar at W√∂rth am Main Coat of arms of Count Philipp I on his grave stone in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau Coat of arms of Adriana von Nassau on her gravestone in the St Mary's Church in Hanau  Context of the division  At the time of his accession Philipp the Younger was only four years old. This situation presented the Hanau family with a dilemma: * They could obey the primogeniture rule, which had been observed in Hanau since 1375. This would mean hoping that Philipp the younger would live to an adult age, marry and have children, who would continue the dynasty. This would have the advantage that all of the family's possessions would remain in a single hand. It would entail the risk that the dynasty might die out, if Philipp the Younger were to die without a male heir. * Alternatively, the family could ignore the primogeniture decision and allowed the next agnate, Philipp the Elder, to marry. This would have the advantage of significantly increasing the probability that the dynasty continued to exist, but the disadvantage that the county would have to be divided. This model also called for urgent action, as Philipp the Elder was almost 40 years old, which was considered quite an advanced age in the 15th century.  Debating the division  The debate over the division of the county is relatively well documented. Two parties took shape in the country and its ruling family. Otto I, co-regent for Philipp the Younger, was opposed to the division. He supported the interests of his daughter Margaret, the widow of Reinhard III and the mother of Philipp the Younger. He sought to position his grandson as the sole heir of the whole county. The elderly Countess Dowager, Katharina of Nassau-Beilstein, was indifferent as to whether the line was continued via her grandson, Philipp the Younger, or via her second, son Philipp the Elder. She held that the danger of the House of Hanau dying out could be reduced by allowing Philipp the Elder to marry, since he had already proven his ability to procreate.Philipp the Elder had at least one illegitimate son, Johann of Hanau-Lichtenberg. The supporters of Philipp the Elder organized a letter-writing campaign. Relatives of the Count and the most important organizations among their subjects -- in particular the four cities in the county, Hanau, Windecken, Babenhausen and Steinau, and the associations of the Burgmannen of Babenhausen Castle and the Palatinate of Gelnhausen -- as well as the vassals of the Counts of Hanau, all wrote to Otto I and requested that Philipp the Elder be allowed to marry. These letters are archived in the Hessian State Archive at Marburg.  Partition treaty of 1458  When his daughter Margaret died in 1457, Count Palatine Otto I no longer had a reason to oppose the division. This tipped the balance in favour of dividing the country. A treaty to that effect was sealed in January 1458. Philipp the Elder received the part of the county south of the river Main, that is, the district of Babenhausen and the Hanau share of Umstadt. So, the downside of a partition was mitigated by giving Philipp the Elder much less than half the county. Even so, Philipp the Elder was happy that he was finally allowed to marry, and did so later that year. In both parts, the primogeniture statute would continue to apply. In retrospect, the decision turned out well, even if Philipp the Younger did not die childless, as had been feared. Philipp the Elder and his descendants managed to extend their county considerably through their marriages. When the last male-line descendant of Philipp the Younger died in 1642, the country was re-united under Friedrich Casimir, a descendant of Philipp the Elder.  Naming the parts  To distinguish between the two parts of the county, the part ruled by Philipp the Elder was called Hanau- Lichtenberg after he inherited Lichtenberg in 1480.Strictly speaking, one should call his territory Hanau-Babenhausen before 1480, but this is rarely done. The other part was officially named Hanau-M√ºnzenberg in 1496. In the literature, the names Hanau-Lichtenberg and Hanau-M√ºnzenberg are used to distinguish the parts before these dates, even though, strictly speaking, that is an anachronism. One should say Hanau-Babenhausen when referring to Philipp's the Elder's possessions before 1480.  Journeys to Jerusalem  Count Philipp I the Younger of Hanau, depicted on a choir stall in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau In 1484, Philipp went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On 10 June 1484, he sailed from Venice and he landed in Jaffa on 18 July 1484. From there, he went to Jerusalem, which he left again on 10 August 1484. He travelled to Cyprus and arrived back in Venice on 30 November, and at the end of January, he was back in Hanau. He wrote an account of the journey, which, however, largely consists of an exhaustive list of holy sites he visited and the indulgences he acquired. A second trip to the Holy Land took place in 1491, when he accompanied Wilhelm I, Landgrave of Hesse.  Reign   Territorial policy  During the reign of Philipp the Younger, Hanau- M√ºnzenberg made significant territorial gains: In 1470, Praunheim was acquired, in 1476 a share in the district of Ortenberg, in 1473 or 1484 Fechenheim and in 1487 Homburg. A compromise was reached with the City of Frankfurt, temporarily in 1453 and definitively in 1481, about a division of the district of Bornheimerberg, which almost completely surrounded the city in the north. A treaty with the Count of Isenburg settled the dispute about Dreieich. Philipp was often involved in feuds, which he sought to settle amicably if at all possible. In this respect, the imperial Ewiger Landfriede of 1495 brought him great relief. Imperial politics Philipp loved to travel. He often visited the Palatine courts at Heidelberg and Mosbach and the city of Mainz. He visited Brabant in 1469 and the Diet of Regensburg in 1471.Sch√§tze des Staatsarchivs Marburg: Certificate from Emperor Frederick III for Count Philip the Younger of Hanau confirming privileges regarding the cities of Windecken, Hanau and Babenhausen. Regensburg, 29 July 1471 In 1474, he accompanied Emperor Frederick III to Frankfurt and Linz. In 1474 and 1475, he participated with a contingent of troops on the side of Emperor Frederick III in the relief of the city of Neuss, which was being besieged by Charles the Bold. In 1480, he visited the Emperor at Nuremberg and in 1491 he visited the Duke of Lorraine. In 1494, he accompanied the King of the Romans and later Emperor Maximilian I to Mainz, Speyer and Worms.  Churches and cultural policies  The altar piece in W√∂rth am Main Philipp the Younger was deeply connected to the late medieval piety. He donated generously to religious institutions; he made two pilgrimages to the Holy Land and he collected relics. Philipp was deeply moved by these pilgrimages. He purchased the entire collection of relics from the monastery at Seligenstadt when it was in financial distress, including the head of St. Lawrence. The archbishop of Mainz, however, objected to this transaction and Philipp had to return the relics to the monastery. As compensation, he received the villages of Nauheim, Eschersheim and Ginnheim from the monastery. He made several additions and expansions to the St. Mary's church in Hanau: * From 1485, a Gothic choir was constructed * The chapel dedicated to St. Lawrence (now the vestry) was decorated with frescoes depicting the martyrdom of St. Lawrence and other saints. * Some pieces of art have been preserved. The most prominent of these is a triptych now held in the St. Nikolaus church in W√∂rth am Main. Philipp is known to have commissioned other altar pieces, which have not been preserved. Philipp also commissioned the woodcarving on the choir stalls and the stained glass windows in the choir. Phillip first wife Adriana Von Nassau The Gotha lovers, probably Count Philipp the Younger and Margaret Wei√ükirchner Philipp also commissioned the Gotha Lovers. This painting probably depicts him and his mistress, Margaret Wei√ükirchner. These works of art are of an excellent quality and are nearly the only works of art that have survived from medieval Hanau. Erasmus Hasefus, Philipp's trumpeter, founded in 1468 a chapel in the Bulau Forest, dedicated to St. Wolfgang. A small Servite monastery developed around this chapel.  Marriage and issue   Marriage  As early as 1460, Philipp the Younger was engaged with a daughter of Count Ludwig II of Isenburg-B√ºdingen. She was either Anna of Isenburg or her sister Elisabeth. This engagement was later dissolved, against a compensation payment of 2690 guilders. Philipp the Younger than married on 12 September 1468 with Countess Adriana of Nassau-Dillenburg (7 February 1449 - 15 January 1477), the daughter of Count Johann IV of Nassau-Dillenburg. They had six children: # A daughter, born on 4 April 1469, died shortly after birth. # Adriana (1470‚Äì1524), married in 1490 with Count Philipp of Solms-Lich (1468‚Äì1544). # Margaret (1471‚Äì1503), a nun at Liebenau monastery. # Reinhard IV (1473‚Äì1512), Count of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg. # Anna (15 March 1474 - 21 March 1475). # Maria (4 March 1475 - 18 May 1476).  Mistress  After the death of his wife Philipp the Younger lived together with Margarete Wei√ükirchner. He could not marry her, because she was a commoner. Cohabiting was apparently accepted universally. He appeared with her in public. The most representative testimony is probably the first large-scale double portrait in art history, the so-called Gotha Lovers. Their relationship is exceptionally well documented. The couple had the following children: # Elsa of Hanau, married around 1508 with Heinrich Rabe. # Johann of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, a priest in Ober-Roden. # Anne of Hanau, married in 1517 with Dietz Reuter, a publican at Ortenberg. These children were not entitled to inherit the county, because they did not belong to the high nobility. Nevertheless, Philipp and Margareta mentioned them in their will and their step-brother, arranged favorable marriages for his step-sisters and a well donated church-position for his step-brother. Philipp the Younger also appears to have had a pre-marital affair with a Gutte from Reifenberg, who was the maidservant of the priest of Hochstadt and Reinhard IV.  Death  Philipp the younger died on 26 August 1500 and was buried in the Church of St. Mary in Hanau; 214 clergyman were present at his funeral.  Assessment  History has not always dealt very carefully with Philipp. The Protestant scholars of the 18th Century objected to his late medieval piety, fixated on indulgences, relics and good works. The civil-military historians of the 19th Century disliked his thoughtful approach to balancing the many feuds in which he was involved, and the bourgeois morality of the 19th Century objected to his relationship with Margarete Wei√ükirchner. The modern view is that his reign should be considered as a positive one for his county and his subjects. The St. Mary's Church, the \\"Gotha Lovers\\" and the \\"W√∂rth altar piece\\" are the most outstanding testimonies of the cultural achievements under his government, and have remained remarkable works of art. He is now considered to be among the more important members of the House of Hanau, on a par with Ulrich III, Reinhard II and Philipp Ludwig II.

Biography Poghosyan was the Deputy Secretary of the CPSU committee for the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast up until 1988. Secretary Boris Kevorkov was very loyal to Azerbaijani leaders in Baku, and was resented by the Armenian community. During the Karabakh movement, 87 Armenian deputies from the Regional Soviet called an emergency session of the assembly on 20 February 1988 in response to Armenian demonstrations in Stepanakert calling for the unification of Karabakh and Armenia. Kevorkov had tried and failed to stop the session's taking place, and when 110 Armenian deputies voted unanimously for the resolution, calling for Nagorny Karabakh to join Soviet Armenia, tried to swipe the stamp needed to confirm the resolution. Kevorkov was removed from office by Moscow emissaries and succeed by Poghosyan on 24 February 1988. Poghosyan was much more popular among Karabakh Armenians. A few months later he began to support the campaign for unification with Armenia. Poghosyan held his position as secretary until the autonomous oblast was abolished on 26 November 1991, at which time the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic had been declared two months prior and the Nagorno-Karabakh War had turned full- scale.

In particular, Al-Himsi translated Aristotle's Sophistical Refutations and Physics into Arabic.

Translations  The Arabic version of Plotinus' Theology of Aristotle was produced by Al-Himsi.

The exposition of Porphyry of Syria, translated into Arabic by Ibn Na‚Äòima al-Himsi, and corrected for Ahmad ibn al-Mu‚Äòtasim by al-Kindi. : Role of Syrian Christians in Arabic Philosophical Texts Little else is known of Al-Himsi; however, his place as a Christian translator of Greek philosophy into Arabic reveals that Christians were at the forefront of rendering Greek philosophy into Arabic. Al-Himsi, like the Syrian Christian Hunayn ibn Ishaq, were among the most able Arabic translators of their day. The reason for this is that Syrian Christians were conversant in Greek, Syrian, and Arabic and therefore were more qualified for preparing Greek and Syrian texts into Arabic editions. Notably, Syriac Christians preserved this great philosophical texts in Arabic, which were then later rendered into Latin for European Christians beginning in the twelfth century.

The homes built by the Doukhobor people are based on the same design brought with them to Canada in 1899. The structure is a two-story structure. The kitchen and dining room are on the main floor, with small bedrooms on the second floor. The Doukhobors grew most of their own food for a vegetarian diet. The village was self-sufficient, and everything was made by hand. Economic times forced the closure and sale of the villages and their associated lands. Proprietors Peter Gritchen, purchased the property in 1971 and opened it as the Mountain View Doukhobor Museum on June 16, 1972. Early Doukhobor artifacts are found there. Gritchen died in 2000.

It is an example of irrotational strain in which body is elongated in one direction while being shortened perpendicularly. For soft materials, such as rubber, a strain state of pure shear is often used for characterizing hyperelastic and fracture mechanical behaviour. Pure shear is differentiated from simple shear in that pure shear involves no rigid body rotation. The deformation gradient for pure shear is given by: F = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1&\\\\gamma&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\gamma&1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&1\\\\end{bmatrix} Note that this gives a Green-Lagrange strain of: E = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\gamma^2&2\\\\gamma&0\\\\\\\\\\\\2\\\\gamma&\\\\gamma^2&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&0\\\\end{bmatrix} Here there is no rotation occurring, which can be seen from the equal off- diagonal components of the strain tensor.

Guy Crittington McKay was born in 1904 to Clifford McKay and Clara Angeline Young who was the granddaughter of Brigham Young. Clifford McKay later changes the family name to McCoy. Later on Guy changes name to Maccoy.http://www.guymaccoy.com Biography In 1924 Upon leaving high school Guy attends day and night courses at the Kansas City Art Institute. During this time Guy meets Geno Pettit whom later becomes his wife. Guy is taught by and meets fellow artists Thomas Hart Benton, Randall Davey, Monty Lewis, Vaclav Vytlacil, Alexander Kostellow, Anthony Angarola, Ernest Lawson, Boardman Robinson to name a few. Many become lifelong friends and colleagues. During the summers Guy travels to Colorado Springs to attend the Broadmoor Art Academy. In 1929 Guy wins a Tiffany Art Foundation scholarship in New York and both he and Geno and recent Guggenheim Fellowship winner Anthony Angarola head to \\"The City\\". In 1930 Guy wins Art Students League scholarship and begins work within the league. Studies alongside Jackson Pollock, Rico Lebrun, Boardman Robinson, Thomas Hart Benton, Jan Matulka, Vaclav Vytlacil, and Arthur Young. During summer months Guy travels back to Colorado Springs to teach at Broadmoor with Monty Lewis. Many artist are asking if only there was a means to reproduce their original works faithfully to offer additional revenue options from painting singular originals. In 1933 Guy leaves the Art Student League to begin work within the Work Project Administration (WPA) under Dr. Herbert H. Spenden and directed by Ben Knotts. Guy is credited with murals in Central American Arts and Girls Industrial High School (see photo). The following year Mayor La Guardia institutes a large poster project which Guy is deeply involved. Guy has been developing ideas for a printing process utilizing a silk screen and experimenting with various components and mediums to produce the desired results. In 1938 Guy has the first one-man show of the newly named process he is credited for developing \\"Serigraphs\\" at the Contemporary Art Gallery. On exhibit are \\"Woman Holding Cat\\" and \\"Still Life\\". In 1940 Guy graduates from Columbia University with his Bachelor of Arts in teaching. Guy and Geno move to Vermont where Guy has taken work with the Poligraphic Lithographic Company as a color separator and dot-etcher on the zinc lithographic plates. During this time Guy continues to refine the serigraphic process. In 1941 Guy is involved with \\"The Workshop\\" which becomes the National Serigraph Society. Guy and Geno are directly involved up to 1947. In 1945 Guy and Geno leave Vermont for Los Angeles, California. Other Artists and Serigraphers follow the Maccoy's to California. In 1947 Guy continues his industrial work with Bolter Lithography, During this time Herb Jepson asks Guy to teach at his newly formed Jepson Art Institute in Los Angeles. Guy is teaching alongside Geno Pettit, Rico Lebrun, William Moore, Francis de Erdely, Bill Brice and Howard Warshaw. In 1948 Guy forms the Western Serigraph Society and becomes its first President. In 1949 Otis Art Institute of Los Angeles's director Millard Sheets convinces Guy to come to Otis and teach. Guy remains for the next eleven years and retires at age sixty five. During the next year Guy teaches Art at several other locations such as UCLA as well as the Palos Verdes Art Center in the Rancho Palos Verdes area of Los Angeles. Many students from Jepson, Otis and UCLA follow Guy, one of these students is Yvonne Linnemeyer. In 1965 Guy is asked to join and assist the newly formed Los Angeles Print Society (L.A.P.S.) In 1969 Guy begins private Art instruction and classes out of his Chatsworth badlands home and other area locations. In 1970 Guy and Geno are notified that their fire insurance has been cancelled due to being in a high fire location. Two weeks later a devastating fire sweeps up from the Santa Suzanna mountains and destroys their home and studio along with all their earthly possessions and a life's worth of Art and memorabilia. Shortly after this event a huge out pouring of support of all types comes from students, fellow artists and other associates. Guy establishes the first of two new Guy Maccoy Studios in the Canoga Park area near his new residence. Yvonne and her son Alan Linnemeyer work alongside Guy, Yvonne as additional color separator and screen stenciling, Alan as print technician. In 1972 Guy opens the second larger and greatly updated Guy Maccoy Studio, where he begins painting originals, producing his own serigraphs, conducts Art classes and seminars as well as begins taking on commissioned artworks from renowned artists looking for fine Art Limited Edition Serigraphs. Again Yvonne takes a key role in color separation and screen stenciling along with additional help from Dan Merrit and Ann Paes. Guy, Alan and Dan take on the key printing duties. Over this period the studio produces multiple commissioned works from renowned artists such as: Marco Sassone, Eyvind Earle, Ted Degrazia, Peter Hurd, Fredrick & Eileen Whitaker, Millard Sheets, Peter Ellenshaw, Jeffery Roy Lunge' just to name a few. Guy produced well over 100 original paintings and over eighty limited editions of his own works. Keeping in mind that all these serigraphs where hand stenciled on their screens using a method of color separation controlled one hundred percent by the mind's eye and knowledge of the Guy Maccoy process. Once the individual color run was completed on as few as 10 sheets of 100 percent rag paper to a practical sheet maximum of two hundred and fifty and never higher than three hundred with proofs included. After each print had been hand registered and printed it was hand hung up to dry, after all sheets in the edition had been run the screen was washed out, cleaned, dried and readied for the process to begin all over. The number of color runs to produce many of these fine work of art averaged in the fifty to eighty plus color runs with many prints having over one hundred color runs. This effect of color layering and intimate knowledge of color is what made Guy's work so beautiful, unique, collectable and valuable. In 1981 Guy Crittington Maccoy with advanced stages of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. A disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement succumbs while in the hospital after only eight months with friends at his side he and his gentle greatness finally pass. Geno Pettit Maccoy passes a year later. The Guy Maccoy Studio is continued under the direction of Yvonne Linnemeyer and over the next five years produces another fifteen commissioned works before the studio's location is moved to a smaller remote location to be closed a short time thereafter. Guy is largely credited as \\"the Father\\" of the Serigraph process and his original paintings, serigraphs, mono prints and sketches are widely collected and remain a lasting testament to this great American artist's genius.

It was first described by Peter William Glynn in 1999. It is found growing on coral reefs in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean but is nowhere abundant. Description Pocillopora inflata is a colonial, zooxanthellate, arborescent coral. It varies in shape, sometimes forming knobbly mounds which can grow to across, and sometimes having a more open structure with short branches several centimetres in diameter. The colour ranges from yellowish brown to shades of green.Pocillopora inflata The Coral Library. Retrieved 2011-12-24. It can be distinguished from other members of the genus by the fact that it has swollen ends to the branches, a small number of pointed verrucae (or none at all) and prominent columellae on the lower part of the colony. The corallites are small and densely crowded and some of the septa, which are indistinct, are fused with the columella. The polyps have 12 tentacles.Family Pocilloporidae: Pocillopora Classification of Scleractinian (Stony) Corals. Retrieved 2011-12-24. Distribution and habitat Pocillopora inflata occurs in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean from the coast of Mexico to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. It favours rocky shores and grows at depths of less than . Ecology This species often grows among other Pocilloporid corals. Corals in the genus have relatively fast growth rates, with Pocillopora inflata growing at the rate of a year. Most Pocilloporids brood their planula larvae, and this may also be true of Pocillopora inflata, but it has on one occasion been observed to broadcast eggs and sperm into the sea in a synchronised spawning event. It has a number of predators. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and filefishes which feed on the branch tips and hermit crabs which scrape the skeletal tissue. Other predators feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact. These include such fish as the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrate predators include the crown-of-thorns starfish, the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis, and the gastropods, Jenneria pustulata and Quoyula sp. Pocillopora inflata has several mutualistic symbionts including the crab, Trapezia sp., and certain snapping shrimps which protect it from attack by its major predator, the crown-of-thorns starfish. Threats Pocillopora inflata is an uncommon coral throughout its range and is more susceptible than many other species to bleaching and to predation by the crown-of-thorns starfish which is becoming more abundant in some areas. In common with other corals, it is threatened by rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, ENSO events, severe storms, coral diseases, pollution and coral harvesting.

Congo-Balolo Mission's landing on the Congo River (c. 1910). Congolese women and female missionary (c. 1910). The Congo-Balolo Mission (CBM) was a British Baptist missionary society that was active in the Belgian Congo, the present day Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 1889 to 1915. It was the predecessor of the Regions Beyond Missionary Union (RBMU), established in 1900, which today is called World Team. Formation The leading figure in establishing the mission was Henry (\\"Harry\\") Grattan Guinness II, born in Toronto on 2 October 1861, son of the charismatic preacher Henry Grattan Guinness. Harry Guinness studied at the London Hospital from 1880 to 1885, then spent two years as a minister in Australia and Tasmania. In June 1887 Harry Guinness became leader of the East London Training Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, which his parents had established. In 1888 there was a World Missionary Convention at Exeter Hall in London. Harry was able to talk with Dr. Murdock, the leader of the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU), who had taken responsibility to the Livingstone Inland Mission (LIM) four years earlier. Harry had become enthusiastic about the plans of John McKittrick, a former LIM missionary now working for the ABMU, who wanted to extent the field of missionary activity further upstream into the tributaries of the Congo south and west of the great bend of that river. Dr. Murdoch supported the plan, agreeing to release McKittrick and also to loan the former LIM steamer Henry Reed for a year. The new mission was called the Congo Balolo Mission, with plans to operate on six southern tributaries of the Congo: the Lulonga, Maringa, Lopori, Ikelemba, Juapa and Bosira. During the years that followed many of the missionaries died, to be replaced by fresh volunteers. Only six of the first thirty five CBM missionaries were alive by 1900. Early Congo activities The first party of volunteers left England in April 1889 and reached Matadi in August 1889, from where they trekked upstream to Stanley Pool. The society was given enough money to buy a sidepaddle steamer named the Pioneer, which was shipped to the Congo, arriving in December 1889. The boat was then carried in sections to Stanley Pool where it was rebuilt and launched. By March 1891, first using the Henry Reed and then the Pioneer, the CBM missionaries had established stations.at Bonginda, Lulonga, Ikau and Bongandanga. During the years that followed many of the missionaries died of accidents or diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness, to be replaced by fresh volunteers. Only six of the first thirty five CBM missionaries were alive by 1900. According to Fanny Guinness, \\"The basis of the Congo Balolo Nission is interdenominational, simply Christian and thoroughly evangelical. Members of any of the evangelical churches are welcomed as workers in it\\". However, the mission found some of the neighboring missions easier to work with than others. The CBM signed a comity agreement with the Mission Evangelique de l'Ubangi, but had difficulty reaching an agreement with the Disciples of Christ Congo Mission (DCCM), which had a rather different philosophy. An internal letter complained of the DCCM that \\"They have come into CBM villages, in some cases placing teachers and in other cases baptizing large numbers of natives without any reference to us\\". The missionaries arrived at a time of great stress. The Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company of King Leopold II of Belgium was using brutal techniques to coerce the local population into producing rubber, slavery continued and new epidemic diseases were causing considerable loss of life. This disruption and apparent failure of the old systems may have made the people more receptive to the new message brought by the missionaries. The missionaries taught local people to spread the word, and these evangelists communicated their understanding of the bible in their own words. Many of the missionaries were from working-class backgrounds, and took pride in teaching their African students practical skills such as printing or carpentry. With these skills the CBM graduates were much in demand by the government. They were also at risk, in the eyes of the missionaries, from corruption by the loose standards of the larger towns where they went to work. The missionaries generally had a rigid view of right and wrong, condemning practices such as polygamy, immodest dress and lascivious dancing. On the other hand, they sometimes mocked Africans who attempted to imitate European ways too closely. Despite these handicaps, the missionaries succeeded in communicating the essence of their faith, which the local people adopted, adapted and assimilated. Expansion into RBMU In 1899 the CBM sent its first missionaries to India, and in 1900 changed its name to the Regions Beyond Missionary Union (RBMU). The RBMU was to expand into many other parts of the world. By 1916 the RBMU had forty-one missionaries in the Congo, in nine stations scattered over an area the size of England. In 1932 the RBMU founded the Baringa Hospital, and in 1945 opened a second hospital at Yoseki. By 1955 there were 32,000 church members, and 9,000 children in the mission's schools in the Congo.

He made many enemies during his term in office, and was rumoured to be fraternising with the Spanish Crown, which led to his imprisonment and, later, his execution. Biography Early life He was supposedly born in around 1578, in Vila Vi√ßosa. At some point in his life, he married D. Francisca de Castro, and was made Knight of the Order of Christ. In 1614, during the Iberian Union, he succeeded his uncle Fernando de Matos, as King Philip II of Portugal's Secretary of the Crown Council. He lived in Madrid, in Spain, in this capacity for 17 years. As Secretary of State Francisco de Lucena had familial ties to the House of Braganza via his father, Afonso de Lucena (1548‚Äì1607), a jurist. When John was acclaimed King of Portugal, Francisco de Lucena was made his Secretary of State (Secret√°rio de Estado), holding the post from 1640 to 1642. A practiced diplomat, de Lucena was in a very powerful and deliberative station. He advised King John to keep all titles and privileges given during the Filipino rule, as to avoid rebellions and acts of treachery against him. On the other hand, by his suggestion, King John's supporters were seldom honoured for their actions during the Restoration War. When the Archbishop of Braga, the Duke of Coimbra and the Marquess of Vila Real were charged with treason against the new monarch, Francisco de Lucena spared his indulgence and condemned them all to death by beheading, even providing the cleaver that had cut off D. Rodrigo Calder√≥n's head in his execution in Madrid. Imprisonment and death De Lucena made many enemies whilst in office, among them the Jesuit and generals. De Lucena was rumoured to keep subversive correspondence with Spain, and was charged with treason in 1642 by the Court. King John, however, knew the correspondence was not unlawful, as it were negotiations for the release of de Lucena's son from a Spanish prison in return for the release of a Spanish prisoner in Portugal. The King was against his sentence to death, and Francisco de Lucena was, instead, imprisoned in the Limoeiro prison, in Lisbon. Easily (and falsely) incriminated by the Jesuit and his successor in the post of Secretary of State (Pedro Vieira da Silva) of having surrendered the Santa Luzia Fort, in Elvas, to the Spaniards, he was finally sentenced to beheading (with the same cleaver used in the Archbishop of Braga, the Duke of Coimbra and the Marquess of Vila Real case) on 28 April 1643.

Biography Cribbet was born in Findlay, Illinois, just outside Decatur. His mother raised him after his father died from the Spanish flu. Cribbet received his undergraduate degree from Illinois Wesleyan University. There, he met his wife Betty Smith. After graduation, Cribbet joined the Army for World War II. He served as an aide-de-camp for Lt. Gen. Troy H. Middleton on the European front. His service produced a number of medals and stories, which he would later relate in his popular law lectures. Cribbet then decided to attend the University of Illinois College of Law where he received his J.D. degree in 1947. He spent a few months in law practice in Bloomington, Illinois, at the law firm of Costigan, Wollrab, and Yoder before he was invited back to the University of Illinois to teach law. As a professor, he held visiting positions at the University of Michigan Law School and the University of Texas School of Law. In 1967 he was appointed as dean of the law school, a position he held until 1979 when he was asked to serve as chancellor of the campus. Cribbet was survived by his wife Betty; his two daughters, Pamela Steward and Carol Cribbet-Bell; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. Chancellorship  Cribbet was named acting chancellor on July 1, 1979, after William P. Gerberding left the position for the presidency of the University of Washington. The University of Illinois Board of Trustees formally named Cribbet as chancellor in December of that year. At the time of Cribbet's appointment University President Stanley O. Ikenberry had positive words for the new Chancellor. He stated Chancellor Cribbet \\"[would] bring to the position of chancellor extensive experience as an academic leader, what [he had] found to be an extraordinary soundness of judgment, and an absolutely superb reputation in his profession.\\" For his part, the new chancellor told the press that he would strive to \\"strengthen the voice\\" of students and faculty in campus governance. Termination of Gary Moeller  While still in his capacity as acting chancellor, Cribbet was involved in the decision to terminate Illinois Football head coach Gary Moeller after the coach posted a disappointing 6-24-3 record in three seasons. The Illinois athletic director, Neale Stoner, made the recommendation to terminate Moeller, a recommendation which was later approved by the university's board of trustees in an 8-1 vote. Prior to the vote, Moeller met with Chancellor Cribbet and President Ikenberry and pleaded for his job. A bitter Moeller called the decision \\"unfair to everyone in the program.\\" Moeller also chided the decision for not coinciding with the university's educational mission. Chancellor Cribbet and Stoner would later oversee the hiring of Mike White after a search that included future Illinois football coach John Mackovic as a candidate. David Wilson Eligibility Case During his chancellorship, Cribbet reluctantly oversaw another athletics dispute that would threaten Illinois' membership in the Big Ten Conference. The dispute involved the eligibility of quarterback David Wilson. The Big Ten had charged Illinois with misrepresentation, deception, lack of cooperation, and failing to comply with conference rules. It sanctioned the Illinois athletics program with a ban in postseason competition in all sports and the loss of conference revenues. Illinois football coach Mike White and Athletic Director Neale Stoner reportedly threatened to resign if the university did not defend itself against the charges. The university vigorously responded with a 34-page rebuttal denying any wrongdoing. Chancellor Cribbet attributed some of the problems to the university's large bureaucracy; operational staff made innocent, unintentional errors in petitions and materials that were not known to university officials. He would lament: \\"I had high hopes of being able to make some contribution to the solution to the many troubling problems [in intercollegiate athletics] surfacing in the mass media. Now I fear I shall be known, in athletic circles, only as the chancellor who was involved in the Wilson case, a fact which truly saddens me.\\" Selected works * Property: Cases and Materials (with Corwin W.

Early life Edmund Sturge was born at Olveston, near Bristol, the youngest of the twelve children of Joseph Sturge (1752‚Äì1817) and his wife, Mary (born Marshall). His older brother, Joseph Sturge (1793‚Äì1859), was active in the anti-slavery movement as was his cousin, Thomas Sturge. Edmund was schooled at James Moxham's (Thornbury) and R. Weston's (Rochester). Both his parents having died by the time he was aged 11, and most holidays were spent with his brother Joseph at Netherton (Bewdley) where he was occupied in the office and warehouse of the corn factors business of Joseph & Charles Sturge. On leaving school he went to live at brother Joseph's new home in Birmingham, where his brother John also resided, and Edmund kept the books of John's Chemical Works until coming of age and entering partnership as J & E Sturge.From the manuscript family history by Charles Dickenson Sturge [Library of the Society of Friends, London] Sturge became active in the anti-slavery movement and other liberal causes: for peace, penal reform, the suppression of the opium trade and in the Aborigines' Protection Society.Dictionary of Quaker Biography: article on Edmund Sturge (described in \\"Sources\\" above) Anti-Slavery From 1837, on Joseph Sturge's return from a tour of the West Indies, Edmund helped to widely distribute Joseph's reportThe West Indies in 1837 : being the journal of a visit to Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbadoes, and Jamaica; undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining the actual condition of the negro population of those islands, by Joseph Sturge and Thomas Harvey.

He served as the Society's Secretary from 1870 and as its chairman from 1882 to 1891 and then as its vice-president until his death. After he retired from business in 1876, he regularly lobbied Parliament on the Society's business (see below: William Tallack's reminiscence).

Lydia was already active in liberal causes, such as the replacement of war with arbitration and the relief of poverty. She was already in the Ladies' Negro's Friendly Society and was later its Secretary. It is clear that throughout their marriage her support in their projects was substantial. Chemical manufacturing business Another of Edmund Sturge's brothers was John Sturge, (1799‚Äì1840). In 1814, he was apprenticed at John Bell, a highly successful Quaker pharmacist and manufacturing chemist, with a shop and laboratory on Oxford Street in London. John Sturge started his own business, at Severnside, manufacturing verdigris and Solution of Tin for the use of dyers. Around 1823, he moved to Edgbaston, Birmingham and bought land between the canal and Wheeleys Road. His brother Edmund joined him in the business, after completing his schooling. The firm traded under the name J. and E. Sturge & Co. In 1831 John leased land across the road on which the John and E. Sturge works were later built and the manufacture of industrial chemicals. Citrates, tartrates, bicarbonate of potash and precipitated chalk were among its products.Source: Grace's guide to British Industrial History: article on John Sturge.

On the death of John Sturge in 1840, Arthur Albright, brother to Edmund's wife and a trained chemist, joined the partnership.Obituary of Arthur Albright in Birmingham Daily Post, Wednesday, 4 July 1900; Issue 13123. Arthur Albright was responsible for developing practical mass-production of white phosphorus and later the safer allotrope, \\"red\\" or \\"amorphous\\" phosphorus, used in the manufacture of matches. He later separated this part of the business, which became Albright and Wilson. The Montserrat connection The factory extracted citric acid from citrus juice, using lemons from Sicily, subject to sharp variations in supply. Their brother, Joseph had supported the production of limes on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This eventually led to the family becoming the largest landholder on Montserrat, successfully running estates with fairly paid labour for many years.The Montserrat Connection: Family history by Joseph Edward Sturge (2004), available online. In 1867, Edmund and Lydia Sturge travelled to Montserrat and spent a year developing the growing of limes. This enterprise later became the Montserrat Lime Juice company, of which Edmund Sturge was a director until his death. Their son John Edmund and daughter Edith were also involved in the running of the Montserrat estates. Marriage and family In 1841, Edmund Sturge and Lydia Albright were married.

The existing mosque was erected next to the old minaret in 1768. The local Tatar nobles had a second storey added in 1835. A little closer to the Oka River is another local landmark, Shahghali's Mausoleum from the mid-16th century. The Khan's Mosque has been designated a public museum since the 1930s. The minimalist design of the minaret, with its unadorned walls, reminds of that of the famous Guangta Minaret of Huaisheng Mosque in Guangzhou, in South China.

Self-portrait by Hanns Georgi, 1984, drypoint, 12 x 16 cm  Early life  Hanns Georgi was the youngest of five children of August Friedrich Wilhelm and Anna Georgi Georgi, Scharschmidt born in Dresden. In 1907 he attended the town school where he illustrated his early essays with pictures. His artistic talent was already recognized and encouraged by his teachers. Later he attended the Fletscherschen Teacher Seminar (teacher-training seminary), in Dresden-Neustadt, between 1915 and 1922. During his training he met his mentor, the painter Osmar Schindler, who had him working in his studio, recommending that Georgi study art. In 1921, while a teacher and artist, Georgi met his future wife, Elfriede Angels. He married her in 1929. He later had three children with her: Dieter (1932), Henry (1938) and Ulrich (1942).  Professional career  By 1923, Georgi had his first major exhibition in Sebnitz, where he showed paintings, watercolors, drawings and etchings. In 1926, Georgi took part in the International Art Exhibition in Dresden, and a year later was a member of the German Association of Artists, where he remained until its dissolution in 1934 (coinciding with the redefining of German culture and art during the Third Reich). From 1926 to 1931, while exhibiting, Georgi continued to further his studies as a teacher at the University of Leipzig in history, philosophy and pedagogy. In 1931 he graduated as Dr. Phil. at the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Leipzig.http://saebi.isgv.de/biografie/Curt_Johannes_Georgi_(1901-1989) From March 1931 until spring 1933, Georgi became a research assistant at the Pedagogical Institute of the Dresden University of Technology. From 1933 to 1939 he worked as a teacher in the town school in Sebnitz. In April 1933, Georgi joined the Nazi Party. In the following years, Georgi continued to take frequent trips to Sassnitz, Stettin and the Bohemian Highlands. However, by 1936 (under the Third Reich) he failed to obtain a teaching post. In August 1938 he joined the war effort as a reserve artilleryman in Frankenberg. On 25 August 1939 Georgi was drafted for part of the German invasion of Poland, then later for the French campaign. From September 1940 he was again working as a teacher in Sebnitz. From 1941 to 1945 Georgi built a teacher training college in Bischofswerda. In 1945, during the last weeks of the war, he was serviced for Volkssturm. From 1945, after his dismissal from the teaching profession, Georgi worked as a freelance painter and graphic artist. 1947-1949 Georgi was in the jury of the city of Zwickau when the Max Pechstein Prize was launched. In July 1948 the gallery in Henning Hall showed the first comprehensive exhibition of Georgi's oil paintings, watercolors and drawings. In the fifties, sixties and seventies Georgi reached the peak of his work as an illustrator.  Later life  From 1948 to 1963 he worked in the community college in Sebnitz holding lectures on art history and literature. In 1952 Georgi became a member of the Association of Artists of the GDR. His wife Elfriede died 1961. He retired not long after but traveled a lot, purchasing many paintings from his travels. He often stayed with his three sons. By 1988 his health deteriorated.

Like his father, he had been trained to be a millwright, and in 1844 became a member of the guild of master millwrights in Europe. He also had trade skills as a cabinet maker and stonemason. In 1848, Guenther traveled to the United States.Shelton, Robert. \\"Carl Hilmar Guenther.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified February 25, 2016. Guenther declared his intention to become a United States citizen on June 28, 1851. Citizenship was granted to him on October 8, 1854. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1856. On October 7, 1855, Guenther married Dorothea Pape. The couple had seven children. Guenther died on October 18, 1902, in San Antonio and was buried beside his wife in San Antonio City Cemetery No. 1. Emigration to Texas Guenther's first visit to the United States was in 1848 through the port of New York with a sojourn in Wisconsin before returning to Germany. Three years later, Guenther returned through Indianola, Texas, at the time a major entry port for German immigrants. Gillespie County He relocated southwest of Fredericksburg at Live Oak Creek, near the present site of Lady Bird Johnson Municipal Park, and began constructing his dream of a gristmill. His steam-operated mill was built with imported French millstones. Inclement weather conditions came close to washing away the unfinished mill in a flood. Nevertheless, Guenther persevered and completed what would become known as Pioneer Flour Mills, a wheat and corn operation that served the area residents of Gillespie County. San Antonio Recurring periods of alternating floods and drought prompted Guenther in 1859 to reassess his situation. After seeing the need for mills to serve San Antonio's growing population, Guenther made the decision to move his base of operations there The site for his new mill would be on land directly adjacent to what became known as the King William Historic District. King William District home Guenther's home was one of the first built in the King William neighborhood. He began construction of his vernacular native limestone home in the district at King William and Guenther streets. The stones were quarried in the area that now is Brackenridge Park, and wood used in the construction was East Texas pine. The original entrance to the house faced southward towards the mill. A 1915 expansion of the house, changed the entrance to the north side, fronting the San Antonio River. The original entrance now serves as a hallway between the museum and the River Mill Store part of the house. The top floor of the house is known as the Roof Garden and once hosted dances. The space is currently used for large meetings or luncheons. The south side of the house now has a patio and arbor for outdoor dining. An area of the house that once served as the library, is now the museum containing family keepsakes, as well as artifacts of milling, dining and baking history in San Antonio. Travel souvenirs from around the world are also part of the museum. The museum, store and restaurant are open to the public 7 days a week.

It has greater efficacy at the 5-HT1A receptors than other antipsychotics, such as clozapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone. This greater efficacy may lead to enhanced antipsychotic properties, as antipsychotics that lack 5-HT1A affinity are associated with increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, and lack of activity against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. As expression of immediate-early gene (IEG) in certain brain regions may represent markers of anti-psychotic activity, expression of immediate-early gene mRNA in the prefrontal cortex and striatum was measured. Treatment with F-15,063 resulted in induction of c-fos and fosB mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex. In the striatum, F-15,063 treatment resulted in induction of all IEGs studied (c-fos, fosB, zif268, c-jun, junB, nor1, nur77, arc). F-15,063 was tested in several animal models that predict antipsychotic activity to help determine the behavioral profile. Administration of F-15,063 blocked amphetamine and ketamine induced hyperlocomotion, but did not affect baseline, spontaneous locomotor activity. In addition, F-15,063 did not produce catalepsy, a side effect of other antipsychotics, such as haloperidol. This inhibition of catalepsy is 5-HT1A receptor mediated, as pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 reinstated catalepsy. The level of catalepsy did not increase with chronic dosing, and there was no evidence for serotonin syndrome at clinically relevant doses. Plasma levels of F-15,063 decreased seven-fold 4 hours after oral administration, and 25-fold after 8 hours. Despite this, there was still a high (65%) level of central D2 occupancy at 4 hours, and it retained its full antipsychotic potential at this time point. Even after 8 hours, F-15,063 still demonstrated some central D2 occupancy, and retained some antipsychotic activity.

History  Foundation and early years  Eastern Stars FC were founded in July 2007 following concern from Milne Bay residents that the lack of clubs in the area had led to many local players joining Port Moresby-based teams; the club's name is derived from \\"the star from the East\\", a symbol that features on the Milne Bay provincial flag.Milne Bay Province Flag (Papua New Guinea) CRWFlags.com. 25 August 1998. Retrieved 21 October 2012.  National Soccer League debut  Ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season, it was revealed that Eastern Stars would be one of three new teams joining the National Soccer League. The side started well, despite their opening match being called off due to heavy rain. They won their opening match against fellow newcomers Sepik FC 4‚Äì3 before a draw with University Inter and another 3‚Äì2 win over Nabasa United saw them undefeated in their opening three games. Further postponements, plus a draw and a loss in their remaining two 2008 fixtures, saw the side enter the new year in fourth place with eight points, with two postponed fixtures still to be played. However, Stars lost both their games in hand, to Morobe FC behind them and Hekari United ahead of them, and the side weren't able to capitalise on their advantage, eventually finishing fifth, just a single point from playoff qualification.Papua New Guinea National Soccer League: Season So Far Extra Time. 13 March 2012. Retrieved 20 April 2012.Papua New Guinea 2008 RSSSF. 6 November 2009. Retrieved 25 December 2011. The side again registered to take part in the 2009‚Äì10 season, bringing in Solomon Islanders Timothy Joe and Paul Wale to boost their squad strength. The season saw similar results for Stars: they again finished in fifth position, and this time only a poor goal difference denied them a place in the semi- finals. The club struggled in the first half of the season, having a six-game winless streak between November and January, but managed to win their last five games to soar up the table.Papua New Guinea 2009 RSSSF. 28 October 2010. Retrieved 25 December 2011. They were edged into fifth place by University Inter who had a superior goal difference.  Two Grand Finals  The club confirmed their participation in the 2010‚Äì11 season in July 2010, with chairman Joseph Ealedona insisting that the club were 'competitive' and would go 'one step further' in the coming season. The side did just that, going into the Christmas break having lost just one game ‚Äì against Hekari ‚Äì and even going top of the league for a short time in February, before eventually finishing second in the league table behind the defending champions. After a 3‚Äì1 victory over Tukoko University in the knockout semi-finals, they fell 4‚Äì0 to Hekari in the Grand Final after having a man sent off. In October 2011, ahead of the 2011‚Äì12 season, the club appointed Luis Jaime Gomez as its new head coach. Gomez played professional football for Chilean club Club Deportivo Universidad Cat√≥lica in the 1960s and 1970s. Stars made a great start to the 2011‚Äì12 season, winning their opening match on 16 October 2011 against Petro Souths FC 7‚Äì0 with two goals from Lab Embel. The club won three, drew four and lost two of the next nine games, lying in second place at the league's winter break in December. However, midway through the season Gomez left the club, and franchise owner Joseph Ealedona installed himself as team manager. Eastern Stars eventually finished as league runners‚Äìup to Hekari, and were beaten 5‚Äì0 by the same team in the league final on 17 April 2012 in front of a 5,000-strong crowd. Stars received K25,000 for their achievements.  Decline and NSL withdrawal  In December 2012, Stars' participation in the 2013 season was thrown into doubt when the NSL board reported that only three clubs had met payment deadlines for the new season; Stars were not among them, and only an additional three places were available in the league despite six other clubs registering their interest. The club finally confirmed its inclusion in the league on 25 January 2013, just one week before the start of the season. Following a mass exodus of players at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 campaign, the club appointed former Papua New Guinea national team assistant manager Max Foster as its coach for the new season. Stars faced NC Oro in the league's opening fixture of 2013, and despite fielding an entirely new squad from 2012, Stars defeated their opponents 3‚Äì1, thanks to a Patrick Aisa brace and a Danny Banaba goal. However, Stars' plight was downhill from then on, and they eventually finished sixth out of the eight teams ‚Äì the lowest finish since the club's inception. Their final season to date came in 2014, with the side one of seven who had met the requirements for participation. While the side managed an opening day 1‚Äì1 draw with defending champions Hekari United on 8 February, the side had to wait until the end of March for a league victory, defeating Lae FC 2‚Äì1 on 22 March. This was to be their only victory all season, with the side finishing dead last with that single win and four draws. In July 2014, it was reported that the side had successfully bid to take part in the upcoming 2015 season. However, ahead of the season kick-off, the side were not one of the seven sides scheduled to compete.  Return to NSL  On 1 December 2017, it was reported that the side had once again shown interest in returning to the National Soccer League for the 2018 season. However, on 4 January 2018, franchise owner Joseph Ealedona revealed the side would not be participating, and instead preparing for a return in time for the 2019 season. On 2 January 2019, it was confirmed that the club would be returning to the 2019 National Soccer League. The club was drawn into the Southern Conference and endured a slow start to the season, reaching the halfway stage in 6th place out of eight teams, having won three out of seven games. However, the second half of their season saw improvement, with victories against playoff rivals Port Moresby United and Central United putting them in contention on the final day. A late victory against FC Bougainville, thanks to an own goal, saw them secure qualification for the knockout phase. In the playoffs, they defeated Chebu AROB 2‚Äì0, before a 4‚Äì1 aggregate defeat to Hekari United saw them enter the third-place match. Against Morobe United, they took a 2‚Äì1 lead, but eventually went down 3‚Äì2, finishing 4th for the season. The club were expected to take part in the 2019‚Äì20 National Soccer League, but they were not one of the final ten teams announced in December 2019.

Justice Somasekhara Commission  Justice Somasekhara was appointed head of a commission of inquiry instituted in 2008 by the Government of Karnataka to inquire into the 2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka. The commission, which was appointed in late 2008, submitted its report in January 2011. The commission did not find evidence of any involvement of the state government or the police in the attacks. Nor did it find evidence of a cover-up. Many prominent Christians, including sitting and former judges like M. F.

They had hoped that the commission of inquiry would produce proof endorsing their belief, but this did not happen. Somasekhara concluded in most cases that the district authorities and the police had taken the \\"appropriate steps regarding the Church and the persons including the required protection.\\" He concluded that the attacks were \\"carried out by misguided elements following circulation of literature which insulted Hindu Gods and reports of conversion activity by some Christian groups.\\" The report also exonerated the catholic church of misdemeanor, saying that \\"the Roman Catholic church and its leaders were not involved in conversion.\\" The Archbishop of Bangalore, Bernard Moras, \\"rejected\\" the Somasekhara report, saying that \\"it has failed to address the terms of reference of the Commission and has failed to do justice to the Christian community.\\" He demanded that the state government launch a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the attacks, also saying that \\"we will make a representation to the government putting forth our demand. We will make a representation to the chief minister, the governor, various organisations including the Human Rights and the Central government\\".

It would complement the existing 509 Harbourfront service which connects Union Station to Queens Quay west of Bay Street. Route Phase one of the line would start in the underground loop at Union Station, and proceed underground to Queens Quay. The line would then turn east and emerge from the tunnel 250 metres east of Yonge Street at Freeland Street. Both the eastbound and westbound tracks would be in a dedicated right of way along the south side of Queens Quay so as to reduce the need for rail vehicles to stop for road traffic, as there are fewer street intersections on the south side of Queens Quay than on its north side. The line would end in a temporary loop at Small Street, just west of Parliament Street. When multiple additional routes arriving at Union Station were under consideration, the city considered replacing the streetcar track in the tunnel between Union Station and Queen's Quay with a driverless people-mover system, and changing the streetcar routing so it only ran along Queen's Quay. On April 19, 2019, staff recommended routing the streetcar service to Union Station and expanding the platform section under Bay Street. The recommended expansion would add four platforms, with cross-over tracks, so a vehicle waiting at one platform would not block the platforms for other routes. Cost In 2015, the estimated cost to build the East Bayfront LRT from Union Station to Small Street was $520million. The breakdown is as follows: * Building a new eastbound passenger platform at Union Station: $112million * Extension of Bay Street tunnel to Freeland Street: $156million * Surface infrastructure: $66million * Rolling stock: $36million * Queens Quay revitalization: $150million By June 2019, the estimated cost of the line grew to $700million. Challenges The underground streetcar loop at Union Station does not have the capacity to accommodate the extra light rail vehicles needed to service the new line. Thus, a new eastbound platform must be added. A sewer at Queens Quay and Bay Street will make it difficult to build an eastern portal to bring the tracks to the surface. One of the issues which has delayed progress of constructing the line is the proposed redevelopment of the waterfront properties between Jarvis Street and Parliament Street, which lie south of Queens Quay. The plans called for two access streets, which would cross the proposed light rail line at signalized intersections. However, the developer has designed a third street into the plan, likely due to the expected traffic volumes from the development, which would require an additional signalized intersection with the light rail line. Some councillors have stated this would negatively affect service along the proposed route, possibly adding as much as an extra three minutes travel to a line that would only require ten minutes to traverse. Demand George Brown College's campus in the East Bayfront has opened and there are development plans for several apartment and condominium complexes on Queens Quay East and, in future years, in the West Don Lands. Thus, there will be roughly 20,000 residential units in the area, plus 8,000 jobs and 3,500 students. According to transit advocate Steve Munro, developers in the area, particularly for commercial properties, are concerned that without good transit, a better connection to the core area than the Sherbourne and Bay buses, developments are not marketable. A project called the Waterfront Transit Reset was set up to study possible streetcar system upgrades along the waterfront from Long Branch to Leslie Street. That study included the East Bayfront. A WTR report dated November 13, 2017, stated that: :While three bus routes currently serve the area, adding higher-quality, higher-capacity streetcar service is an urgent priority for the TTC, the City, and Waterfront Toronto. Projected peak demand in 2041 on this section is approximately 2400 people per hour, and serving this very high level of demand requires high-quality streetcar service in a dedicated right of way. In January 2019, the Waterfront BIA (a neighbourhood business group) estimates a $1.2billion loss of productivity and a $20billion loss of federal, provincial and local tax revenue if the opening of the East Bayfront LRT were delayed from 2025 to 2045. The BIA hopes that the line will open by 2025 which according to the BIA would stimulate commercial and residential development providing 135,000 new jobs and housing 67,000 residents along the proposed line. Bus alternative A bus service running in the former streetcar's dedicated right of way has been considered as an alternate service. The challenge for such a service to the eastern waterfront is the connection at Union Station for transferring passengers. There is limited sidewalk space for both pedestrians and transit stops along Bay Street. Buses would have to compete with other traffic through the Bay Street underpass and the mixed traffic south to Queens Quay. History On April 5, 2006, the first Public Forum for the Environmental Assessment for the Eastern Waterfront transit proposals was held. In February 2012, Emily Jackson of the Toronto Star reported that budget over-runs on the Queens Quay West line had not left enough funds to start the Queens Quay East line. On August 29, 2014, The Globe and Mail reported that senior City of Toronto officials had gone over the head of City Council, and made an appeal for funding for the line right to more senior levels of government. TTC General Manager Andy Byford and City Manager Joe Pennachetti had made their proposal to their opposite numbers in the Provincial bureaucracy. According to The Globe and Mail, they had not yet approached provincial and federal politicians. In September 2015, the TTC Budget Committee passed the following motion regarding the Capital Budget: :Request TTC staff, working with the City of Toronto manager, and Waterfront Toronto, to prioritize the East Bayfront LRT project, and to report back to the TTC's Budget Committee on how to expedite the work, starting with the planning and engineering work. In May 2016, condominium developers expressed concern about a lack of activity on the East Bayfront LRT project. Sam Crignano, president of Cityzen, a developer with three projects along the eastern waterfront, said that having two or three bus lines in the area won't be enough to handle the future influx of new residents and employees. Niall Haggart, executive vice-president of the Daniels Corp., urged action on the LRT project. Daniels has started a $700-million mixed-use development which will add about 7,300 people to the area by day and 2,500 at night. The Toronto Star reported that the project had been stalled because of a lack of funding and piecemeal transportation planning. A report about the Waterfront Transit Reset project dated November 13, 2017, stated that: \\"The City, Waterfront Toronto, and the TTC would carry out the approved plans for a new streetcar line along Queens Quay East [to Parliament Street] in the East Bayfront area.\\" Since the provincial election of June 2018, when there was a change in government, the province has made no promise to fund the Easy Bayfront LRT. In January 2019, the provincial Ministry of Transportation said it had not received a formal request for funding from the City; thus, the province remains uncommitted. In June 2019, Sidewalk Labs offered $100 million in \\"credit support\\" to build a portion of the East Bayfront LRT between Cherry Street and Broadview Avenue, which would pass through its proposed development in Toronto's Portland area. The estimated cost of that portion of the line was $406 million and would be in addition to the $700 million estimated cost to build the line from Union Station to Small Street. On June 17, 2020, the TTC Board approved spending $15,000,000 over three years on design work for the expansion of streetcar platforms at and stations as well for a new tunnel and portal for the East Bayfront line. The TTC is also considering connecting the line to Distillery Loop. Future expansion At the eastern end of the East Bayfront line, just east of Parliament Street, there would be a temporary streetcar loop. In 2012, the intent was to replace this loop with an easterly extension along Commissioners Street into the Port Lands area and north along Cherry Street into the Lower Don Lands. Thus, there would eventually be a connection between the East Bayfront line and the Cherry Street streetcar line. To reach Commissioners Street, a new Cherry Street would be built roughly in line with the existing Cherry Street north of Lake Shore Boulevard to allow streetcars to cross the Keating Channel on a new bridge and run south via New Cherry Street to the Ship Channel. In a November 13, 2017, report about the Waterfront Transit Reset project, the City, Waterfront Toronto, and the TTC reported they would continue planning for new streetcar lines in the Portlands area, east of Parliament Street and south of Lake Shore Boulevard. However, east of Leslie Street, projected demand (150 people per hour in 2041) is too low to justify streetcar service. The report made no mention of connecting the East Bayfront line to the Cherry Street streetcar line.

Fossils have been found from the Elgin sandstone of Cutties Hillock Quarry in Elgin, Moray. These are among the many reptile fossils referred to as the Elgin Reptiles. Gordonia was named in 1893 with four species: G. traquairi, G. duffiana, G. huxleyana, and G. juddiana. Currently, the only recognized species is the type G. traquairi. All other species are considered synonyms of the type. Description Illustration of the skull of Gordonia traquairi, 1893 Gordonia is known from several skulls and partial skeletons. It is small-bodied in comparison to other dicynodonts. It is distinguished by the rod-like shape of a ridge on its lower jaw called the lateral dentary shelf. Gordonia has a short snout with tusks that are angled slightly forward. The intertemporal region at the top of the skull is long and narrow and forms a raised sagittal crest. A long intertemporal region is usually associated with larger dicynodonts, making the skull proportions of Gordonia unusual. History Fossils of Gordonia were first found by Scottish naturalist Ramsay Heatley Traquair in 1885, who immediately identified them as belonging to a dicynodont. They included several partial skeletons and complete skulls. All of these remains were preserved as impressions in sandstone, and no fossilized bones were found. On the basis of these impressions, E. T. Newton named Gordonia in 1893. Gordonia was named alongside a similar dicynodont, Geikia, and the small parareptile Elginia. Newton named four species of Gordonia, including G. traquairi (named after Traquair), G. duffiana, G. huxleyana (named after Thomas Henry Huxley), and G. juddiana. In 1922, Russian paleontologist Vladimir Prokhorovich Amalitskii named two more species of Gordonia, G. annae and G. rossica. In 1926, G. annae and G. rossica were distinguished from the other species of Gordonia and transferred to the genus Dicynodon. Both species are now considered synonyms of Vivaxosaurus trautscholdi. In 1988, British paleontologist Gillian King synonymized all species of Gordonia with Dicynodon, creating the single species Dicynodon traquairi. This classification was widely accepted in the following years. In 2011, a phylogenetic analysis of Dicynodon species found D. traquairi to be only distantly related to other species. The name Gordonia was reinstated, although only one species, G. traquairi, was recognized. Classification Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of Gordonia from Kammerer et al.

She performed one of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poems to music on the television series An Experiment in Television. She also performed in episodes of Family Affair, The Man and the City, Mannix and The Streets of San Francisco. In 1967, she was the first deaf actor to have a photograph featured in Time magazine. In 1978, she was the center of a controversy towards deaf actors and actresses. Norton auditioned to appear in an ABC Afterschool Special titled Mom and Dad Can't Hear Me, but was told by the casting director that she could not have the part because he would rather have people who can speak. Norton complained to the Screen Actors Guild, which arose protests by deaf people in the United States. After this incident, Norton never performed on television again. She was the lead actress for the Kodak TV commercial \\"Memories\\", which was directed by Stuart Hagmann. It won a Clio Award for Best Commercial of the Year (1974).

At age 20, she became an overnight sensation on Broadway and was known thereafter as the \\"Yama Yama Girl\\"; it became her lifelong theme song.Eve Golden. Vernon and Irene Castle's ragtime revolution, University Press of Kentucky, Nov 30, 2007, p. 28 The show ran for 288 performances. The lyrics contain topical references of the era such as street cars and ladies' fashion while the refrain is about a comical bogeyman‚Äîthe Yama Yama Man‚Äîwho is \\"ready to spring out at you unaware\\". Bessie McCoy's song and dance routine was a standard into the 1930s with a prestigious lineage of imitators including Ada Jones, Marilyn Miller, Irene Castle and Ginger Rogers. History Bessie McCoy's signature performance was key in establishing the song's popularity. According to Marjorie Farnsworth, \\"thousands came to see Bessie sing and dance as the Yama Yama Girl and then came to see her again.... her knack of dancing the songs became so effective that she often did them in pantomime with the audience filling in the words.\\" According to Joe Laurie Jr she was one of the most imitated routines in Vaudeville. Nell Brinkley, who saw McCoy perform, described her thus: Bessie McCoy in her Yama Yama Man costume. The July 25, 1908, edition of Billboard magazine reported the following story how the Yama song originated. When The Three Twins was rehearsing in Chicago, prior to first opening, Karl Hoschna, the composer, was asked to furnish a \\"pajama man song\\". He wrote one called The Pajama Man only to learn that it could not be used owing to another pajama number booked at the Whitney Opera House the next day. Gus Sohlke, the stage director, happened to pass a toy store and saw in the window a doll built out of triangles. Realizing that this had never been used in stage work he decided to have a triangular man chorus in place of The Pajama Man. That afternoon as he, Collin Davis and Hoschna sat together wondering what they would call the song, Sohlke kept repeating Pajama jama yama yama. Suddenly he brightened up and cried \\"Did either of you fellows ever hear of a Yama Yama Man?\\" Of course neither one had and Sohlke confirmed \\"Neither have I! Lets call the new song Yama Yama Man\\". Quickly Davis set to work to write a lyric around the title and that night Sohlke and Hoschna locked themselves in a room with Bessie McCoy and rehearsed the Yama song and dance for five hours.Billboard, July 25, 1908, p. 8 Influences Ada Jones recorded \\"Yama Yama Man\\" in 1909 for Victor Light Opera Company.Ada Jones & Victor Light Opera Company - The Yama Yama Man 1909, Internet Archive The lyrics for verse two and three were changed, verse two being more bawdy.Ada Jones extra lyrics: :Verse two: ::The Johnnies they go to see the play, ::But they don't care for the plot. ::They want to see if all the girls, ::Are wearing much or not. :Verse three: ::A man sold some powder good for bugs, ::But the man he must have lied. ::It wasn't good for bugs at all, ::The poor little bugs all died.

In 1918, the cartoonist Max Fleischer created Koko the Clown, who appears to owe much to the Yama Yama Girl costume.

Both wore white foot coverings, white gloves with long fingers, and a hat with the same white pom-pom as in front. A 1922 sheet music drawing makes the connection explicit, saying \\"Out of the Inkwell, the New Yama Yama Clown\\", showing a picture of Koko. Lyrics 1.

A strong public sentiment favors these new and up-to-date cars, since they not only gather in the nickels, but they do away with crowding, shoving, jamming, and the abominable nuisance of the conductor, who used to throw people down and step over them in his eagerness to gather the coin that he paid over, or did not pay over, to the car companies.The New York Times: Louis M. Fisher. New York, April 26, 1909. In 1909, the Pay-As-You-Enter Car Corp issued stock making it quite topical around the time of the song.

The ATC Medical Assisting Program is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (www.caahep.org) upon the recommendation of the Medical Assisting Education Review Board (MAERB). History Albany Tech traces its roots back to the establishment of the Monroe Area Vocational-Technical School, which first opened its doors in 1961 with a class of 175 students. In 1972, Monroe Area Vocational-Technical School was merged with Albany Area Vocational-Technical School, keeping the Albany name. The school's campus was moved to its current location during the merger. In 1988, the school was renamed Albany Technical Institute and placed under the direction of the newly formed TCSG (then-named the Department of Technical and Adult Education). Albany Tech was charged at this time with providing technical education opportunities to the residents, businesses and industries within the seven-county service delivery area it currently serves. Following the passage of Georgia House Bill 1187 governing the names of units in the TCSG, Albany Technical Institute was officially renamed Albany Technical College on July 6, 2000.

The Motorola trunked radio system is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate on radio frequency spectrum in the 800 megahertz (MHz) public safety band. Background The Calhoun-Talladega 800 MHz communications system was originally developed and installed to enhance interoperability and to provide alert and notification for the community during the destruction of chemical weapons at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD). The communications system was funded and maintained through a federal grant known as the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint United States Army and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program designed to provide community education and emergency preparedness resources in the event of a chemical agent emergency. The original communications system, a Legacy system with analog trunking, went on- the-air in 1998 and quickly became the primary means of two-way communications for most public safety agencies in Calhoun and Talladega Counties, replacing their standalone conventional radio repeaters. In 2006, the CSEPP communications system was upgraded to a digital Project 25 Motorola Type II SmartZone version 7.4 linear simulcast/multicast trunked 800 MHz communications system. The facilities at ANAD, known as Anniston Chemical Activity (ANCA), stored approximately seven percent of the nation's chemical weapon's stockpile including VX (nerve agent) and Sarin (GB) agent. ANAD was one of nine United States Army installations in the United States that stored chemical weapons. The United States Army began incinerating the stored weapons on August 9, 2003. The destruction of ANAD's chemical weapons stockpile was controversial, in part, because of the potential danger to the surrounding community should an incident occur during weapons disposal operations. In September 2011, the US Army's Chemical Materials Agency (CMA) successfully completed the safe elimination of ANAD‚Äôs chemical weapons stockpile. Funding Transition As a result of the completion of chemical warfare disposal operations at ANAD, all federal funding for the communities surrounding the Anniston Army Depot will end on March 31, 2012. This includes funding for operations and maintenance of the CSEPP communications system. Over the years, the community has become increasingly dependent upon the capabilities of the communications system, in particular, because of reliability, interoperability, capacity and in-building coverage. It provides 24-7-365 voice and data communications services for nearly 3,000 users including law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency medical services, school facilities and buses, hospitals, transportation, utilities and many other agencies. It also provides activation signaling for almost 200 outdoor warning sirens located throughout both counties. By the time chemical weapons disposal was completed, the system was serving nearly 100 percent of the mission-critical communications needs in Calhoun and Talladega County. In preparation for the end of CSEPP grant funding, local officials explored alternative strategies to generate funds that would allow continued service and operation of the existing communications system. With the support and cooperation of local and state elected officials, FEMA, consulting firms and the users of the system, an exploratory committee crafted legislation that would allow the users to take ownership of the system. New Beginning On June 15, 2011, Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley signed House Bill 389 into law as Act 2011-675 to create the radio/alert notification communications district. The purpose of this legislation was to create a mechanism for the community to transition the CSEPP communications system from the federal grant funding to locally generated funding, operations and ownership. As provided by the new Alabama law codified in Sections 11-31-1 to 11-31-4, Code of Alabama 1975 (as amended), the Calhoun and Talladega County Commissions made their respective appointments to the communications district's board of directors (term of appointment listed in parenthesis): :CALHOUN COUNTY :Mr. Mike Fincher, Director of Safety, Calhoun County Board of Education (4) :Police Chief Bill Partridge, Oxford, Alabama (3) :Ms. Melonie Carmichael, Emergency Management Specialist, Jacksonville State University (3) :Fire Chief Mike Howard, Alexandria, Alabama (2) :TALLADEGA COUNTY :Police Chief Travis McGrady, Lincoln, Alabama (4) :Police Chief Alan Watson, Talladega, Alabama (3) :Mr. Andy McWilliams, Facility Operations Manager, Talladega Superspeedway (3) :Fire Chief Danny Warwick, Talladega, Alabama (2) The duly appointed board of directors convened for the first time on September 1, 2011, the first day of their appointment terms. With all members present, a motion passed unanimously to officially name the communications district as the Alabama Regional Communications System. The ARCS board of directors meetings are open to the public, with regularly scheduled monthly meetings held on the second Tuesday of every month at the Oxford, Alabama Police Department and Municipal Court, 600 Stanley Merrill Drive, Oxford, Alabama 36203. On April 1, 2012, the ARCS will become fully responsible for administration and operation of the 800 MHz system, with assets estimated at a value of approximately 100 million dollars. At that time, the cost of operating the system will be 100 percent funded by revenue collected from user fees. Based on the current predicted costs to operate and maintain the system, the ARCS board of directors has determined the monthly user fee as $22.50 per two-way radio device (mobile, portable, modem, siren control) and $50.00 per dispatch console (rate applies to local users in Calhoun and Talladega County). The formula for determining the user fee is based on the total estimated annual costs to operate the communications system compared to the projected total number of users subscribing to the system. The current user fees were established based on approximately 2,800 users with a projected annual cost of approximately $760,000 to operate and maintain the system.

In a career that lasted from August 1860 to September 1861 he ran eight times and won four races. As a three-year-old in 1861, he won The Derby and the Doncaster Cup and finished second in the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger. At the end of the season he was retired to stud where he had limited success, and was later exported to Austria-Hungary. Background Kettledrum was a big, powerful chestnut horse bred at Croft-on-Tees by James Cookson. As a yearling he was put up for sale at Doncaster and was bought for 400 guineas by the trainer George Oates on behalf of his patron, Charles Towneley of Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire. Kettledrum‚Äôs sire, Rataplan, was a top-class racehorse who won forty-two races including the Doncaster Cup and the Cambridgeshire Handicap. He was a successful stallion but was even more successful as a sire of broodmares, being the damsire of the Derby winners Cremorne and Kisber. Kettledrum‚Äôs dam, Hybla, was an excellent broodmare who had already produced the 1854 Epsom Oaks winner Mincemeat. Racing career 1860: two-year-old season Kettledrum made his debut in a race at York in August which he won despite not being fully fit. He was unsuccessful when running again at the same meeting. In September he ran behind Walloon in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. He had done enough, however, to establish himself as a contender for the following year's Classics, being offered by bookmakers at odds of 8/1 for the 2000 Guineas and 20/1 for the Derby. 1861: three-year-old season Kettledrum took time to reach full fitness in the spring of 1861 and suffered from dental problems which affected his training. On his seasonal debut he ran in the South of England for the first time in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. He started 4/1 second favourite and finished second of the sixteen runners behind Diophantus. Kettledrum was beaten three lengths but appeared slightly unlucky in running as his rider, James Snowden had been unable to find space for a clear run at a crucial stage. The St Hubert's Church building at Dunsop Bridge was financed by Charles Towneley from Kettledrum's Derby winnings. Oates continued to supervise Kettledrum‚Äôs training, but moved the colt to a base in Lambourn to complete his preparation for the Derby. At Epsom on Wednesday, 29 May 1861 he started at odds of 12/1 in a field of eighteen runners, with Dundee starting the 3/1 favourite. There was much criticism of the state of the Epsom course, which had been badly neglected and was strewn with rubbish. The race was marred by a faulty start which saw several runners left at the start. Ridden by Ralph Bullock, Kettledrum was always prominent and moved up to take the lead from Diophantus in the straight. He was strongly challenged by Dundee on the wide outside and the two colts raced almost level into the final furlong. At this point the favourite faltered, having sustained an injury to his foreleg and Kettledrum was able to win comfortably by a length. Towneley reportedly used his winnings to pay for the building of a new Catholic Church at Dunsop Bridge, Lancashire. Kettledrum did not race again until September 18 when he started 11/8 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster. He did not help his own chances by misbehaving before the race and causing several false starts. In the race he ran in second place in the early stages before going to the front before half way and leading the field into the straight. Most of the opposition dropped away, but the filly Caller Ou, an unconsidered 66/1 outsider, emerged as a challenger. The two horses drew away from the field and raced together throughout the closing stages before the filly gained the advantage and won by a head. Two days later Kettledrum reappeared in the Doncaster Cup over two and a half miles. He took the lead in the straight and after an \\"exciting set-to\\" he ran a dead heat with The Oaks winner Brown Duchess, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. Brown Duchess's connections declined to take part in a deciding run-off, enabling Kettledrum to walk over for the prize money. He was allowed to walk over again in the Select Stakes at Newmarket in October and was then retired to stud. Stud career Kettledrum Inn in Mereclough named after the Derby winner Kettledrum was not a great success as a stallion. His most significant offspring was Lady Langden, who produced the Champion sire Hampton. He is therefore an ancestor of the American champion Man o' War. Kettledrum was put up for sale along with the rest of Towneley's horses in 1870. In 1872 he was sold again, this time for 4000 guineas to Count Forgach and exported in to stand in Hungary where his last known foals were conceived in 1881. Kettledrum died in 1885 at the Count's stud at Nagy Szalancz. Honours In the year of Kettledrum's Derby win a public house at Mereclough, in the parish of Cliviger near Burnley, was renamed The Kettledrum Inn in his honour. There is some speculation that the winnings from Kettledrum's Derby win paid for the pub, but there is evidence of an inn and alehouse having been on the site since the 1820s. It may be the case that the winnings paid for a refit or extension, but nothing more. The pub survives to the present day and is widely recognised as one of the best country pubs in the area (September 2014). Shortly after the pub was refurbished in early 2014, a couple visiting the UK from Australia donated an unusual memento to the owners in the shape of a silver-mounted ink-well fashioned from a horse's hoof. They claimed that the hoof was actually taken from Kettledrum after his death, and the underside of this somewhat grisly item does indeed have \\"Kettledrum 1861\\" scratched into it. However, there is absolutely no provenance for this item and many feel that the hoof and the attached shoe are too small to be that of a racehorse. Writing under the pseudonym \\"Kettledrum\\" named after the Derby winner, Edward Hulton was the original tipster of the Sporting Chronicle newspaper he founded in 1871. A tipping column was written by others under the same pseudonym until the newspaper closed in 1983.

(pp. 311‚Äì12). It was the first of numerous pulp magazines devoted to Western fiction. In its heyday, Western Story Magazine was one of the most successful pulp magazines; in 1921 the magazine was selling over half a million copies each issue.Ed Hulse, The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps. Murania Press, 2009. (pp. 137‚Äì141) The headquarters was in New York City. History Western Story Magazine began when Street & Smith executive Henry Ralston decided to convert one of the company's nickel weeklies, New Buffalo Bill Weekly, into a pulp.Jon Tuska, The Western Story: A Chronological Treasury, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, (p. xxiii). Ralston installed Frank Blackwell as editor of the new magazine. The magazine attracted a number of famous Western authors, including Charles Alden Seltzer, H. Bedford-Jones, Stewart Edward White, W. Ryerson Johnson and William MacLeod Raine. The November 25, 1920 issue was the first issue to carry the work of Max Brand (writing under the pseudonym George Owen Baxter). Brand's work would dominate the magazine in the next decade; he would write dozens of stories for Western Story Magazine both under his own name and several pseudonyms.William F. Nolan, Max Brand, western giant: the life and times of Frederick Schiller Faust, Popular Press, 1985 (p. 67) Western Story Magazine was also prominent in publishing material by women writers, including B. M. Bower and Cherry Wilson. In the 1930s, the publication's roster of authors expanded to include Walt Coburn, William Colt MacDonald and W. C. Tuttle, while noted pulp illustrator Walter M. Baumhofer contributed several covers.Nick Carr, The Western Pulp Hero, Starmont House, 1989, (pp. 119‚Äì120). In the late 1930s, Blackwell was succeeded as editor by John Burr, who edited the magazine until it ceased publication in 1949.

Published in October 1891, it was the last of Mart√≠'s works to be printed before his death in 1895. Originally written in Spanish, it has been translated into over ten languages. Among the poems of the collection are Yo soy un hombre sincero (I), Si ves un monte de espumas (V), and Cultivo una rosa blanca (XXXIX). Verses pruned from various poems were adapted into the folk song Guantanamera, which is the most popular patriotic song of Cuba and was popularized in the US in the 1960s during the American folk music revival. Overview The bulk of the book was written in 1890 while Mart√≠ was convalescing in a small town called Haines Falls in the Catskill Mountains. The manuscript was first read in public in December of that year, at the home of Carmen Miyares in New York City; it was published ten months later, by Louis Weiss & Co. of New York. The book comprises 46 poems, written in four-line stanzas (quatrains) of octosyllabic verse. The diction is clean, sparse, and the verses display regular rhyme schemes and alliteration. The work is rich in the symbolism of color; its verses known for their spontaneity and transparency. Their style has been compared to that of Zen watercolor paintings.

B. H. Wadia, was a prominent Bollywood movie director, screenwriter, producer and founder of Wadia Movietone Studio. He was born in prominent Parsi family which hailed from Surat, Gujarat whose ancestral business was ship building. Their family name of Wadia stands for master shipbuilders. In a family of entrepreneurs Wadia is credited with creation of movies involving populist stunt roles including those by Fearless Nadia and bringing concept of stunt actresses in Indian cinema. Film career Wadia began his film making career with silent movies. Being an intellectual and avid writer he wrote scripts for his movies while his younger brother Homi Wadia who joined him in the business a few years later was usually tasked with directing them. He produced his first movie Vasant Leela in 1928, along with 11 other silent movies at the Kohinoor Studios in Dadar as well as under Deware Laboratories. These movies were modest successes and were mostly remakes of populist Hollywood classics. In the year 1933 he founded Wadia Movietone company and made his first Talkie movie Lal-E-Yaman, inspired by the Orientalist fantasy world espoused by the Arabian Nights and related themes. This movie's success helped establish Wadia Movietone as a studio to contend with, in partnership with his brother Homi, their distributor Manchesa B Billimoria and the Tata brothers Burjore and Nadirshaw. Under the Wadia Movietone Studio banner Wadia introduced a variety of new concepts to Indian cinema starting with a stunt actress playing a leading role to a documentary newsreel,The Indian Gazette, to a feature-length documentary, Haripura Congress. As part of capturing cinematic recordings of early classical and semi-classical musicians and singers he made a series titled Wadia Movietone's Variety Programme, featuring legendary artistes such as Feroz Dastur, Bal Gandharva, Malika Pukhraj and Pandit Tirthankar. Wadia Movietone was also the first to create an Indian film without songs, Nav Jawan, the first Indian movie to be filmed in English (along with parallel Hindi and Bengali versions), The Court Dancer, the first Sindhi-language movie post-Partition, Ekta, and the very first Indian television series, Hotel Taj Mahal. Movies from Wadia Movietone Studio Poster of Hunterwali (1935) featuring Fearless Nadia was Wadia's big hit. Some of the notable movies made by Movietone studio were Swadesh, Black Rose, Fauladi Mukka, Return of Toofan Mail, Jai Bharat, Kahan Hai Manzil Teri and movies starring Fearless Nadia namely Hunterwali - Miss Frontier Mail, Hurricane Hansa, Lootaru Lalna, Diamond Queen, Bambaiwali and Jungle Princess. In the late 1930s, Wadia got involved in the Indian freedom struggle, initially inspired by the Indian Congress Party and then by M.N. Roy, the former Communist who turned away from Communism after a falling- out with Stalin and started his own party, Radical Humanism. The friendship with M.N. Roy added to his zeal for social and cultural change‚Äîincluding the emancipation of women, the casting aside of superstition and harmful practices such as the caste system, and the need to educate each and every person if India was truly to be free and sustainable as an independent nation. His films, including the few stunt films he would make before abandoning that genre altogether, included these themes - such as Raj Nartaki, Vishwas, Balam, Madhosh, Mela, Ankh ki Sharam, Manthan and Amar Raj. The Fearless Nadia starrer Diamond Queen captures all these themes perfectly - blending bold calls for revolution and the eradication of corruption with breathtaking stunts performed by the amazing Mary Ann Evans (aka Fearless Nadia) and John Cavas. Indeed, it was Wadia's ability to entertain while educating and empowering that is perhaps his strongest and greatest contribution to Indian cinema at a particularly pivotal and crucial time in Indian history. Family and personal life Wadia was born to a prominent Parsi family of shipbuilders whose vessels had served the East Indian Company, including the opium trade with China. His own branch of the family had, however, fallen on hard times in the late 19th and early 20th century, and finances were tight. Wadia himself was well educated with and L.L.B. and M.A. degrees, as well as proficiency in Persian, Gujarati and Urdu (languages he wrote poetry in as well). Although he tried to carve out a career in finance and law, his true passion was the cinema, which he encountered via the initial offerings of the Lumiere Brothers and other films that made their way to British India. When JBH turned to film- making, his family were initially not at all supportive - and were even more dismayed when his younger brother Homi decided to join him. However, with the success of their movies, the rest of the family eventually came around. It was a very conservative family, with JBH Wadia perhaps the only genuine rebel among them. His discovery of Mary Ann Evans who he immortalized as Fearless Nadia, the stunt queen par excellence, led to Homi falling in love with Mary ‚Äì much against the rest of the family's wishes. Indeed, although JBH Wadia encouraged them to defy the family, including their orthodox mother Dhunmai, Homi couldn't bring himself to marry Mary until his mother died. By the time they got married in 1961, they were too old to have their own children, although Homi and Mary eventually formally adopted Bobby Jones, who was either Mary's much younger brother (the story that was always pushed forward) or perhaps her real son from a prior relationship. Wadia was married to Hilla Patel, to whom he was distantly related. They had two children, a son named Vinci and a daughter named Haidee. Vinci married Nargis Khambata, who eventually became the first woman in Asia to start her own advertising agency, Interpublicity, or Interpub. Haidee married a German, Gerhard Meier, and moved to Boblingen, Germany. Vinci and Nargis had two children: Roy (named after M.N. Roy), who became a journalist at CNN) and eventually joined the United Nations, and Riyad, who resurrected the Wadia Movietone banner and the Fearless Nadia legend during his brief life with an award-winning documentary on Nadia, titled \\"Fearless: The Hunterwali Story.\\" Riyad also produced India's first gay-themed film, a short titled BOMgAY. Riyad died in 2003 at the age of 36. JBH Wadia died in 1986 due to cancer, triggered by a fall endured when crossing the road near his home and being struck by a car.
